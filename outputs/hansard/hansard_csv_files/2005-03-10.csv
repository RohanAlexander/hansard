(Notice given 10 March 2005.) Thursday, 10 March 2005 ----Rotary International Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (9.40 a.m.)-TodayI would like to draw the attention of the House to the recently passed 100th anniversary of the first Rotary club meeting. The first Rotary club was formed on 23 February 1905 by Paul Harris in Chicago, America. Paul was a lawyer who wanted to recapture the sense of community that he felt in small towns during his youth. The name Rotary came from the club’s initial practice of rotating the meeting venues between members’ offices. Rotary was originally formed as a network that could be used to further the professional and social interests of its members, but as the organisation grew so did its mission. Members began using their talents and resources to benefit communities in need. Seventeen years after the first meeting, Rotary clubs existed on six continents and the organisation adopted the name Rotary International. Since then the organisation has continued to grow and on 23 February this year more than 1.2 million members of 31,000 regional Rotary clubs in 166 countries celebrated the organisation’s 100th birthday. Rotary was introduced to Australia in 1921 by two Canadians-James Davidson from Calgary and Lieutenant-Colonel Layton Ralston from Halifax. They originally arrived in Sydney but found the city to be closed; businesses had shut down for Easter and the royal show-or so the story goes. They headed down to Melbourne where the first Australian Rotary club was formed. It has been my honour and great pleasure to be associated with the Rotary movement here in Canberra and I would like to take this opportunity to pay homage to their good works. In the weeks following the Boxing Day tsunami, Canberra Rotarians raised funds that were donated to the Red Cross, World Vision and Care Australia. I understand that the Canberra Rotary Club contributed to the funds needed by Canberra resident Andrew Elston to attend the Ride to Cure Diabetes event in the Barossa Valley in January this year. I recently had the pleasure of attending a meeting of the Canberra South Rotary Club, which was celebrating the organisation’s 100th anniversary in its own local way. It was there that I met Stephanie Medhurst and Tove Gullikson, two exchange students from America and Sweden studying here through the Rotary exchange program. The Rotary international exchange program is renowned and is a program that all members here would be familiar with. These are just some of the causes that the local chapter supports. I would speak at greater length on this if time allowed me as it is very worthwhile noting the work of Rotary. Canberra Rotary clubs base their activities around the same principle motto-service above selfthat was adopted in the early days of the organisation. Based on that key principle, the good works of Canberra Rotarians look set to continue well into the future and I commend all of them on the occasion of their centenary-something I am sure all members join with me in doing. Gladstone Port fic lights for a new major piece of road infrastructure at the port city of Gladstone.

161,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (9.43 A.m.),"RecentlyI had the pleasure of switching on the trafport central precinct, and will remove about 500 vehicles per day from the CBD. Many of these vehicles are heavy industrial trucks-B-doubles and the like-which cart petroleum and other hazardous products. Most members would know that the port of Gladstone is Queensland’s largest multicommodity port. It generates 34 per cent of the state’s exports by volume, and that will increase further in line with greater throughput at the port. Removing port related vehicles from the CBD area will not only help Gladstone’s industrial expansion and the associated increase in port traffic but also improve public safety and free up the delightful tourism precinct of Flinders Parade. Along with that, many Gladstone families depend on heavy industry for their employment, so the road will help pave the way, indirectly, for more local jobs. The Australian government contributed $7½ million to the project under the Roads of National Importance program-an exemplary form of funding-and this was matched by the Gladstone Port Authority’s $4½ million, the Calliope Shire Council’s $1½ million and the Queensland department of state development’s $1½ million. This was one of the most significant road projects in Gladstone for many years. It involved relocating a railway line to pass under the southern span of an existing bridge, the construction of a road underneath the main street, Goondoon Street, and a new bridge and the creation of an intersection with an existing road. The road would not have been possible without the Roads of National Importance funding, and it is a prime example of what strategic funding can achieve for many towns. I have been working on the port access road since the mid1990s, hand in hand with the Calliope and Gladstone councils, the Central Queensland Port Authority and Gladstone Area Promotion and Development Ltd. It is gratifying to know that, with the opening coming up in a few weeks time, we are on the cusp of the full completion of this important project. This also comes as part of a wider vision for Gladstone, with its rapid expansion with the opening of Comalco and the possibility of Aldoga opening there. There is a great need for arterial roads and I have been very active in seeing that these are put in place. We have had the Deputy Prime Minister there and we are having another road, known as the Callemondah overpass, completed. I think the people of Gladstone have a bright future, in an industrial sense, facilitated by expansion. (Time expired) Veterans: Entitlements contribution and committed acts of great self-sacrifice in the defence of our nation. In the lead-up to ANZAC Day, there is no-one who would not agree that these men and women deserve our admiration and respect. I, like many local families, will be heading out at dawn on 25 April to pay tribute to those who died in the service of our nation, those who survived, soldiers from the past and those who defend us in the present. Today, I would like to raise an issue on behalf of one of my constituents, David Marrinon of Brunswick Heads. Mr Marrinon is part of a group who are fighting for the recognition of those who trained cadets post World War II by a medal for the officers and instructors of cadets. Cadets have made a valuable contribution to our defence forces. I am told that about 50 per cent of all military personnel have a background in cadets. Cadets are trained by dedicated officers who give up their time in the service of our nation. The recently released defence white paper praises the cadet system and its contribution to the defence of Australia. Surely those who instruct cadets deserve proper recognition for their efforts. It is hoped that the government will bestow a medal of recognition, available after two years of service, for their conMAIN COMMITTEE",130,Statements By Members
162,Mrs Elliot (Richmond) (9.46 A.m.),"Our nation’s veterans have made an enormoustribution to the Australian defence system. When discussing the future of the cadet system and the contribution it makes, it is so important that we do not discount that contribution made by the officers and instructors of cadets. I know that Mr Marrinon has been in constant correspondence with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs regarding this specific issue. I will be very interested to hear her response to the request of this group. This is an important issue for a number of my constituents, and I hope that the government will take their request very seriously. Again we find the government paying lip service to those involved in the defence of our nation, those training future soldiers, but there is little action, just as there has been on the indexation of TPI payments to our veterans. The minister and the Prime Minister are always happy to have their photo taken with veterans, but when real action is required we often find them lacking. I will continue to hold the government accountable for the proper recognition of those who have selflessly served our country. Law Enforcement lice officers in Sydney and also on Palm Island last year, I want to see our community supporting the police and giving them the backing that they really need to do their job. I challenge the notion that seems to be put about these days that police are guilty when someone else breaks the law. Violence towards officers has escalated in the last 12 months, with riots in Sydney’s west and on Palm Island following the unfortunate deaths of people who came to the notice of the police. Some will say it is insensitive to say this but it has got to be said: those who lost their lives would be alive today if they had kept themselves out of trouble. It is not the fault of the police; people have to take responsibility for their own lives. The notion that the police are wrong and the suspect is right has to be rejected, and the community has to stand up and support the members of our police force when they are doing their job. The aggression and anger in our community is heading towards being out of control. The community has to back the police in maintaining law and order or things will spiral out of control. The very fabric of our society depends on having a police force able to do their duty when people break the law. A person whose blood alcohol content is six times the legal limit should be arrested. People who have stolen vehicles should be pursued. The unfortunate deaths of those involved do not give people an excuse to commit further acts of violence. Those people would not have been involved in the respective incidents if they had not broken the law in the first place. I am fed up with the blame being directed at the police force. Unlawful actions have consequences, but the consequence for a police officer intervening and doing his job should not be a full-scale riot, as occurred on Palm Island and as occurred in the western suburbs of Sydney. Just as ordinary people should not live in fear of violent criminal behaviour, police officers should not have to fear that their actions will spark riots. I condemn the riots that occurred on Palm Island following the unfortunate death of Mr Doomadgee. I condemn the riots that occurred in the western suburbs of Sydney. I ask that the community back the police officers who were just doing their duty.

In Western Australia we are to receive two of these magnificent innovations on behalf of the government. I, along with the member for Hasluck, will be fighting for one of these technical colleges to be located within our region. To put it into perspective, every one of the 15 federal electorates in Western Australia wants one of these technical colleges placed within their electorate, because they are very popular ways of providing training and further skilling the work force. That is why all members, of every political persuasion, look forward to having a technical college located in their electorate. MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Statements By Members
164,Mr Randall (Canning) (9.54 A.m.),"One of the most significant and popular commitThe electorate that I serve, Canning, is very short on tertiary education and training skills. This puts into perspective much of the criticism by the Australia Labor Party about education. Both at state and federal levels, the area that I represent has been very poorly served in terms of training and education facilities, yet in a bipartisan way we are now working strongly to achieve a technical college for our locality. The Armadale City Council and the Armadale Redevelopment Authority have approached me in the most positive way to get behind this initiative for the Armadale region. The Gosnells City Council-whose area I share with the member for Hasluck, Stuart Henry-is also working cooperatively to endeavour to have one of these technical colleges located in this region. The fact is that the eastern and south-eastern corridors of Perth have been poorly served. There is the Swan TAFE in our region; it is a small TAFE and it does not cover the skills that we are talking about. The region is crying out for this sort of facility and we can provide an early walk-up start towards the infrastructure for a technical college. There are schools which are under capacity which could be converted into such a facility. I am putting on record today that I will be working hard, along with the member for Hasluck, to see the delivery of such a fine federal government initiative for the people of Canning and surrounding localities.

Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.57 a.m.)-It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Australian Institute of Marine Science Amendment Bill 2005. This bill seeks to expand the Council of the Institute of Marine Science, the governing body of the institute, from six to seven members. The additional part-time member will be nominated by James Cook University, a very fine university within our community. This amendment encourages the closest collaboration between the institute and James Cook University, a formal aspect of this affiliation being a joint venture known as AIMS@JCU. The bill also changes the title of the principal executive of the institute from ‘director’ to ‘chief executive officer’. The Institute of Marine Science is a fine institute. I have visited it and I think that anything that enhances the ability of the institute and the university to work together is a fine move. world in what it does. The Australian Institute of Marine Science is located just south of Townsville on the Cleveland peninsula, and it does a body of scientific work that is nothing short of outstanding. The Australian Institute of Marine Science Amendment Bill 2005 will allow the collaboration between JCU and AIMS to be further progressed, and it is a sensible thing to do. With AIMS now at JCU, it is important and sensible that a nominee from the university be on the Council of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The government has recognised that this is how the arrangements should be. But it is important for more reasons than that.

167,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.59 A.m.),"The Australian Institute of Marine Science leads theJCU’s mission to be, within 10 years, one of the top five universities in the world dealing with tropical science, it is important that AIMS and JCU be as close together as possible. The Tropical Science and Innovation Precinct which is being developed at JCU will have in it the new Commonwealth funded environment programs, which are the sons of the existing reef and rainforest CRCs. It will have in it CSIRO, which is moving to the JCU campus. It will have in it AIMS, BSCS, SRI and those sorts of things. It will have veterinary science, trop ag science and so on. The kind of precinct that is developing will have a centre of gravity and a weight that will not be exceeded anywhere else in the world. Also in Townsville is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s headquarters, again with another very significant body of science that will add to the research that is being done. I am very hopeful that an ARC Centres of Excellence grant will be received by JCU in the next round. That particular grant would be in the marine sciences area and AIMS would certainly be very much a part of that. It is a very exciting position at this stage. There were about 90 applications for these centres of excellence. They have been whittled down to 17. The JCU bid is still in that 17 and 10 are going to be chosen, as I understand it. So there is a very good chance that we will see a centre of excellence grant to JCU, and AIMS will be part of that. The people at AIMS do a fantastic job. As the local member, I see one very difficult problem, though, in supporting the work of the institute. Their vessels need to be replaced. You cannot say it any more plainly than that. They are not funded at the moment to be replaced. They are putting an enormous drain on the budget of AIMS because of their maintenance and running costs, and AIMS need more modern vessels. I say to the government today in supporting this bill: further support the Australian Institute of Marine Science by providing the money necessary to replace the vessels that they have that are now old, outdated and very costly to run. The council at AIMS, to which this legislation will allow the appointment of a new member, has had a very strong leadership and strategic role in looking out for Australia’s interests, not only around our coastline but indeed in the world. AIMS have recently participated in the rescue mission to the Maldives after the tsunami to help with the damage that was done to the coral reefs there-coral reefs which provide a lot of the food for the people of the Maldives. The AIMS people were helping to look at how the reef could be regenerated and reinvigorated to continue to provide that particular food source. I am very pleased to support the bill. It is certainly going in the right direction, and AIMS will go from strength to strength as a national institution looking after Australia’s interests and indeed the interests of the world. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (10.04 a.m.)-I thank the member for Shortland for stepping in for me. As she has indicated, Labor certainly will be supporting this very straightforward piece of legislation-the Australian Institute of Marine Science Amendment Bill 2005. I take this opportunity to express the opposition’s appreciation for the very fine research that is being done at the institute. I certainly look forward to visiting and talking with them about their excellent research when I am next in Townsville. Of course, the research they undertake in each of their three research priority areas is critical not just for that part of Queensland but for the world. It is world-class research-a standard that we can be extremely proud of. It is important to recognise that the institute do not MAIN COMMITTEE just engage locally, although they do this extremely well, but also they have managed to present their research on a global scale. It is a demonstration of the outstanding level of research that is happening in many of our universities-no one university has a monopoly on excellence. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.06 a.m. to 10.22 a.m. ence and Training) (10.22 a.m.)-Firstly, I would like to thank those who have spoken on the Australian Institute of Marine Science Amendment Bill 2005. The bill amends the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972 to expand the council of the Institute of Marine Science, the governing body of the institute, from six to seven members, with the additional part-time member being nominated by James Cook University, JCU. This amendment reflects the close collaboration between the institute and JCU, a former aspect of this affiliation being a joint venture known as AIMS@JCU. The bill seeks to change the title of the principal executive officer of the institute from ‘director’ to ‘chief executive officer’. The title update for the principal executive officer will bring the institute into line with the current terminology used by, for example, the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Australian Institute of Marine Science is a public sector research agency whose primary objective is to generate and transfer scientific knowledge. It will support the sustainable use and protection of the marine environment through innovative, world-class scientific and technological research. AIMS was established in 1972. The Australian Institute of Marine Science, its research and other scientific work have a tropical and northern Australian emphasis. The institute’s main site is at Cape Ferguson in Far North Queensland, which is in close proximity to James Cook University at Townsville. Townsville is one of the world’s acclaimed centres of research for tropical marine science, a reputation that has developed through the work and cooperation of AIMS and JCU as well as the Cooperative Research Centre for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The institute has sites in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is Australian government policy to encourage collaborations between the Commonwealth science agencies and the universities. Through such collaboration Australia generates critical mass for its research activities and commercialisation activities. The bill reflects the importance of the collaboration occurring between AIMS and JCU and boosts the capacity for the two organisations to strategically work together, enhancing the ability of the organisations to advance excellence in tropical marine science. AIMS develops strategies and alliances that allow the institute to create a critical mass. The AIMS 2003-06 research plan lists the three important cooperative initiatives. The first is the AIMS-JCU joint venture, which is a formal alliance between AIMS and JCU. The second is the Arafura Timor Research Facility, a major national research facility run jointly by AIMS and the Australian National University. The third is the AIMS-United States National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration strategic partnership, which examines coral reef ecology, water quality and climate change. The AIMS@JCU joint venture is an exciting collaborative arrangement that reflects Australian government policy. The joint venture has the objective of formally strengthening the ties between the Australian Institute of Marine Science and James MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Australian Institute Of Marine Science Amendment Bill 2005
168,Mr Farmer (Macarthur,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, SciCook University. The AIMS@JCU joint venture agreement was signed by both parties on 17 June 2004. Since then it has become a reality through the establishment of related infrastructure, the set-up of programs and the awarding of scholarships to AIMS@JCU PhD research students. These activities are being funded by the 2003-04 federal budget allocation provided to AIMS for a joint venture. Achievement of the AIMS at JCU already includes a state-of-the-art 47-kilometre fibre optic communication link between AIMS and JCU. With this new communication link, the two organisations are much closer. They can exchange greater amounts of information much faster than over an ordinary internet connection, allowing researchers based at AIMS to access JCU’s supercomputer and scientists to supervise students via videoconferencing. Work has commenced on the joint venture’s initial two programs, which are the aquaculture program and the coastal process and marine modelling program. Three PhD research students will commence work on AIMS@JCU projects by June this year. The students shall be jointly supervised by AIMS and JCU scientists. Similar research student scholarships will be awarded by AIMS@JCU for 2006 and 2007. As I indicated at the start of this summing up, the amendments in the first part of the bill will serve to promote the further development of the collaborative relationship between AIMS and JCU. Greater coordination between AIMS and JCU is encouraged through the addition of a JCU nominated member to the council for the Institute of Marine Science. Increasing the council’s membership from six to seven also brings added skills and knowledge to AIMS. The second part of the bill changes the title of the head of AIMS from ‘director’ to ‘chief executive officer’. The amendment to the act updates the title for the leader of the institute. The clarity provided by this revision will assist the holder of the position in the development of professional relationships and arrangements on behalf of AIMS. I commend the Australian Institute of Marine Science Amendment Bill 2005 to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 17 February, on motion by Mr Pearce: That the House take note of the document. Ms KING (Ballarat) (10.29 a.m.)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, for the opportunity to continue my remarks in relation to the tsunami. There are two people in particular in my electorate to whom I want to pay tribute. The first is Sally Harvey from Lyonville. A few weeks after the tragedy Sally sent round an email to her friends in Hepburn shire and I want to quote from part of that. She says: Hello one and all. By now i will have spoken to some of you, and you will be aware of the project i have embarked on ... ... thinking about the terrible and almost unbelievable circumstances and ramifications of this tragedy, i wondered what a single mother might do, other than making a $10 or so donation, which, however useful, is not really the sort of contribution that satisfied my ideal of possibilities available ... so i decided to have a performance night extravaganza, and make it a community event, to ensure that as many peoMAIN COMMITTEE ple as have the urge, have an opportunity to be involved in a concerted effort to raise a substantial sum to help those in a situation that is affecting young and old alike all over the world. i would like to organise, with help, an afternoon of fun and entertainment with as wide a variety of acts and activities as possible, including dance, circus, music, poetry, fashion parade, auctions, raffles, door prizes ... i am on the hunt for any interested individuals and groups to donate time, goods ... to the project ... i am only one pregnant person, and therefore there is only so much i can do, but as a community, the sky is the limit!!! I attended the fundraiser organised by Sally and a dedicated group of volunteers, including Frank Page, Sally herself, Elias Ebel, Peter O’Mara, Maureen Sartori Peterson, David Hall, Janette Dalgliesh, Miriam Beaumont, Jenny Beacham, Jon Stephens, Tony Kelly, Carol Hofmeyer and many more from the Hepburn shire. At the last count, they had raised just under $10,000 to donate to the Red Cross. It was a fantastic effort, and during parliamentary sittings I have been wearing very proudly in the gym the ‘one small world’ T-shirt that was produced by this group of people. Sally is an exceptional young woman about to give birth to her second child, and her efforts in being able to raise $10,000 for this terrible tragedy deserve special recognition. I also want to recognise Ballarat anaesthetist Robert Ray, who returned from Banda Aceh recently after three weeks working as part of a 24-member medical team sent into the hardest hit region. I was made aware of Robert’s work when on a school visit to a local grade 6 class who have just recently been to Canberra. Robert’s young son made a point of waiting for me after the class had finished to tell me what his dad had been up to. Dr Ray described working in the conditions at the hospital that had been hit by the wave-the ground floor was still muddy when the team arrived. There was a shortage of diagnostic equipment. The hospital lost a quarter of its medical staff in the disaster. He states that a lot of the post-tsunami work related to head injuries and trauma caused by unstable buildings or car accidents. Water and power were intermittent and went on and off during operations. Dr Ray had previously helped with the Darwin based emergency effort after the Bali bombings and has served in East Timor. His message on coming home was pretty clear: ‘The team’s work is just beginning and support will need to be continued for years to come.’ As a country and a community, we need to continue the support for the work to rebuild shattered communities and lives across so many parts of the world affected by this disaster. The work of the aid agencies and the in-depth media coverage help us to understand the need that is still there and will continue to be there long after the last injured survivor is discharged from hospital and the story has slipped from the pages of our newspapers. In BallaratI chair a tsunami advisory committee made up of aid agencies, service clubs and local government organisations. Our initial efforts have been to coordinate and publicise fundraising activities and to provide information to the community as to how best they can assist. We are now turning our thoughts to the establishment of a longer term relationship with the devastated region. Most MPs in this place would have had approaches from their local government or local charities with requests for similar arrangements. I think it would be an appropriate role for the government to provide some coordination of this through AusAID and in conjunction with the Australian Local Government Association. I will write to the respective ministers in this regard. MAIN COMMITTEE This disaster has brought people from different religions, different nationalities and different beliefs together across the globe for a common cause. It allows us to share what we have in common-our humanity. This condolence motion allows the parliament to come together to show our compassion and our support for the victims of this terrible tragedy. Our thoughts and, more importantly, our practical help go out to our nearest neighbours at this time. that I add my voice to the debate. The Indian Ocean tsunami has now claimed close to 300,000 lives and destroyed the livelihoods of thousands more. Firstly, I would like to extend my personal condolences, and those of my electorate, to the victims. An estimated one million people have been displaced and five million deprived of basic services. There is something indelible about the human spirit that shines brightly in the face of adversity and tragedy. I am sure we will all remember where we were when we heard of the Boxing Day tsunami disaster. While most of us did not personally know the victims, the loss of life and livelihood touched each and every one of us. We witnessed the catastrophe on our television screens, we heard it through the radio, we read about it and we saw pictures in our newspapers. I for one recall hearing of the initial earthquake off the coast of Aceh. At the time the first reports came out of Aceh very little was made of it; it was only in subsequent days that we heard of the enormity of the disaster. While I am not a seismologist, I was still shocked to hear that the underwater quake measured 9.9 on the Richter scale. Further estimates placed the quake at 10, which, in logarithmic terms, as I am told by those who know more than I do, is 10 times greater in force than the initial estimate. The deadly force of the resulting tsunami did not reach our shores. However, we did have Australian victims in the areas. We as Australians felt compelled, nevertheless, to extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims, even though the disaster hit foreign borders rather than our own. Even more significantly, everyday Australians have dug deep and donated generously to help sufferers. I am sure that all of us share that lump in the throat when we hear of decent, hard working people chipping in to lend a hand to the various relief efforts. It is a well-worn phrase, but goodwill, charity and community spirit really do begin at home. The tens of millions of dollars that Australians gladly donated to assist tsunami ravaged countries point towards a strong current of compassion and empathy in the community. I was in the Middle East during the initial aftermath but, while tension is high in the Palestinian territories and the Middle East area and suffering is not hard to find, even in this climate it was evident that the Asian tsunami had touched people in this far corner of the globe. Indeed, it demonstrated the global effect of the disaster. The airwaves, even in the Middle East, were swamped throughout the day by stories coming out of the Indian Ocean region. In my electorate of Deakin the response to the crisis has been swift and significant. While I have had differences with them in the past, the Whitehorse City Council should be commended for their public show of support for the relief effort and for the victims of the disaster. I was reassured upon my return that both local councils in my electorate, Whitehorse City Council and Maroondah City Council, were actively engaging the community. Both councils provided important services to the community. They both provided an avenue for people to place messages of condolence and to inquire how they could help with the relief effort. At this point I would like to congratulate my colleague and close friend the Hon. Bruce Billson, Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, for his work during this time. MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Australian Institute Of Marine Science Amendment Bill 2005
169,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (10.34 A.m.),"It is with a sense of immense sadness and reflectionHis work during this period really did contrast quite remarkably with the silence from some others who, perhaps, we may have expected to come out and make comments in the political sphere. During this period, Bruce’s work of informing colleagues from both sides of the political fence on the latest efforts and on how they could assist families and friends in their electorates was work that we all commend. I know that he gave up much of his personal time and holiday time with his children in order to provide that service and that support not only to us but also directly to the families and friends affected by the tsunami. The tsunami has had a significant personal connection with the Deakin electorate. My electorate chairman, Jim Madden, was holidaying in Phuket when the disaster struck. If it had not been for one of those moments of fate, he might have been on the street at the time the tsunami hit. Fortunately, there was some change in circumstances and, after discussions, he and his wife decided to go back to their room, which was in a hotel high above the waters, but he certainly had a direct connection with what was happening. Contrary to some people in the region who made untimely criticisms of DFAT staff and the lack of so-called government assistance by some people who were in the region, Mr Madden was full of praise for the service offered to Australians in Thailand at the time, particularly the evacuation efforts to get Australians back home. Credit for the response should not go exclusively to our elected representatives. Community groups and individuals in Deakin have extended a willingness to help out wherever they can. For example, a local panel works offered to lend vehicles to assist with the relief effort. Local teachers and nurses also asked me how they could utilise their skills to help out. The staff at the physiotherapy department at Maroondah Hospital took their own steps and raised close to $4,000 with a treadmill marathon. This money has been donated to World Vision to provide supplies such as bottled water, blankets and vaccines for people in affected areas. Two local Bendigo Banks in my electorate, the Ringwood Community Bank and the Ringwood East Community Bank, have contributed towards the banks nationwide appeal, which has raised more than $300,000 across Australia. Both branches provided local people with the opportunity to donate. I also acknowledge the work of our major non-government organisations in Australia. I have a particular interest in World Vision, Australia’s largest NGO, as they are based in my electorate. Their work typifies what has been undertaken by agencies in the tsunami affected countries, whether it be the successes, the challenges or the frustrations experienced by those NGOs. World Vision Australia has raised $80 million towards the relief effort-a fantastic result. Their efforts include the memorable World Cricket Tsunami Appeal at the McG, which raised $15 million, and the historic Reach Out For Asia concert and telethon, which raised $20 million. The two events were historic. The concert was broadcast to 38 countries and the cricket match to 122 nations. These events demonstrated the spirit and determination of Australians. To pull two massive events together in such a short space of time was nothing short of extraordinary. Differences were forgotten, corporate competitors joined forces and the nation pulled together in a moment of unprecedented kindness and generosity. I have had discussions with World Vision over the past months and they have echoed to me the same sentiments that many have expressed to me and to other members of this Housethat is, that the goodwill generated, in particular from the cricket match, will last well into the future. In addition to the funds raised, the match was broadcast in India and Sri Lanka-two MAIN COMMITTEE of the countries so badly affected by the tsunami. Corporations from right around the world were inspired to donate millions of dollars as Australia’s hands of friendship stretched across the ocean. World Vision’s international appeal has raised $240 million, with the majority of funds from Australia, the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. Pleasingly, Australians have donated more per capita than any other nation. It is expected that the total raised will be around $US350 million, as further funds come in from government grants, corporations and foundations. In the first 30 days alone, World Vision provided more than $11 million in assistance to around 500,000 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and Myanmar. The friendship and close cooperation between Australia, the affected countries and the NGOs is a major positive that has arisen since the tragedy. In the House of Representatives today, the parliament is examining Australia’s $1 billion bilateral assistance package to Indonesia. While I am not debating the mechanics of that bill today, I would like to put on record my utmost support for the government’s historic response. Indonesia, one of our closest neighbours and one of our most important regional partners, has welcomed this show of support from the Australian government-a show of support that extends beyond personnel and government assistance. I believe that the friendship and the ties developed between Indonesia and Australia over the years will continue to be strengthened through this donation. This support will bear fruit for all of us in both nations. I am sure that most Australians feel a heightened sense of kinship as we stand shoulder to shoulder helping our nearest neighbour and the largest Muslim nation in the world as it rebuilds its devastated regions, particularly in Aceh. The bilateral nature of Australia’s aid package to Indonesia is much more than a symbolic gesture of friendship and goodwill; it is possibly the most significant factor in ensuring that our assistance is delivered in a prompt, fair and just manner. Rebuilding the lives and homes of the millions of people affected by the tragedy will be a long and, at times, arduous process. The phase of this humanitarian effort requires extensive consultation with, and the participation of, the local community. It is not the role of a sole government, aid agency or international organisation to have an absolute say in the rebuilding. Pressure is exerted by the media and the public in donating countries to spend funds quickly. Aid agencies must resist the pressure to spend the money quickly and opt instead for sustainable, planned, long-term results. I look forward to an opportunity to visit some of the devastated regions at an appropriate time, when, as MPs, we are not more of a nuisance than a benefit to the aid workers. I would certainly like to see first-hand the generosity of the people of Australia and the work done by World Vision, and lend my personal support and kinship to the people affected. In closing, I express my thanks to the many people in my electorate that have donated and shown their support. To all those who lost their lives and to their families and friends, whether in Indonesia or in the other affected nations: my heart, prayers and thoughts go to you. must consider an event that is just mind-boggling in terms of the dimensions of human suffering but where we can unite in expressing concern, sharing our grief and talking about the efforts that many people have been involved in, both heroic and financial. This is an international disaster not quite of unprecedented scale but certainly of a magnitude that I hope we will not see in the future, though I fear we may well see something similar again. I, like many MAIN COMMITTEE",139,Indian Ocean Tsunami
170,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (10.47 A.m.),"This is one of those occasions where the parliamentothers, I am sure, felt a true sense of helplessness at the time of the tsunami and in the aftermath. My office, like those of many other members, was inundated with people seeking information about family members or friends and people asking what could be done to help with the coordination of aid efforts and endeavouring to assist people dealing with the sorts of feelings that one has at such a terrible time. But that sense of helplessness was something which internationally, and particularly within Australia, the general community responded to very effectively, as did the government, aid organisations, the defence forces and volunteers. In this country the government, to their credit, came forward with a major aid commitment-and they ought to be commended for it. The work done on the ground by our defence forces in places like Aceh deserves our respect and our support for what has truly been a great effort at a time of incredible human suffering. The efforts of volunteers and aid workers also deserve our recognition and support. The amount of money that has been raised from donations from members of the Australian community and the wider international community is absolutely amazing. It is an unusual thing to find aid organisations actually saying publicly that they are having difficulty working out how to the spend the money that has been raised and, in fact, suggesting that it would be better for people to donate either to other organisations or to other causes, given the level of money that is there to be used. That does not mean to say that that money cannot be used effectively; I am sure that it can be used effectively and I am sure that more money will be needed in the years to come. But it makes the point that, with the infrastructure of and the circumstances facing some of these countries, only so much aid can go in at any particular time and be used effectively. Many speakers have talked in some detail about what has happened in Indonesia. I will not dwell too much on that other than to say that the people of Aceh, in particular, have suffered tremendously as a result of the tsunami, and that the sorts of efforts that will be required in rebuilding there will be phenomenal. When you look at it in terms of the sorts of issues faced by that community with the civil war that has been going on there, you understand just some aspects of the challenge that they face. A lot of pictures have come through from Thailand showing what occurred there. We have heard many harrowing stories about people from Thailand and international visitors, particularly Australians who have died or suffered there. The human nature of this tragedy has touched many Australians. The third country I want to talk about, in some detail, is Sri Lanka. It is a country that I have visited and I know representatives from its various ethnic communities who now live in Australia. Although Sri Lanka is further away from most places affected seriously by the tsunami, it is a country that was affected dramatically. Sri Lanka has a population of around the 18 to 20 million mark, but the degree of destruction, given the nature of its island coast and the concentration of population around the coast, was quite phenomenal. The circumstances that have faced that country since have also created a range of difficulties for the government and the communities in those areas. From Shane Warne’s recent visit to Galle we saw what happened to the cricket groundsomething we recognise as almost an icon for the international cricketing community-but the level of devastation in not only the south but also the north and the east has been quite phenomenal. The death toll for that area as of 10 February was 38,195. The total number of MAIN COMMITTEE displaced persons belonging to 77,436 families had declined to 500,668 by 10 February. The number of independent displaced person camps, island wide, had decreased from 328 as resettlements continued. The number of completely damaged houses was reported at 78,529, whereas 41,097 houses were recorded as partially damaged. The reported number of injured tsunami victims has decreased to 15,196. Those notes come from a tsunami news update from the Foundation for Coexistence in Sri Lanka and give you an idea of the level of harm and devastation that occurred. Sri Lanka is a very interesting community and one that has suffered a lot over the last 20plus years. There has been a civil conflict with elements of the Tamil community in opposition to the Sinhalese government. It has been a very bitter and brutal conflict. Many have been killed. It is a conflict that has raged throughout the island not only directly through military engagement in parts of the north and the east, particularly, but also in acts of violence in the south, particularly in the capital, Colombo-although in recent years ceasefires have been in place and discussions have been continuing between representatives of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the government of the day. One thing you can say about it is that it is an incredibly complex dispute. It is a dispute noone comes to with clean hands and it is a dispute where the level of passion and feeling across those communities is incredibly high. In that situation, when a natural disaster of this nature occurs, on the one hand it increases discussions in some quarters about the need to try to peacefully work together and deal with the enormous humanitarian disaster they face and, on the other hand, it leads to a situation where the very sensitivities that have dominated those communities over time have been heightened to a degree which has led to a whole range of things occurring. There have been real problems in getting aid through to some places. This has been reported in the media on a number of occasions. I do not seek to blame anyone in particular, other than to say this: it is clearly difficult for international aid organisations to go into a country. There are cultural sensitivities, geographic issues and the actual nature of the communities that they are seeking to assist-combined with the fact that they are dealing with those communities after an event that has placed massive stress levels on them. All of that makes it difficult for the aid organisations in the first place. There are infrastructure problems with roads, rail et cetera. Certainly, those areas on the coast of Sri Lanka were severely affected and those conditions make it incredibly difficult for aid to get through. There is a great deal of suspicion from the government with respect to some of the Tamil organisations, like the Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation, and there is a great deal of suspicion towards the government from the Tamil and other community organisations. Those concerns create difficulties with things like aid and what occurs there. An article in the Age on 11 February pointed to some of these issues. Again, I am not wishing to score points against the Sri Lankan government or anyone else, but I do make the point that we have to recognise there have been real issues in aid getting to where it is needed. The article states: Six weeks after the tsunami struck, aid-some 4.1 billion rupees ($52 million)-has failed to reach nearly 70 per cent of the displaced people in Sri Lanka, a senior Government minister said this week. Almost a million people have not received basic needs of food, water and shelter, Commissioner General of Essential Services, Tilak Ranaviraja, said. MAIN COMMITTEE Australian volunteer Alison Thompson, who is working as a nurse in Periliya, a refugee camp near Galle where 2500 people were killed, said there had been no aid. “I don’t understand where these big organisations are,” she said. “I know the children now and they come out to me and say: ‘Alison. No eat. I’m so hungry.’ … … … Another Australian volunteer, Claire Stewart, expressed deep frustration at the lack of aid, saying the Government and the large aid organisations were ignoring much of the country. It goes on to say: She visited eight government-run camps on Tuesday at Moratuwu, on the outskirts of Colombo where families were still waiting for tents to arrive. For the moment, they sleep side by side in a temple. … … … Ajith Aponso, a leader at the Thalarukkarama camp, said: “Government help is very small. Food comes twice a week or something. It’s not enough.” Further on, Ms Thompson, whom I mentioned earlier, states: … there was no medical care at many of the camps. People have been forced to walk 20 kilometres to get to the makeshift hospital she had established at the camp, she said. Many have infected feet from cuts suffered as they ran from the tsunami. Others are suffering from rabies, malaria and broken bones. Sri Lanka received 4.1 billion rupees on February2 from both foreign and local individuals and organisations, the Central Bank said this week. A spokeswoman for Red Cross International said aid organisations had found it difficult to reach the affected areas. “It’s very difficult logistically to maintain a presence here because of the road conditions. That gives you some idea of some of the problems that are occurring with aid in those areas. Again, there is probably some rightful criticism to be placed upon the Sri Lankan government; there is probably some criticism that can be aimed at some of the aid organisations too. However, it underlines the very serious problem in getting aid through effectively to underdeveloped areas with a lack of qualified and skilled workers. WhatI would stress in relation to that is the fact that there are problems occurring means aid still needs to get through and that we have to keep up the effort to ensure that fundraising occurs and that the aid is allocated. I also stress to everyone that we need to look to the future. It is not only about the immediacy of aid in order to maintain life; it is also about the rebuilding of communities into the future. I know that a lot work is being done and needs to be done on rebuilding infrastructure in those areas to ensure that the people are less likely to suffer the same level of devastation should, God forbid, something like this happens again and also so that we can give those who have remained the opportunity to rebuild their lives so that things can be better in the future. I urge all parties in the external disputes in Sri Lanka to do everything they can to get over their concerns about the motives of others and ensure that we maximise the effort. The Tamil Rehabilitation Organisation, TRO, which I mentioned earlier, plays a very important role in the provision of aid in predominately Tamil areas in the north and east of the country. It is an organisation which is often claimed to be very close to the LTTE-and I think that is true. However, I urge the government and others to recognise that it is no doubt an organisation MAIN COMMITTEE that has to be part of the process. It can play a very important role in ensuring that aid gets out there. Concerns have been raised about the operation of various parties within those communities. A range of issues have been raised about corruption. A lot of those concerns are valid but some of them are not. It is easy to blame and to point the finger in these circumstances, but we need to encourage all parties to get together and do what they can to alleviate the problems faced by the community in those areas. I mentioned earlier, in those quotes from the Age, the devastation and problems with aid going through. But I think the amazing thing is that, although there were numerous concerns raised about the possibility of epidemics, starvation and a much higher death toll after the disaster, that has not happened. That has been a triumph for all concerned. I urge all to work together to try and deal with this problem. (Time expired) Day, 26 December 2004, was a devastating natural event. It registered 9.0 on the Richter scale. Countries right around the Indian Ocean rim, from Indonesia in Asia right across to Somalia in Africa, were affected in a way that was beyond people’s imagination and certainly beyond what anyone could have prepared for or expected. According to the Red Cross, the human devastation as of the beginning of February included some 278,000 dead, some 14,000 missing, over one million people left displaced and over one million left homeless. There were some 230,000 dead in Indonesia alone, our neighbour. Australia was affected very directly by this tragedy, with 21 Australian citizens losing their lives and six more unaccounted for with grave concerns held about whether they have survived this disaster. The impact of the tsunami was such that the island of Phuket in Thailand has shifted 32 centimetres from where it was-an entire island permanently shifted by the earthquake and consequential tsunami. As the shadow minister for the environment and heritage, I believe that the tsunami following the earthquake was very much a stark reminder of the power of mother nature, the power of natural forces beyond which humankind can have little effect. We can certainly prepare better, and certainly the discussions about the need for early warning systems are very valid, but the tsunami’s effect was such that there would have been some impact no matter what the level of preparation. Indeed, NASA has confirmed in later studies that the waves which flowed across the Indian Ocean were travelling at 800 kilometres per hour as a result of this earthquake. The waves grew from centimetres to 10 metres of water high. That they travelled at 800 kilometres an hour across the ocean is an extraordinary finding. The two waves were 800 kilometres apart. We have read devastating personal accounts of, firstly, when the water receded people going towards the ocean to look at this phenomenon only to lose their lives as a result of the first wave coming and, then, in between the waves, other people thinking that the crisis was over only to be hit by the even more devastating second wave. The scientific analysis of this event will continue over a considerable period of time. Hopefully we can come up with early warning systems and strategies to alleviate the impact of such an event. In the meantime, I believe if anything positive can be seen to have come out of such a tragedy it is the extraordinary response not the least of which is by this great nation of Australia. I congratulate the government on its decision to contribute $1 billion on behalf of the Australian people. That was a very generous commitment when compared with the contributions of some other nations, but it reflected the concern of the Australian community. In the Australian community we saw extraordinary contributions from individuals right up to govMAIN COMMITTEE",141,Indian Ocean Tsunami

There was the Reach out to Asia telethon, held primarily on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. There was of course the Wave Aid concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground, in which the member for Kingsford Smith played such a prominent role in re-forming the great iconic band Midnight Oil to play. Many members of parliament on both sides of the chamber had contribution points at their electorate offices. I know that people are still coming into my office contributing to the bucket for the Red Cross. One very young constituent of mine-she was five years old-contributed her tooth fairy money. It was the only money she had in the world and she wanted to contribute it to the devastated community. For that I thank and acknowledge Alex Coombs of Dulwich Hill for giving up what for her was a very generous contribution of $1. It was all she had, but rather than put it into her money box it went into the tsunami relief box. That reflected the best of the Australian character. I hope it also marks the point at which it reflects, given concerns expressed by many people in this House about events surrounding the Tampa and issues of asylum seekers and where we are placed in the world, the acknowledgement by the Australian people that we are part of Asia. Australians’ generosity towards people of different ethnicity and different religions reflects that that does not matter, that we are all human beings and that we all deserve to be treated with dignity. When someone was in trouble, our great neighbour Indonesia in particular but also Sri Lanka, India and the other nations, we were prepared to kick in, and to give a helping hand up. The Leader of the Labor Party, Kim Beazley, stated in his contribution to this debate that he hoped-and I hope as well-that it would bring to the forefront the issue of poverty in our region. Tony Blair as the president of the EU and chair of the G8 has made his two priorities the Kyoto protocol-climate change and taking action on that-and the alleviation of poverty in Africa. The tsunami has drawn the issue to the forefront in a very stark way, because part of the reason it had such a devastating impact is the undeveloped nature of many of the regions that were hit. The impact will devastate economies such as Aceh’s, where 70 per cent of the fishing fleet has been destroyed. We need to make the issue of poverty and living standards in our region something that is of concern to us every day, not just at a time of tragedy, and that generosity of spirit needs to be constant rather than subject to any single event. I would like to conclude my remarks by making the point that the tsunami resulting from this earthquake has reminded us of the power of nature and the forces in our natural environment. It was an event we could not do anything about; it was not a human-induced event. For environmental disasters that we can do something about it, that we know are coming, such as climate change in particular, we have a responsibility to take action. It has been predicted by scientists that climate change will result in a rise in sea levels of up to seven metres. If that occurs, many of the low-lying nations hit by the tsunamis will be devastated. In the Indian Ocean region, the Maldives will simply be under water, as will the Cocos Islands, which are part of our territory, just as, in the Pacific, Tuvalu will be. One-sixth of Bangladesh’s agricultural production will be gone and 30 million people are expected to be displaced from India. The United States State Department and the Pentagon estimated in a paper the potential for a total of 150 million environmental refugees being created by climate change. With the reminder of the force of the natural environment, we need to be very clear on and very determined as to where we can make a difference. As policy makers in the naMAIN COMMITTEE tional parliament we have a particular responsibility and ability to make a difference, so we should not lose any opportunity to do our best to acknowledge the impact that human activity has on our natural environment. I commend the motion to the House and I acknowledge the contribution that the government has made. I believe that this has been the Australian parliament working at its best in a bipartisan way in the interests of Australia and of our neighbours in the Asian region in which we live. tragic day that saw so many lives devastated throughout Asia by the ‘tsunami’, that word that we all now know. It devastated hundreds of thousands of lives, it devastated villages and it devastated whole communities in Sri Lanka and other places that saw this dreadful event take place. As a South Australian I was shocked by other events on 11 January, on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. Somehow these tragedies always seem to huddle together, and with the bushfires coming after the tsunami it felt like the world was falling apart. The bushfires happened so soon after we learnt of the tsunami. On that Tuesday South Australia lost nine people in the fires. Those people were Jack and Star Borlase of Wanilla and their grandmother, Judith Griffith, of Adelaide; Port Lincoln High School teacher Helen Castle; Jodie Russell-Kay of Poonindie and her children, Graham and Zoe; and the original ‘Cockaleechie Kid’, Neil Richardson, and his mate Trent Murnane. This fire was more intense than any fire in South Australia’s modern history. It burnt at up to 1,000 degrees Celsius and turned engines into molten steel. It travelled at 80 kilometres per hour, even though scientific studies show that usually a fire is blown out by the wind when it goes faster than 60 kilometres per hour. It blazed from north to south to west and approached houses from two or three different directions. It was unlike any fire South Australians have ever seen. Two South Australian Country Fire Service volunteers were killed that day-Trent Murnane and Neil Richardson. They paid a horrific price for their commitment to their community. Two thousand CFS volunteers were committed on that awful day. There were 16 fires burning around the state, and on the Eyre Peninsula the fire danger index approached a record 300. Even on Ash Wednesday it had only been 150. At CFS headquarters in the city there was no way of knowing if all 16 fires would turn into a nightmare. There were serious fears in relation to fires in the south-east, in the Adelaide Hills at Mount Osmond, at Mount Bold and of course on the Eyre Peninsula. Winds across the state were gusting up to 70 kilometres per hour. CFS volunteers knew the fires that they would battle that day would be almost impossible to contain, yet they put their safety on the line as they battled in the most unbelievably difficult conditions. What is amazing about these people and what sets them apart from the remarkable contributions made by other emergency services and medical personnel that day is that they are volunteers. CFS volunteers are farmers, butchers, bus drivers and teachers. They come from every walk of life and every profession, but when disaster strikes they drop everything to protect others and their community. It is worth noting that even though these people are volunteers their professionalism is second to none. Their training is comprehensive, and that in itself takes enormous commitment and courage. The Eyre Peninsula fires brought the dedication of these people to the forefront, but it should not be forgotten that every day, rain or shine, CFS volunteers are out and about. Whether it is cutting car crash victims from a wreck, dragging people from a house fire or fighting deadly wildfires, these volunteers give their all. MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Indian Ocean Tsunami
172,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (11.16 A.m.),"I too was shocked by the events of that I would also like to say a little about the other people who lost their lives on Black Tuesday. Helen Castle was a schoolteacher in Port Lincoln. She lived at North Shields and was home alone on that day. The fire was reported to be travelling at about 100 kilometres per hour. It is thought she would not have known the fire was coming. Poor little Star Borlase was just 12 days from her fourth birthday when she, her brother Jack and her grandma were so cruelly taken by the fire. Jodie Russell-Kay was trying to flee the fire and save her children, 11-year-old Zoe and 13-year-old Graham, when they were killed in a car crash as they tried to escape the fire, surrounded by thick smoke. One can think of nothing worse than the terror of trying to save your children in those sorts of circumstances, or the grief of losing them so tragically. My heartfelt prayers go to the loved ones who survived. There are no words that can offer any comfort, but they should know that our thoughts are with them. As was the case in the Tulka fires on the peninsula a few years earlier, and the Ash Wednesday fires, the fire burnt some homes to the ground and left others untouched. The school at Poonindie was destroyed but the town’s church was spared. But the Eyre Peninsula communities are resilient, and, despite the tragic deaths and the devastation caused by the fire, the people will get back on their feet and get on with their lives. The South Australian communities are helping them to do that. Donations directly from the public and funds from the state government are supporting families as they rebuild their lives. Within days, the state government had allocated $6 million for those affected by the fires. By 19 January, 112 farmers had received $1 million through emergency farm business support grants, 281 people had accessed emergency assistance grants for families and 660 people had registered for assistance at recovery centres. As is common for Australians, especially those who live in the bush, many people had to be convinced to accept help. They did not want a handout. The state emergency services minister tells of a couple whom he and the Premier came across on Wednesday evening after the fire. They had lost everything but the clothes on their backs and the Minister for Emergency Services asked them if they had gone to a recovery centre for help. They told him they had not because: ‘There are plenty worse off than us.’ In the face of complete devastation this couple continued to think about the needs of others before their own needs, and I believe that demonstrates the most wonderful sense of community. That caring attitude will be the reason that people on the Eyre Peninsula are able to get back on their feet. There is a huge challenge ahead for the communities on the Eyre Peninsula and despite the horror of what they have experienced they will pull together and overcome those challenges. I must acknowledge the tremendous work done by the volunteers at the Country Fire Service. These men and women battled the fire for hours and hours on end. Knowing that their own homes might be burning, they fought on to save the lives and properties of others. There is no doubt that without their heroism more lives would have been lost. I am aware of talks between the Prime Minister and the South Australian Premier to overcome a taxation problem that has arisen in relation to the relief grants. In the first instance it appeared that the state government grants would be taxed as income. However, the Premier has contacted the Prime Minister as a matter of urgency and we remain confident that the issue will be resolved. Those who live in South Australia, the driest state in the driest inhabitable continent in the world, are always aware of the risks of bushfires. Unfortunately, we are not always vigilant and, as sad as the Eyre Peninsula fires were, they serve as a timely reminder to those who live MAIN COMMITTEE in bushfire risk areas. I urge these people not to ignore this warning. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Just because the Eyre Peninsula has suffered this terrible tragedy does not mean that the Adelaide Hills, for example, will not experience a similar blaze. The Country Fire Service is unapologetic for the blunt message it has sent to the Adelaide Hills residents: clean up your properties, clean the gutters, remove debris from around the house and make sure you have a fire plan. Plan now to stay or go and if you intend to stay make sure you are prepared. Check with the CFS that you have everything you will need and that your home is properly prepared. Others in South Australia owe it to those on the Eyre Peninsula to show them that what they experienced was not without reason, that in some way it had a purpose and that others will not die in wildfires, because the fires on the peninsula prompted them to make sure that it will not happen again. Already the people of the Eyre Peninsula are getting back on their feet. The support of the South Australian community-and indeed of the Australian communityhas been essential. So soon after the tsunami disaster Australians were again asked to reach into their pockets or make hands-on contributions-and they did that. Australians are indeed great neighbours. When the chips are down, as they have been all too often of late, Australians find kindness and generosity within. I believe it is the quality that shines through amid such adversity that makes Australia a great country. 300,000 people, displaced 1½ million people and left 5,000,000 people without basic services, was one of the most horrific natural disasters to befall mankind, certainly in the modern era. Words cannot express the horror of a child being dragged from its mother’s arms, of whole families, if not villages, being swept away, or of holidaying tourists being divided by cruel twists of fate, some surviving and some never to be seen again. Words cannot express the devastation of the cities being reduced to rubble, of fishing fleets being swept ashore and dumped grotesquely kilometres inland. Nor can words express the human misery of the survivors, some with horrific injuries and nowhere to go for aid-no food, no sanitation, no clean water, no hospitals. So Australia’s contribution becomes all the more significant when we were the first nation to act and to act decisively. But before I move to the content of that matter I would like to speak about the 21 Australians who died as a result of the tsunami. They were fun-loving Australians, most of them on a holiday experience in much the same way as those who lost their lives in the Bali devastation-fun-loving Australians just doing the things they normally do. Some of them were sporting groups on holiday excursions cruelly ripped apart, on this occasion not by terrorists but by this cruel twist of nature, an event so well developed and described by my colleague the member for Grayndler. He described how various waves came in and how people raced down onto the beach to see the water receding only to be caught in the next wave. It was really a grotesque sort of a tragedy. The devastated area was not contained to just one place like Bali; it was right across the Indian Ocean region as far away as the East African coast and the islands in between. I am immensely proud of the Australian response to the disaster and of our spontaneous action in reaching out for those who needed aid in a tangible expression of humanity and compassion in the Australian spirit of mateship. Never before has the Australian public dug so deep. The amounts donated to help the survivors are truly staggering. Care Australia raised MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Indian Ocean Tsunami
173,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.25 A.m.),"The Boxing Day tsunami, which killed almost$30 million. World Vision raised $75 million for its tsunami appeal. There was $17 million from corporate businesses. The Red Cross raised around $100 million. The Australian government response, which I referred to before, was $1 billion to help rebuild the shattered communities of Indonesia under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development. This is a five-year program comprising of $500 million in grant funding and another $500 million in loans. It will lift our total aid to Indonesia to $1.8 billion over the next five years. The Australian tsunami assistance to Indonesia for the relief phase includes coordination of transportation, disaster management and logistics, health, water, sanitation, food and non-food items and education. Rehabilitation activities include help with education and child protection, governance and further work on health, water and public sanitation. Of course, in speaking about this, we should not overlook the incredible contribution of the Australian military forces, who provided logistics and health support and ran field hospitals, and also the contribution of some of the states that sent medical teams. I know a medical team was sent from Queensland to assist and may still be there. It is an incredible expression of support for one of our nearest neighbours. It is also an investment which we can use to help fight terrorism and to help strengthen our relationship with Indonesia. I think we are all aware of what the challenges are in the Aceh region. It is easy to understand how people who live on a subsistence diet, who frequently starve, who have no future, who have no hope, once given a weapon and a dream can become empoweredempowered in the wrong way, of course, but empowered. Some of those rebel movements do not act with any sort of logic; they are often driven by hatred. Anything we can do of a humanitarian and a practical nature to try to ease that deprivation that many communities suffer we should look at, as I said before, first as an expression of our common humanity but second as an investment in our own future. On that note I am somewhat taken aback by a handful of constituents who approached me with the issue of the billion dollar aid package to Indonesia and asked why we were giving so much money to a foreign country. Quite frankly, I was flabbergasted. I find it incongruous that some members of the public would question the spontaneity of the government approach. But the amount of money raised across Australia from private sources and sporting events or in the form of donations to our various agencies was totally unprecedented. I think it was the clearest possible indication that the Australian public endorsed the government’s actions. I think Australians in making those donations voted with their wallets. We should also remember on the broader scale that we are a nation with an annual budget of $180 billion. It is incumbent upon us to be generous with our neighbours. We enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world and we are certainly at present going through a period of unprecedented wealth. We are enjoying low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment. Never before in our history have we been so empowered to be able to do things for other people. That is why I find this handful of people in our midst saying things like that almost unbelievable. I think it demeans us as a nation when you see letters to the editor questioning that sort of generosity. Some people also come into my office on a general level, not just in relation to the tsunami-and I address these remarks to them today-and they say, ‘We give too much foreign aid; charity begins at home.’ Charity does not begin at home; charity begins when you look MAIN COMMITTEE into the eyes of a starving or maimed child. That is when it starts. These sorts of catchphrases that people use to excuse their lack of generosity in the physical sense of giving a donation or their lack of generosity of spirit I find quite un-Australian. We as a country have had a long, proud history of helping nations less fortunate than us. Every year, Australia’s aid program reaches more than 58 million poverty stricken people around the world. The challenges they have range from trying to counteract AIDS and other health problems to the most basic things like providing fresh running water for villages. As the leading nation in the South Pacific, there is a double responsibility on us to do something about the nations in our region. Going back to that $180 billion, in any normal year we allocate just over one per cent of federal expenditure to foreign aid, compared with the 44 per cent-a figure I heard in the parliament only this week-that is spent on social security and welfare. In 2004-05 Australia will provide $2.133 billion worth of official development assistance, an increase of $239 million on the amount given in 2003-04. As I said before, quite apart from the aspect of common humanity, at a more practical level Australia’s national interest is served by stability in our region. Of that $2.1 billion I talked about, $805 million goes principally to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. We know the challenges that are being experienced there. In the case of Papua New Guinea, being the last colonial power to rule New Guinea we are obliged by international protocol to make an ‘over and above’ effort. In the poorer parts of Asia we give just under $500 million-surely no-one would begrudge that-and for other parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, $206 million. When you break it up like that it is not a lot of money. The other thing we and the critics should remember is that a lot of that aid comes back to Australia in purchases. It is not just money going offshore. Australian companies and professional bodies that provide services to those countries enjoy some of the benefit of that. Of course we do not do that with that in mind, but in net terms it is not a lot of money going out of Australia. I hope that this tsunami will serve to make us a much more sensitive nation to these disasters. The previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh, spoke of the devastation on the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia from the recent bushfires. There should be spontaneity in this country; we should not be so inwardly focused at a time when the country is enjoying a relatively high standard of living and prosperity. I ask in my closing remarks that the government and Australia’s scientific agencies do everything they can to play a part in tsunami warning systems. The tsunami earthquake would not need to have occurred many more miles to the west for it to also have affected the north-west coast of Australia. We also have a lot of coastal communities-more of them than we sometimes realise. In fact, most of the nation is built around the eastern and southern seaboards. We should remember that our own vulnerability could be an issue. There are stories in North Queensland of a tsunami back in the 19th century that hit an isolated part of North Queensland. SoI call on those scientific agencies to be very focused and very generous as we develop a tsunami warning system for the Pacific and Indian oceans. Let us hope this dreadful circumstance never occurs again. Debate (on motion by Mr Baldwin) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea, it is surprising how little coverage and attention events in Papua New Guinea receive in the Australian media. One honourable exception is the Melbourne Age correspondent Mark Forbes, who from time to time puts together particularly interesting stories in relation to Papua New Guinea. I draw the chamber’s attention to an article that appeared in the Melbourne Age on 4 December entitled ‘Policing a country in crisis’. This article arises from the deployment in support of Papua New Guinea of a vanguard of the Australian Federal Police accompanied by a number of civil servants, which was called the Enhanced Cooperation Program. What struck me in this article was a quote from the Papua New Guinea Police Minister, Bire Kimisopa. He said the Papua New Guinea police force ‘is no longer functioning’. Those are the words of the Papua New Guinea Police Minister. He talks about the police force as a ‘cul-de-sac of corruption’. I know Bire Kimisopa quite well. He strikes me as a man of undoubted integrity and capacity. When he is quoted as having made those sorts of observations, we need to take them very seriously indeed and support him in the courageous role he plays. Mark Forbes followed this up with another story in the Age on 19 February entitled ‘Mafia, corrupt police cripple PNG bid for law and order’. Bire Kimisopa, talking about the influence of organised crime in Papua New Guinea, says ‘it goes right to the top’. The article talks about an investigation by the Age uncovering links between 16 of PNG’s most senior police and Asian criminals implicated in people-smuggling, money laundering, prostitution, illegal gambling, fraud and theft. I simply want to alert the House to the difficulties that Papua New Guinea faces and the importance of Australia’s support. When the Enhanced Cooperation Program was announced by the government, it attracted opposition support. I, as the relevant shadow minister, and the then leader, Mark Latham, put out a media statement endorsing the program and giving our best wishes to the Australian police who commenced the deployment in quite dangerous circumstances. The evidence of problems, though, continues with a report to the PNG government, produced last year by an inquiry into the Papua New Guinea police force. The report made comments such as ‘The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary has lost its integrity’. It talks about the lawless behaviour of some police having destroyed community confidence and trust. It simply illustrates the difficulty of the environment and the importance of the role the Australian police will be undertaking. Whilst Labor have supported the government’s approach on this, there are a number of matters at present that we think need considerable attention. The revelations, particularly by Mark Forbes, of somewhat more sophisticated, typically Asian based criminals infiltrating Papua New Guinea lend importance to the need not only for policemen on the beat but also for a more sophisticated approach to developing the critical infrastructure that Papua New Guinea needs for effective law enforcement. This will include adding significantly to the PNG capacity in communications and their capacity in relation to forensics, and it is particularly MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Indian Ocean Tsunami

175,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (11.41 A.m.),"For a country as important to Australia asimportant in the light of the sorts of comments that I have alluded to that we strengthen the police internal affairs function. It is also very important indeed, in my view, that this government engages in dialogue with the Papua New Guinean government to look at expanding the enhanced cooperation package beyond its present bilateral basis to a basis where other Pacific nations can have the opportunity to support Australia in its role in Papua New Guinea in the sort of way that Pacific nations are working with Australia in the RAMSI exercise in the Solomon Islands. Papua New Guinea has been a very strong advocate indeed of Pacific regionalism and I believe the current law and order difficulties that are reaching crisis proportions in this country really do require a regional approach, not just a bilateral approach, involving Australia. Cockatoo Fire Brigade bert and Captain Stephen Cameron from the Cockatoo Fire Brigade. They were greatly concerned about a replacement tanker for their local area. I recall the Ash Wednesday bushfires, which affected La Trobe, of 16 February 1983. These fires left a dramatic debt, calculated in today’s terms at roughly $1 billion, not to mention the tragic loss of lives, many of whom were local CFA officers. Following these fires, the Cockatoo Fire Brigade took it upon themselves to sew the initiative to develop and build a tanker capable of carrying 10,000 litres of water, which is four times the amount which a standard fire tanker can hold. This extra water capacity has proven to be extremely successful as it enables a tanker and its crew to remain at a fire scene rather than go back three or four times to refill. It is because of this unique advantage that the Cockatoo brigade will often receive calls from other fire brigades seeking assistance throughout the state. The Cockatoo tanker has played a major role in firefighting throughout the electorate of La Trobe. The region itself, with the lack of reticulated water supplies and the fire sensitive vegetation, gives much justification for a tanker with a much larger water capacity than normal. A suitable replacement is in the best interests of the community. Unfortunately, the brigade owned tanker is fast coming to the end of its 25-year life span. The Cockatoo brigade have been informed that they will be required to remove their current tanker from the roads within the next year or so as it is around 20 years old and will no longer be roadworthy. Whilst the Cockatoo brigade have raised more than $80,000 thus far, further funding of approximately $200,000 is still required to build a replacement tanker by 2007. Through my office I contacted the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment and spoke to Gary Morgan, who is in charge of the state government’s emergency services. I was informed that it was an internal issue for the Country Fire Authority to resolve. The state provides between 20 and 25 per cent of the annual budget, with insurance companies contributing the majority of funding, at close to 70 per cent, mainly through fire service levies. It is up to the Country Fire Authority to allocate funds to the relevant branches as they see fit. This tanker has provided an essential service in defending the community against fires throughout the region. It is especially useful in La Trobe as this region lacks sufficient reticulated water supplies and is prone to bushfires. Letters of support and recognition from surrounding brigades have included Emerald, the Pakenham group, Macclesfield, Lang Lang and the Dandenong Ranges group, all of whom thank the Cockatoo brigade for their assisMAIN COMMITTEE",152,Adjournment
176,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (11.46 A.m.),"On 31 January 2005, I had a meeting with Stan Hibtance in the past and express their concern that the tanker will be removed from the region without an adequate replacement. I am vitally concerned that if we lose this tanker and it is not replaced we may have a devastating bushfire in the future without the area being properly resourced. I had first-hand experience of the destructive force of the Ash Wednesday bushfires. At the time. I was 16 years of age and I can recall the fires starting in the Dandenong Ranges. I have written to the Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Tim Holding, urging him to intervene and replace the Cockatoo tanker. We need to ensure that we provide the best support and training to our CFA volunteers, who have been doing a fantastic job, and that they have the best equipment to prevent another Ash Wednesday bushfire. Defence: Equipment liament’s Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have spoken out in relation to my concerns about the need for Australia to maintain air superiority in our region and about this government’s improper management of our air assets-in particular, their decision to bring forward by 10 years the date of retirement of the F111 without a replacement to come online for a period of at least two and perhaps five or six years, resulting for the first time ever in our history in a situation where Australia will no longer have air superiority in our region. In the newspapers today we see further alarming evidence of that problem. There are articles in a couple of papers with headlines, such as ‘War plane bill goes sky high’ in the Herald Sun, referring to the JSF aircraft which the government have all but announced will be the replacement for the F111. The newspaper article refers to a report conducted by the United States Government Accountability Office, which did a review of the JSF program, which you might recall we signed up to without any process of evaluation. Mind-boggling though it seems, the single most important defence acquisition this country will make in the next 20 years-the replacement for our air strike capability-is being entered into without any of the normal processes of evaluation being undertaken. Compounding this problem, none of those processes have been followed. The report released this month by the US Government Accountability Office is scathing in its commentary on the JSF. This is what it says in part: JSF’s original business case, established when the program began in 1996, is unexecutable. Unexecutable-a damning indictment that puts beyond any doubt the question as to whether or not we have signed up to something that is deliverable. The United States Government Accountability Office have made it plain that the program planned from 1996 is now unexecutable. They identified a few of the reasons, and they are alarming. The cost estimate to develop the aircraft has increased 80 per cent. The government have been talking about the cost of each aircraft being around $67 million. I wonder whether the minister and the government are now factoring in an 80 per cent increase on that, or are we just going to have 80 per cent fewer aircraft when they finally arrive somewhere closer to 2015-five years after we give up the F111s? But that is not the only problem. As the United States Government Accountability Office report notes: ... operational capability has been pushed out 2 yearsMAIN COMMITTEE",153,Adjournment

Of course, as we get closer to that point, it is more than likely that that two-year delay will be extended, which is not uncommon in high-tech, new projects of this kind, but which was totally unplanned for by this government when it decided to bring forward the retirement of the F111s from the anticipated date of 2020 to the new date of 2010. The US Government Accountability Office also noted: ... and expected acquisition quantitiesthat is, how many of these planes are going to be boughthave been cut by 535 aircraft. So from the time they started this program in 1996-and we signed up to it about two years ago-to now, they have themselves in a situation where the cost overruns have gone through the roof, with an 80 per cent increase. They are now looking at a minimum two-year delay and, on top of that, they now look like they are going to sell 535 fewer aircraft than they thought they would at the start. That is on a downward slope because some of the variants of the aircraft, such as the vertical take-off aircraft, have actually run into a weight of problems. Vertical take-off aircraft cannot carry the weapons and vertically take off at the same time, so they have a choice: whether or not they will leave the weapons at home or reduce the weight of the aircraft. This is a fiasco in the most critical area of defence capability this country will confront in the next 20 years. I argued long and hard in the last parliament, in the defence committee, to get a proper evaluation of this done and it was all uphill. Finally though, we did get a recommendation from the defence committee from the last parliament that recommended: … at the start of the next Parliament, the Minister for Defence requests the committee to conduct an inquiry into the ability of the Australian Defence Force to maintain air superiority in our region to 2020. It is time the government did it. Instead of playing games and waiting until after 30 June when they can control the show absolutely, that inquiry should start now. (Time expired) Leukaemia Foundation has come very close to home. One of my staff members has recently been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. He is a passionate Liberal member, a loyal friend, a long-time colleague and an outstanding and long-serving member of my staff. I have been overwhelmed at the support from everyone, and he and his family are truly grateful for the many messages, letters and cards of encouragement he has received. He will shortly undergo another bone marrow biopsy and he has completed his first treatment of chemotherapy. He has had quite a few rough days, but thankfully seems to be improving health wise. We can only hope and pray for his speedy recovery. I have been in regular contact with him and his family as he goes through this difficult time. Australia’s focus has shifted to this disease as this week is the Leukaemia Foundation’s World’s Greatest Shave for a Cure. This is the Leukaemia Foundation’s major fundraiser for the year. The World’s Greatest Shave is one of Australia’s premier charity events, and last year it raised $8.5 million.

178,Mrs Draper (Makin) (11.56 A.m.),"I rise to speak today on an issue that, unfortunately,that has gone before it, has had a dramatic effect on the treatments that are used for leukaemia and this has meant that leukaemia is not the life sentence that it once was. Better treatments have meant that survival rates have increased greatly. For example, children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia now have an 80 per cent chance of survival, compared with a 30 per cent chance 20 years ago. This important fundraiser also provides funds for care and support services for sufferers and their families from the Leukaemia Foundation. They provide a free home away from home service for patients and their families. This is done in 16 accommodation centres located close to treatment facilities across Australia. Undoubtedly, many of my rural colleagues would know constituents who have come to need this invaluable service. The foundation also provides other very important services for leukaemia sufferers and their families-including support and counselling, education programs, transport to and from hospital, and practical assistance-all free of charge. I have great pleasure in reporting that two of my staff members have volunteered to have their heads shaved as part of the fundraising commitment during the World’s Greatest Shave as their way of chipping in for a mate and showing support as he continues his battle with leukaemia. It has also come to my attention that a number of my colleagues are also involved in this magnificent fundraising venture. I have been informed that the newly-elected member for Kingston is going to dye his hair-Liberal blue, he tells me-for this very special occasion. I hope that my constituents in Makin will forgive me for having purple hair, for a week or two at least, as I am also raising funds for the Leukaemia Foundation. I would like to encourage all members and staff, and all Australians across the nation, to contribute to this magnificent fundraising venture as the money raised has a very real benefit for a number of Australians every year, not least my staff member. Child Support Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (11.59 a.m.)-RecentlyI worked with the Child Support Agency to hold an information evening for constituents in my electorate who were either making or receiving child support payments. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Child Support Agency for organising the evening. I know that those who attended found it as useful as I did. I am sure that all members of this parliament would be aware of the concerns of their own constituents who are involved in the child support system and those concerns were made clear to me at this information night. I attended the session with the express purpose of gaining a greater appreciation of the issues faced by parents who are involved in the child support system and in this I was successful. I went to listen to their concerns, to try and understand the pressures that everyone involved faces and to allow me to make a more informed contribution to debates about changes to the child support system after the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support and Reference Group reports back later this month. There are some serious concerns about how Australia’s child support system operates. There are concerns about how the amount of child support payment is calculated and concerns about equity in the system. It would be easy for me to have dismissed concerns about the level of payments as the grumblings of disgruntled individuals forced to make payments but this was clearly not the case. MAIN COMMITTEE When the Child Support Scheme was established in 1988, its objective was to introduce and administer a system that shared the cost of supporting children between separated parents according to their capacity, and to make sure that adequate support is available for all children not living with both parents-a noble objective and one with which I cannot disagree, nor for that matter could the 100 or so people who came to the information session in Wollongong. There was a sense of common purpose among those assembled. Even though they might not agree with the detail of the system or the fact, indeed, that they are involved in it at all, they knew they were there and involved for the benefit of their children. Everyone assembled agreed that no matter the nature of the relationship between the now separated parents, they wanted the best for their kids. None of them wanted their kids to miss out on anything in life just because, for whatever reason, their relationship did not work. The other common purpose I noted was that both payers and recipients were keen to see the detail of the task force’s recommendations and anxious about the future of child support. The biggest concern related to the calculation of child support payments. Both payers and payees expressed this concern to me. The now separated parents, their new partners and other concerned relatives, such as grandparents, expressed their deeply held concerns that the current method of calculation created a particularly onerous payment regime that seemed to be based on a presumption that the lives of the individuals involved do not change from the time immediately after the relationship fails. That is, it does not seem to accommodate the separated partners moving on with their lives. It does not seem to reflect that the separated parents may find a new partner, may have more children or may find themselves in circumstances not foreseen at the time of separation. It is from this presumption that their concerns about the calculation of payment levels arise. While sitting with individuals discussing their particular circumstances, the constant refrain I heard, from both men and women, I hasten to add, is that payments made using the current formula left them with very little to live on. In fact, this led to some people informing me that they felt they were in a better position not to work than to continue to work. Some had considered taking second jobs or doing additional overtime to assist with the payments, but the calculation of payments based on gross income rather than net income, in conjunction with the current tax regime, would not have allowed them to get ahead anyway so they felt that was hardly worth their while. While the payment levels were hurting them, putting pressure on new relationships and in some cases leaving the children of these new relationships at a disadvantage, none of them expressed to me a desire to stop the payments for the children of their former relationship. We face a difficult task in reaching a workable solution to the problems of the child support system. It would be easy to dismiss their concerns as grumbling, but it is not. I look forward to examining the findings of the ministerial task force. I know that I am not alone in this, many in my electorate and in the electorates of others are looking forward to it. I urge the government to expedite the process of the task force recommendations. Newcastle Knights of the Newcastle Herald is the headline ‘$2 million penalty’.

179,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.05 P.m.),"TodayI am not surprised that on the front pagesity, where indecent acts were performed on some women. As a result, one of the players, Dane Tilse-now an ex-player-was dismissed from the Newcastle Knights. Following that, the potential sponsor of the Newcastle Knights, Gizmondo-an American company who were to provide $700,000 per annum to the club-have withdrawn their support. Their logo will not be on the front of the club’s football jersey this year. This has left the Newcastle Knights in a precarious position. The team were fined some $100,000 because of their actions and are subject to a $100,000 suspended payment should anything else happen. As a person who supports the Newcastle Knights, I find their behaviour rather distasteful, particularly after the actions of the Canterbury Bulldogs last year when several players at Coffs Harbour were involved in what was alleged to be a gang rape of a female. This latest incident is more distasteful because this week, on 8 March, we celebrated International Women’s Day. One of the problems we have is that these young fellows, who have a bit of brilliant talent in football, in a lot of instances come from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds. They are brought into the high levels of league and, all of a sudden, they start to taste fame and fortune. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, can I say this and say it very clearly: no person, whether they be a footballer or ordinary member of the community-no matter what their role is in the community-should believe they have the liberty to do as they wish to any other member of the community, in particular women. I find this incident involving the Knights particularly distasteful. I can understand why the young lady involved in the incident has decided not to press on with the matter. To have to go through the process of court cases in pursuing these people would be very daunting, embarrassing and could cause long-term mental scarring. I witnessed this recently in relation to a case in Sydney, involving a young girl who was gang raped. The foolish actions of one of the jurors who decided on their own account to make an inspection of the crime scene led to some of the charges being appealed. The very severe sentences that were justifiably placed on the young men involved in the rape were overturned. The Crown wanted to conduct a new trial, but the young woman was not prepared to subject herself to another trial. I do not know what the footballers are like in other states; I only know that in New South Wales we have had two very distasteful incidents involving footballers who think they are above the law and the rest of the community. Because of the actions of not just Dane Tilse but also others who were there with him, the fans of the Newcastle Knights will suffer. The other hard-working, hard-playing and decent fine men who make up the Newcastle Knights will suffer. They are the only team in the NRL that will start the competition without a major sponsor. They will be the only team that runs onto the paddock without a name on their jersey. We have some great players in the Newcastle Knights, some very respected members of the community who know how to handle themselves and who have been able to handle the fame and fortune that has come their way. But, as I said, I find it extremely distasteful, particularly as a parent of a young daughter who enjoys her football, to see young men act as though they are above the law and bring great embarrassment upon the great game of football and our community, Newcastle. MAIN COMMITTEE Australian Institute of Sport Awards sporting field, as part of my responsibility as shadow minister for sport and recreation. I had the great pleasure yesterday to attend the Australian Institute of Sport athlete and coach awards at the AIS theatrette. It was a good occasion, where you saw the very cream of Australian sporting talent represented, from the organisational level to the coaching level to the athletes from both the Olympic team and the Paralympic team. You got a real sense of the esprit de corps of the athletes and the community that makes up that sporting group. You got a real feel that there is a sense of purpose and plenty of competition among all and sundry, both within and across sports, but also a good deal of camaraderie, which has been shown most strongly by the sorts of results that have been achieved in recent times. A selection of awards were made. A number of scholarships and educational and vocational awards were made to a range of particularly younger athletes, and to them go my congratulations. The main awards, I think, really showed just how well Australian sport has been going. The AIS Athlete of the Year Award was shared between Ryan Bailey and Petria Thomas. Members do not need to be reminded that Petria is a great swimmer who won some three gold medals at the Athens Olympics, in the 100 metres butterfly, the 4 x 100 metres freestyle relay and the 4 x 100 metres medley relay. Ryan, of course, is the most laconic and engaging cyclist who won gold in the sprint and in the keirin on the track in Athens, and was later named Cycling Australia’s 2004 Cyclist of the Year. Both of them have been great ambassadors for Australian sport and have achieved a lot over their careers and certainly, although I think Petria is retiring, it may well be that from Ryan his best is yet to come. There were other awards. The AIS Program of the Year went to diving. This is the second year in a row that diving has been given that award and it goes to show just what a great effort diving has been putting in over the last several years. At the Athens Olympics the divers produced their best effort ever, with one gold, one silver and six bronze medals. In particular, who could forget Chantelle Newbery, who became the first Australian diver in some 60 years to win Olympic gold in the 10-metre platform event. The AIS Junior Athlete of the Year was archer Tim Cuddihy. I am sure we all remember that Tim won a bronze medal at the Athens Olympics. It was an outstanding performance. I think it is true to say that it was a bit unexpected in terms of some of the public comment at the time, but Tim equalled the Olympic record for a 12-arrow match at 115, and broke the Olympic record for the highest cumulative score for a finals series, shooting a total of 340 over his three matches. Tim himself is only a kid and he has a long way to go, but his achievements so far have been phenomenal. The AIS Team of the Year was men’s hockey. Like many members, I am sure, I have watched the Kookaburras over the years and they have come close so many times in the Olympics. They previously had lost three Olympic finals. After making it to the semifinals and beyond in eight of their last nine appearances at the summer games since Tokyo in 1964, this is the first time they have gone that extra yard and won the gold medal. It was a fitting tribute to them to receive this particular award. The award for the Coach of the Year went to Martin Barras, from cycling. People will recall that the cycling team at the Athens Olympics was again the most successful on record, with an incredible five gold medals, two silver and two bronze. It is certain that Martin has played an important role in building the team and giving it the capacity to be able to do that. MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Adjournment

To all those responsible for the administration from the ASC and the AIS: congratulations on jobs well done. It certainly has been a premier time for Australian sport. The job is there now to try and maintain it, and I wish them all the very best in trying to achieve that in the future. Indian Ocean Tsunami property during the Boxing Day tsunami. As Secretary of the Sri Lankan Parliamentary Friendship GroupI visited Sri Lanka recently. I must say I was shocked at the devastation I saw throughout the country. On a good note, Australia’s aid was delivered very quickly. It was the sort of aid that was required, and when I spoke to a number of people in the parliament and in business they singled out Australia’s response as being appropriate and on time. Other countries, of course, sought to assist Sri Lanka. Some countries sent the wrong sort of help, but I want to congratulate the Australian High Commissioner, Dr Greg French, and the staff at the Australian High Commission for the excellent job that they have done in assisting the rebuilding of Sri Lanka and, indeed, in aiding those people who were so grievously affected by the tragedy. I was also impressed by the many private efforts being carried out by various groups in Australia and elsewhere raising money here to assist local communities in Sri Lanka. I think all of us get a bit concerned about the cost of administration of some of the large charities. I am not going to single any out, because they all do very good work, but clearly it costs a large amount of money to run a global charity and people, at times, are a little reluctant to contribute to what they largely see as being administration expenses. I saw quite a number of Australians, New Zealanders, Britons and people from Europe who had gone to Sri Lanka to assist in a private capacity. At Arugam Bay in particular, a place that was totally devastated, there were many overseas organisations raising money privately and working very hard on the ground to repair infrastructure. I assisted to reconstruct a shed. the wrong way and had to take it down again. As a person who can barely hammer in a nail, it was great to be able to help in that small way. Here in Australia, Petrea King, who has done wonderful work with cancer victims, has sent her son, Simon Vandervoort, to Sri Lanka, and they were endeavouring to assist the children of that country. In my own electorate of Fisher, while I was away there was a cocktail party held to rebuild Kumari, a village just 14 kilometres from Arugam Bay. I want to congratulate Raelene Boyle, Alfie and Janine Langer, Errol and Rohina Johnston-they live six months in Sri Lanka and six months on the Sunshine Coast, Rohina being Sri Lankan-Judy Wild, Sally Waterworth, Nick Bevacqua, Dr Ellen Mowatt, Jeni Hing, Julie Dickson, Jennifer Anderson and William Darby for sponsoring this cocktail party, which raised $150,000 towards the work of rebuilding that particular community.

I was also privileged to meet the Deputy Chairman of Committees of the parliament, the Secretary of the Sri Lanka-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Association and a number of ministers and former ministers as well as captains of industry who head the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. Universally, there was praise for Australia’s efforts. At times we do hear bad stories. For instance, there was an American organisation that decided to provide toilet paper for people in Arugam Bay. In that particular area toilet paper is not generally used. The organisation imported toilet paper from the United States at a cost of $US10 per roll and the children were using it as streamers. Happily, that is not happening with Australian charities. What they are doing is looking at where the needs are and making sure that the money gets through to the people. Australia’s response was excellent. As a government, we have done the right thing, and I thank the opposition for their support of the government’s initiatives in this area. Individually we have helped, and also importantly Christian and other community groups are assisting people in Sri Lanka. For instance, Anglican Aid Abroad in Brisbane is assisting the Anglican Sisters of St Margaret, who have an orphanage. The people to people links and the help which has been given will bring our two countries even closer together while making a very important material improvement to the future of the devastated areas of Sri Lanka. Economy strong for so long by so many so quickly be considered to have cracked with only a smallsome might even say tiny-interest rate rise of 25 basis points? Any economy that experiences a rate rise of only a quarter of a per cent should have an equally measured response, so why have business, industry, households and the majority of Australians been so affected by this rate rise, and why are they all so worried about its impact? Economic data released last week now reveals that the economy began to slow late last year and, with a further rate rise expected in the near future, the impact of higher interest rates could be more profound than understood by government. This is especially alarming for an administration that has failed to inoculate the economy against an overzealous election campaign spending spree of $66 billion in 20 weeks. John Howard and Peter Costello must have known for months, if not years, prior to the 2004 election that an economy based on rampant consumerism could not be sustained. But, instead of applying the brakes, the Treasurer and Prime Minister firmly jumped on the accelerator and fuelled consumption merely to purchase their way back into office. There is no doubt that the Australian economy has performed well in recent years. Australians have enjoyed 14 consecutive years of growth, which is largely the result of the reforms undertaken by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. This trend, however, will not continue if the current neglect of and disregard for the basic premise of economic sustainability is ignored by the Howard government. Economic data and reports are awash with details of squandered opportunity and complacency by John Howard and Peter Costello. The Reserve Bank of Australia, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the Business Council of Australia, the head of Treasury, government departments, industry leaders and many others have all warned about a stalling economy. In particular, they have all lamented the opportunities lost through a failure of the Howard govMAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment
184,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.20 P.m.),"How can an economy that has been heralded as soernment to reinvest in the economy and the nation’s infrastructure. Not only has the coalition lacked the vision and foresight needed to deal with a 21st century economy but also it has lacked the determination to deal with an emerging infrastructure crisis that has the potential to derail our productivity, an event from which we may need years to recover. The last 20 years were undoubtedly about economic reform and the next 20 years undoubtedly need to be about infrastructure reform and productivity gains. So whether it is the interest rate rise, the massive trade deficit, the massive skill shortages or the emerging infrastructure crisis, the economy is unravelling at an alarming pace. But of all of these the most worrying sign for the economy, and families, is the high levels of personal debt. Several reports now show that the average household debt servicing ratio is much higher than it was when interest rates hit 17 per cent in the 1990s. This is a figure that the government should pay close attention to, looking at it with serious concern. Families are now using more of their disposable income to service debt with interest rates at seven per cent than they did when interest rates were at 17 per cent. So badly has debt spiralled out of control that the smallest shift in interest rates in today’s terms represents a massive and unbearable pressure on consumers. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment fell sharply from February to March this year, with survey data gathered over the weekend showing a record 16.6 per cent fall in sentiment, the biggest fall ever recorded in the history of the survey. Among mortgagees there was an astonishing 20.2 per cent fall in confidence. This dramatic fall in sentiment can be explained by very high levels of household debt, which make families even more vulnerable to the smallest upward movements in interest rates. But the real crunch will not be felt most painfully by those with high mortgage payments. While those will certainly hurt them, the tipping point and the straw that will eventually break the camel’s back will be the added burden of extra payments on credit cards at rates of 20 per cent and more. The economy, like a sleeping giant awoken from its sleep, has reacted badly, and we may yet see the full impact of the Howard-Costello government’s economic mismanagement. While this government has crowed for many years about how credible its economic management is, how good it is and how it is the economic genius, we are now seeing the real picture. It is not painted by rhetoric from the Labor Party; it is confirmed by the Reserve Bank of Australia, by the head of Treasury, by government departments, by the IMF and by the OECD. These are the real credible voices on what is happening to our economy. I regret that this government is not yet capable of doing something about it. Iraq lives concerning ourselves with the small things like what to cook for dinner, getting the laundry done, dodging the traffic and getting to work on time. Occasionally we experience something that makes us stop and look at the bigger picture. I had one of those experiences some weeks ago as I observed Iraqi people taking their lives in their hands to vote. For so long they have been living under a feudal yoke, having absolutely no say in how their lives were run. They came out of their homes and risked death to cast their votes as a final rebuttal to the regime of Saddam Hussein and his acolytes. In some Western democracies people can vote but do not have to, so they often cannot be bothered to take part. In Australia we can vote and we have to vote-and thank God we can. We all hear complaints from people who resent having to do so. Yet in Iraq, in spite of all the threats, the bombings and the chaos-or maybe because MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
185,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.25 P.m.),"Usually we in the Western world go about our dailyof them-the people showed that they wanted to play a role in their country’s future. They wanted this democracy badly enough to risk their lives to vote in Iraq’s first free election. As one of those who voted here in this House to send troops into Iraq, I wanted to go and support the military and other personnel from my electorate to show them that I, too, was prepared to take some risks. But when I heard that 120 people were directly engaged in protecting just two Australian electoral officials, it seemed ludicrous to take even more people from the job at hand. In the end, I could not get into Iraq to observe the elections but observed proceedings at election booths outposted along the Jordan-Iraq border, from the Jordanian side. It made me proud knowing that Australia had helped make this election possible. And it made me proud that our military personnel, diplomats, election officials and many others had contributed to this success. In fact, people on the streets told me how they enjoyed the Australians’ professional but more relaxed attitude and appreciated their cultural sensitivity. We all know that this election is just a first step and there is a long way to go and that the system is not perfect. Australia’s own system has been operating for over 100 years and it is not perfect either. In the streets of JordanI went out and met many Iraqis who came there to vote and asked about their feelings. The people voting told me that they were joyful, thankful and happy to have the opportunity to vote and, more than that, they have now regained hope. Imagine what life without hope must have been like. They told me, too, about the wonderful things happening already in Iraq since the occupation: schools reopening and the huge building programs under way. Iraqi people are being trained to look after themselves. I spoke with many people and heard many things that I have not seen reported on TV or in the newspapers over the last year or two. I guess good news does not sell as well as bad news. We have been shown plenty of the horror of war but little or none of the happiness or hope that freedom from tyranny has brought. There is so much good news out there that Australians are not being told. I call upon the media to give all sides of the story for a change. Why is it that the good news is being censored? Why do we only hear of the bombs and deaths? Why did they not report such things as the wonderful international effort that was displayed to make these elections successful? These efforts deserve special commendation. My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his department have been just fantastic. They saw to my arrangements and gave me every opportunity to learn as much as possible in quite difficult circumstances. The department of foreign affairs personnel are extremely professional and knowledgeable, yet can communicate easily with people from all walks of life-from royalty to MPs like me with very different backgrounds. I record my thanks to the Australian Ambassador to Jordan, John Tileman, and his first secretary, Helen Smith, who ensured that I met the relevant people and could have my questions answered. They made a difficult trip much more worthwhile. I must also record my thanks to the men and women of HMAS Albatross from my electorate who, as usual, are providing excellent services to others on behalf of our country. I can certainly assure their families and the people of Gilmore that their efforts are not in vain. It is almost impossible to relate just how the Iraqi people feel about our Australian men and women, and I am immensely proud of them. I am humbled but grateful that we in this House, from all sides, are blessed with the honour of representing constituents in the best democracy in the world. MAIN COMMITTEE Collaborative and Innovative Responses for Youth at Risk Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (12.29 p.m.)-TodayI wish to support a fantastic program, the Collaborative and Innovative Responses for Youth at Risk program, otherwise known as CIRYAR. I know that the member for Hinkler, who is sitting opposite, has also been very supportive of this program. I may be calling on him again to help us out because, once again, the program is facing closure as its funding will run out towards the middle of this year. It provides a service to young people and their families who are dealing with issues of youth suicide and self-harm. CIRYAR was started in 2003 as a 12-month pilot program funded by the Department of Family and Community Services. In my remarks today I should say that it has had a bit of a chequered history with the federal government. The federal government provided the initial funding, which was great, but, because it was only a 12-month pilot program, the funding finished just when the program had established itself and established its significance in providing services to a really crucial and distinct group of people in the Rockhampton community. Getting the program refunded by the government has been an ongoing battle ever since. When CIRYAR started out, its aim was to establish a service that provides professional support to young people and their families with complex mental health and/or social isolation issues or support needs. There is no doubt that the team at CIRYAR have achieved all of that and more. This program has been embraced by the community of Rockhampton because it has helped so many of our young people and their families who knew that it was literally a lifeline that they clung to when they reached crisis point. The program originated in response to community concerns about urgent and serious gaps in health, education and welfare services for young people with mental illness or significant mental health issues. It is now also recognised as filling a significant gap by providing support to the many young people who do not have any diagnosed mental health problem but who are finding it difficult to cope with the pressures that come with being a teenager-bullying, peer pressure, relationships, family conflict and stress associated with their academic performance. through a range of responses, including crisis intervention and activities to build resilience in young people and greater capacity in the broader community to understand and help young people when they are struggling. There are things like crisis management, personal support, counselling and psychotherapy, education about mental health and key youth issues, personal growth and skills development opportunities, collaborative case management, and information, advocacy and referral services for young people. As I said, CIRYAR has been embraced by our local community in a way I have never seen before. It is something that the Rockhampton community can be very proud of. When the pilot funding ran out at the end of 2003, the community rallied around at all levels to fight to keep the program going. In the circumstances, how could we not do that? For some families, it was what was keeping their kids going. A campaign run primarily by one of our local radio stations raised $70,000 from the community to help keep the program going, and other media outlets have also gotten involved. There is a business group or a group of community and business leaders who got together and MAIN COMMITTEE who meet regularly to see how they can support CIRYAR. And, of course, those involved in youth work in our community are constantly out there supporting CIRYAR and reinforcing the fact that it plays a very significant role in filling a gap in services for young people who may not have a recognised mental health disorder but who nonetheless need that extra help to cope with life. I have here a pile of testimonials and letters of support. It is as long as your arm. Many are from government agencies-both Commonwealth and state government agencies-who refer young people to CIRYAR for help. There is also a letter from the mother of a young girl. time is coming once again for CIRYAR. We have to get behind it. The federal government needs to play its role in keeping this important service going for the young people of Rockhampton. (Time expired) Royal Visit Technical College Infrastructure Development Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (12.35 p.m.)-Last night I had the delightful pleasure of meeting the Danish royal couple, Princess Mary and Prince Frederik. It was a personal pleasure. My brother quite frequently sees me meeting all these wonderful people in the media coverage or in the media clippings that my mother sends him. As an Australian living in Denmark, he is married to a Danish citizen and is raising his three children as Danes-I suppose he did what Princess Mary has done but he did it 15 years ago. When he had the opportunity, and knowing the role that I play in Australian society, he sent me an email from Denmark with a photo of him and Princess Mary together. SoI am going to take great delight in sending back to yet another Australian abroad the news that the royal couple have been welcomed very warmly over here, as warmly as Richard has been welcomed into Denmark. I have three older brothers, so I suppose I had more of a tomboy upbringing, but I do have a five-year old princess. She is very pretty in pink and she dreams of being a princess. It is quite delightful that I now do not have to disabuse her of her dream and tell her that as an Australian she is never going to be a princess! I can quite honestly say, ‘Keep dreaming, my dear; you can carry on wearing that tiara and carrying your pretty wand.’ The royal couple have had an extraordinarily successful visit. As my colleague reminded me, I am a republican, but on this occasion it was very sweet to see a couple in love. I would also like to make a report on Penrith’s progress towards our tender for a technical college, which will increase the number of young people completing trades in my area. My area has a high number of tradespeople. It has a highly motivated parental work force that makes sure that kids get through those difficult first and second years of study before they start earning the income that makes it easier for them to attend to various aspects of working in trades. We have a tremendous amount of support from tradesmen and tradeswomen in our area for that technical college. One aspect of the constraints facing construction in Australia at the moment is the escalation in raw material costs. We also have record low unemployment levels, which makes it very hard to find unskilled labour as well as skilled labour. There are shortages of labour right across Western Sydney. We also need to be doing more to make child MAIN COMMITTEE care available, to bring females into the work force, to retain people longer and all those sorts of issues in the lead-up to the next budget. Those issues really rely on town planning being done properly so that the built environment in which women are trying to manage a family, schooling and child-care options as well as their work actually functions. A critical part of that infrastructure will be the Army land in north Penrith. That is an area that could provide over 5,000 jobs and possibly more in the long term and would allow females to work close to home and create some balance between raising their family, obligations with schooling, after school work within the home and paid employment. That positioning of jobs close to the people who we want to retain in the work force is critical to addressing some of these skills shortages. Certainly, if you add one or two hours commuting time, I think most mothers in a single income, single parent family-unless income is critical-will decline that option because it is preferable to be working closer to home. We need to put in infrastructure such as extending the M2. There are a radical number of houses being constructed in the Penrith Lakes area and between Bligh Park and Werrington. An enormous number of houses are coming into existence. Over the long term we need to extend the M2 from the Western Sydney orbital interchange in the area of my colleague from Blacktown right out to the Northern Road and make it part of that major infrastructure that links Sydney. With these ideas in mind I think we can continue with some of the more realistic dreams that young Australian women have. (Time expired) Indian Ocean Tsunami speak on the tsunami and the devastation which swept across many countries-Burma, the Seychelles, the Maldives, Somalia, Malaysia, Thailand, southern India, Sri Lanka and, in particular, Indonesia. The final death toll was 300,000, including 230,000 in Aceh, Indonesia. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced; in Aceh, the figure is around 400,000. These statistics do not convey the reality of the extent of loss and suffering that will go on for some time. Families have lost husbands, wives, children and grandparents. The tsunami has had a devastating impact. I have previously complimented the government on its response to the tsunami. I am aware that an appropriation bill dealing with financial assistance has gone through the House and there has been debate on a motion on the tsunami disaster, but I am happy to place on the record again my support for the government’s actions in response to the tsunami. I have also mentioned that the fine work and generosity of the Australian government on behalf of all of us has only been exceeded by the generosity of the Australian people: men, women and children-and I especially compliment the children. Australians have donated more than $190 million to 29 different aid agencies that are signatories to the Australian Council for International Development Code of Conduct. The tsunami has swept our concern for mankind to the fore. We have made every effort to preserve and perpetuate it. There is no doubt that on 16 January, the day that we officially commemorated the tsunami, people from around the world understood that when humanity is to the fore it will strike a common chord in people in Australia, in Indonesia and in every other country in the world. This has been such an exceptional event that we should not lose that sense of humanity and that sense of caring for one another. It is for that reason that I propose to write to the Prime MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Adjournment

January 16 should be marked as a national day of giving for humanity, a day for us to remember the victims of all disasters, natural and man-made. I am conscious that around that time we had the Adelaide bushfires. A day of giving would be a reminder of the generosity of spirit that we are capable of as ordinary people, whether parents or children. Out of the tsunami, out of the government’s response and out of the response of individual people of Australia much good has come; there has been great generosity. Let us not lose that spirit when we are faced with another tragedy or another disaster. Let us have another day of giving, 16 January, so that people can respond and generously donate to alleviate the suffering and poverty of others on this planet. We are all God’s children on the planet, whether we are black, brown, brindle or white and whether we are Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu or whatever-and 16 January ought to be a day for remembering that. It ought to be a day when we reach out, in the global village, and give a dollar or two to help someone else. Science Meets Parliament Day Indoor Air Pollution the very successful program Science Meets Parliament. Certainly it is a great opportunity for members of parliament to meet with scientists and members of the scientific community, and I certainly welcomed the opportunity during the week to meet with Len Ferrari, a scientist from my electorate; Marianne Johnson, who is from the Victorian Institute for Chemical Sciences; and Professor Andrew Bolton, from the University of New England, who has done a lot of great work in relation to Rivercare. Rivercare and the issues of the marine and riparian environments on the coast are vitally important because of the great pressures that are placed upon that environment by very rapid development. I think all members of this House would have appreciated the opportunity to meet with the many highly qualified members of the science community who made their time available to communicate to us the many things that science is achieving and the needs of science within our community today. As a nation we cannot put enough emphasis on the importance of science and I think that as a nation we are going to derive great benefits from science. SoI would like to commend the Science Meets Parliament program specifically. I think it is a great initiative and one that should be strongly supported in the future. From the interviews that I had with these scientists one point of particular interest to me was the study that Mr Ferrari conducted in partnership with Mr Frank Fleer, Ted Pender and Mark Tulau. That study focused on the issue of indoor air pollution. It was a study conducted in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra and it was done in some 116 homes and looked at the impact of the polluting effect of non-flued gas heaters. We focus very much in this country on outdoor air quality standards, but we have had a much lesser focus on the issue of indoor air quality. It was very interesting to note that this study concentrated on the presence of chemicals such as nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and formaldehyde and took into account a whole range of issues such as the outside air conditions, in addition to the levels of rates of ventilation that existed in the homes involved. It took into account very old homes, some of them around 100 years old, right up to more modern homes. It covered a range of heating appliances, both old and new designs. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Ciryar Was Able To Change That Girl S Life And Give Her Some Hope For The Future Crunch
187,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (12.45 P.m.),"I rise in the Main Committee to speak onThe findings of this report really are quite disturbing. Let us take nitrogen dioxide, for instance. When one looks at the typical types of concentrations that were recorded in the outside air-and I would like to quote a couple here-one finds that the maximum concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in New South Wales are around 86 parts per billion. But when one looks at the research one finds that the level of nitrogen dioxide in an indoor situation where these heaters were present was some 930 parts per billion, over 10 times the concentrations of the pollutants existent in the outside air. The study found, and its conclusions were disturbing, that the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide were 10 times higher than in the outside air and that these levels are far above World Health Organisation recommendations. The study also found that there were significant levels of other pollutants in the air. So it is a cause for great concern that we have been focusing very much on outside air quality, yet we have this potential problem with the impact of non-flued gas heaters on inside air quality. In fact, the Western Australian health minister, Jim McGinty, said that the state government considers the levels of indoor pollution to be ‘a serious health risk’. That is most interesting. In many of our schools we have non-flued gas heaters, and one of the things that nitrogen dioxide does is cause breathing difficulties. It has been identified as a potential source of asthmatic complaints in young children. We have many school buildings around our country being warmed by non-flued gas heaters. This study shows that there is a very significant rise in the presence of pollutants in the air through non-flued heaters, some 10 times that being encountered in normal air conditions. I think it is something that we need to look at very carefully. The Clean Air Society of Australia and New Zealand is very focused on this matter and has issued a number of press releases. We as a government should be mindful that we focus not only on outside air quality but also on indoor air quality as a very important determinant of health. Southern Family Life knowledge the work of a wonderful organisation in my electorate, Southern Family Life. I would like to highlight the excellent work they are doing in two programs in particular-a program called Creating Capable Communities and another, the Youthworx@Station Road program. For 30 years Southern Family Life have been working with the families in my local bayside community who are disadvantaged and at risk. They are an organisation totally committed to supporting families and the local community. The Creating Capable Communities program is based in the public housing estates and works with the residents to build relationships, friendships and supporting networks to foster a positive community atmosphere. I have met many of the participants-men, women and children-and the sense of community that is being developed is really special. Approximately 1,200 families reside in the public housing estates in and around my electorate. Many of these families and communities in the past have, to a greater or lesser extent, suffered from social isolation, financial disadvantage, mental health issues, violence and alcohol and drug use. Many of them have come from overseas-immigrants who do not have the confidence and the skills to interact with their fellow residents in these housing estates. It is a very sad and lonely situation for many of these people. Through social activities, such as playgroups and barbecues, and peer support groups, the Creating Capable Communities project is working on building a community environment where people can pull together and MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Ciryar Was Able To Change That Girl S Life And Give Her Some Hope For The Future Crunch
188,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (12.50 P.m.),"I am privileged to have this opportunity today to accontribute to their community, so they feel like a community and are there to help and support each other. One of the several other programs run by Southern Family Life that I would like to commend is the Youthworx@Station Road program. Youthworx@Station Road is a retro and recycled clothing store established in early 2003. The shop provides young people with an eight-week opportunity to gain some work experience, which is vital to their being able to go on to find full-time work. The participants receive free on-the-job training in customer service and retail skills, free training in modules of the Certificate 11 in Retail Operations, personal coaching and mentoring and assistance with a job search. The greatest barrier for many of these kids in finding work is the lack of previous work experience, lack of a formal resume and no professional references. The Youthworx program gives young people an opportunity to gain some professional work experience and the step up they need to go on to find further work in the retail and other sectors. It is a wonderful thing to see these young people grow in confidence and self-esteem as a result of this program. It is a life-shaping experience. I have enormous admiration for those good and committed people who are making this happen at Southern Family Life. This organisation, Southern Family Life, has demonstrated over the past 30 years an extraordinary commitment to the bayside community. I have highlighted just two of its programs, but there are many more. I commend Southern Family Life to the House and thank the people involved in it, particularly Southern Family Life’s CEO, Jo Cavanagh, for their extraordinary commitment to our community.

194,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister Representing The Minister For Justice And Customs, In","the honourable member’s question: (a) the total actual administered expenses for the 2003-2004 reporting period were $23,123,000. (b) The nature of each administered expense was: (1) Receivables provision for doubtful debts $17,406,000 (2) Debts written off $5,469,000 (3) Contribution to World Customs Organisation $248,000 (c) There were no amounts allocated in the 2003-2004 budget for provision for doubtful debts nor debts written off. These expenses reflect a change in policy developed in consultation with the ANAO regarding the recognition and provisioning for prosecutions and fines. The World Customs Organisation was allocated $280,000 in the 2003-2004 budget; the final payment was influenced by prevailing foreign exchange rates. International Air Passengers (Question No. 451) writing, on 8 February 2005: (1) When did the Australian Customs Service (ACS) review the assumption of a ten minute delay between aircraft arrival and the time passengers arrive at the ECP queue for calculating the facilitation rate of international air passengers in Australian airports. (2) Will the Minister provide details of the formula and explain how it is used to calculate the facilitation rate. (3) Is the ACS able to apply the formula to the international air passengers facilitation rates reported in its report for 2003-2004; if not, why not; if so, what are the results of applying the formula. the honourable member’s question: (1) Customs undertook a review of the formula for calculating the facilitation rate in late 2003. The decision to change the calculation formula was made in April 2004. (2) The facilitation standard requires that 95% of arriving passengers will be processed through the Entry Control Point (ECP) within 30 minutes of joining the ECP queue. The facilitation rate is calculated from: (a) the “chocks” time of each arriving aircraft (b) a “pre-queue” time (c) the time each passenger gets processed through the ECP The pre-queue time varies between airports and takes account of the delay from aircraft arrival time to when passengers join the ECP queue. This pre-queue time is the sum of median times taken for travellers to disembark the aircraft and to walk or bus to the ECP queuing area. The table below shows the median pre-queue times for passengers for each major international airport.
