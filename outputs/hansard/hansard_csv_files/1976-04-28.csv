One of the points which I group has been asked what it thinks ought to be wish to raise is why the Attorney-General has done. been removed from the focal point of the legislation. To that extent my remarks will become a How impartial are members of this group? httle relevant to what the Minister might be worOne is a solicitor.

It is not bad having a relative in the these matters, which in our view should be dealt business. This is perhaps one of the serious matwith on an impartial basis, into an area where ters that we want to raise. The firm has taken an there can definitely be a conflict of interests. We active interest in a number of matters. Its memwill set out to show it a httle later. Of course there bers are legal men. They are entitled to put their is every good reason why there should be a Mincase. In most cases they are acting for people ister interested in consumer protection and busiwho want a clearance or an authorisation ness affairs, but there is an equally valid reason granted. They are acting for big business. Very why, when there is a conflict of interest, the matseldom do they act for the small consumer. That ter should be determined by a commission or a signals that something is amiss in the review of tribunal. There would be no suggestion of this Act. In my view it would have been quite influence. There would be no suggestion that the proper and fair, and certainly impartial, to leave Minister had a discretion which he might deign it to the Trade Practices Commission to report to use. Let me take up the honourable member whether the Act ought to be reviewed. There cerfor Higgins on some of his accusations, particutainly would have been an impartial result.

This is not from the jurisdiction of the Attorney-General. unique legislation. There is equivalent legislation in most other democratic countries. If they are progressive they must have some form of control Let us look at the structure of the Bill and what over corporate affairs and business activities. we think about it. As the honourable member for There is similar legislation in countries such as Port Adelaide( Mr Young) said, we have no Canada, Sweden, France and Germany. We had basic objection to this legislation because, in the a lot of trouble getting effective trade practices main, it is something that a Labor government legislation introduced in Australia. Most of the would have introduced as an improvement. trouble came from the then Opposition. The When it comes to the removal of the AttorneyPrices Justification Tribunal met similar oppoGeneral from the section, we are rather sition. At the last Federal election a plank of the interested why so much weight has been given to present Government's platform was to do away the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs with the Tribunal. So we have this sort of attack in all aspects of restrictive trade practices. Clearon the consumer or the ordinary lay citizen. This ances, mergers and all matters which affect comlegislation should have been available to him petition and public interest are matters which years ago. interest us. In a very short space of time there will be a review of the Trade Practices Act. The We are now suspicious of the reason for this review group will be established immediately sudden review by people who we would submit, and will report to the Minister on a number of have no close affiliation with the day to day pubmatters. Section 28 (1) (b) of the Trade Practices lic, the consumer or the free enterprise system, Act states that the Trade Practices Commission which in its strictest sense, should be free to trade can examine critically and report to the for the benefit of the consumer. We are closely Attorney-General on the laws in force in moving into the area of the multinationals and Austraha relating to the protection of consumers their influences. When one looks at the group and in respea of matters referred to the Comthat is reviewing this legislation one cannot find mission by the Attorney-General being matters anybody effectively representing the trade union with respect to which the Parliament has power movement, the consumer or the small businessto make laws. But the Commission is completely man. I will not name the members of the group. ignored. It is not even asked to make any suggesThe Minister knows them well. It is on that basis tions.

This proposed amendment will not help the Minister, is a vastly different approach to the one which it will not help the ParUament and it wtil not help was adopted by the previous Government.
