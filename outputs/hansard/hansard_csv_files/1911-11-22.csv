However, the lesson to be derived from past failures in this connection-the inevitable lesson that easy revenues derivable from banking are only a mirage by which ignorant State financiers have been led to national ruin-ha s already been dealt with fairly full y by honourable members on this side of the House. address myself to the principles underlying the measure before us. A House of this kind should be prepared sphere without undue fear, if it can be conclusively shown that this new agency of government will serve some useful Government purpose. were to find some special profit accruing to the Government through a Government Bank handling the conversion, renewal, controlling currency, that it would be the duty of the House to proceed to the earnest discussion of the measure without being unduly timorous because of the failures and errors of bygone centuries. But I do not see in the measure before us any such proposal. I do not see a single sign, in either the B ill or the Prime Minister's speech that this measure is proposed to facilitate some Government purpose^of the character referred to. There is no sign that this proposed' bank will facilitate the conversion, flotation or renewal of loans. In fact, if we carefully examine the Bil l and its antecedents, we see that that is not the intention of the Government or the intention of the B ill . Further, we know that currency which ought properly to be handled by a bank-sinc e currency is largely a matter of supply and demand, and must be dealt with in elastic ways-is BILL. debarred from the comprehension oi"" this measure under one of the clauses. Consequently Ave have to look at this proposal purely as a money-making onea proposal way, the difficulties of which, I am afraid, are not thoroughly realized by Ministers. I think that the Government generally have an idea that there is money in banking; and where there is money they, of course, desire the State to share. That Ministers were not the originators of this proposal is transparent to anybody who cares to examine even casually the recent political history of Australia in this connection. If honourable members will go back to the Brisbane Conference of three years ago, they will find that this bank owes its origin to a general idea, prevalent in that Conference, that a Government bank might assist an arrangement of the general finances of the Australian people-the finances as between Commonwealth and States, and' I propose briefly to especially as affecting the transfer of debts from the States to the Commonwealth. I find, according to the Brisbane Worker of 18th July, 1908-and I think that in the to travel into this new Brisbane Worker the best report of the Conference is to be found-that this question was introduced at the Conference by the present Minister of Home Affairs, whoI f , for instance, we is reported as having said that "" he wanted a banking system included in any financial arrangement which the Conference might approve for the Commonwealth and; and flotation of loans, or States.""

35,Mr Roberts,The answers to the,16,Fisher
36,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [2.45],"I dobanking concern as between the Commonwealth and the States. As reported in the Brisbane Worker, we find that it was to be a bank of deposit, issue, exchange, and reserve, with a capital of Â£1,200,000, of which not less than ,Â£600,000 should be held by the Commonwealth, and not more than Â£100,000 by any State in the Australian Commonwealth. His idea, I under"" stand, was that not only in regard to the conversion of loans and such operations, but also in the handling of the ordinary -Savings Banks business of the various States, the States would feel that they themselves had some peculiar interest in the new undertaking, in the management of which they would have some voice. That proposal on the part of the present Minister -of Home Affairs was resisted by the late Mr Batchelor and Senator Lynch, who proposed that the subject of banking, being so important in itself, be referred to .a Committee entirely apart from the subjects of State finance and borrowing. That amendment was lost, and the original motion moved by the present Minister of Home Affairs was referred to the Finance Committee of that Conference. ing to the following issue of the Brisbane Worker, Mr Holman, one of the leaders -of the Labour movement in New South Wales, and one of the most brilliant men in that movement throughout Australia, introduced this subject again to the notice -of the Conference. It was part and parcel of a whole series of financial proposals, the first of which readThat Conference approves the general outlines of Mr King O'Malley's scheme relating 'to the establishment of a National bank. That bank, as I have pointed out, was to be upon co-operative lines. In the course -of the debate which followed, Mr Watson, -a former Prime Minister of Australia, and I think it will be admitted, a prominent leader of the Labour movement to-day, said that he was in agreement with the -principle of Mr King O'Malley's scheme for a Commonwealth National bank. Wales, who occupies to-day a position which entitles weight to be given to his words, saidHe felt that the Labour movement was under a lasting debt of gratitude to Mr O'Malley. . . . . -a National bank, and Mr O'Malley had put the machinery and operation of it in a concrete form. ""ThenI find that the scheme as a wholea -scheme for a co-operative State and Commonwealth Bank combined, to deal with banking facilities affecting directly Government agencies-wa s then approved by the Conference. That is the history of these proposals, as originated at the Conference, when this scheme for a Government bank was placed upon the fighting platform of the Labour party. The proposal now before us, however, has departed fundamentally from that conception. The scheme now before us is the very antithesis of that adopted by the Brisbane Conference. This proposal, to use almost the Prime Minister's own words, is one to make money. It has nothing to do with the government of the country; and therefore, as far as possible, must be divorced from political control. This is a scheme merely to add to the various money-making banks throughout Australia, and not to carry out the present Minister of Home Affairs' broad conception which was submitted to, and carried by, the Brisbane Conference three years ago. I do not wish, however, to enter into a discussion of the comparative merits of the two proposals. I am satisfied that my honorAccordable friends opposite, who, by the very constitution of their party, have to pay considerable attention to the will of their party outside this Parliament, as expressed in these periodic Conferences, would not have departed from the 'instructions of the Brisbane Conference unless they had had very good grounds for doing so. I do not know what' their grounds were. They keep their secrets remarkably well; but the fact remains that they have thrown overboard that Conference, which, apparently, was almost unanimous, and have, for some reason unknown to the Opposition-and , I presume, unknown also to the Conference-departe d from the proposals which they had previously accepted, and which formed the basis of the particular mandate which they claim to have from, the people in this connection. over, not only the Brisbane Conference, but their own manifesto. honourable member.

W'e are now confronted with the duty of analyzing this measure, and of ascertaining whether it is designed in the best way to arrive at its alleged object. Its alleged object is to find money, out of banking, for the Commonwealth. It is proposed to do that irÂ» two ways : First of all, by entering into competition for private banking business in the Australian Commonwealth and without it ; and secondly, by absorbing, eventually, the State Savings Banks throughout Australia. This bank, being started to make money, we will find, is started upon borrowed capital, despite the fact that we have ""heard a lot from honourable members opposite about the iniquity of not be the first time they have borrowed. We know that they have succeeded in borrowing from the Australian public some Â£10,000,000 without interest-that is to say, to the extent of the note issue now cirthe Commonwealth is responsible for the culating in Australia. For that issue, of course, golden sovereigns have been given by the public, and portion of that shortdated loan of Â£10,000,000 has already been used for revenue purposes. My honourable friends opposite have always denounced borrowing, even for reproductive works. vicious, mischievous, dangerous, and must be discontinued. the very first action taken by the Prime are placed on exactly the same basis as Minister, who can so clearly express the prothe general trading business to be carried fundity of his knowledge upon this subject, on by the bank as a whole, and are there is to borrow from the Australian publicfore subjected to the same risks. who are to be gulled into the belief that they have given nothing in exchange for the notes they are handling some two matters ought to be divorced.

In this Bill, able member, it is merely bookkeeping if however, diey are actually borrowing to you throw together two different sides of a. start a bank which is to incur obligations and liabilities over which Parliament will have little, ' if any, control. They have not only sunk the issue of non-borrowing for reproductive works, but have actually borrowed for revenue purposes, and are borrowing now to start a trading venture. Some of the money to start tliis bank is to be borrowed at interest by means of debentures, but in addition a sum for incidental expenses, which may be Â£50,000 or Â£5,000,000, can be advanced without interest by the Treasurer. If , for instance, the bank cares to start expensive buildings in the various capitals, the Bill gives authority to the Treasurer to advance without interest the money required for that purpose. The Bill, therefore, provides for borrowing with interest, and without inborrowing. This, however, will terest, to start what is purely a trading venture. An interesting feature in connection with the financing of the bank is that, while the Government loftily declare that operations of the bank, a special provision makes only the bank suable! That is a delightful Gilbertian proposal which should commend itself to the close attention of all those who are faced with the desirability of lending the Government bank money.

One of the curious clauses of the Bill is that which says that "" The principal and interest due in respect of any -debenture issued by the bank in pursuance of this Act is guaranteed by the Commonwealth by this Act, and the Consolidated Revenue Fund is hereby appropriated for the purpose of this section."" The bank is alleged to be placed under the control of an expert, the Governor of the bank.

The bank should have been started on an entirely different basis. It should have been started with a view to help the Commonwealth in connection with the debt problem of Australia.

If you fail, it does not matter, because the taxpayers are behind the bank."" we should do is to give him as much as may be necessary to start the bank, even if Â£2,00 0 , 0 0 0 be required. itself contains evidence that it is not thought that Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 will be sufficient.

This is not business, or common-sense finance, but it is the surest way to .engender dissatisfaction in the management, and to sow the seeds of future disaster. I a second-reading speech, but have merely emphasized a few points which have occurred to me in studying the measure. We shall lay a great burden on the Australian people if we do not provide better safeguards against political interference, and better guarantees for straightforwardly financing this proposal. financing not straightforward? Commonwealth raises debentures to the extent of Â£ r , 0 0 0 , c o o . wealth stands behind the bank, though it I shall not canvass indiis not suable for the Â£1,000,000 . The bank is not given the Â£1,000,00 0 and told that it is its capital, and that the bank must be responsible for making profits on it. On the contrary, a sort of placard To of no legal value is held up to the bank in the Bil l to the effect that nobody is capable of suing the Commonwealth for a debt of hope, too, that we shall not the bank; but if the Â£1,000,00 0 is wasted,, the Treasurer is behind the bank. What is the use of this inducement to the bank The bank not to be as active in making profits as it otherwise would be? Then, again, the Were Government have not carefully thought out beforehand what money will be required for initial expenses and contingencies, .as an ordinary business man would do-indeed , as a tyro at the game would do. The Prime Minister, because he is handling public funds, and has not to risk the money of honourable members individually, is satisfied to leave all to chance, and to ask the House to present him with a blank cheque to be handed over when he and the Governor of the bank may decide. I do not think that What a successful company has ever been floated in that way. The Bill Treasurer to provide for the preliminary expenses. liminary expenses not thought out?

If the manager, whoever lie may be, contemplated establishing branches in Sydney and Melbourne, or, perhaps, in five capitals, he might ask the Treasurer for Â£500,000 to meet the preliminary expenses; and the Treasurer might not be willing to advance this sum, but offer Â£5,000 or Â£10,000. Under such circumstances, it would be only human nature on the part of the manager to think that he had taken over control, not exactly under false pretences, but under a misapprehension ; and he would go on his way with the idea that, if the bank failed, it would not be his fault, because he had not been given all the supplies he had been led to expect under the Bill.

And no rate of interest isfixed1 member is now discussing matters which ought to be discussed in Committee. Mr Speaker, but I refer to them at the invitation of the Prime Minister. The general principle I am advocating, without reference to any particular clause, is that when we start a business, we should be able to put the whole debt of the business in the ledger, so that the manager, before he takes over the responsibility, may know exactly how far he is indebted, and what it is necessary for him to do in order to make profits. That is not being done. The financing is clumsy and dimcult, and bound to lead to muddle of a serious nature. Is it the intention of the Prime Minister to enter into the sphere of the States with regard to lending money to farmers ? In New South Wales there is an Advances to Settlers Board, and in Victoria the Savings Bank lends money on the Credit Foncier system, while there are similar agencies in, I believe, all the other States. According to Knibbs, the total sum advanced to farmers up to 1910 was Â£7,000,000, while the balance due is just short of Â£4,000,000. When advances are made for a special purpose at a low rate of interest, the most rigid supervision is required in order that the generosity of the State may not be abused. If there are two competitors for the business, the opportunity for rigid supervision is decreased by half. When a State is acting within Clause 10 proits own borders, with no competitor, it can follow up every transaction with success; but if the Commonwealth enters into the States' sphere, there will arise out of the competition between State and Commonwealth -to appear the more generous, some very serious losses which will ultimately materially affect the Australian people. It is worthwhile at the present juncture to consider whether we ought not to keep out of this sphere in order to prevent The Prime Minister, in introducing the Bill, said that if the Savings be to the profit of the Savings Bank depositors.

If we start advancing money on land, the margin of security to-day may be entirely wiped out to-morrow through no fault of our own, but owing solely to general depression. many years of prosperity, we have every phase of property at almost boom values. If we were to lend now on a basis of even 60 per cent., the 40 per cent, margin might, after a few years of drought, or some great external trouble, entirely disand the methods we adopt in makappear. Irish blight affected the value of potato lands ? These depressions are constantly occurring, and cannot always be guarded against. We can, however, endeavour, as far as in us lies, to protect Savings Bank depositors from being subject to the general risks of fluctuating values. The Savings Bank business ought to be on the safest possible basis, and to that end, it ought to be a separate concern. I suggest that the Savings Bank business might be conducted on a co-operative basis by the States and the Commonwealth, which would leave depositors with the same guarantee of security that they enjoy under the State organizations to-day. If , however, the Savings Bank business is taken into the general organization, which is trading in its character, and must, to trade successfully, take some risk, we shall expose the depositors to some danger, which, in view of their special circumstances, they ought not to be asked to face. I apologize to honourable members for occupying more time than I intended, but, at any rate, I have had the merit of endeavouring to avoid ancient history in considering this measure. honourable member for Wentworth, after his customary supercilious references to Ministerial supporters, proceeded to teach us the limitations of the measure. He set out by stating that no provision was made in regard to the State debts, and, at the same time, he criticised the method proposed in order to put the Bank, in a small way, on its feet. The honourable member desires the Government to do very "" big things "" all at once; yet he criticises the methods they have adopted in order to finance the scheme at all, and do little things. It is apparent that there can be no other way of financing it ; yet we are told that we ought to do something that would enable us to take over the State debts. If there is one feature of this Bill which should appeal more than any other to hon. orable members, it is its modesty. It does In the present year, after not set out to achieve wonders. It is simply the beginning of a long-contemplated movement on the part of those who profess to be in the vanguard of politics. We must depart to some extent from precedent if we are to make any advance, ing that advance must, of course, be open to fair criticism. It seems to me, however, that, all things considered, the forward step attempted by means of this Bill is a fairly careful one'. The honourable member for Wentworth said that the Bill made no provision with regard to the transfer of the State debts. My contention is that the only provision possible in existing circumstances has been made. Clause 30 provides thatThe net profits derived by the bank shall be dealt with as follows :[a) one-half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to be called the bank reserve f u n d ; and (4) the other half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to be called the redemption fund. It sets forth, further, that when that redemption fund shall be strong enough to cover the debentures and the stock issued, any surplus may be applied to the redemption of any Commonwealth debts or State debts taken over by the Commonwealth. No further provision could be made at this juncture but that when the bank is on a thoroughly sound footing, we may turn our attention to State and Commonwealth debts, and apply any surplus over liabilities to their redemption. That, I think, is a fairly discreet proposition, and indicates considerable foresight in attempting to place the bank on a proper basis. The honourable member for Wentworth further urged that this bank should be free from political control. He has no objection, apparently, to the Government financing a private institution; he has no objection to a national bank per se. He desires an institution that shall bear the name of a national bank; but seemingly he wants that national bank to be entirely controlled by private individuals. Once, however, we associate a bank with the nation, some control must be exercised over it by the nation.",22,Fisher

107,Mr Kelly,That is a case in point.,23,Fisher
108,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [3.38],"TheI admit that the extent to which we should reserve control by the nation is a delicate one; but it seems to me to be preposterous to advocate the subsidizing of a bank which shall be called a national bank, and at the same time to urge that no control over it shall be exercised by the nation. The honourable member suggested that the gentleman placed in charge of this institution might "" play u p "" with the funds and disappear, leaving us all lamenting. He would not do this, I presume, if he were entirely free from political control ? If he were entirely cut off from any supervision on the part of the representatives of the nation there would, of course, be no danger! But, apparently, there is great danger of such a thing occurring when the bank is brought under the purview of the officials of the nation. That is a somewhat incongruous position to take up. If there is any danger in this regard, it must be minimized by placing the bank under the general supervision of the Auditor-General and the Treasurer of the Commonwealtli. If we retain any control over the bank, we cannot have less than that for which the Bill provides. precluded from dealing with the bank, 1 am quite prepared to agree to the suggested exclusion, if it is likely to commend the institution to the public. Perhaps it would be a wise provision to insert in the B ill ; but there could be no objecton to our financial operations which must certainly depositing our small savings with the Savings Bank, branch. savings."" Mr ^CARR -The honourable member's poverty is not so apparent as he would have us believe. As to clause io, to which the honourable member for Wentworth took exception on the ground that it implies a continuous drain upon the revenue, I admit there is some room for criticism. It may possibly be necessary for the Treasurer to make advances to the bank, but we shall, have to rely on the discretion of those in power to do the right thing. Every responsible Government has power to do outrageous things, but we rely on the fact that men in responsible positions are invariably disposed to walk warily. Knowing that public attention is focussed on them, they dare not do any avowedly foolish thing. Although this clause seems to give a certain measure of licence, that licence must be given if possible contingencies are to be guarded against. We should not so hedge about our representatives, when placed in positions of trust, that all their efforts must become entirely abortive. There is too much of that sort of thing in regard to the Public Service of the Commonwealth. It is so hedged about-ther e are so many checks and counter checks in connection with itthat the Minister, in many cases, appears to be a mere cypher. That, however, is by the way. I admit that certain checks are necessary, but we may go too far. The difficulty seems to be in striking the happy mean. An attempt has been made to do that in this Bill, and I am not prepared to suggest any particular improvement, save in one or two directions to which I shall refer later on. So far I have been dealing chiefly with the criticisms levelled at the measure by tlie honourable member for Wentworth. Coming to the Bill itself, I contend that the time is ripe for the establishment of a National bank. There are many reasons why such an institution should be created, the main reason being that our revenue is of such dimensions that it is equal almost to the volume of money passing through some of the banks to-day. As time goes on, no doubt, our revenue As for honourable members being alone will be quite as large as that which passes through any of the banking institutions of Australia. The Commonwealth has much to do with finance, and probably in the future will have to deal with loans, so that there is open to us a vast field of be conducted more advantageously to Australia through the agency of a National ""our bank than through private institutions. I freely admit that we are establishing a precedent when we provide that this shall be essentially a National bank, owned absolutely by the nation. So far as I can gather, that is an entirely new departure. One or two attempts have been made in the same direction, but they have not been persisted in. The past is not an infallible guide to its heirs, but if we are not going to profit slightly from it we shall be unworthy of our heirship. This being essentially a National bank, the National Parliament must retain some control over it. I fail to see how it could be what we want it to be if it were entirely divorced from the National control. This, I admit, is a very delicate point. I have had very serious doubts concerning it, but, upon reflection, have come to the conclusion that, seeing that' we have to establish this bank and to finance it, it would be unwise for the nation not to retain some control over it. If the",23,Fisher
109,Mr Joseph Cook,"D o not sayNational Parliament were to be divorced from it, it could not be regarded as a truly National bank, and the nation could not be expected to back its credit. It will be part and parcel of the nation, to such, an extent that I do not think the principle laid down in the B ill , in this regard, could properly 32 declares that the Governor may, with the consent of the Treasurer, make rules and regulations for the good government of the bank, the classification of its officers, and any matter necessary or convenient_for carrying on the business of the bank. That is a very necessary provision, seeing that this will be a National institution backed by the people's money. The people who send us here, and make it possible for any one of us to become Prime Minister, expect that their interests will be guarded by their representatives and by the man selected by their representatives to lead the party in power.

Clause termination of the rate of interest to be paid by this institution. Under clause 33 the Commonwealth is made responsible for the payment of moneys due by the bank.

115,Mr Carr,"Taxation is an entirely the B ill .more that it seems to me to'be inevitable that this should be so if it is to be a National bank at all. The honourable member for Richmond conveyed the impression that he feared that if the Government entered directly into the banking business it would weaken itself as an aid to other institutions in the event of a crisis. He seemed to think that, in so far as the Government itself would be involved in the financial crisis by the fact that it was dealing in securities and other features of the ordinary banking business, it would to that extent be weakened in any support which it might extend to other institutions that might be tottering. I believe that was the burden of his lengthy speech, but I cannot see how the fact of the Government being engaged in the banking business would in any way increase the total volume of the country's liabilities at a time of crisis. If the Government were not engaged in that business, the business, I presume, would be done through other institutions, practically the same liabilities would be incurred, and the Government would still have to come along and take up the whole load, no matter whether it was represented in overdrafts in other banks or not. The Government might not have an overdraft in their own books, and might not be bankers at all, but the liabilities would be there, and would still have to be sTiouldered. The mere fact that the Government, as bankers, were already carrying part of the liability would be neither here nor there. The total volume would be practically the same, and the Government would be not one whit weakened. It is always competent for the Government at a time of crisis to pledge its credit, and to pledge it up to the hilt, if need be. There is no possibility of a country's credit being entirely destroyed, unless its people are practically annihilated, and it is devastated. Only in the event of invasion or some great calamity of nature can a country's credit be entirely destroyed. Governments have come to the rescue of nnancial institutions in times of crisis, and if a crisis should occur here, the mere fact of the Government being identified with the National bank would tend rather to strengthen than to weaken their position, from the very fact that they would know more about the situation than would otherwise be possible, and probably be in a position to stem the tide before it reached the flood. Mr Carr. Another point which the honourable member for Richmond made was that we on this side of the House were bound to vote for the Bill right or wrong. I wish to repudiate that statement altogether. VVe are no more bound to vote for anything, right or wrong, than would an Anglican churchman be bound to adhere to his thirty-nine Articles, right or wrong. There is just asmuch sense in advancing the one proposition as the other. The churchman knowswhat he is pledged to, and knows hiscreed, and to charge him with having to do what he believes is simply bathos. There is no argument in it. VVe have for long believed in a National bank. That does not say that we are going to swallow anything in the shape of a National bank that may be produced, but it does say that when we get a chance to put a decent proposal for a National bank before Parliament, we will do so, and support it, and that is what we are doing to-day. The honourable member for Angas was put forward as the big gun of the Opposition. I may say, in passing, that a singular feature of the debate is the tardiness of the Opposition in furnishing arguments against the proposal, and the weakness of the arguments that have been submitted as such. member for Angas is a good man. I have not a word to say against him, but he seems to be one of the type of politicians who are more calculated to perpetuate the past than to help the future. That seems to be the function which he discharged very creditably yesterday afternoon. I wish to take exception to his statement that there is no provision for expert inspection and examination. The honourable member could not have read the Bill, or he would not have made it. He said he read it, but he must have missed clauses 19 and 20, which make ample provision for expert inspection and examination in these wordsThe affairs of the bank shall be subject to inspection and audit by the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. The inspection and audit shall be conducted not less ""often than half-yearly, and the Auditor-General shall report to the Treasurer the result of each inspection and audit. The Governor, at least twice in each year, shall prepare a balance-sheet in accordance with the prescribed form and submit it to the Auditor-General for report as to its correctness or otherwise, and transmit it with the report of the Auditor-General to the Treasurer, and shall also transmit a true copy of the balance-sheet",25,Fisher

If we expect this bank to take a leading position, more capital than .Â£1,000,000 will be necessary; and we might follow the good old precedent of the Bank of England, of which the people of the Old Country: are so proud. I sometimes wonder why the people of Australia are not more proud of our banking system, which is regarded with admiration in other parts of the world, and has conducted the financial affairs of this country for very many years with only one crisis. The Bank of England has issued stock to the value of Â£i4>553>ooo which is the working capital. I saw a suggestion made the other day by an expert in the Age to the effect that stock to the extent of ,Â£5,000,000 should be sold, and the proceeds made the capital of the bank. Personally, I think that plan possesses many advantages, the main one of which, of course, is that it is a respectable sum, and in the raising of it we shall be following a good precedent. amount to make interest on ! power should be taken to raise that amount, but I do not think there is any chance of the bank investing Â£5,000,000, or any such sum, right' away. "" As the 6 market suited, and investments were found, the stock could be issued, until the whole ^Â£5,000,000 worth was out.

Debentures always remain a liability which must be met some day, whereas the other plan makes shareholders, and would thus widen the area of those' favorable to a Commonwealth Bank. they must have some say in the management. how that is in the case of the Bank of England, but I should think that the shareholders have some say. The issue of stock would give the Commonwealth Bank much greater stability than would the issue of simple debentures. fectly well that the stockholders would be paid last in any division of the assets, whereas the holders of debentures would share pari passu with the other creditors if the former did not take precedence. Ordinary depositors might have to wait until the whole of the debenture-holders had been paid; and this would tend to discredit the bank as a' depository institution. The next suggestion I have to make is that the Commonwealth Bank ought to manage the control of the Commonwealth note issue. My great objection to this note issue has always been that it is under the management of the Treasurer. In troublous, times of panic the strain put on a Treasurer to use the printing press in order to issue notes broadcast would be enormous, and almost beyond the power of any human being to resist. On the other hand, if the note issue were handed over to the bank, which is a semi-mercantile concern, it would be conducted on business lines, and that danger would be eliminated. If we are to have a Commonwealth Bank, let us have one prepared to do all the financial business of the Commonwealth, and not leave the control of the note issue to the Treasurer, who, after all, is only a man who would, naturally, in time of panic, desire to oblige everybody. If there had been a note issue on the present lines in 1893, no Treasurer in the world would have resisted the pressure put upon him to issue notes wholesale. have been no panic, because the banks would have got re-discounts from the Commonwealth. Home Affairs was not behind the scenes. There had to be a panic, because advances had been wrongly made. There was one bank in which not a single advance was state of things to-day to some extent? and I hope and trust not. Some of the banks were then intrinsically rotten, and had to go; and no amount of credit, but only cash, could have saved them; losses had to be made good, and credit cannot do that. honourable member think that the Commonwealth Bank ought tb be given a year of two, in order to prove itself, before taking charge of all the financial business? a Bill, let us do the whole thing at once; this bank is going to be an expensive affair,",29,Fisher

The Treasurer is only human, ancl, in time of panic, desiring to oblige the people, would probably do things which he knew to be wrong, but do them merely with a desire to stave off the evil day. There is an idea that this is to be a bankers' bankj but a bankers' bank, dealing with banks with deposits amounting to Â£20,000,000 and with Â£ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 of reserves, must necessarily be a fairly strong institution. A bank with Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 on one side and a liability of Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 on the other could never be a bankers' bank. If this institution is to be a bankers' bank, the Government should adopt my suggestion in regard to the issue of Â£5,000,000 of stock, which ought to be invested in exceedingly solvent securities, capable of being rapidly realized in time of panic, so that the bank could not only give credit to the Government, but substantial assistance to the other banks. The three large banking institutions, which kept their doors open during the great banking crisis of 1893 were enabled to do so only by the action of the New South Wales Parliament in allowing them to pay in notes instead of gold, save at their head offices. It would be impossible for any bank to meet a sudden demand by all its creditors to be paid in gold. That is practically what happened in 1893, 'and the Parliament of New South Wales passed a lawmaking notes a legal tender, with the result that the panic immediately ceased. Some power of the sort ought to be intrusted to this institution if it is to be a bankers' bank. We ought in times of peace to prepare for any possibility of crisis. Until the evil day arrived, when we should be able to deal with the special circumstances. tend to increase the panic. It is f ar better that we should take action in this direction when there is no thought of panic. If this is to be made a bankers' bank, power should be taken to deal in some special way with the associated banks. The Government ought to have power to suspend as it were their charters, and to allow them to pay in notes in time of crisis. The question would then arise as to what banks should come within this association. The Governments of the day in the several States during the crisis of 1893 were greatly hindered in taking action by the If the Government knowledge that it was impossible for any credit to save some of tlie banks. They were insolvent, and nothing but cash could save them. The Commonwealth Goverament, therefore, must have some power to suspend the charters of the associated banks and to allow them to pay in notes in time of panic. It should also have power to see that they conducted their business properly, and any bank that desired to come within the associated banking arena should be prepared to allow its accounts to be audited by representatives of the Government. Under some such system as that the money of the people would be properly safeguarded, and we should stave off a crisis far better than we should be able to do by any other means. member suggests really that we should simply re-discount their best securitiesvernment of the day should have the further power I have mentioned. in the Banking Bill to be introduced next session. shall have such a measure. I make this suggestion because the Prime Minister said that this was to be a bankers' bank, and a bankers' bank with Â£1,000,00 0 on one side and a liability of Â£1,000,000 on the other would be ludicrous.

They did not restore confidence. They simply passed a law which made it impossible for creditors of the banks to demand payment in gold. The management of this bank, like the management of every large concern, is the crux of the whole question; and I am surprised that a democratic Government should insist upon its affairs being managed by one man. Such a proposal is extraordinary, and could not possibly be carried out. The Prime Minister said that bank directors were valueless-that they simply appointed a manager and drew their fees. that he has never been a director oÂ£ a bank. The Bank of England has a Board of Directors, consisting of men familiar with practically every branch of trade in London, and with the trading concerns of nearly the whole world. One man could not manage this great undertaking. the first place, if the bank is to undertake exchange work, it will have to open extensive offices in London, and will have to issue credits there, so as to secure a flow of money backwards and forwards. That being so, the Governor of tlie bank will require a thorough knowledge of exchange. He must also have a general knowledge of the commercial l if e of the community all over Australia, so that he may pick his discounts. There are a dozen other directions in which he will require special knowledge; and I feel that if the Ministry insist upon having a one-man control, it will be fatal to this scheme. If we are to have a National bank, let it be conducted on proper lines, and not be a mere hole-and-corner institution. member suggest?

If , however, the Goconcerns there is one man at the top and vernment will deign to accept some of my suggestions I think the bank will be properly managed.

If the Government want to justify the bank, the proper thing for them to do is to give it all their business, and more particularly to give it the command of the note issue.

We had in Queensland some very unfortunate experiences in connection with banking, as you, sir, know. We had there a bank with a very influential directorate, and it was so managed that men who had the ear of the directors, and some of the directors themselves, were not above buying properties at a small price, mortgaging them to the bank at a very high price, pocketing the difference, ancl letting the bank foreclose on the properties.

Some honourable members opposite have spoken of the proposal -to establish a Savings Bank as one sprung -on the House by the Caucus, but on-the 5th June, 1908, I put on the business-paper the following notice of motionThat, in the opinion of this House, it is -desirable that wherever throughout the Commonwealth an official post-office is now, or may Siereafter be, in existence, a Commonwealth '.Savings Bank should be established in connection ""therewith. In my opinion, it e Commonwealth should establish Savings Banks in connection with the post-offices, and should give depositors a higher rate of interest than is given by the States.

I hope that, in discussing tlie matter, honourable members opposite will not again assert that the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank will do injury to widows and orphans by bringing down the value of bank shares. The position is as I have stated, and not as it has been stated by honourable members who have preceded me. I have listened with attention to the speeches of honourable members opposite, and wish to deal with the Bill from the stand-point of public interest, and without any personal or political feeling. The banks fill a very important place in our business life, and do not deserve Io be adversely criticised for their management of their affairs. I have had a banking account for more than forty years, during which I have not always been affluent; but I have never had cause to complain of the manner in which my bank has treated me. On the contrary, I have on many occasions been under an obligation to it, and feel that it has done a great deal Making of work for me for which I have paid very little, although some persons grumble at the yearly charge of ios. for tl -e keeping of accounts. No doubt the ^ s t ing arrangement is satisfactory to the bank; it has also been satisfactory to me. 1 Banking houses are, of course, business concerns trading in money, as other establishI n Melbourne, the ments trade in other commodities. I have noticed for some time past, however, that some honourable members show a wish to put their knife into the banks, to use a colloquial expression, though I do not suppose that the banks have done them, any injury. The establishment of a Commonwealth Bank being one of the planks of the platform of the Labour party, the Government, having been returned with a considerable majority, has been under an obligation to bring in this B ill . At the same time, it has not been proved that the measure is urgently needed, or that there is a. gap whicli it will fill. The Treasurer failed to give reasons for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank. There is no doubt about the power of this Parliament to provide for the establishment of a bank for conducting and regulating the note issue of the Commonwealth, transactions in connection with loans, the debts of the States,",34,Fisher

That, however, will be a matter for the High Court to deal with. I should have thought that the Government, having in view the establishment of . a Commonwealth Bank, would have proposed the taking over and incorporation as a Commonwealth concern, two of the most influential private banks, making them the National Bank of Australia. Personally, I think that a central bank, to manage the nnancial transactions of the Government, including the taking, over of the State debts and the control of the note issue, is necessary, so long as the position of of information in regard to the opinions that bank in relation to the Government is clearly defined and understood. There is nothing in the Bill about the control of the note issue, though this is one of the most important branches of business that a central bank, with the Government behind it, would have to undertake. It has been proved in practice, I think, that any attempt to dissociate the note issue from banking, and to leave it entirely in the hands of Government officials, who are not in touch with the trade and commerce of the country, has not proved a success; ancl I do not think it will prove a success in Australia. issue of notes per capita in Queensland than in any other State; in Queensland the note issue was double that of any other State. of the note issue is most intricate; and, though the management of the issue may be good now, it would be better under a commercial institution in touch with the trade ancl commerce of the country. It is almost universally admitted that the English system of the Bank of England, namely, a note issue controlled by a central bank which has the Government account, represents the highest development the world has yet seen of any banking system. bank in England. my statement holds good. My difficulty in dealing with this matter is that the Government have embarked on the business without, so far as I know, any expert knowledge or experience to guide them. We are, as a Government supporter has said, proceeding on a course without precedent; and, under the circumstances, not only the Government, but honourable members generally, ought to have been fortified with expert advice. It is not reasonable to throw down a Bill of this sort without telling us whether any persons competent to advise have been consulted, or, if so, what is the advice they had tendered. It is unreasonable to ask us. without the fullest information, to deal with a matter affecting so deeply the interests of the country. That is not the way in which people act when they are incurring great personal responsibility in their own business. If that were the case witli Ministers, they would require a great deal of persons of experience in this branch of business. * Honourable members generally have no information at all, except that given in a very short speech by the Treasurer, whether this matter has been submitted to any expert or experts. There are plenty of authorities available; and I am astonished that we have been told nothing as to the opinions of financiers and others competent to speak. What was done in Germany before the establishment of the Reichsbank? Parliament was not asked to pass a Bill as we are asked to pass this measure. The German Government sent distinguished people to carefully study the English system, which was practically adopted en bloc, with the exception of the power to extend the fiduciary note issue on certain fixed and definite conditions. Our Prime Minister, as Treasurer, went Home the other day, taking with him the best available talent; but he has not told us that, when in London, he consulted any authority whatever in regard to die forthcoming Commonwealth Bank Bill. Personally, I do not believe that the Treasurer consulted any one. is only "" fishing."" reason to believe it. When the Reichsbank was started it was not established <le novo, as we propose to establish the Commonwealth Bank. The German Government took over the Prussian State Bank, which already had a note issue; and thus the great central bank of the German Empire was founded.

221,Sir John Forrest,"I say I havealtogether agree, although, of course, I admit that knowledge is good from wherever it may come. At the same time, I am a believer in the nnancial institutions of our own country, rather than in the nnancial institutions of other countries. I do not think we should go to America or Germany for our laws in regard to finance. I am informed that it is almost a commonplace in banking circles that the American system is essentially faulty, and that for years the American people have been trying to improve it, without really any satisfactory results. There is one great omission in this B ill . was in office? I confess that I now refer to a most difficult question; but it must be pointed out that no provision is made for any banking crisis. Apparently we have to go on as before, and, in the event of a crisis, trust to"" I rovidence. Crises are known all over the world; and even in the case of the Bank of England-probabl y the greatest institution of the k in d . in the world-ther e have been three occasions since the Bank Act of 1844, on which that Act has had to be suspended. It has been thought by many tliat some power ought to be created, by which the Bank Act would be suspended automatically. recollect that in 1873 Lord Sherbrooke, better known here as Mr Robert Lowe, introduced a Bil l for that very purpose. Lord Sherbrooke proposed that when the bank rate was 12! per cent., the Act should be suspended automatically; but that rate was considered too high, and the Bill did not become law. It is worth considering, however, whether, when the rate reaches a certain point, there shall not be power to increase the fiduciary note issue. In such case, however, the rates would have to be fixed pretty high, so as to mark an exceptional state of things. In Germany, the law in this respect comes into operation annually uncler certain conditions; the note issue is increased on certain terms, but, although it seems to work well, it is said to vitiate international confidence in the German notes. sire the Government, or the authority in charge of the note issue, to be able to issue additional notes on any small pretext; but we certainly do require some planthough I am not here to suggest one-by which, in times of stress and difficulty, there should be power, as has been clone in England many times, to issue additional notes, and make them legal tender. There is no provision, however, in the Bill to meet such extraordinary exigencies as I have indicated. The Bill before us is not the banking measure that is very much required in Australia, namely, a measure to consolidate our banking law. Such a Bill was drafted, ancl in print, years ago by the Treasury, and I do not know why it has not yet seen the light. been introduced long ago. Why did not the honourable member introduce it when he time; honourable members opposite turned us out. Had we remained in power, it would have been introduced in the first session of the present Parliament. I am surprised that such a very necessary B ill as one providing for the consolidation of the banking law of the States has not been introduced. A consolidation of the banking law of Australia is much required; but this is simply a specific measure to establish a Government bank. I am told that the Labour party's platform Honourable members may provides for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank free from political influence, but can it be said that the bank to be created under this measure will be free from political influence? honourable member point to any clause in the Bill which shows that it will not be? Sir JOHN FORREST I shall be able to do so. The Governor of the bank will have only the Government of the day to advise and control him, and he will not be free from iiolitical influence. I am opposed to this institution being controlled by one man. I do not believe that any great institution should be wholly dependent upon one individual; and the Governor of this bank must have some one to advise him. Autocrats are often said to be the greatest benefactors, but we generally reWe, in Australia, clo not degard such a system as undesirable.

I cannot understand ment should desire to concentrate one man the whole power and responsibility Wide experience ancl knowledge will be absolutely necessary. The Government will want this institution to advise it in regard to various nnancial operations, and if we have only one man to manage its affairs that man must be placed at a disadvantage. I am sure that he would prefer to have the assistance of other eminent financiers in carrying on the business of the bank. Sir JohnI propose now to refer to some of the clauses in the B ill . In the first place, I think that clause 7 We all reconfers very wide powers on the feat performed "" bank."" In some clauses we have references to the "" bank,"" and in others to the when the national debts, "" Governor."" In this clause it is declared were that the "" bank"" shall have certain powers. I presume that the reference is really to the Governor; but the clause does not state It was who is to be the executive power of the bank to exercise authority. It is a mistake to use different terms, for it must undoubtedly lead to confusion. The bank, or, as I presume, the Governor, is to have power, amongst other things, to carry on the geneThere ral business of banking, to acquire and hold land on any tenure, to make advances by way of loan, overdraft, or otherwise, to borrow money, and to do anything incidental to any of the powers and the of the bank. I am not quite which has a capital of clear as to the meaning of this There cannot be any good reference to the power of the bank to borrow money. Is the Governor to have power to borrow as much"" as he pleases, or does this provision relate to the raising of the capital of the bank ? Then, again, under clause 10, the Treasurer is given carte I urge them to provide blanche to spend a million without any vote It by Parliament. He is given power to make advances to the bank to enable it to defray It any of the expenses incidental to its establishment, or to the opening of offices. The money advanced is to be repaid, but the When we remember that the clause does not say when it is to be repaid. How is the Treasurer to raise the necessary money ? He will obtain it, I presume, by selling the debentures for which clause 9 provides. As to the name of the general receive only a small manager of the bank, I do not think that the title of "" G o v e r n o r"" is a good one. Its use must lead to confusion. It is true that the general manager of the Batik of England is known as the "" Governor,"" but why the Governthere are no State Governors there. When in one is referring to the Governor of this bank, one may be thought to be referring to relating to this institution. the Governor of a State. There is no good reason for the use of this title, and I suggest that the Ministry should substitute for it the title of President or General Manager.

I do not see why we should not their continuance in office. In clause 14 it is provided thatThe Governor and the Deputy Governor shall it away to Canberra. respectively have such powers and perform such duties as are prescribed by this Act or. the regulations.' That provision, it seems to me, will destroy the Governor's independence, and make him the mere creature of the Government of the day. The Government will scribing his duties, and he will have to conform to them. Why not set forth in the Bill itself the duties to be discharged by him? Let them be placed in the B ill , so that we may see what they are to be, and have an opportunity to criticise them. In that way we should conserve the independence of the Governor, and he could not be removed except for malfeasance or neglect of duty. This power to be vested in the Governor General in Council to make regulations prescribing the duties of the Governor of the bank will take away [108] The the day.

I take it that the funds derived from the Savings Bank will be invested as provided in clause 34 of part i v . Although part v . deals with the Savings Bank business, I can find nothing in part v . relating to the investment of the Savings Bank funds. I may say at once that I think the Commonwealth is very well qualified to do the Savings Bank business of Australia, because of its post-offices and post-office officials, by whom the work will be done. It is done already by the postal officials. The only, additional expense in my own State, Western Australia, and in several of the other States, is in the head office, all the other officers throughout the country doing the work as part of their post-office duty, without special payment. thought that some day the Commonwealth would carry on this business, because it has the machinery for doing it ; but that does not prevent me saying that I very much regret that it is being done at the present time, unless some satisfactory .arrangement can be made with the States. posits in the Savings Banks of Australia amounted in 1909-10 to Â£ 2 0 , 1 5 0 , 5 7 4 in New South Wales, Â£15,417,88 8 in Victoria, Â£ 6 , 7 9 1 , 3 2 0 in South Australia, Â£ 3 , 4 8 1 . 7 6 4 needs, in view of the complexity and diffiin Western Australia, and Â£ 1 , 6 5 2 , 9 6 6 in Tasmania, making a total of Â£53,117,498I n my own State, Western Australia, being, used by the Government for developmental purposes. It is borrowed by the Government from the Savings Bank, and used for land purchase, closer settlement, an agricultural bank, municipal water supplies, and other things, the Government paying interest to the Savings Bank for it, [108]2 and charging those undertakings with it. This often removes the necessity for going on the market to borrow. The Savings Banks should be under Government control, though in some of the States they are not. I do not know whether the Post Office does business for them in those States, though I suppose that it does, It is furand gets paid for it. The primary object of Savings Banks is, not to find an investment for large sums, but to encourage th r ift by enabling persons with limited means to put aside small sums. The limit on which interest is paid has gradually been increased as outlets have been found for the money borrowed, and in Western Australia interest is now paid on all deposits up to Â£ 6 0 0 . To allow interest on any sum deposited, however large, would altogether change the nature of Savings Banks, and I do not know that their business could be transacted by the Pest Office, if very large sums had to be handled. Savings Banks should be under Government control, because the poor man should be certain that his deposits, are absolutely safe, and that the Government is responsible for them. 1 The Post Office is a convenient agency for accepting deposits, and paying withdrawals. The main objection to the Government's proposal is that it will take from the States money they now use, and need for local development, but if a plan could be devised under which that money could be lent to the States at rates not higher than are now paid, my objection to the change would be I always greatly removed. Provision should be made for the lending of the money deposited in ' each State to the State for general developmental purposes. It would not be right to bring it all to the Seat of Government, and divert it from being used for local purposes.

The bank, if properly established, should be the chief financial adviser of the Government, and in touch with financial movements all over the world, and especially in the Old Country. a pleasure to have the opportunity to support the B ill. Honourable members must admit that during the last electoral campaign, the Labour party made the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank one of the planks of its platform. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The people were told that it would give them cheap money. bleed the other banksments, which my knowledge of the world tells me would be foolish. The objects of the proposed bank are set out in the BillThe bank shall, in addition to any other powers conferred by this Act, have power(a) to carry on the general business of banking; (4) to acquire and hold land on any tenure; (c) to receive money on deposit, either for a fixed term or on current account; (d) to make advances by way of loan, overdraft, or otherwise; (e) to discount bills and drafts; (/) to issue bills and drafts, and grant letters of credit; (g) to deal in exchanges, specie, bu'lion, gold-dust, assayed gold, and precious metals; (h) to borrow money; and (i) to do anything incidental to any of its powers. Members of the Opposition have warned us that the establishment of the proposed bank is unconstitutional, but I do not admit it ; I think that we are quite within our powers in passing the measure. The Constitution empowers us to legislate in regard to banks and banking. Our legislation in regard to banking will, no doubt, be largely the consolidation of State Acts, general principles being laid down for the control of all financial institutions in the nature of banks doing business in Australia. We are now providing for a bank which will transact, first of all, the financial business of the Government. Every one must admit that that is a step in the right direction. The longer the establishment of the proposed bank is delayed the greater will be the difficulties. In other countries, there is virtually no State bank in the sense in which this will be a State bank. We are fortunate in being able to establish such a bank, but the credit of the country never stood higher than it does now, and circumstances are particularly favorable for what we propose. One of the reasons for Federation was the possibility of establishing a National bank, and the opportunity it would give for bringing all banking institutions under one control. It has been objected that there is no need for a Commonwealth Bank, because Australia has had practically only one banking crisis, but the reason for this is obvious. We have frequently had droughts and times of depression, when crises have been prevented by public borrowing. During the last forty years, the State Governments have borrowed Â£300,000,000 . Under the See Government, New SouthA n d that it would Wales was saved from a crisis by large public borrowing, for which Ministers were I did not make such statecondemned at the time, though it was afterwards admitted that they had done the right thing. The resources of Australia are so great that it can soon recuperate, and public borrowing is justified by its effect in keeping things going in times of depression. The opponents of this measure have directed attention to the Bank qf England; and it may not be known to all that, up to 1866, that bank was saved from disaster no less than fifty-five times, though, since. 1866, there has been no trouble. The freedom from crises is due to the fact that the Bank Act may be suspended by the Government and the bank allowed to issue notes. We in Australia must have o^ir periods of financial depression; and it is the will of the people that there should be a Commonwealth Bank. In April, 1910, the people very emphatically decided on a change of Government, because they were dissatisfied with the conduct of public business. That dissatisfaction arose partly, from the fact that there had not been established a bank of the kind now proposed ; and the Bill before us simply represents the mandate of the electors. Some honourable members opposite unworthily impute motives to honourable members on this side. I am sorry that the honourable member for Wentworth is not here, because I should have liked to say to him that imputing motives does no good, and that I am surprised to see him resort to such tactics. Nothing is more likely to create bad feeling; and 1 hope that these remarks of mine may assist to prevent a repetition of such conduct. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.",41,Fisher

243,Mr West,"monwealth Bank has increased greatly even duiing the present session. We have passed an Act to take ove the Northern Territory, r have arranged to take over the State debts, and also to create a Federal Capital city. In the case of the Northern Territory, for instance, the necessity for a Commonwealth Bank will certainly arise, and in connection with the taking over of the State debts and other financial transactions between the States and the Commonwealth there will have to be some kind of banking account. Whether the people generally will avail themselves of this bank for their own business time alone can prove, but I feel confident that they will. There will always remain a large amount of business for the private banks, which have to enter into speculative transactions, or they could not pay their dividends. Some of our largest commercial houses are to-day virtually run by the banks; and this is necessary, because the banks have large sums outstanding. Commonwealth Bank will monopolize all the business; and I am sure no honourable member contemplates such a position. In any case, the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank will prevent crises in the future. The honourable member for Swan urged that the note issue should be part and parcel of the business of this bank; but for that I see absolutely no necessity, because the Bill makes provision for the Treasurer at any time to make advances to the bank. I presume that one of the obiects of this provision is that if at any time there April, 1910, has invariably met with stern is a crisis, the Government may come to the aid of the bank. The Governors of the bank, whatever the number may lie, must be subject more or less to the Government of the day. We may call that political control, or what we may, but the management of the bank must be subject to the Government, who are answerable to the House, which, in turn, is answerable to the country. Indeed, in my opinion, it would not be a Commonwealth Bank unless the people, through their representatives, exercised some control. As to the management, I believe the Government will be able to get men as competent and honest as are now available to the private banks. Honourable members have dealt with the past history of State banking, but I do not think that anything said under this head will change a vote in this House. Some of the transactions of private banks have been of a scandalous nature. In the Overend crisis of 1866, I remember seeing, in Cornhill and Cheapside, in London, grown men crying, and not knowing which way to turn in their distress. The capital of that bank was only about ^Â£750,000, and yet one transaction alone on which the bank fell amounted to ,Â£500,000. Then, in the case of the Glasgow Bank, we found the directors storing lead washers in place of gold, in bags in the vault, so as to deceive the auditors. I admit that in Australia there are no such charges to be made against our banks. Some of the managers of our financial institutions are men of the highest integrity. Many hongrable members, and notably the honourable member for Swan, have referred to the fact that this bank may be left to the entire control of one man; but we know, as a matter of fact, that some of our greatest banks are practically so controlled. I feel quite sure that there is not a bank director who would oppose any suggestion made by Mr Thomas A. Dibbs, or by Mr French, of the Bank of New South Wales. Honourable members There is no need to fear that the need not worry themselves about the number of Governors, whether they be one, two, or three. No legislation that we pass is so perfect that it does not need amendment; it is only when a law is put into operation that its weaknesses are shown. Weshall have, perhaps, the same experience in regard to this Bill, and after it has been in operation for some time we may find an amendment of it necessary. The people must have been struck with the fact that every measure introduced in this Parliament by our party since 13th opposition. Honourable members of the Opposition the other day were praising the Australian note issue, whereas they strongly opposed the Bill to provide for it. Then, again, when the Land Tax Bill was introduced we had predictions that all sorts of disasters were likely to arise from it. ber must not discuss that matter. tioned it but for the references made by the Opposition to those two great measures. When they were before the House we were told that their passing would be attended by a series of disasters to Australia.

Confidence is essential to the success of all big financial undertakings, and I am confidence in this institution. All our busivice and of the soundness of their judgness is done on credit. It could not be transacted on any other basis, and so long as we can secure stability in our banking institutions and the gonfidence of the public so far as they are concerned, our credit will be good, and our business transactions will be facilitated. I hope that this measure will be passed, and that my forecasts of the benefits likely to flow from it will be fulfilled. If they are, I am sure that the people will not regret the course they took on 13th April, 1910, in placing in power a Government of business people, who have shown their capacity for work. Our honourable friends of the Opposition have never shown any real capacity for work, nor any desire to push on with legislation such as we have been advancing step by step, and so increasing the prosperity of Australia. honourable member for East Sydney has appeared in sundry characters since he manifested his presence here as one of the factors of the 13th April, but has excelled himself to-night in the role of the model supporter. It would hardly be possible to present a more unqualified and absolute declaration of loyalty and admiration than the honourable member has given to-night to the Government which he supports. Simplicity itself characterizes all the honourable member's views. He is amazed that sophisticated persons on this side should have any apprehension to express or question to ask. "" What more could you desire?"" he asks. another bank, a bank of a special character."" some respects, the more he admires it ; the more it is like other banks, the more he approves of it . The more it enters into new fields, the better he likes it ; the more it keeps within old lines, the greater, according to him, will be its stability; and so on. But there are people who ask questions. It is the business of the Opposition to make inquiries, and to endeavour, to obtain answers, if they can, from the more responsible representatives on the I other side of the House. In New Southi Wales there are great financial institutions' which are notoriously indebted largely for their success to individual members of theirstaffs. The honourable member mentioned two gentlemen who are thoroughly well known. But those gentlemen exercise ar* unquestioned authority over their assosure that the people . will have ciates, both by reason of their long serment and capacity. To accord to a man as a reward of a life spent in the service of an institution a confidence which grows from experience of his wisdom' and capacity is very different from expressing faith in some unknown person of whom we have not, at present, the slightest knowledge. opportunity. portunity. The difliculty with us is to support the acceptance of a one-man institution especially without knowledge of the man, or what his qualificationsare for the post. The honourable member will see that the two cases are wholly different. The natural and legitimate authority exercised by men like Mr French and Mr Dibbs is a healthy wholesome growth, whereas to ask us to accept without question any appointment that may be made by the Government to this bank implies as large a demand as ever was made on the generosity of an Opposition. The circumstances of a Com-' monwealth Bank are sufficient to evoke a whole series of financial problems. . The agitation for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank did not originate owing to any public Remand. The appeal for such a bank dates back a few years. It has been considered at conferences, where resolutions have been passed. I have a vivid recollection of "" We are to have seeing in those inflammatory placards and publications which are frequently used in The more peculiar it is in connection with elections, and which certainly signalized our last, an appeal to the great body of the people to rise against banks, which were absorbing incalculable riches pirated fro m the. pockets of the people.

This second theory, like the first, was put forward for inflammatory purposes-to provoke a sentiment against the present banks, used for electioneering purposes.

There has been a departure which may or may not be sanctioned by the next Conference, at the beginning of next year.

The parallels drawn between this new carefully spoon-fed bank and the career and development of a private institution, fighting its own way under the guidance of men whose capital is staked in the venture, exercising a vigilant control of the minutest incomings or outgoings, cannot be maintained. It is those qualities which explain the astonishing growth in Victoria, and elsewhere, of institutions of which the weakest have been weeded out, and from which incompetent guardians, guides, or omcers are speedily dismissed. That stern process involving the survival of the fittest cannot be expected to operate upon an institution standing on an entirely different base. It will be subjected, so far as its employees are concerned, to nothing like the same strain. Those responsible for its policy will find themselves at the very outset with the whole Commonwealth behind them, finding them a million of money, and able, if necessary, to find them Â£5,000,000, which they can repay at their convenience, finding them in prestige and authority, finding them the business of our established Departments and huge public activities when launching them upon their career. Surely with all those circumstances in its favour, and the interminable support of the public purse and patronage, such an institution has an absolutely special position.. On the other side, the deductions to which I have already alluded must be rigorously and perpetually made. In the latest shape which the banking proposal of the Conference, that of the party, and, finally, of the Government, has now taken, we find that, while calculating upon all those advantages, they ignore practically the whole of the disadvantages to which the institution must necessarily become subject, as compared with private institutions. It is only due to the Minister of Home Affairs to say that, for the final turn which brought this banking proposal so far to the front in Labour politics, that it was impossible to pass it by, what I may term the O'Malley boom was chiefly responsible. Although1 disclaim all knowledge, the suggestion is that, because of the O'Malley boom, and the extravagant nature of his proposals, his colleagues have found that they could not delay action any longer. If they did, they might have to swallow the whole of the O'Malley dose just as it had been Mr Deakin. compounded. It was, therefore, thought desirable to get in first with a milder instalment for which the endorsement of the party could be claimed, and which would enlist the support, evidently the silent support, of the Minister for Home Affairs himself. Mr VV. H . IRVINE -This is O'Malley pasteurized. is far from pasteurized to the full extent, although sufficiently to remove several of the most brilliantly original features of his scheme. For all that, it has not been deprived of its power to multiply apprehensions, even in its parents. We are Â«sked, in what is almost pure O'Malleyism, "" Why doubt, why hesitate, when the credit of the Commonwealth is behind the bank ? "" Why hesitate, indeed ! Moreover, we still have the honourable member's doctrine that, if we only knew how, we could live on credit, and this bank was to be the means of doing it. An exchange of credits was to take place all over the country, relieving us of the necessity of coinage. All we required was a little pocket-book in which to enter our debtor and creditor accounts. I do not know how the creditor account was to be kept up, but the debtor, account of itself would keep on mounting up enormously. should say he wished the Minister of Home Affairs means it. I believe he did honestly intend and mean it. One can understand, therefore, the certain amount of gloomwith which the very much-modified proposals now before the House have been received by gentlemen who looked upon that credit and debit scheme, as well they might, as an open gateway into a financial paradise.

He insisted that political influence would be strictly exspect does not protect the public interest cluded, and Ministerial influence banished, so that the only relation existing be the holders of high and responsible positween Ministers and the bank was to be that of a Court of Appeal, very rarely resorted to, but open when a much-perplexed Governor, overcome by the burden of his position, wished for help. That was the authorized version laid before us at the outmay have ceased to be a fit custodian of set of this debate. Gradually since then statements have been made culminating in that of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, whose frankness in that regard has earned him the appreciation of the whole House. He says, frankly, that the Bill places the bank under the Governmentof the day, making them its masters and conductors, and making them responsible for its proceedings. He asked, if the Ministry were not responsible for it , who would be, and to whom were the people to look ? In short, according to the honourable member, the people are to rule through their representives, their representatives to rule through the Ministry, and the. Ministry to rule the bank. That is not the non-political bank which has been painted for us on the platform. This is the bank described in the frank interchange of opinions which one welcomes.

We all desire that the bank, if established, shall be on a basis as broad and strong as possible, ancl conducted in a manner which will guarantee success. The Governor should have at his elbow tried and trusted advisers to whom he could submit his doubts, and from whom moral support could be obtained. The bank will be handicapped at the outset if in its early days, which in some respects will be its most anxious, the Governor is refused the invaluable aid of expert advice, which those in control of private financial institutions of standing possess. Again, the Bill makes no provision for that searching inspection of the affairs of the bank which ought to be made by, confidential and capable persons, independent of the Governor and of the Board of Advisers. Some such check is enforced in connection with all private institutions, in addition to other tests, but is not provided for in regard to the Commonwealth Bank, where it will be more needed, because the funds to be used will be furnished by the Government, instead of being obtained from vigilant shareholders.

One contention, which can be tested only by experience, but which appears to have a. good deal to be said in its favour, is that, looking ahead, there are nnancial operations of the Commonwealth which it would obviously be best to deal with by a Commonwealth Bank.

Would a bank like that not have to grow ? the power to create any bank under our Constitution, outside the direct needs of the Commonwealth itself. I shall answer the honourable member in a moment; but the case I am now dealing . with is that of a new kind of financial institution a bank for the special needs of the Commonwealth. Whether we can go beyond that constitutionally is another question, on which I do not think it necessary to offer an opinion.

Undoubtedly, when the greatest of our financial problems is faced-that of bringing the Commonwealth and States into harmony not only in their financial relations but in their financial operations-thi s will be, and indeed is, the most important work at present on the Federal horizon.

Can we offer greater advantages? should we enter into a field already well supplied, and where everything is working satisfactorily? I suppose that all human things are capable of improvement.

We shall not give, for a long time, anything like as good a service as the States Savings Banks are offering. They are giving all that is required. Who gives it and who gets it?

It has been upon that basis that we have built our great superstructure of national power and authority. If we build legitimately on that foundation it should stand for all time. Weaken it, and we shall weaken the foundations of our own authority, and narrow the scope and the beneficial exercise of the powers already intrusted to us. My difficulty is that, without doing justice to even this one branch of the question and without alluding to many others, which are of importance in this B ill , I have already occupied much more time than I had proposed. At this period of the session I feel that whatever can be dealt with in Committee had better be dealt widi there. strongly press upon this House is that we are not yet anything like qualified to go into Committee to deal with this measure. VVe have here what may be called the machinery, so far as it is necessary to put this proposal into statutory for m ; but we have nothing more before us. VVe have to test the Bill by questioning how it will operate under given conditions. We need to ask ourselves how, in its everyday working, it must affect us and others. That can only be arrived at by the closest arguments, inferences, and conclusions. There is not the slightest doubt that although each of us brings his own experience to bear upon the clauses, even our collective experience cannot help us to unravel all the intricacies of the Bill, so as to determine for ourselves how this new institution will work in the novel and original circumstances in which it is placed. We have to endeavour to forecast all the circumstances with which it may be faced, all the positions in which it will find itself, its extreme importance, we are entirely unall the emergencies it may reasonably be expected to encounter.

No doubt, as we go on our enthusiastic way towards that bourne to which, whichever side of the House we sit upon, we are all looking with the same intense longing, these amendments will become epidemic, so that every day we shall have an amendment of this kind moved, couched in almost the same terms, debated in almost the same way, and leading to precisely the same barren result. I do not propose to follow the honourable gentleman in detail, but two features of his speech I intend to emulate. While he apologized for being so long, he wound up, after all, without unduly trespassing upon our time; and he avoided all those intensely interesting by-paths along which the honourable and learned member for Angas so Then, and only then, in our successfully travelled yesterday. I am glad he has done so, because he has saved me a good deal of hard work in following him, for which I am particularly unfitted just now. The honourable and learned member has been dealing with a Bill to establish a Commonwealth bank, and has found many reasons for objecting to it. One or two of them are relevant, and may be considered. The others are of the same character as the articles with which softgoodsmen decorate their windows, particularly as the festive season approaches. He wound up his speech by asking for more time to consider the question. He seemed to have forgotten that this was a Bil l to empower the Government to do something which the Federal Parliament ought to have done long ago. Instead of asking for more time, we ought to be standing up and apologizing to the people for our negliI t is not for the Gogence. We have been here ten years, and this is the first time the subject has been definitely brought forward in any of its phases. The honourable and learned member had something to say about the unconstitutionality of the measure. He is the second lawyer on that side who has touched upon that point. There will be others to follow him, and they will all say that they It is like your imdoubt its constitutionality. Ever since the Government have been in office, the habitual -I must ask the honframe of mind of honourable members on the other side has been to doubt the constitutionality of everything. I cannot reat collect one measure introduced last session fhat was not declared by the Opposition to be unconstitutional, but not one of them has been declared unconstitutional by the High Court. Although several have been before it, they have run the gauntlet unscathed. While all the members of the Opposition may venture to doubt the constitutionality of this measure, I challenge any lawyer on that side to say, in so many words, that it is not constitutional. It is one thing to express a doubt-doub t is the proper frame of mind of a human being, because he can be certain of nothing-bu t it is quite another to say definitely that the Bill is unconstitutional.

Again, those honourable gentlemen, who were in office for the best part of ten "" years, power, wbich was given to them clearly under the Constitution, in relation to banking in general. Whether a Commonwealth bank, to do business outside the Commonwealth's own requirements, is constitutional or not, our power to regulate banking in general is undeniable. Will honourable members say that that was not one ot the chief powers given to us in the Constitution, and that there were, and are, more than sufficient reasons for exercising it? orable members opposite exercised it? VVe are told now that we know nothing of banking. If this be true, the fault lies at our own door. Ample opportunities have been at our feet, and for ten solid years the only party that have ventured to even say anything at all about banking, Commonwealth or other, have been this party. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat frequently alluded in the course of his speech to a member whom I could not place for a long while, as '' the gentleman who has just resumed his seat."" As I came in after that gentleman had resumed his seat, I was in a state of mild curiosity to know who he was. I found at length it was the honourable member for East Sydney The Leader of the Opposition had seized upon some statement made by him, and wns going at it "" hammer-andtongs "" when I entered the chamber, to the effect that "" the gentleman who had just resumed his seat "" had declared tliat "" this Bill would create a bank that was practically under the control of the Government of the day and the Parliament of the hour."" He gyrated round this point to my certain knowledge for at least ten minutes. Having exhausted the possibilities of that gamut, he switched abruptly on to the other line, complaining, "" Here you propose to entrust the destinies of this bank to one man."" Both those accusations will not lie. One of them may, but both cannot. The honourable and learned gentleman realized this and was very much more severe with the second one than with the first, because, unfortunately for the honourable gentleman, it happens that the second has some relevance to the Bill, while the first has none. In regard to the proposal to make one man the manager of the bank, he spoke of the uncertainty of human life. He said, "" You might get a man in the prime of life with a reputation and ability failed to exercise the and appoint him for seven years, but,"" he asked, "" who could guarantee that this man would remain in full possession of his faculties and continue capable, honest, and reliable for the whole of that term?"" Who, indeed ? Every one of us has known cases of men being taken for three years, presumably in the full possession of their faculties, and reliable and capable, but what a mighty change has come over the scene in that period 1 In three short years the people have been so profoundly disWhy, then, have honappointed with the bargains they have made, that they could only describe them as very bad indeed. But I have never heard the honourable gentleman condemn Parliaments on that account. It is said that we .cannot discharge this man except for bad behaviour. . Well, what of it? Is this a new principle, or an unwise one? The Judges are appointed for life, and the Leader of the Opposition, of course, primarily responsible for the Judiciary Act, appointed them. Judges are, all over the British Empire, appointed, not for years, but for life. This is an old and settled principle, and, on the whole, it has worked admirably. Yet, as all lawyers know, it has frequently happened that men have remained on the Bench* long past the period of usefulness. Mr W. H , IRVINE -Judges are appointed during good behaviour. it that the honourable member for Ballarat's point was the capability of an individual to carry out the duties of his office during his occupancy of it. It is undeniable, although happily for us we have had no experience of it in this country, that Judges have continued to sit on the Bench when they were quite incapable of carrying out the duties of their office. Yet we never hear a word against the wise and sound precaution which hedges the dignity of the judicial position with these safeguards against outside interference. We are attacked because in this Bill the Governor of the bank is made above the Public Service Commissioner, and cannot be affected by political, social, or any other kind of influence.

That was the real meaning of his amendment.

If he did not say that, I apologize for misrepresenting him. The honourable gentleman went on to make some useful remarks in dealing with the Savings Bank-useful , .1 mean, not as a contribution to the debate, but in their possible effect on people outside. This is a great country in which to make money, and more people than ever before are able to put money into Savings Banks. If , then, the honourable gentleman can persuade them, as a candidate at the recent Victorian elections tried to do, that the Prime Minister is endeavouring by force of law to take their money from them, he will certainly score one against us. I am afraid he will not succeed in his hopeful (enterprise. I would remind him, however, that it is for the Governor to say what Savings Bank business shall he done. If he considers that the Savings Bank depositors should be catered for, ine will provide a Commonwealth Savings Bank, but he is not directed to do so in the B ill . He is merely to undertake the business of a general banker. The Opposition bitterly regrets that the Bill is a practical measure, gives no hint of a millennium, ho suggestion of printing presses working overtime manufacturing paper money throughout the twenty-four hours for the .happiness of the people. It is a plain business-like and practical measure. That is more disappointing to honourable members opposite than anything else. The measure does not lend itself to the criticism for 'which they had prepared themselves. It is ,a plain measure, which could be understood by every man and woman in the country, !and provides merely for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank such as should have been established long ago; because .the Government, which is now the best customer of the banks, ought to make provision for doing its financial business directly instead of indirectly. No doubt, we must expect, and shall survive, the criticism of .those whose interests may be affected. We are taking action under a power vested in us by the Constitution. able member strove to make it appear that the competition of the Commonwealth ..Bank with private banks will be of a negligible character, but that the competition, of the Commonwealth Savings Bank ,'with those of the. States will be disastrous. That was very diplomatic and characteristic. Whenever it is proposed to tax thc rich man there goes out a wail from honourable gentlemen opposite, not on behalf of the rich man, but on behalf of the poor man, who is warned to beware of the Labour party. It is the little land-owner who is told to look out for the land tax; it is the man with Â£ 1 0 0 in the bank who is told to beware of the Commonwealth Bank. Is it the little man who provides the powder and shot for these attacks on Labour legislation? No ; it is the man with plenty of money against whom the legislation is directed. The honourable member says that the B ill aims a blow at the depositors in the Savings Banks. It does not do anything of the kind. Under any circumstances tliey are all right. They will not transfer their deposits to the Commonwealth Savings Bank unless they can gain advantages by doing so. The security of the State banks is not denied, nor is it suggested that the Commonwealth Bank will be insecure. The security being the same, the depositors will place their savings where they can get the better interest, and if the Commonwealdi Savings Bank cannot offer better terms than the State Savings Banks, it will do no business. -I say emphatically that the honourable member has endeavoured to divert the attention of the people from the true object, purpose, function, and scope of this bank, and he has done so in order to make people believe that those who will suffer most from the operations of the institution are not the other banks, but the poor unfortunate people who have put their money into the Savings Banks. The Savings Banks, and the Savings Banks depositors, have nothing to fear from this bank, which is established for the purpose of carrying on the legitimate business of banking. There is no "" wild-cat "" element in it ; we set down in black and white what the bank's functions are. The scope of the powers of the Governor is precisely delimited; he is placed above the power of any party influence, put in a position to exercise authority, and he will be the most efficient man it is possible to get. That being so, the Governor is asked to make the best he can of the The honorbusiness; and he will have behind him the credit of the Commonwealth, of which nothing can rob him. Banking consists in the buying and selling of credit. One would imagine from what we hear from honourable members 3048 opposite that the banks dealt with their capital, but they do nothing of the sort; they deal with credit, and with the money of other people. tal of the Australian banks amounts to Â£18,501,042, while the total liabilities are Â£122,545,000. A bank is a buyer and seller of credit; every bank has to build up a reputation, and on that reputation it depends. The gold reserve is something to increase the reputation of the bank, but it is the reputation itself, and not the gold reserve, on which the banker depends. Now, as credit is the basis of banking, consider the position of the Commonwealth Bank; could there be any individual or collection of individuals whose credit is marks him for a man and a brother. as great as the credit of the whole people? The Commonwealth Bank will have behind it the resources and power of the Commonwealth. The power of the Governor to deal with this credit is clearly set forth; he is not to abuse it, but is to carry on in it to a Select Committee, who would a legitimate way the business of banking. He is to compete with other banks, and to do that he must conduct the bank in a busimittee test it by every test known to human ness-like way. The honourable member for Ballarat went on to say that this Bill means unification. I cannot remember one measure introduced during the last three years in which the honourable member has not seen in it this demon of unification. The honourable member for Ballarat has a power of imagination which, if it were directed on his internal economy as it is on the general economy of the nation, would strike him dead the very first breath he drew. The complicated processes of physiological life are such that if a man could see the working of the valves of his heart, the blood coursing through his arteries, contemplate his nervous system, and watch his brain, and realize on what a slender thread his life depended, he would be frightened to move or do anything at all. The honourable member for Ballarat sees, with his perfervid imagination, a thousand circumstances, any one of which would shipwreck every measure submitted by this Government. ' When the Arbitration Bill was before us, he pointed out the differing conditions of the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Tasmania, and asked how any one man was to deal with such circumstances-the meant unification. is that if the honourable member can see unification in the Bill before us he Mr Hughes. CommonweaUh [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bank Bill. can see unification in anything. And what is all this for? It is to impress the man in the street, who has no more idea what The paid-up capiunification means than the babe unborn. The man in the street, however, sees that the honourable member says that the Government, in introducing this Bill, is after his savings, and is going for unification; and the honourable member hopes he will immediately say, ""That is good enough for me; I am going to wipe the Labour party out."" But now we come to the chef d'astivre of the honourable member in the admission that he does not know anything about the subject. That is one of the honourable member's lapses into absolute veracity which He says that if we had more time to discuss the matter, or if there were a longer session, it would be all right. What he really desires is never"" to see the measure any more. He would refer inquire into it, and rake it from Dan to Beersheba; he would have a Select Comingenuity, and then bury it in the deepest shaft of Ballarat or Bendigo. The honourable member, in accumulating his objections to the Bill, said that if it were carried into effect it would increase an already swollen Public Service. According to the honourable member, however, the Commonwealth Bank is doomed to failure from its very inception. He admits at the same time that the bank will grow, but that the poor little puling thing when all of us have passed away will still be in its swaddling clothes. Yet the honourable member' talks about the institution of the bank swelling the Public Service! There is one thing about the honourable member, and that is that he sees a subject from every side. The bank is going to be a success, and it is going to lie a failure; it is going to be controlled politically, and it is going to be placed under the absolute control of one man; it is an enterprise which should be referred to the consideration of a Select Committee in order to obtain further information, and yet he knows enough about it to say that it will prove most dangerous to those thrifty depositors whose growing deposits cause all our hearts to throb with pride. measure, in his opinion, Neither time nor the patience of the AllI have to say House enables me to follow the honourable member further. I can only say that, having come to his amendment, we have come to the end of all things. I only regret that he did not submit the amendment at the beginning of his speech rather than at the end, because it has absolutely nothing to do with his previous remarks. He went from the one to the other as a man might go to murder his step-mother after dancing a cotillion with a fashionable woman-ther e is no relation between the two things The Prime Minister has said that he cannot accept the amendment ; and at this the honourable member for Ballarat professes to be profoundly astonished. Doubtless the honourable gentleman thought the Prime Minister would agree, because both he and the Prime Minister are consumed with a passion for knowledge, and, doubtless, it was in his mind that the two of them might spend the recess, or a greater part of it, in probing into the mysterious business of banking, with a view to enlightening honourable members next year. As I say, the honourable member for Ballarat is very much astonished that the Prime Minister is unable to accept the suggestion, and doubtless the honourable member who will follow the honourable member for Ballarat will continue to express that astonishment. AllI have to say is that the Bill is constitutional, and is a clear business-like document. It places the bank clearly and unmistakably out of the control of any political and extraneous influence, so far as any human institution can De. The business of banking is clearly within our functions, and it ought to have been exercised long ago. Every year the Commonwealth is losing money through having to pay for banking facilities. This bank will do more than an ordinary bank, in so far as it will enable the people of this country, if they so desire, to do business vvith an institution now told that, despite this amendment, the that cannot be shaken by any of the panics or crises that other banks may waver under. It is an institution based on the credit of the whole nation, and an institution, therefore, the credit of which can only be shaken when the credit of the whole nation is shaken. That, I venture to say, will not be in our time. -VV e have listened with interest to the speech of the Attorney-General, who, with his usual rhetorical fireworks, has successfully clouded the true issue that has been put from this side of the House. Circus displays of this kind, involving the swallowing of fire and jumping through hoops, are not arguments, and will not divert the attention of honourable members from the real issue, which the Attorney General has not attempted for one moment to meet. He told us a lot about unification, and described it practically as the "" King Charles' Head"" of the Leader of the Opposition. The question of unification was introduced into this measure by the Prime Minister himself in the following wordsI desire to say quite frankly that I think the passing of this Bill will mean that there will be ultimately only one Savings Bank in Australia. If words have any meaning at all, that quotation means that centralization and unification are included in this measure, as contended by the Leader of the Opposition, and the Attorney-General cannot get away from it. I have to complain of the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister, who said that it is not for the Government to supply information to the Opposition. I apprehend that whatever information was available to the right honourable gentleman has been carefully concealed within the secrecy of the Caucus, but, in introducing a measure of this kind, there ought to be no ground for complaint from honourable members on our side of lack of information. The Prime Minister, and those who sit beside him, have themselves to blame for this amendment. The honourable gentleman never attempted to adduce one solid argument to show the necessity for this .Bill, and more particularly that portion of it providing for tlie establishment of a Savings Bank. largely an experiment. result will be the same. I admit that I think the amendment will be rejected, but we are justified in appealing to the good sense of the House in this way, if for no other reason than by way of protest. This measure will vitally affect the welfare of the community, and we are justified in claiming that we should have the fullest information regarding it. It was open to the Prime Minister to furnish us with the advice of some of the leading financiers of the Empire. On the occasion of his recent visit to London, the seat of finance, he could have consulted the highest experts, and have obtained from them information that would have enabled us to come to some satisfactory decision upon this proposal.

While* some experts whom he claims to have consulted are hinted at, no evidence or advice on the part of experts capable of advising have been brought forward.

We seek, not only the advice which the members of such a Committee would 'be able to give, but the valuable evidence that it could obtain. Does the honourable member for Gwydir agree vvith the Attorney-General in deriding, as he has done, the value of Select Committees in this connection? Does he agree with the Attorney General that Select Committees are usually impotent ? Sir ROBERTBEST that the generality must include the Royal Commission of which the honourable member was a member ? which the honourable member was .a member. was that? There is no such Commission. I have on several occasions refused to act. Acting on the authority of the evidence which a Select Committee would obtain, and judging its value for ourselves, we should be in a position to come to a wiser and 'better decision than we can possibly arrive at now. Another point made the subject of ridicule by the Attorney General was that made by the Leader of the provision enabling the Legislature, by resolution, to of stated that, whilst it was true that this Bil l provided that the should hold office during good behaviour, there was a similar provision in regard to the Judiciary. It is quite true that a Justice of the High Court holds his office during good behaviour. tenure by reason of that office, but the Act under which he is appointed, and which gives him a freehold tenure, provides, also, that a member of the High Court Bench can be removed on the resolution of both Houses of Parliament. The point made by the Leader of the Opposition was that this Bill contains no such, provision. in exactly the same position as the Public Service Commissioner is. upon which a report was Sir ROBERTBEST I shall deal prewhich formed the basis of sently with the position of the Public Service Commissioner.

The contention on this side has been that the experience of al! well constituted banks has proved the necessity of surrounding themselves with a council of advice in the shape of a proper directorate. The Attorney-General picked out for commendation the Bank of New South Wales, which he described as the greatest financial institution in the Commonwealth. If that bank is to be the model which we are to follow, let us examine the precautions taken by it in order to carry on its business upon the soundest and most prudent lines. It has a directorate consisting of men distinguished in business, and particularly in finance, consisting of Dr. Mackellar, Mr Black, Mr Buckland, Mr Binnie, Senator Walker, Sir Normand MacLaurin; ""and in London Sir R. Lucas Tooth, Frederick Green, and H . L . M . Tritton. The Attorney-General, if present, would recognise those names as those of men of great ability and business experience. Surely, then, if the Attorney-General contends that we should take that .institution as a model in creating a Commonwealth Bank, he must acknowledge the necessity for a council of advice.

380,Mr Fenton,"First, the honorableCommonwealth will be at the expense of the publica result which is totally uncalled for. One of the reasons urged by the Prime Minister for taking over the State Savings Banks was that uniformity would result. The honourable member must have overlooked the fact that, practically, uniformity already existed throughout Australia among the Savings Banks, as the result of arrangement. Savings Banks' managers was held in Adelaide in October, conference of inspectors in 1 Melbourne in May last, with the result that the facilities with which depositors can operate on their accounts when travelling in any part of the Commonwealth have been increased, and there is a closer' approach to uniformity of system and method. what had been going oh for some years. There had been an understanding between the New South Wales, Victorian, and South Australian Savings Banks, whereby practically the same forms, regulations, and passbooks were used, arid a general reciprocity established. This has now been extended to the whole of Australia, and it is competent for a depositor in the Perth Savings Bank to make withdrawals in Queensland at once of sums not exceeding Â£ 2 , or of greater amounts after a little delay. The Savings Banks of the States are working in harmony as one institution, and offer all the facilities which a Commonwealth institution could offer. business done in respect to transfers is very large. During the year, the transfers from Victoria to other States numbered 2,274, and covered Â£ 1 3 4 , 1 6 6 5s. i d . , and those be put into Government debentures, which from other States to Victoria numbered 2,820, and covered Â£ 1 5 9 , 3 3 0 16s. 9d. I could not find in the speech of the Prime Minister, or bf his supporters, any other argument for this proposal than the obtaining of uniformity, which, as I have shown, already exists. made that there is a limit to the amount on which the Savings Banks pay interest, it being Â£ 2 5 0 in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports thought that there should be no limitation. the people. has been imposed as the result of practical experience here and in the Mother Country, Â£170,000,000, and the limitation is Â£ 2 0 0 . Experience shows that there is a* degree of fixity which enables the Savings Bank authorities to deal with confidence, working on a reserve of something like 20 per cent., but were the limitation removed, the reserve would have to be enormously increased. It must be remembered that all the money deposited in the Savings Banks is at call, whereas in the ordinary banks A conference of deposits on interest are for periods of a year or two. What is more, when the Sav1910, and a ings Bank raises interest the increase comes into operation at once, whereas in the case of the trading or commercial banks the increase would gradually come into operation and be spread over one or two years. It will be seen, therefore, the methods are different. Suppose the limitation was removed, and it was possible for withThese conferences completed drawals to be made on demand, because of some outside attractions of higher interest, we might have 100 depositors of Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 each walking into the bank some day, and perhaps for days together, demanding their money. The bank might thus be seriously embarrassed, unless its reserve was largely increased, by such sudden withdrawals, and this would alter all the root ideas and principles upon which Savings Banks have been so successfully worked throughout the Empire. The deposits in the Victorian Savings Banks amount to something like Â£18,000,000, and, by law, the Commissioners may invest The by way of mortgage on landed security 25 \ per cent, of their funds, but they are not able to invest _ more than 11 per cent., the balance having to return only from 3 to 3J per cent. If the limitation were removed, the Savings Banks would receive vast sums which they could not utilize, and this would make it impossible to pay, as is done in Victoria, 3 per cent, on the first Â£ 1 0 0 deposited, 1 The complaint has been and 3 per cent, on the next Â£ 1 5 0 . In support of the amendment, I assert that we are working in the dark and without information, and are not, therefore, justified in taking the step proposed by the Government. The facts I have put before the House show that the Government proposal is unjust to the Savings Banks of It would be better for the States, whose arrangements for meeting the wants of the people are now complete and satisfactory, while their management is economic.

I hope that I have dealt now evaded by the Attorney-General in his reply to the Leader of the Opposition. He said that this is a plain measure, and so it .is, so far as the Savings Banks are .concerned. As the Prime Minister has said, this bank is intended to ultimately absorb the Savings. Banks; but he has given no reason why that should be so. He has not attempted .to justify that aggressive attitude, and, in the public interest, I say that no substantial benefits or advantages are going to .be achieved by a transfer such as is now proposed by this Bill. is the most important measure that has been hrought forward by the Labour Government. It is the keystone in the arch of very many beneficial measures which, in time to come, will be referred to by the historian as the finest legislative work done in Australia. We are told by the opponents of the measure that it is not desired by the public of Australia. Bankers tell us that the public are now very well served, that competition is keen, and that profits are remarkably moderate, considering the gigantic risks run by the banks. They also tell us that the autonomy of the present banking is absolutely flawless. If that be so, it is remarkable that, with all this perfect self-government, we should have had .the financial crisis of 1893. If competition be so keen, why is it necessary for the , bankers of Australia to form into a union qr association? As I understand competition, it means that the banks should compete in the market in order to meet the financial necessities of the people. But if we go into the question, we find that the Bankers Union have practically decided that all rates of exchange and discount, and all charges appertaining to banking, shall be based on one foundation. If I wish to cash a New South Wales cheque in Victoria, any bank will charge me half-aThe new accounts numcrown per cent.; and we are confronted with the same rate of interest on deposits and the same rate of exchange on overdrafts. I do not' think that honourable members will regard it as simply a coincidence that all the banks make a similar charge for keeping our accounts. When we realize that the banks of Australia are making something like Â£250,000 per annum for keeping the accounts of the people, we see that they number of transactions was are getting together a very nice.little nest-egg. It is not twelve months ago since the banks with the points so skilfully removed the iniquitous exchange on bank notes ; and that was only because the present Government came into power and proposed to issue Commonwealth' notes. At the present time, if we take a postal note or post-office order to a bank, a small charge is made for cashing it. On the other hand, the Savings Banks, which, though not so democratic as I should like to see them, do not find it necessary to make these charges. For instance, no charge is made for. keeping current accounts; indeed, interest at the rate of 3 per cent, or 3J per cent, is paid on the monthly balance. In dealing with mortgages, the Savings Banks, instead of charging 6\ or 8 per cent., charge only 4J per cent., with 1J per cent, as a sinking fund. I cannot see that the argument as to competition holds water, because the banks take care to have their own unions, though they object to common labourers having the same protection. In 1910 the paid-up capital of. the various banks Was Â£191552,104, and, notwithstanding that enormous dividends and bonuses have been paid, there was .1 reserve fund of Â£9,198,000. There were fixed deposits to the amount of Â£74,600,000, and deposits free of interest of Â£""55,000,000, making a total of Â£-.129,000,000, which was used to make handsome dividends for shareholders, who have paid up only Â£19,000,000 odd. Under the circumstances, I think the public would readily lend this Â£129,000,000 to their own bank, and thus relieve the taxpayers",63,Fisher
383,Mr Ozanne (Corio) [10.40],"Thisof' Australia, instead of enabling a few thousand shareholders to make dividends. On reference to the report lying on the table, we find that, from 1885 up to 1910, the various banks in Australia have provided dividends to the amount of Â£31,530,183. In 1885 there was a reserve of Â£5,727,500, which, to-day, has been increased to Â£""9,198,000. Notwithstanding the financial crisis of 1893, the banks of Australia have been enabled, owing to good seasons, to present to their fortunate shareholders a magnificent return on their investment. On no occasion has Â£23,000,000. 1 read the other day a statement made by a writer in the financial columns of the Argus denying that there was any close corporation in the banking business, ancl saying that nothing was more harmful than to introduce unsound banking practice. Doubtless, this had reference to the Bankers Union which we, from time to time, both inside and outside this House, have distinctly said does exist; and I think I have quoted sufficient facts to prove the truth of that statement. Perhaps the bankers have found it necessary to meet together to protect themselves against possible failure; and, if so, it is a pity their combination did not exist prior to 1893. I "" 1 t n a t Y e a r t h gentleman at e the head of the Commercial Bank, who was considered to be a leading authority in the banking world, declared that, though other institutions might go smash, his own would remain financial. As a matter of fact, however, the Commercial Bank did go smash, and the unfortunate shareholders were required to provide extra capital to the extent of ,Â£752,000. In 1892 they had a reserve fund of over Â£1,000,000, but they had to reduce it by Â£290,000, and, in the following year, 1893, they had to wipe out the whole of the balance. If we could not manage a Commonwealth Bank better than that we should deserve to be described as individuals who know nothing about finance. We have already proved, however, in connection with our note issue, that there are men in the Government who do understand the first principles of finance, and who, when put to the test, are able to provide for the public good profits which previously went to a few fortunate shareholders. I noticed in the Age of the 3rd November an article which exposes the hypocrisy of the arguments of some honourable members of the Opposition. I am not now speaking of all members of the Opposition, because there are some who are not altogether an j tagonistic to the measure, but only desire to strengthen it in certain directions. Those honourable members opposite who, with their Tory ideas, are opposing the establishment of the bank, should hear what the Age saidTo people who see iniquity in all forms of. State bankinghonorable member to be reading from a newspaper leading article on this Bill? member must not read it. pointed out by the writer that the Tory element will always condemn anything that is progressive. ber must not deal'with that matter now. I , personally, recognise anything that is progressive, but the Tory, having hold of the right end of the stick, naturally desires to maintain the privileges he has had for centuries, and which he hopes to possess for many centuries to come. But, with the democratic element, which the Labour party is introducing into our measures, we trust that the wealth-producers of this great country will get consideration, and that not all will be given to the Tory element, which, to 'my mind, is retarding progress. We, undoubtedly, as one honourable member has mentioned, are fighting for humanity. We do not trouble ourselves about the gold, so long as benefits are being conferred on the people who constitute the wealth of the nation. The honourable member for Wentworth said that if we could show that this bank would, facilitate Government transactions there could be no valid reason against its estab-' Hshment. I should like to point out to him that, although he believes that the La-, bour party is opposed to borrowing, the platform of our party contains the plank ""restricted public borrowing."" The inference is that where the amount to be earned by borrowed money is equivalent to the amount paid by way of interest, then we, as a party, would be justified in supporting the floating of a loan. A glance at speeches made by various honourable members will show that we take that view. I have said, time after time, that we should be justified in borrowing for reproductive works.

389,Mr Ozanne,"Then I shall say thatnational works, and it may be necessary later on to borrow several millions of pounds. The Commonwealth Bank could undertake the floating of a loan, and it would secure the large sum that we have now in respect of flotation expenses and brokerage. Again, we have great financial transactions in connection with the carrying out of public works, and there are a thousand-and-one items in respect of which the profits, instead of going into the pockets of the fortunate holders of bank shares, would, by means of this bank, go into the pockets of the taxpayers of Australia generally. The honourable member for Wentworth also' said that we were going to give unlimited power to the Governor of this bank. I think that we have provided sufficient safeguards in that respect. To a certain extent we cannot allow political influence to creep in ; but it is absolutely necessary that this Parliament should know how the Governor of the bank is conducting its business. We do not desire at the end of the year to learn that the gentleman in charge of it is, perhaps, so incompetent that the investments made by him are likely to destroy it. We have, therefore, provided in the Bill itself that quarterly and half-yearly balance-sheets shall be prepared, and laid on the table of both Houses. Surely that should be a sufficient safeguard for people who deposit money with the bank. ' One of the principal reasons why I have pleasure in supporting this Bill is that behind the bank itself we shall have the security of the whole of Australia. As has been pointed out, in the event of a serious financial crisis, bankers thought that they would thus be whilst private banks mignt be failing right and left, the National bank would remain as firm as a rock. Before it could fail the whole Commonwealth would have to be bankrupt. If the people have confidence in the security afforded by private banks, how much greater must be the confidence which the security of the Commonwealth Bank will afford? According to the Commonivealth Year-book for 1910, the notes in circulation in Australia for the quarter ended 30th June in the years 1901 to 1910 averaged Â£3,748,482, and deposits not bearing interest Â£55,233,862, or a total of Â£""58,982,344. As against that there was coin to the extent of Â£28,826,729, and bullion of the value of .Â£1,322,899, or a total of Â£30,149,628. The percentage of coin and bullion to liabilities at call was Mr Oeannt. 51.12 per cent. Turning to the other side of the picture, we find that the average assets of the banks in the Commonwealth for the quarter ending 30th June, in the years 1901 to to pay to outside institutions 1.910, amounted to .Â£138,758,266, whilst their liabilities amounted to Â£135)031,491. Against that liability they had coin and bullion to the extent of only Â£30,149,628. If the banks doing business in Australia are considered to offer a sufficient security, notwithstanding that their metallic reserves are so small, what weight can be attached to the opinion advanced by the Opposition that, notwithstanding that the whole wealth' of the Commonwealth will be behind the National bank, there must yet be a possibility of its failure? It has been said that this is a movement in a new direction, and we have been asked to mention one precedent for the course we are taking. We have been asked whether we desire to reduce the credit of Australia to the level of some of the South American Governments. I should like to refer to the National bank of the Argentine Republic, which was established in 1891 by Dr. Carlos Pellegrini, the President of the Argentine Republic. The various banks at that time had practically driven the country to bankruptcy, and he therefore decided to establish a National bank. Having to meet the opposition of the bankers and many newspapers, he had to resort to trickery. He was not able to secure the passing of the necessary Bill until he had inserted in it a clause providing that the general public should be allowed to subscribe to the stock. The able to gain control of the bank, and the Bill was allowed to pass. As soon as he had carried his measure, however, Pellegrini started his bank on paper money. He had not one copper of metallic reserve behind it. In such circumstances, some honourable members would say there was no possibility of success, but the fact Is that that institution has been remarkably successful. Its position to-day, according to an authority before me, is better than that of any other bank in either South or North America. Its reserves amount at present to 7,000,000 pesos gold. It has a capital equivalent to Â£10,000,000 sterling, and it has 129 branches operating throughout the Republic. On the 30th June, 1911, its proportion of cash to deposits was 49 per cent., as against 34 per cent, in the case of the French bank. 33 per cent, in the case of the Italian bank, spect of which interest is payable is rather and 29 per cent, in the case of the British and German banks. The bank has, therefore, achieved magnificent results, and when honourable members speak disparagingly of the National banks of South America they show that they know nothing about the matter. There is one point upon which I am hardly in accord with the Ministry, and it relates to the proposed establishment of Commonwealth Savings Banks. I think that in this respect we are going to introduce something that is not economically right. If has been pointed out by members of the Opposition that at present we have the States Savings Banks operating in various centres, and that we propose to establish Commonwealth Savings Banks there. In other words, the Commonwealth and the States institutions are going to deal on the Savings Bank cashed just as a with the same people. Where one bank at present exists we are. to have two operating. Under this Bill the Commonwealth Bank The working expenses consequently will be twice as much as the)' are at present. It appears to me that the Ministry might well have consulted the various States, with a view of ascertaining whether some satisfactory arrangement could not be arrived at. Wc know that the States Savings Banks at present use many of our post-offices for the purposes of their business. As one honourable member has said, in Victoria alone several hundred post-offices are used in that they may have at present a capital of way, and if we shift them from those buildÂ£1,500,000 or more. The Prime Minister is ings we shall injure them to a certain extent. I recognise, however, that Savings Banks are collecting agencies for the banks throughout Australia, and that the Commonwealth Savings Bank will be a collecting agency for the Commonwealth Bank doing general business It is absolutely necessary for us to start our bank, but I think it would have been well had the Ministry consulted with the various State Premiers, and endeavoured to arrive at an arrangement that would be satisfactory to all concerned. Sooner or later, I recognise, we shall have control of all the Savings Banks, although I do not think that the banks have had a very fair deal in this regard. One of the chief reasons why I think we should control the Savings Bank business is that the Savings Banks are subject to the Legislative Councils of their respective States, which are remarkably conservative. The Victorian Savings Bank is not as democratic as I should like it to be. In the first place, the maximum deposit in relow. member have it a bank for wealthy people? mim deposit on which interest will be paid to be raised to Â£1,000. That, I believe, is the maximum fixed in connection with the Savings Bank of Western Australia. all the people? that. The depositors, no doubt, will come into our Commonwealth Bank later on. Another objection that I have to the State Savings' Banks is that when a depositor requires to cash a cheque it is necessary for him to produce his pass-book. Why should it not be possible for him to have a cheque cheque on a private bank can be cashed? is to be clothed with all the powers which the banks throughout Australia at present possess. The honourable member for Wentworth expressed the opinion this afternoon that a capital of Â£1,000/000 to begin with would not be.sufficient to enable this bank to do all the work expected of it. The records show, however, that many of our big banks started with a capital of something like Â£500,000 or Â£600,000, although remarkably temperate as regards this Bill. He is not promising any of thewonderful things outlined by the honourable member for Kooyong. He is not up in the clouds, nor is he telling the people of Australia that we are going to create a paradise. It is going to be a bank carried out on sound lines, and as other banks have done remarkably well on a capital of Â£500,000 or Â£600,000, I think we are also going to do remarkably well on a capital of Â£1,000,000. I recall how, in 1887, when the Bank of New Zealand was practically bankrupt, it was saved by the . Government, advancing Â£2,000.000. That is double the amount that we are starting with, but we are not starting in a bankrupt condition. The Bank of New Zealand has already returned Â£1,000,000 to the Government; it has also a reserve of Â£1,000,000, and, during the last four years, it has made a profit of over Â£1,250,000. This measure receives my most hearty support. It is the most important introduced by the Government, and I bave no doubt that its success is assured. At the same time, in all these",65,Fisher
