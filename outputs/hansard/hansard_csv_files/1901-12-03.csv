Another matter to which I wish to refer, is that : warehousemen used to he allowed to ' make clearances from their warehouses at , Adelaide, hut they are now obliged to make' their clearances at Port Adelaide, and, in order to do so, they hwre to employ an agent.

I do not intend to deliver a lengthy speech in support of my proposal, because I am persuaded that no set of men such as are here assembled can be ignorant of the very great importance of the articles -which are enumerated under the headings to -which I refer. They enter very largely into the daily consumption of all classes of the population, and represent some 20 per cent, of the expenditure of the people of Australia. I am very glad that the revenue receipts are exceeding the Treasurer's estimate. right honourable gentleman, of course, discounts the fact by saying that last month was a very heavy one, and that next month the returns may not be so good; but no doubt if fche returns had been below his estimate, he would have been told by us that it was, therefore, so much the more necessary to keep every item on the Tariff exactly as it stands. Every person in this country must use cotton goods whether they are taxed or not, and, therefore, to put duties of 15 and 10 per cent, upon them is an infamous imposition. We find that under the Victorian Tariff, these articles were admitted free. The Treasurer estimates to -receive something like £338,000 from these goods, and whether that is or is not an over-estimate, he should be in a position, in 23 N 2 people merely for tlie sake of taxing them. experimentally in Queensland, but it has But the making revenue. Honourable members opposite are as ready as we are to strike these articles off the list, because the duty on them is really a duty upon raw material. I trust that the Treasurer will regard my proposal in that earlier amendment to move. I propose the removal of butter and cheese cloths, white and grey calico, sheetings, and towellings from the 10 per cent rate, as I think they should come under the 15 per cent, ad valorem dufcy imposed upon cotton and linen goods not elsewhere included, since these particular articles can be manufactured and are manufactured in Queensland.

It was only the necessities of the case that induced me to propose a duty on these articles. If I could nave seen my way to allow this class of items to come in free, I should have been only too glad to do so. for Bland holds a view entirely different from that which I , as Treasurer, hold with regard tofcheduty of the Government and of this Parliament towards the States. He seems to think it is not material that sum to keep the States in the position in which they ought to be kept: I do. I believe that the States entered into this Commonwealth on the faith of promises which were made in the convention, and which are practically embodied in the Constitution-that we should take such steps in framing the Tariff as would enable them to be kept in as good a position as they had been in previously. It is all very well for honourable members to say it is the duty of the States to raise whatever may be short in their revenue by some means of direct taxation. In one of the States, the senior State, as my honourable and learned colleague calls it, there is no difficulty. They have plenty of money, plenty of land. can give them. sir, whether the Treasurer is in order in discussing the relation of the Commonwealth to the States in its broad financial aspects, under cover of this amendment 1 consider a large item of revenue without giving some consideration to that point, and I do not think it can be out of order, sir, for an honourable member to say what effect a reduction or an increase of taxation would have on the finances of the States. be made clear that there is no intention on the part of the Government to run into any kind of debate which will insure that any and every proposal for a reduction of duty shall be debated from the stand-point of its effect on our obligation to sustain the finances of the various States. This is an exceptional case. It is a line which involves some hundreds oE thousands of pounds, .and the broad question whether large reductions or omissions. o£ such lines will affect that obligation which the Government has always held to, and in which it expects the support of the committee, is one which I think may be considered in dealing with large items of ihis sort, while it would have no relation todebates on items which involve only small The honourable member fluctuations of revenue.

I hope, Mr facturers' raw material, and the only arguChairman, you will bear this in mind in giving your ruling. gestion that we are entitled by the rules of debate to consider what will be the effect of the excision of a particular duty on the general financial proposals of the Government. It is the privilege of the members of the committee to deal with every item from the point of view of its effect upon the revenue generally, and to consider whether the object of the Government could not be met by the variation of other dutiesi n the case of an alteration of the duty under discussion. I would remind you, Mr Chairman, that we are not only exercising the functions of a Committee of Ways and Means which deals with the annual Budget, but that we are really dealing as a Committee of the Whole House with fixed duties which will be permanent taxes upon the community. So far as the Committee of Ways and Means is concerned, it is quite competent for any honourable member when proposing to reduce a duty to refer to his intention to increase some -other duty, or to show that if one duty is excised, Supply may be met by increasing another. We have that right according to English practice, and also according to the -colonial practice. sible to avoid reference to the effect upon the revenue of many of the items in the Tariff, and if -the Chairman were to rule as has been suggested, and the Treasurer is not able to make such a statement as he was entering upon, the limits of discussion would be seriously restricted. It rests largely upon members to refrain from unnecessary discussion, so that our debates may not be unduly lengthened, or that the privileges accorded to us-may not be abused. The Treasurer was pursuing a perfectly connected line of argument in pointing out that if certain duties were excised we should lose a very large amount of revenue and seriously embarrass the States. The item now before us is eminently one upon which a general discussion of its effects upon the revenue can be raised without any suggestion of irrelevance. fair if the Treasurer were to be prevented from pursuing the line of argument upon which he has entered. We are pointing out the injustice of taxing the manument that can be used on the opposite side is that the abolition of the dtifcy will seriously affect the revenue. I think, therefore, that reasonable latitude should be allowed,and that every member of tlie committee should have an opportunity of traversing the arguments of the Minister. as to our standing orders, which state that no honourable member shall digress from the subject before the Chair; but I take it that it would be most inconvenient if the committee were to request the Chairman fco give a strict ruling on that point, so far as Ministers in charge of business are concerned. I have endeavoured in the past, with the concurrence of the committee, to allow the Minister in charge offchebusiness to make a general statement, and I have also extended that latitude fco the acting leader of the Opposition, fco enable him to reply to statements by Ministers. A t the sanie time. I have tried to restrict the discussion by other honourable members to the item before the committee. I think that that would be the most convenient course to follow. If I am requested to rule strictly that the Minister is not in order in digressing from the subject before the Chair, I shall be compelled to so rule in every case; but it has been the practice to allow a cerIt is absolutely impostain amount' of latitude to the Minister in Charge of the business and the leader of the Opposition. If the committee give their concurrence to a general debate they are their own masters, and their decision must guide me.

37,The Chairman,"It would be betteryou stated that it is the practice of the House of Commons and of the Australian State Parliaments to recognise only two parties in the House. . But from my own knowledge I can tell you that that statement is altogether erroneous. In the Queensland Parliament three distinct parties have been recognised for a long time. For five years the so-called labour party, which was two-thirds larger than any other party in the State, was recognised ; but in spite of its numerical strength that party was modest enough to allow the so-called leader of the Opposition to take precedence. I tell tliis Chamber that if we are not allowed to take a reasonable course, we shall claim our rights as a party, and"" if we fail to get them by means of the inherent power of the party. ""That is the position which we occupy. be no begging and praying on behalf of the labour party in this House while I am a member of that party. It is just as well, now that the question has been raised, that it should, be clearly and definitely laid down what position we occupy. The business of the House cannot proceed without a coalition of both sides, if the labour party is to be ignored. I do not think, sir, that your ruling is well founded, and I deny that it is practicable in a Parliament of this kind. Wheni n Australia a member of the labour party has been called by the constitutional representative of the Crown to forma labour Government, it is rather too late in the day to give a decision of that kind. end this discussion by saying that I shall make no further reference to the question as it affects the States, but shall deal simply with the effect on the revenues of, the Commonwealth of removing this item. a word before this discussion is finished. The whole idea underlying the granting of permission with concurrence, whether in committee or in the House, to a Minister or to the leader of the Opposition difliculty may arise, because when a Minis-or , for that matter, to any other repreterial statement was made the other evensentative person-is that tlie business may ing, objection was lodged against any reply be facilitated-that we may ascertain, in a by the leader of the Opposition.

I conceive, with all respect, sir, that it is your duty, so far as the standing orders, will permit, to allow that method to be followed which will conduce to the expedition of business generally. As instancing my feeling in the matter, I may say that the other day, when it was suggested that the acting leader of the Opposition might be allowed to make a statement, I was very strongly in favour of permission being given, because, by that means, we were able approximately to ascertain the opinions of his party, and what thenaction would be in relation to certain matters.

If there is any disposition not to concede this latitude to any other section of the House except the Ministry and the direct Opposition, that will in effect mean that no other party will be allowed similar latitude. I certainly object to the leader of the Opposition speaking for the section of the House with which I am associated. While he very properly is the mouth-piece of those with whom he is directly associated, it would not be proper to take as authoritative what that gentleman may say, so far as honourable members in this section of the House are concerned. I only desire to say that, in my opinion, any person who can speak on behalf of a number of honourable members of the Chamber should, with concurrence, be allowed, equally with the leader of the Opposition, to make a general statement on any matter of importance. tion before the Chair; and it will be necessarj', if the debate is to continue, for an honourable member to conclude with a motion.",19,Honourable Members Hear Hear

42,Mr Sydney Smith,"I can see that awise that the question should be settled on some definite basis. perfectly right if you allowed some reference to be made to the' question of revenue, in the same way that on clauses of Bills, references are permitted to general principles, not for the purpose of taking up time, but of explaining how a particular provision may be in contravention of the general proposal. If , however, the procedure were ruled by party considerations only, it would only be necessary for a man, in order to be entitled to speak, to detach himself and claim to represent a fifth or a sixth party. there seems to be a tendency to discuss these items of taxation, without regard to the object for which they are proposed. Are we to understand that in considering the items we are not to consider the revenue which is to be raised ? of Ways and Means. ing every item, I think we should ask ourselves whether we are going to get so much money, and how? Tlie CHAIRMAN -Ihavenot attempted at any time to prevent an honourable member, Minister or otherwise, from making incidental reference to subjects connected with that under discussion, or expressing an opinion as to the effect of an item on do I intend to do so in the f u t u r e; In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Bland, I desire to point out that I occupy a very high and responsible position, and I have to follow the precedents which have been laid down for my guidance. It is not for me to make new precedents ; that is for Mr Speaker and the House. This is merely a section of the House. We are in Committee of Ways and Means, and the question of the recognition of certain parties is a matter which should be determined when the Speaker is in the chair. In calling upon the Treasurer to resume, I would again point out that the practice of the House of Commons, as clearly laid down in Man/, is that the Ministeri n charge of a Bill has a certain privilege which other honourable members do not enjoy in regard to making a general statement. I shall, therefore, prevent upon an item of the Tariff anything like a general debate upon the whole question of the Commonwealth finances. considered this item from a protectionist point of view. It may be that in some parts of Queensland cotton can be grown, and cotton and linen goods can be manufactured. But while a successful attempt has been made in that State by the granting of a bonus to cultivate cotton, the industry may perhaps be looked upon from a stand-point similar to that of the iron industry. There is no certainty that the mere imposition of a 10 per cent, duty would enable it to succeed, and-as in connection with the iron industry-it would _ not be right to attempt to establish it simply by a protective duty. It should be dealt with in a manner somewhat similar to that in which we are dealing with the iron industry. Therefore we regard this item merely from a revenue standpoint. Honourable members will realize that the Government have no desire to impose revenue duties for the mere pleasure, of doing so. It is no pleasure to any Government to take more money out of the pockets of the taxpayer than they consider is absolutely necessary, for the purpose of enabling them to carry on their administrative functions. This is one of the items which the Government, with some reluctance, have included in the Tariff from revenue considerations.

Honourable members, therefore, will, acquit me of any desire to mislead the committee by stating which I do not believe to be absolutely accurate. cannot take the revenue of any two months as a guide to what this Tariff will produce.

I feel bound to place these matters before honourable members before they decide to take away froni the Government this large sum of money which it is proposed to collect by way of a revenue duty.

72,Sir George Turner,"No doubtpossibly may give a better measure of protection to those who manufacture the made-up article. I have felt bound to place,before honourable members the seriousness of the position. I quite admit that no man can foretell the effect of the Tariff from a revenue point of view, but I repeat what I said in my Budget statement, that we must be extremely cautious-that if we are to err we ought to err on the side of caution. If , after the experience of a year or two of the operation of the Tariff, we find from practical knowledge that it is producing more money than was anticipated, -or is necessary, no one will be more willing than I to assist in removing these mere revenue duties. Holding the position I do, and viewing the other items which have yet to be considered, I cannot consent to all the reductions proposed in connection with this item. I have placed the matter from my ptnnt of view before the committee, and it is for honourable members to decide whether they will be guided by the Treasurer, or whether they will refuse to give him what he considers to be a reasonable amount of money with which to carry on the business of the Commonwealth. very glad that the right honourable gentleman has made this very elaborate exposition of his policy. He is now pleading for revenue, but we have passed a division involving £1,141,000, and on nearly every item of that division I cautioned the Government that the duties proposed were prohibitory, and that they were recklessly throwing revenue to the winds. I told the right honourable gentleman that the prohibitory character of the Tariff was absolutely killing his revenue resources, but we never heard a word about revenue before. It is only now after these duties have been passed involving taxation to the extent of £1,141,000 that we hear a word at all about the revenue aspect of the case. When we said we agreed to raise revenue without destruction we were simply jeered at. I tell my right honourable friend that I do not feel inclined to support a duty of 'this kind pressing so hardly upon the whole population of Australia, and especially upon the labouring population, when no consideration has been given to the other items to which I have referred. Besides that, those of us who demanded certain reductions may take the credit of swelling the revenue under this last division, for every item we reduce means thousands and thousands of pounds extra revenue to the Treasury. We have not yet finished with these items, and it is very hard to say whether a very considerable portion of the revenue which the right honourable gentleman expects to receive from these items will not now be received, in consequence of the reductions we have made. If there is not a larger revenue to be obtained from the previous division, it is the fault of the Government for not keeping their compact to introduce moderate protection, for attempting to carry prohibitive duties, as honourable members on the other side have candidly admitted, to keep out the importations. We do not get any fair play at all from a certain section of the committee, and perhaps the members of that section will be able to justify the Government in this proposal. According to the comparative statement placed before us I find that these linen and cotton goods were free in Victoria.' Perhaps those honourable members will be able to justify the position of the Government in that respect. The duty upon them was 5 per cent in Queensland, in South Australia. I am they were free, and in Tasmania the duty was 20 per cent. New South Wales has one-third of the population of the Commonwealth, Victoria another third, and there is South Australia with her proportion. According to this comparative statement, the larger populations of Australia have followed a policj which is against any duty upon these goods. There are one or two other considerations I would like to place before honourable members. If we put a high duty on these cottons we must put a correspondingly high duty upon the manufactured articles, and if we begin high at the base we shall be absolutely committed to the higher duties later on. If we put an extensive duty upon cotton'goods, which cannot be manufactured in Australia, where will be the scientific protection, and where will be our sense of equity when we come to deal with the woollen goods ? If we impose heavy protective duties upon the goods of one manufacturer, we must level up all the others, and I am anxious that in dealing with this matter we should commence upon a proper basis. I admit that the revenue aspect of the duties must be considered, and I have been divided in opinion between the expediency of placing cotton goods upon the free list, and imposing",24,Honourable Members Hear Hear
73,Sir William Mcmillan,"a 5 ^per cent, duty upon them ; but in view of the character of the Tariff so fara great many of the duties which have been imposed having been intended to shut out all importations of the articles upon which they are imposed-and as I shall be very glad if the Government have to review it and go back upon theii"" work, I shall vote for tlie amendment, and the placing of these goods upon the free list. In coming to this decision I am also guided by what I must consider the public opinion of the States in regard to the treatment of these articles, and, as I have shown, they have generally been on the free list. While I admit that under ordinary circumstances they would be fairly open to the imposition of a revenue duty, we must remember that we are dealing now with a highly protectionist Tariff, and that the proposed duties are duties material. If we begin by putting duties upon raw material, we shall be forced, when we come to the consideration of duties upon made-up material to impose higher duties than are reasonable. toria has been to relieve these goods from taxation, and, seeing that we have hitherto heard so much about the Victorian Tariff, we should require very strong reasons from the Government for, in tliis instance, departing from the policy of Victoria. It might be said by honourable members in favour of these duties that it is impossible without them to obtain the necessary amount of revenue. Buti t should be borne in mind that there will be no difficulty in making up the revenue without them. Mr L. E. GROOM -How1 posing reasonable duties upon other articles with which we have yet to deal, and upon some of those which we have postponed. I should like to see a review of the Tariff if sufficient revenue cannot be obtained under it . If we cannot get sufficient revenue, the best thing to do will be to recommit division 4, and go back upon the protectionist policy under which, in breach of the compact made, by the Government, prohibitory duties have been imposed in certain instances. very unfair for the Treasurer to tack on to an item of this kind expenditure which will probably have to be met during the next five or ten years, as though the £338,000 which it is estimated that these duties will return is to be ear-marked to meet that expenditure. I am rather surprised that the right honourable member should admit the inability of the Government to obtain the necessary revenue without a tax upon these goods, seeing that, although he took charge of the affairs of the State of Victoria when it was nearly insolvent, he was able to pull the State out of that condition without a tax upon cotton goods. Erom the three States under whose Tariffs these goods were formerly admitted free, he expects to obtain from the proposed duties about£.254,000 of the total£338,000 of revenue, which he expects to get from the whole Commonwealth. Therefore, new taxation to that amount is imposedI submit unnecessarily-upo n the people of thosethree States. I do not wish to repeat the arguments of the acting leader of the upon raw Opposition as to the probable increase of revenue to be obtained by the lowering of the duties which has already taken place, and the changes which may occur before consideration of theThe policy ,of VicTariff is concluded. Neither the Treasurer nor any one else has said anything in favourof these duties. The right honourable member admitted that they were undesirable, but he did not prove that we could not do without them. The argument that they will producea large amount of revenue is one which should induce honourable members to vote for the amendment, because it is a proof that, the tax will press upon the great mass of the people, and will have to be borne chiefly by those who can least afford to bear it. The Treasurer spoke about the necessity for providing for the needs of the States. B y imI f any of the States are left short of revenue, they must resort to direct taxation to make up the deficiency, and if they do that, the taxation will press upon a class which is able to bear it . The Treasurer, however, would have us save that class by putting the taxation upon those who are least able to bear it . Poor people will haye to buy cotton goods, because they are cheap, although they may not be the most desirable articles of wear, and by imposing a duty upon these goods the Treasurer practically reduces their wages, and makes life harder for them, in order to save the richer classes from direct taxation, which they would be able to bear.

The honourable and learned member is too timid, and if he will look at the statistics of any federation he will find that the Customs revenue from j'ear to year is always an increasing one, that as the population increases automatically the productivity per head goes down although the total revenue goes up. Unless we involve ourselves in ridiculously extravagant habits, the Customs revenue we have had for the last three or four years ought to be ample to suffice for the needs of the States and of the Commonwealth, If we do not check, through a limitation of supply, the great tendency towards federal and State extravagance, we shall be mistaking our duty. learned member is simply pandering to some ridiculous ideas of the dignity of Australia in financial matters by refusing on lines like these to limit supply. That is the true course to take. A duty on linen and cotton goods is, speaking generally, principally a tax on the poorer classes. There is no doubt that the bulk of the linen and cotton lines enters largely into the consumption of the working classes. The honourable and learned member talked about an honourable member going down Bourke street and looking at the shop windows. W ill he find there an effigy of a "" masher "" in a tall hat, a frock coat, and moleskin trousers 1 I defy him to say that most of the items under the head of cotton and linen enter largely into the consumption of the well-paid classes. The bulk of this revenue of £330,000 will be levied on the hard earnings of the poor, practically the only class that gives thorough compensation for every penny it receives, and, therefore, the class in respect of whose earnings we ought to be most considerate. A t the opening of the session the Ministry displayed a wonderful solicitude as regards the mother country. They were anxious that in no imposition should we strike hard against the country from which we sprang. There was an idea to enter into a sort of reciprocal trade arrangement with England. Minister state at Maitland that reciprocity declining to attack the pockets of the poor ? was part of the Government policy, and fl confess that he had not considered, although he did not discountenance, the idea of a sort of one-sided reciprocity, if I can be guilty of a "" bull ""-that is of allowing A man can be honest in consideration in our import duties to imports from England, although we did not ask for any compensation in return. That policy was also mentioned in the Governor General's speech, but now we have a line which affords an opportunity of differentiating to some extent in favour of English imports, not the slightest advantage is taken of it. In fact we are trying to strike at England, because statistics show that hitherto there was practically a free list. As regards productivity of revenue, I have not had an opportunity of examining the Australian statistics, but from the South Australian Statistical RegisterI find that in 1900 the cotton imports into that State were valued at £282,000, that we got £248,000"" The honourable and worth from the United Kingdom, and that practically the whole of the linen piece goods were imported from England. The Ministry are forgetting their little plausible declaration made to catch the ears of the groundlings at Maitland, and at the opening of the session, that the Tariff would be so framed as to display some regard for what they considered to be the weakening exports of England. The honourable and learned member for Tasmania is very anxious about its revenue. Wiry does he not suggest, as an alternative, that this sum of £330,000 should be obtained by a resort to excise duties? Does he not know that excise taxation in Australia is not a fourth of what it is in Europe, England, .or America1 On prior items we have wasted an immense amount of revenue. If we brought the excise duty on narcotics up to the limit of the import duty, we should get a revenue of at least £50,000 more on that line alone. The revenue from the import duty on stimulants amounts to about 47 per cent, of the total receipts from import duties in the six States. In New South Wales, where they had a revenue Tariff, they received 81 per cent, of their revenue from the duties on stimulants and narcotics. In South Australia the receipts from such duties are as low as 32 per cent, of the total imports.

If we refuse to impose duties on -certain classes of goods, there is nothing to prevent us from increasing the imposts on others, and it is a mere subterfuge on the part of honourable members who object to the reduction of these duties to say that we are unduly restricting the opportunities of the Government for raising revenue. These honourable members are shirking their moral responsibility by imposing direct burdens on the poor, instead of substituting less -oppressive duties. It cannot be forgotten that these duties are fixed duties. We are imposing what amounts to a permanent tax, whereas in Committee of Ways and Means in the House of Commons they never impose fixed duties, but deal only with the financial necessities of one year, and pass the annual Budget. We know that the duties fixed in this Tariff will be permanent until the Tariff is revised, and we are aware further that there will probably be no revision for the next ten years. We should therefore be cautious how we impose burdensome duties, which are to endure not for one year, but until some courageous Ministiy, years hence, proposes their repeal. shall not allude to the figures put forward by the Treasurer, because I do not think that they quite place that responsibility on this committee which the Treasurer desires to impose upon us. Some weeks ago I was one of those who expressed the opinion that we should be content with some £800,000 or £900,000 less revenue than the Treasurer was asking for, and the only way in which I can emphasize my opinion is by reducing duties in some direction or other. The Government have successfully resisted all attempts to reduce the duties imposed for protective purposes, but even if we had been able to effect reductions, no loss ' of revenue would have resulted, but rather the contrary. I have already stated that this Tariff presses too heavily in several directions upon the poorer classes, and upon the primary industries of the community, and whilst I cannot go so far as some honourable members desire 23 o in giving relief in one direction only, because I wish also to afford it in other ways, I can join with them to a considerable extent in lightening the burdens of the poorer classes, as we shall not minimize the revenue by lessening the protective duties. That must be done by reducing some of the revenue duties. It then rests with us to make a selection of the revenue duties upon which reductions should be made. I cannot go as far as some honourable members would wish, because I think they are proceeding to an extent that would not be justifiable in ' view of the financial requirements of the Commonwealth. I am ready, however, to support the amendment, because by abolishing the duty on cotton goods we shall not only give relief to the poorer classes, but also get rid of a lot of Custom-house complications, and help those who largely use cotton materials in industrial operations. If we were to abolish the duty on tea we should probably give no greater relief than by placing cotton and Linen goods on the free list. Tea presents no difficulties to the Custom-house authorities, and is not used in any industrial operations, arid, therefore, stands upon an entirely different footing to cotton goods. For these reasons I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney. It has been urged in support of the duty upon cotton and linen goods, which have hitherto been admitted free into most of the States, that a much larger amount of revenue is required than has previously been necessary. The incidence of customs taxation has been bad in the past, and has pressed unnecessarily upon the poorer classes. Such a duty as that upon cotton and linen goods, which is a purely revenue tax, would be specially felt by those who earn only very small wages, and, as very often happens, have large families. Unfortunately, we frequently find that the greater the necessities of the people, the larger the amount of taxation they have to bear, especially in connection with revenue duties of this kind. I have always opposed such imposts, and I certainly will not be any party to allowing the cost of federation to be thrown entirely upon the working classes. I admit the difficulties which the Government have to contend with, but I think the alterations which have already been made in the Tariff will result in",28,Honourable Members Hear Hear
88,' Mr Thomson (North Sydney),I,29,Honourable Members Hear Hear
89,Mr Batchelo R (South Australia),"our receiving a larger amount of revenue than if the original proposals of the Government had been adopted. Unlike the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, I have always contended that tbe first duties of which the public should be relieved are the purely revenue taxes, which do nothing but increase the cost of goods to the consumer. and linen goods are used to a much larger extent by the wage-earners who receive £ 2 or £ 3 per week than by those in receipt of much higher salaries, and as I regard this as a sort of poll tax, I to find that in this matter we are to have the support of tlie revenue tariifists, and I hope they will discountenance all taxes which have an oppressive tendency so far as the working classes are concerned. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -It gives me great pleasure to be able to vote for the relief of the working men and women of the Commonwealth from what I consider a limited amount of persecution. I firmly believe that these duties are nothing more nor less than whips and spurs for the hips and backs of the democracy of Australia. The working people frequently have large families, and are developing the country; and they pay heavily through the Customhouse, while the rich, who generally have small families, pay less. I admit that this taxation will afiect Tasmania, but the question arises whether I am here as a special pleader for the Government of that State. If the Government of Tasmania are incapable of meeting their responsibilities without salting the backs of the workers on the west coast, they ought to retire, and allow abler men to undertake the re-adjustment of the incidence of taxation. The whole financial system in this country is rotten to the core ; but when we have a proper system of taxation, based on the equality of sacrifice, those who have much shall pay much, and those who have little shall pay little. Asimiliar trouble arose in the States of Canada, pal consumers. where the cry was-""Will you persecute the States"" ? But when the States realized their responsibilities and re-adjusted their systems of taxation, the burden was spread over the whole of the people in proportion to their wealth. It is the poor man who pays all. He buys in the smallest quantities, and has, therefore, to pay the highest price, which may amount to 25 per cent., or 30 per cent, more than. is paid by the rich man, who buys in large quantities.. It is the working man who keeps going the> small towns, because, unlike tlie rich, he isunable to get to the big cities and buy hisgoods wholesale. WheneverI have an. opportunity, protectionist as I am, I shall, consider the stragglers and endeavourers. who are developing this country. have discussed this question as if the wholeof the items proposed to be struck out referred to goods exclusively consumed by the poor or poorest classes. But that is not the case. In framing our Tariff we originally shall vote against it . I am glad provided for two classes of cotton goods, one, the more valuable, to be taxed 15 percent., and the other, the less valuable, to be taxed at 10 per cent. afterwards. duced both classes to an equality of 10 per cent., in order, amongst other reasons, toarrive at that convenience of administration which has been so often referred to. Originally we specified the poorer articles at 10 per cent., allowing all others to come in as ""n.e.i.,"" at the higher rate. The poorer articles comprise blue frocking, butter and cheese cloth, calico-whit e and grey, drills, duck, dungaree, jeans, moleskins, oil baize, leather cloth, sheetings (including Forfar, dowlas, and flax), shirtings-white , Oxford, Cambridge and Havard, ticks, towellings, window-nets and hollands. I think those who have. any practical acquaintance with the trade will see that in this group are fairly described the lower classes of articles. When the Government were discussing this matter I received a memorandum from an official expert in confirmation of the view which we took of the Tariff. The memorandum statedApart from "" calicoes, white and grey,"" and ""cotton sheetings,"" and ""Forfar dowlas and flax sheetings,"" also ""corduroys,"" which are largely used by the poor, I think it may be truly said that people in good circumstances are the princiThere are honourable members who have a trained knowledge of this subject, and we are advised by experts elsewhere, whose reputation is at stake if they advised wrongly.

The Government have never concealed in the slightest degree from honourable members their desire to avoid taxes which can be fairly avoided, particularly those which press too hardly on the poor. There are three or four rates of duties provided for in the Tariffi n connection with which we should be only too glad to afford relief if we could do so; and not once or twice, but several times has the Government put that position before honourable members. Speaking on the 14-th November, the Treasurer saidThere are a number of items, such us tea, rice, kerosene, and cotton goods, which are looked upon as practically only revenue duties, and it will be a matter for our consideration whether we shall not ask the committee to deal first with the x-est of the Tariff, in order that we majsee how it is finally settled, allowing these four large revenue-producing items to stand over. In the meantime we shall have some experience of the revenue-producing power of the other items, und that will guide us in asking the House to take a certain course in regard to the purely revenue-producing items I hare mennot two tioned. 20th November, to give expression to practically tlie same sentiments. I said, We propose also to strike out the exemptions I cannot state at mentioned in the third column, so that the cotton and linen piece goods there enumerated will also be imported under a duty of I d per cent. I think.it is very probable that tlie revenue from these goods will remain about tbe same, notwithstanding the alteration of duty. We recognisefcheimportance of the question as to what rates should apply to these goods, and if circumstances permit we should like to see an even lower duty than 10 per cent, imposed upon them. We gain information as to the working of the Tariif as time goes on, and it may be that when only 2£ per we come to finally consider the matter, it may be seen that there is room for even more lenient treatment of the goods in question. It has always been the wish of the Government, in regard to these items, particularly kerosene and tea, which are purely revenue producing lines, to do what we canto relieve the poorer classes from the burden which will be cast on them.

Tea is consumed by rich and poor, and the poor man's tea, unfortunately, will pay the same rate of duty as that of higher quality whioh is used by the rich. But taking the three items of tea, kerosene, and cotton goods, are we prepared to say at this moment that we will entirely abandon taxation on cotton goods, knowing f u l l well value of the two classes of goods. The goods that as a result it will be more difficult to upon which we proposed to levy a duty of 10 deal with the other items as liberally as we might desire? If we remit or remove a large amount of taxation here, Ave cannot to the same extent remove or remit when we come to the other items. It would be wise for us, in this general connection, to consider what is best to be done in regard to these three items, rather than hurriedly come to a conclusion to deal with the first without considering the claims of the others, and prejudice, as we must, claims to relaxation made in respect of the latter. I put this position all the more. strongly for the reasou that the leader of fche Opposition contended that if we relaxed taxation in the way suggested he would show how it could be made up in some of the postponed items, and also pointed to the possibility of doing that in regard to goods from duty, notwithstanding the fact some items which we had already passed. What itenu have we postponed or proposing to postpone?

I ask honourable Tea members generally not to hurriedly decide on this general relaxation. Wouldi t not be infinitely preferable that this item should be postponed for consideration in connection with other items at which we shall shortly arrive? A t the least when it is proved beyond the possibility of doubt that the classes of goods which the honourable member proposes to strike out, include goods standing in two different categories, do not let us adopt any rash mode of applying the arguments which operate in tlie one case to that of the other. HereI may say that I am now in the happy position of being able to answer a question which has been asked regarding the relative per cent, are valued at £1,040,000, whilst those upon which we proposed a 15 percent, impost represent a value of £1,560,000. I am inclined to think that honourable members generally are disposed to do a fair thing. They know also that the Government wish to do a fair thing. If the financial conditions were such that we could dispense with a revenue duty in this case, we should be only too glad to adopt that course. Our whole attitude in connection with this Tariff has been to seek opportunities for remitting duties in connection with all reasonable claims to exemption. Those claims relate chiefly to three great items, namely, kerosene, tea, and cotton goods. Are honourable members prepared to say that they will exempt cotton that those which we propose to tax at the higher rate represent an aggregate value of 50 per cent, more, and that we are told in so many words that the way to make up the deficit is by retaining the duty upon kerosene and tea, and increasing it if necessaiy ?

I have looked at them from the revenue stand-point, and also from the stand-point of the opportunity which they would give our people to earn something. But now we come to an item when the question involved is not one of employment, but of revenue only. t Yet the honourable member stands up and says in effect"" Away with the revenue. Down with the idea. Here is £350,000 which can be struck off at one fell blow, and I am prepared to strike that blow."" In such circumstances, when the honourable member rises in future to talk about such trifling considerations as £20,000 or £30,000 it will be our duty to remind him that he was prepared to sacrifice £350,000 in direct defiance of the principles which he so eloquently advocated. The Government are with honourable members in regard to their democratic wish to .avoid harsh dealing with the poor. not as if we were setting up this claim for the first time. It is consistent with our principles throughout. Our every action shows it . There are. items which have been reserved for final decision ; and I ask whether we are now hurriedly going to say that the noses of the poor shall be held to the grindstone. think that honourable members will not come to such a conclusion, but that they will prefer to deal with those items by classes which will properly separate the goods of the poor from those of the rich, and to leave matters relating to their clothes, their light, or their breakfast table, to be considered and dealt with at the one time. do not know what the Minister for Trade and Customs meant when he spoke of a reversal of form on the part of the acting leader of the Opposition. The only reversal of form of which I know is that the acting leader of the Opposition during this debate has undoubtedly evinced an attitude of intense sympathy with the poor struggling working people, and has in season and out of season striven to diminish the burdens which they are asked to bear as the result of federation. On the other hand, the Minister for Trade and Customs has embraced every opportunity to make it imposThroughout the sible to lighten those burdens. ter judge of cant in this House than is the honourable member. The Government are merely anxious to postpone the consideration of these items in order that they may ascertain the attitude of the committee, in regard to the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who wishes to further inurease the burdens of tlie people. Their policy is a most easy way of sweeping aside all consjderations of revenue. No more reprehensible course than that adopted by the Treasurer this afternoon has ever been taken in any Parliament. The right honourable gentleman came down whilst the committee were deliberating upon an item in committee, and made another financial statement. He interposed upon a certain item, and endeavoured to show that the federal expenditure is piling up so enormously that it .is absolutely necessary for the committee to give him all the revenue which is asked for. His action It is was a deliberate attempt to influence the debate in a way that has never been attempted before. I should not have objected to his statement if it had not been made for thepurposeof morally coercing the committee into giving him the revenue which he seeks. In my judgment these articles ought to be placed upon the free list. They are articles I venture to of common consumption and of common necessity, and' though a Tariff is a good deal moulded by circumstances and not by our voluntary choice, we ought in these circumstances so to frame our Tariff as to give some relief in respect of those articles which enter largely into the every day life of working people. Notwithstanding what has been said by the Minister for Trade and Customs, I venture to assert that the items now under discussion will affect the working people of the Commonwealth more than the middle classes and people who are well to do. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has indicated that he is going to propose increases upon items which are to come on for consideration later.

Knowing that that money remains in the pockets of some of the people, I am going to submit a proposal which will put practically the whole of these goods used by the poorer people on the free list. I am prepared to support a duty of 10 per cent, on higher-priced goods under the item "" cotton and linen piece goods n.e.i.""

I object to him giving us information based upon highly exaggerated estimates. The Minister for Trade and Customs does far more than that. He said, in the first place, that he hoped we would postpone this item. That is the great argument of the Govermnent-postpon e and delay things, and keep out of awkward corners. He wants us to postpone the consideration of this item as we have already postponed the duties on tea and kerosene. laboured and miserably inadequate attempt to show that the duties here proposed do not press wholly upon the poorer classes, he asked us to deal with them as we have dealt with the duty upon tea, an article which, on his own showing, is consumed by every human being on the continent. .But we must deal with everything upon its merits. I am given to understand that the Government are in favour of the exemption of articles which are used chiefly by the poorer classes, and I therefore want to know from them whether, if I withdraw my amendment, and move as separate amendments tlie placing of ""cottons and linens "" and of "" cotton and linen piece goods "" upon the free list, they will vote for the first, ami will allow the'amendment to place ""cotton and linen piece goods"" upon the free list to be dealt with upon its merits allow ""cottons and linens"" to be placed to ask the Treasurer whether he considersupon the free list if the committee w ill , agree to a duty of 10 per cent, upon ""cotton and linen piece goods."" bargain of that sort, because either the duty is right and should be imposed, or there should be no duty. .But, to facilitate business, I am willing to divide my amendmentin the way I suggest. I agree with theacting leader of the Opposition that it is almost impossible to distinguish between piece goods and the cottons and linensenumerated above. I have here a sample of dress-lining which the Custom-house officials, who are assumed to be able to discriminate between cotton and linen piecegoods and other cotton goods, declare to beapparel, although it has hitherto come in as a minor article. The same officials declare an ordinary hat-pin to be jewellery, and charge 25 per cent, duty upon it . These uncertainties and ambiguities do more harm to trade than the Tariff itself, and it is thereforeimportant that people should know exactly what goods are dutiable and what are not. of the Government is to obtain a reasonableamount of duty from these items, and to show that I was willing to meet the committee, I said that we were prepared to accept a duty of 7£ per cent, all roundI t has been pointed out with some force that the poorer class of goods ought not to bearconsideration of the proposed as high a duty as the better class. We had After a that opinion when we framed the Tariff, ashonorable members will see; but some difficulties arose in connection with the working: of the particular items, and to obviate them, we offered to make the duty 10 per cent., all round. Although there will be difficulties in the administration, still they arisein every Tariff, and from time to time have to be, and are, overcome. Under thesecircumstances I shall raise no objection to the honourable member for West Sydney testing the feeling of the Committee as toputting the particular items he mentions on the free list, and afterwards we can take a. vote as to remaining items, and then I hope,, as we have shown a desire to meet the committee with regard to the poorer class items, it will allow us to have a dufcy of 10 percent, on the other items, which will give us a fair amount of revenue from the better class ; of goods.",35,Honourable Members Hear Hear

My object is to get the very poorest class of goods placed on the free list, and I am now naming some items for the consideration of tlie Government. » Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN be new names given to other things which come in? but we can only deal with those things we know at the present time. I admit that the proposal of the honourable member, for a 5 per cent duty all round, is the easiest and simplest so far as the revenue is concerned. But, at the present moment, what we are considering is how best to exempt from taxation the class of goods which the poorer people use. My suggestion is that in addition to those named by the honourable member for West Sydney, dennins, galateas, .zephyrs, and shirtings, not being flannelettes, ought to be placed on the free list. I recognise that we are now in a quandary in having three proposals before the committee. The proposal I intend to support is the exemption of certain articles with a duty of 10 per cent, on the balance. If the honourable member for West Sydney will add to his list dennins, zephyrs, galateas, and shirtings not being flannelettes, I shall vote with him, and support the Government in their effort to put a duty of 10 per cent, on the balance. shall vote to place on the free list the articles under the heads of "" cottons and linens,"" from "" blue frocking"" down to *' hollands,"" because, judging from the State Tariffs, it is a fair thing to do. I am prepared to consider the other matter afterwards. I may say, in reply to the Minister for Trade and Customs, that I give very much more consideration to these items than to either tea or kerosene, because they are very largely used by the great bulk of the people. While we cannot differentiate so as to say that the wealthier classes shall not use them, we know that cottons and linens enter considerably more into the cost of keeping a household than does either tea or kerosene. I hope I shall not be accused of making a protectionist speech when I say that in putting such articles on the free list we shall large number of female workers, and if any class of manufacturing employees word ""frocking."" require assistance, the weakest of the number are deserving of consideration, does not apply to tea or kerosene. Therefore we are not only giving an opportunity to poor people to procure these goods at first cost, but we are also offering additional facilities to the sempstress and others who are engaged in making up the M a y there not raw material. It is this class of workers who have received less consideration than any others under the Tariff. W it h regard to the other suggestions that have been made, I feel confident that the Government will be prepared to review their proposals. mated earlier in the debate that I intended to move for the omission of butter and cheese cloth, calico, white and grey, and sheetings from the list of cotton and linen goods, subject to a 10 per cent"", duty, with a view to having them included among cotton and linen piece goods not elsewhere included, upon which it was proposed to place a duty of 15per cent. pose to alter the form of my amendment, so as to permit the honourable member to take action in the direction he has indicated.

I shall not object at the present stage to their being included, but reserve my right to make further inquiries, and if necessary bring the matter before the committee again. In the meantime, I accept the proposal to omit blue frocking from the list of dutiable goods. know where this is going to end. All the materials mentioned in the list are called by the names which are given to various cotton goods in Manchester. They are all cotton goods, call them by what names we may. Some of the material which the honourable member for Bourke desires to have admitted free is manufactured at Manchester for -£d. a yard, and directly honourable members on the other side begin to express free-trade ideas I become suspicious at once. How is it that we are hearing so many requests for the omission of these articles from the dutiable list 1 Isi t because the country party, which is composed of the representives of half-adozen Victorian constituencies, have been making representations to the Government, and are attempting to "" boss "" the Commonwealth 1 The whole of these goods should be treated as cotton and linen goods generally, and placed on the free list without having a whole string of names applied to them. M.r. CONROY (Werriwa) I am very much surprised at many honourable members who profess to be protectionists endeavouring to fasten a duty upon articles which are the raw materials for many of our manufactures. An attempt is being made to impose an unnecessarily high tax upon the people. These duties of 10 and 15 per cent, are equivalent to 2s. and 3s. in the £ . If the protectionists take up the view that these duties are necessary for revenue purposes, we reply that the revenue which the Government are attempting to raise is far too large. It may nol be too large from the point of view of some of the States, but we are legislating here for the Commonwealth, and have to itudy the interests of the entire community. This impost deserves the serious attention of honourable members. Protectionist members, knowing that the free traders in the House were determined to cut down this taxation, have for once joined with us, and may thus obtain credit, which properly belongs to our party, for lessening the amount of duty. I have heard from the protectionists no discussion of this matter from the manufacturers' point of view, and I should like to know why our friends opposite have lost all their solicitude for that class to which they usually devote their attention. If one class of manufacturer is entitled to have blue frocking brought in as raw material, then other manufacturers are entitled to have their raw material admitted free. What surprises me, from a protectionist point of view, is that cotton should be placed on the free list, when we are informed that protection is wanted for the woollen manufacturer, and that cotton goods come largely into competition with woollens. From the point of view I have indicated, cottons ought to be subject to a duty of perhaps 30 per cent., seeing that such a duty would deprive the people of the chance of buying cotton materials, and would greatly increase employment in the woollen industry. It is interesting to hear from protectionists the admission that the tax is paid by the people here, because that shows that, having listened to our arguments, they have been converted to our point of view. This item is of the greatest importance to the community, and it would be a mistake to pass it without discussion. Figures showing the consumption of these goods ought to have been furnished by the Treasurer, because, with such information, we should have been in a much better position to discuss the general question as to how the revenue is affected. It may be that the revenue will be considerably interfered with, and yet we are voting to a considerable degree in the dark. It is no part of the duty of an Opposition member to help the Government in framing a Tariff, seeing that we do not believe in customs duties, and I shall certainly support the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney.

163,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I should like toso far as the Customs department is concerned. Amendment agreed to. That the following words be omitted"" Butter sufficiently protected, and partly to the and cheese cloth, calico, white and grey."" In submitting the amendment, I am actuated by a desire to encourage the growth of a staple which, at one time, was of immense service in settling a large number of people upon the lands of Queensland. During the whole of the sixties and seventies, nothing contributed more to land settlement in that State than did the growth of cotton. contemptuous terms that this industry is a mere nothing. But I would point' out that the same remark was applicable to all the industries of Australia at one period of their existence. I remember when it was stated that the richest part of Australia would not grow a cabbage. Why was that statement circulated ? Because the pastoralists wanted to keep the land for themselves ? So long as there are large merchant princes who are interested mainly in importation, they will be desirous of keeping the supplies of the Australian , market iu their own hands. They have no desire to encourage manufacturing industries or to find employment for the people other than in pastoral, agricultural, mining, or mercantile pursuits. I have a higher ambition than that for the coming generation. see them develop the mechanical instinct. That is why I maintain that even at the cost of a little self-sacrifice we should estabare, after a crop or two of cotton has been lish Commonwealth. I am merely asking for the omission from this item of four lines. I have submitted samples of those lines to the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs, who I think, will agree, that they are very failsamples indeed. This industry is a ""mere nothing "" to-day, because it has not received that measure of protection which it should have received. It has always had to compete not only with the goods of England, America, and Germany, but with the cotton of India, where the cheapest labour is employed that is to be found in the world. It is true that Queensland gave a bonus of £5,000 for the first £5,000 worth of cotton goodsmanufactured in that State, and placed upon the market, and it has been said that as soon as the bonus was exhausted, the industry collapsed. It is a coincidencethat the factory did close shortly after thebonus had been earned, but its failure farmers growing more cotton than the factories could consume. No one can question the quality of the Queensland cotton. In this connection, I might point out that in the sixties it was awarded the gold medal at the Paris Exhibition for the finest quality of fibre in competition with the Egyptian and American cottons, and cottonsfrom other parts of the world. Not only can fibre be It has been stated in rather grown in Queensland of equal quality to that of any other cotton in the world, but at the present time a small factory is. in existence, which, if encouraged, might, be the precursor of great things. Two thousand spindle's and 50 or 60 looms are standing idle there, although thisfactory has turned out first class calicoes, sheetings, towellings, cellular cloth, ifec. I merely ask that some little encouragement should be-given to the leading lines which this factory has been established tomanufacture. If we grant this encouragement I believe that the cotton-growing industry in southern Queensland will be re-established, and will eventually assume large proportions. There is a .very widearea in that State suitable for the growth of cotton. Even as far north as Bundaberg, the cotton plant has been I want to successfully cultivated. I would also point out that lands whose fertility for cultivation of maize has become exhausted, manufacturing industries . in the grown upon them, restored to their virgin richness."" Upon all these grounds I commend the amendment to the favorable consideration of the committee. we could firmly establish the cotton industry in Queensland it would be a very good thing for the Commonwealth, but it appears to be the feeling of the committee that the particular articles which are used by the poorer people should be placed upon the free list. That being so, I regret that we cannot see our way to support the honourable member's amendment.

I believe-and on the point we have the assurance of the acting leader of the Opposition, who, although he does not call himself an expert, knows more about the subject than most of us-that practically it will be impossible for any man to say in regard to many articles under which list they should come. The Treasurer, after having made it to appear that ruin would inevitably overtake fche Commonwealth if the committee insisted on a reduction of more than 2^ per cent., acquiesced in, if he did not actually much more.

Treasurer, has, however, announced that he will allow certain articles, which have been named, and similar articles that may be brought under his notice, to be put upon the free l is t ; but he has frankly informed the committee that he cannot afford to lose the whole of the revenue that may be expected from this item. or £125,000 of revenue, is no reason why he should give up the whole £.350,000. West Sydney says that the action of the Treasurer is not that of a man who is hard up, and he proposes to make him hard up by taking the remaining £200,000 from him. I would have the greatest pleasure in placing all these things on the free list. Protectionists and free-traders alike are in accord on that point; it is only revenue tariffists who would place duties upon such articles. But during the debate on the address in reply and upon the Budget, it was constantly reiterated that the Commonwealth must raise a large amount of revenue through the Customs. It has been said that by placing protective duties upon certain articles we have lost the chance of getting as much revenue as we might otherwise have obtained; but my answer to that is that, if those duties had not been imposed, a large number of men would have been thrown out of employment. In consideration of the attitude which the Ministry has taken up in regard to previous items, I feel bound in honour to support them now. I know the difliculty which is raised about discrimination. I dare say that a duty of 5 per cent, all round on these two lines would have meant far less trouble in the practical working of the Tariff than there is at present, but we also know that the committee would not have agreed to its imposition. It is not so fair, just as the Governthey may do all the crowing. From ment's second proposal of a 10 per cent, duty all round was not so fair as their original proposal for a duty of 10 per cent, on one line and 15 per cent, on the other. Althoughi t is probable that the "" n.e.i."" class will be found to include some items of common use, still I think that tlie list of special exemptions includes the great bulk of the articles in common use, and what is left in the ""n.e.i."" class will not be more than those which will fairly cast on the less wealthy portion of the community such a burden of taxation in proportion to their The means as I admit would have been cast on them by the original proposal. If the understanding with the Government to impose a 10 per cent, duty on this class be carried, we shall sacrifice a considerableamount of revenue, bufc we shall have adjusted the burden of taxation much more reasonably and equitably than did their original proposal. AVhatever my That he has given up £100,000 feelings about the dutyon cotfcon and linen piece goods may be, I feel bound in honour to follow the Government in supportThe honourable member for ing the proposal to.have a 10 per cent, duty on the "" n.e.i."" class. I understood! that in agreeing to the last item without a. division we were carrying out one part of acompact, and I feel it my duty in fairness to support the other part of it . somewhat difficult to please the committee. First of all we had the proposal that these goods should be admitted absolutely free. Then our honourable friends on the other side differed as to whether the goods should be admitted free all round, or whether they should pay a duty of 5 per cent, all round, My honourable and learned colleague suggested a means out of the difficulty which I think will be regarded as fair by the majority of the committee. We fell in with the view that it was perhaps a littl e hard to impose any duty on the poorer classes of goods. But at fche same time, I think it is not unreasonable to ask that this particular class of commodities should pay something to the revenue. I am not going to take any notice of the remarks of my honourable friend who twitted me with giving away revenue. Ib appears to be the practice of some honourable members on that side, whenever It r y to meet the difficulties which naturally arise, to crow if they gain a point or two. But so long as we can do what is fair and equitable, a 10 per cent, duty on this item as ifc stands we expect to collect £150,000, and the articles can well afford to pay the duty. It is suggested that we should enumerate the articles. But any one who has had experience of the Custom-house, as I have had, knows that if we enumerate articles that are dutiable they are very soon introduced under different names, and a claim made that they are free of duty. We liave tried to put on the exemption list everything that should be",42,William Mcmillan W E Cannot Discriminately To All Articles Not Elsewhere

But we -cannot attempt to enumerate the goods which are to be dutiable, because I know what it would lead to from my experience -of two or three years of the Custom-house. I have no objection to give the names of some of the articles which this line will -cover. Tapestry, cretonnes, chintz, damasks, sateens, linenettes, crepons, crimps, prints, piques, vestings, quiltings, marcellas, muslins, nets, diapers, and laces are the main articles which will be included. While some of them may be cheap and others more expensive, at the same time we may fairly say that they are all of a class which ought to pay something. The very cheap articles a t 6d. or 7d. a yard will not pay very much at 10 per cent., but the expensive articles at 4s. or 5s. a yard will pay in accordance with their value. take prints out of the list. are very valuable. We all know how the fashions change. If some of the better-off people wear goods which are not veiy much used now, others will follow their example and there will be a good demand for the more expensive descriptions. However, I think the offer we made that the cheaper class of goods which are more extensively used by the poorer people should be placed on the free list, and that the others should pay the lowest revenue impost we are proposing of 10 per cent., is a very fair one. ""We have spent several hours over these items, and we have a large number of other items in the division to deal with. I am certain that we have all made up our minds, and I hope that we shall now get to a division and that the committee will accept our reasonable proposal. vote for the remission of the 10 per cent, duty. I should prefer to have a 5 per cent, duty all round because I believe that to free some articles and place a 10 per cent, duty on the others will lead to a great deal of dishonesty and place the honest trader at a disadvantage. If we removed the duties on cotton stuffs the people would have more money to purchase other articles on which duties are imposed, and in that way we should get more revenue. We ought to consider the persons employed on the wharfs, and in the shipping industry. We have passed a fere with the shipping industry in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and other ports, because every duty of a protective character which prevents importation undoubtedly takes away work from the wharf labourers and others. I do not see why we should not consider that class as well as those Who are employed in other industries. I understand that the honourable member for Moreton seriously suggested that we might make cotton goods in. the Commonwealth, but I do not think that the great majority of the committee believe that for a great many years we can manufacture cotton goods. Therefore, any duty on cotton goods cannot possibly be of a protective character. Taking the articles on which we cannot place a duty of a protective character, the more imports we have the more work will be given to the wharf labourers and others, and they will have money to buy cigars, whisky, and other articles which are liable to very heavy duty. Of course, I would rather see the people spend their money on cotton and woollen stuffs, but at the same time they will buy whisky and cigars, and if the Treasurer is simply considering the revenue, then undoubtedly, if they spend their money on articles on which the duties are heavy, he will get a large return. I should like to see the duties removed from everything if possible. I believe the honourable member for Wentworth was right when he said that this discriminating duty will lead to a tremendous amount of dishonesty. I should prefer the imposition of a 5 per cent, duty all round to the admission of some articles free and the taxing of others at 10 per cent., but as the committee. have decided to free a large portion of them, I shall not hesitate to vote for the freeing of the others. am sorry that this position is taken up, because, although there was no understanding with the Government, there was a very strong inducement offered to them by interjection and otherwise to agree to put the first line on the free list. It was then suggested by interjection that we should put 10 per cent, duty on the other lines.

188,Mr Poynton (South Australia),"Iimposition of a' 10 per cent, duty on this particular line. The Treasurer included laces and lace flouncing in the list of enumerated goods which would come under the n.e.i. classification, but I find on reference* tc item 64 that those articles carry a 15 per cent. duty. I think that the Government has not made out a case in favour of this proposal. Sir different from the other. lace. ment tried very hard early in the evening to show that extra expenditure would be forced on the Commonwealth in consequence of taking over certain services which are in contemplation. This goes to show that the Treasurer, in raising this revenue of £350,000, is trying to provide for certain expenditure which had not been taken into consideration when he came down with his estimates. When he made his statement early in October he said definitely that there would be a balance of £500,000. When the Prime Minister was before the country, it was distinctly stated that the Tariff would realize about £8,750,000 and all the lines of contemplated expenditure referred to by .the Treasurer were taken into consideration by the Governmeut. Inasmuch as the Government have consented to the remission of duties representing revenue to the extent of £150,000, it is is clear that they feel confident that they will be able to raise the f u l l amount required to carry on the Commonwealth Government and to meet the necessities of the States. Such high duties have been levied upon articles which it is desired to protect, that revenue has been to a very large extent destroyed. The Government have broken their pledge to the country, and now wish to take out of the pockets of the working classes the money necessary to make up for the deficit that will result from the protective incidence of the duties which they have already fixed upon. The articles we are now discussing should be placed on the free list, and the Government, with a balance of £500,000 over and above immediate requirements to meet all possible contingencies, could well afford to make the further concession. The Minister for Trade and Customs has represented that whereas the goods on the 10 per cent, list would be very largely used by the 23 P poorer classes, the goods on the 15 per cent, list will be consumed by people who are better able to pay the duty. All classes of the community, however, dress well when they have the means, and goods of the class which it is proposed to tax at 15 per cent, will be found in use among the poorest people. I hope, therefore, that the committee will not consent to exact from the masses of the people duties which they up veiy much the same position as the. honourable and learned member for Corinella.. Nothing would give me greater pleasurethan to see the whole of these goods placed, upon the free list, although among. thearticles mentioned by the Treasurer were a number that might fairly bear some taxation, because they are used purely forornamental purposes, and can under no circumstances be counted amongst the necessaries of life. By placing a duty upon thesegoods, we cannot be charged with unduly adding to the burdens of the poor. ,We have to consider the necessities of the-various States, which are already beingplaced at a disadvantage through having surrendered control of the Customs and! Excise to the Commonwealth. The bulk of the community who use a great many of the articles which would come under this duty of 15 per cent,, do not regard them as necessaries, but asministering to their comfort. I am veryglad to see these goods used, and to feelH that the great majority of the people are ini a position to enjoy the comfort resulting, from their use, but these very people will endorse the action we are now taking in, subjecting these goods to a duty. They will agree that at this particular juncturethey should be prepared to bear a certain, share of the burdens which the Commonwealth find it necessary to place upon them.. Those honourable members, who, like myself,., would have all the necessaries of life placed upon the free list, do not believe in revenue duties per se, but desire to see taxation levied in such a way as to benefit the whole community, and to provide employment, for the people. We are told that some of the articles which will be subject to this duty are of no great value, and surely that constitutes a strong argument in favour of the Government proposal, because under an ad. valorem duty those articles which are in-, expensive will not have to bear an excessive",44,William Mcmillan W E Cannot Discriminately To All Articles Not Elsewhere

Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN member does not mgan to imply that there was any compact made. was any compact. I do not think there has been any compact between the Government and members of the Opposition, but after the statement Of the Treasurer as to the .amount of revenue which will be lost to the Government owing to the concessions they have just made, we must all recognise that they have gone as'far as we can expect at present, and I hope, therefore, that the commitbee will support the Government proposal. no compact in connection with this item, and I feel under no obligation to support fche Government proposal, because Of any concessions which may have been made in connection with' other articles. My first obligation is not to the Government but to the people who sent me here, and I have to consider their wishes. An attempt has been made in connection 'with these duties to differentiate between articles that are used by the working classes, and those likely to be used by the more well-to-do -classes of the community, but without -claiming to be an expert, I have a strong suspicion that many of the articles -enumerated as among those used by people who are well able to pay the duty enter extensively into the daily necessities Some of fche articles enumerated are -dress materials used by the women of the working classes, so that a large proportion of the increased taxation will fall on the toilers, whose burdens I wish to see lightened as much as possible. ' Under Customs taxation it is the great masses who foot the bill, and that has been and always will be the case. The items are defended by supporters of the Government on the plea that this taxation, while undesirable owing to the burdens which it imposes on the masses, is necessary in order to raise revenue. These honourable members with strong protectionist proclivities regret that this need prevents their going to the full extent of putting these articles on the free list. But I do not -admit that there is this need to compel the committee to impose this taxation on these particular lines. In my place here I have coinbatfced fche Stand taken by the Government that they are Compelled to finance the States as well The honourable as the Ee'deration, and I hold that it is quite open to them to allow these articles to appear on the free list, and to 'adopt the Other alternative oi which they do not seem fco approve. The Tariff has been devised for the two-fold purpose of giving protection to certain industries, and of raising a very large amount of revenue. Bufc if the Government were prepared to remit a portion of the duties on these items which they have singled out for special treatment, fchey would get a larger amount of revenue, and place a greater-share of the taxation on the shoulders of those best able to bear it . In that way they could solve the problem, and allow these lines to go on the free list. I shall vote with the honourable member for West Sydney; and if I cannot get these lines on the free list, I shall endeavour to get them made as nearly free as possible. The committee are entitled to definite information as fco fche amount of revenue to be received, or likely to be received, under this Tariff, which has been in operation since the 8th October. The Treasurer has said he believes that the paragraphs in the newspapers, and fche information conveyed to honourable members on this point, will not be borne out when the actual figures are submitted. The acting leader of the Opposition will remember that in the State of New South Wales on the 1st orfche2nd of of the working classes. every month a full statement is given of the actual amount Of revenue which the Treasury officers have received on account of the several services. In the first month of this Tariff, according fco the statement which we have had, the Treasurer received : £840,000, which is at the rate of over £11,0,00,000 more per annum than he estimated.

I say that if the Treasurer had not put on these prohibitive duties there would be no occasion now for him to complain of an attempt fco reduce purely revenue duties. Surely that is relevant to the subject before the committee ? Wfe cannot separate these items. The items of the Tariff are interdependent. The Treasurer puts on duties which absolutely k ill revenue, and he now tells the committee that he cannot permit any reduction in those items, which are relied on to give revenue. It is these prohibitive duties which render it necessary to impose an excessive duty upon such items as this. Unless the Government are prepared to give some guarantee that they will take the duties off kerosene, galvanized iron, and other things used by the settlers and pioneers in the back country, I shall vote for the reduction of this item, although I have admitted that I think fche compromise made in this case is a fair one. Unless some such guarantee as I have suggested is given, I shall be forced into the uncompromising position of voting for the reduction of every one of these revenue-producing duties, for the reason that it will compel the Government to reconsider the prohibitive duties they have imposed, and so bring their Tariff down to a purely revenue basis. a good deal from the other side about pro. hibitive duties, but I do not know of one Every duty passed so far has been considerably less than the duty imposed under the I am not in the habit Victorian Tariff, and yet, as has been pointed out before, though out of a total import of £18,000,000 worth of goods, only £6,000,000 were taxable, from that we raised from£2,300,000 to £2,500,000 a year I have been good in Victoria. No doubt honourable members accustomed .to free-trade look upon these duties as somewhat high, but we, who have been accustomed to high duties in Victoria, look upon them as moderate, and in no I decline to have my sense as prohibitive. This duty on cottons and linens has a peculiar significance for various reasons. In the first place it is one of the duties from which a large amount of revenue is to be derived, and if the Government are to be deprived of the revenue which they expect to carry on the Commonwealth, the shortage will have to be made up by direct taxation. The acting leader of the Opposition harps continually upon the compact made at the elections, but if there was one general understanding 1 relevant to the item ?. able member is going beyond the question. the back of the demand for the reduction of this duty 1 I do not blame the honourable members who have avowed it , but it is openly declared that the reason is that we may have to resort to direct taxation.

That is the object avowed by honourable members in tbe labour corner, and they are being aided and abetted by our friends in direct opposition. There was a distinct understanding that we should not have direct taxation, that we should keep up the revenue of the States, and that it should be left to themselves to resort to direct taxation. afraid that the honourable member for Echuca is drawing a new trail across the track, because there is not the smallest",48,George Turner Cotto N Lace Is Should Not Be Called Upon To Pay

It has been stated over and over again, that if a particular duty is sacrificed, there is no intention to prevent the necessary revenuefrom being raised by some other means under the Tariff. Having consented to the abolition of the duty on the last item, free-traders are bound to see that tlie duty upon this item is also abolished. We had the co-operation of Ministers in proposing that the 10 per cent, duty should be taken off comparatively raw materials, and now when we come to manufactured articles they. want to impose a duty which did not exist previously in three or four of the States. The object is protection. We have admitted the raw materials free, and now they want to impose a tax on the manufactured article. It is not surprising that the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures support this proposal. advocate the imposition of this duty in order to bring about the greater consumption of woollen goods, a truly protective idea.

If a difference of 5 per cent, was justified in the first instance, how can a difference of 10 percent.be justified now? The Ministry tell us that £225,000 of revenue is to be expected from this duty, and we are asked to vote for it as a revenue duty; but are there not many items with which we have already dealt in connection with which they have diverted far more than that sum from the pockets of the taxpayers to the pockets of particular manufacturers ? In my opinion, the proper interpretation to be put on the initials "" n.e.i."" is not that given by the. Government, but that suggested by an honourable member on this side of the Chamber -""nearl y everything included."" The articles not enumerated outnumber those which are enumerated by a thousand to one. It must also be remembered that what are called piece goods are the raw materials of the dressmaking and millinery trades-. In Victoria 3,782 persons, and in New South Wales about) 2,370 persons, are engaged in those trades, so it is safe to assume that 7,000 persons are engaged in them, throughout the Commonwealth. Yeti t is proposed to put 10 per cent, upon the raw materials which they use, and thus to discourage their industiy. I shall support the proposal to place these articles on the free list, because it seems to me absurd to make any distinction between them and the cottons and linens already dealt with.

232,Mr Crouch (Corio),"I m o v eat some length. According to a return presented to the House on the motion of the honourable member for Kooyong, there were 1,504 persons employed in the woollen industry in Victoriai n 1900. In 1898 there were 1,306 employees; in 1899, 1,445. the constituency I represent, fully one-half of the woollen mills in Victoria are situated, and certainly a large proportion of the male operatives are employed there. extracted from a return prepared by the Government some figures showing how the duties have operated upon the .industry in the various States during the last few years. In New. South Wales under free-trade there were in 1898 five factories, the number having been reduced to four in 1900. In 1898 there were 231 employees, the number having decreased to 219 in 1900. In 1898,185 horsepower was employed in these factories, which was decreased in 1900 to 165 horse-power. NowI wish honourable members to notice the great distinction between these figures and those which relate to Victoria where a 25 per cent -duty has been in operationthis duty representing the minimum protection necessary for the successful carrying on of the industry. In 1898 there were in Victoria eight factories, and in 1900 one more. The number of male emplovfes increased from 426 in 1898 to 526 in 1900, and the female employees from 387to 487 during the same period. Thus, whereas in New South Wales there had been a decrease of twelve in the number of employees, the operatives in Victoria had increased by 200. The only other place where there has been any increase in the number of employees in the woollen industry has been in Tasmania, where the duty has been 20 per cent., as compared with 15 per cent, in the other States. The number of employees has increased in Tasmania from 157 to 177. These figures show clearly the absolute necessity for a high duty to adequately protect the industry. The wages paid to operatives in the woollen mills throughout Australia are higher than those received by workmen similarly engaged in any other part of the world. I have a return prepared by the Ballarat Woollen Company, in which they submit a comparative statement of the wages paid in Victoria and other parts of the world. It is shown that in tweeds the operatives at Huddersfield are paid from 4-|d. to 9 Jd. per .string, against lOd. and Is. 8d. at Ballarat. In worsteds-whit e serges are woven in Wellington, in England, the average is one weaver to two looms at 12s. per week. In Ballarat, the average is 33s. per week for a weaver working one loom only. The hours of labour in all woollen mills in England are 56 hours per week. In Ballarat In the hours of labour are 48 per week only. In further support of that position I shall quote what appeared in the Yorkshire Factory Times on the 27th November, 1899, I have as follows:The following is a copy of a letter which the secretary of the General Union of Weavers and Textile Workers( Mr Allen Gee) has received from Ballarat, Australia:Ballarat, 27th September, 1899. Dear Sir, Enclosed you wil l find a copy of the Ballarat Woollen Mills Weaving Rates. The scales which yon forwarded came safely to hand, for which I thank you on behalf of the Ballarat Weavers' Union. Yours truly, Annie Close, Secretary. Then follows the scale as set out. In the same paper there is a leading article which states:A COMPARISON. In another column will be found a few parti-, culars in respect to weavers' wages said to be paid in Australia, or at least in one portion of that continent. Some time ago a correspon-i dent from Ballarat wrote to the secretary of the Weavers' and Textile Workers' Union, in Huddersfield, asking him to be good enough to supply the Ballarat Weavers' Union with a scale of prices paid in his district, and after consulting his executive the necessary information was sent by Mr Gee, who asked in return for the prices paid in Ballarat. The information is now to hand, and no doubt it will be of considerable interest to those engaged in the industry here. At the Antipodes they are evidently going through a set of circumstances similar to those experienced by the weavers in England. The scale is based upon the ""Four-box Fast Looms,"" seeming to imply that fast looms are now taking the place of the slow loom, and for this latter kind of loom 2d. per string extra is paid. An idea of the difference between the prices paid for weaving there and here may be obtained by comparing a woollen warp at home and at Ballarat. The Ballarat weaver, who is weaving a job with 30 picks, two shuttles, on a slow loom, gets 19s. 6d. for a cut of eighteen strings. In Huddersfield a man weaver would get 12s. 9d. for the same job. A t 40 picks, the price in Ballarat is 24s. 9d., whilst the price here is 16s. (id. Honourable members w ill see t h a t one result of the establishment of the in d u s t r y in V i c to r i a has been the payment of f a i r wages. I know that an argument constantly used against the continuance or increase of. the duty is that the industry has been protected for nearly 30 years. But further protection is not asked for, those interested stating that they are satisfied with 25 per cent., but that, they cannot stand any decrease. It must further be realized that 35 years is a short time in the existence of an industry, and a mere trifle in the history of a nation. Afte r the Australian industry has been protected for about 500 years, as it was in England, it will be fair to talk about a reduction. It was in the year 1200 that: a start was first made to create thisindustry in England.

238,Sir Geobge Turner,"The GovernmentSir member has a perfect right to move foran increase of. the duty if he thinks fit. say that it is an extravagant amendment, 1 which only proves what we have said all along, namely, that there are a certain number of gentlemen on the other side who are of opinion that every duty in the Tariff should be the Victorian duty. The Government reduced the duty by 5 per cent., and then did not arrive at an average; but this honourable member wants the rate brought back to that which prevails in Victoria, which is taken as the only standard without regard to other States or other conditions. I do not intend at this stage to say what I want to say, because I cannot view with any seriousness the proposal of the honourable member. bound to be a great difference of opinion in settling a fair dufcy on an item of this kind. On the one hand, we have New South Wales, where this commodity was absolutely free, and on the other we have Victoria, where the duty was 25 per cent. But we can get some guide as to the terms on which an industry may flourish by looking outside Victoria, and without going to New South Wales, whose conditions, some may say, are exceptional. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN an occasional trip, mentally, to New South Wales? trip, mentally, to New South Wales, and I hope I bear in mind the claims of the senior State. Our friends in New South Wales very often forget, I think, what must have been in their minds before they joined this Federation, namely, that they were joining partners who would require them fco give up a great deal of what they had been accustomed to in their methods of taxation. sympathy with thepeopleof New South Wales, it is impossible that their claims can be quite met; and, on the other hand, we cannot expect them to submit to extremes of taxation. I should say, even to those who desire fco see the woollen industry progress, that there is no need, in view of the experience of other States, for the large protection which is asked for. The honourable member for Corio has drawn attention fco the fact that the number of people employed in this industry in Tasmania increase has been 120 per cent. The quantity of wool dealt with in the facB u t I tories of that State has increased 350 per cent, in the same period. If Victoria used wool to the same extent that it is used in the factories of Tasmania fche former State would, deal with double the quantity. Under what conditions has fche industry in Tasmania been enabled to flourish as it has done ? In Tasmania those engaged in the industry not only supply to a great extent the local market, but are competing, in the better lines of production, in the free market of New South Wales. 426 worth. small-abou t £30,000 worth in a year ; and I am only pointing out that if the industiy in Victoria were on the same scale, it would be of much larger demensions. The quantity of wool used in Tasmania is 1 lb. out of every 7 lbs. of its production, whilst in Victoria the consumption represents only 1 lb. out of every 30 lbs. of its production. The industrj' in the State which I represent has been developed withoutfcheaid of any extreme protection. One large mill has doubled its hoise-power within the last few years, and two others have introduced new and valuable machinery. W h y not take The owner of one of these mills declares that any manwho cannot be successful with a protection of 20 per cent, deserves to go to fche wall. I suggest that fche New South Wales representatives should accept a 20 per cent, dufcy on fche understanding that it should continue for three or four years, in order to give the industry in Victoria a chance to come down from the high level of protection under which it has been carried on, and to return to the other States fchafc amount of' revenue which, I think, they will acquire from this item.

244,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I intend toancl learned member for Corio made out a very good ease so far as he went, but I find from the Statistical Register that there are only 917 hands employed in the industry in Victoria, despite the fact that it has enjoyed a protection as high as 35 per cent. I would further point out that New South Wales has produced some of the finest tweeds in the world without the aid of any protection.. In Queensland, where wages are higher than they are in Victoria, big dividends are paid by the wool industiy, although the protection which it has hitherto enjoyed was only 15 per cent. How then can it be urged that a duty of 20 or 25 per cent, is necessaiy for the encouragement of the industry ? In this connection I have received a letter from one of my constituents in the far north which I should like to read. The writer saysThere is one aspect of the proposed federal Tariff which seem3 to have been overlooked, but which is of the utmost importance to a verynumerous section of producers, viz., wool growers, shearers, and all those connected with the wool-growing industry. Sir George Turner, the federal Treasurer, has said' If what we propose is likely to injure any industry . we are perfectly prepared to ascertain the views of the various parties interested . . . . to modify or alter any of the anomalies which may possibly exist."" The anomaly I would point out is the proposed heavy duty on woollen and worsted goods, on woollen yarns, and on carpets. Of the burden they impose upon the consumers I have nothing to say here, because these burdens are borne by all consumers, and not by wool-growers, shearers, carriers, & c , specially. But the fatal defect of these duties, a defect which does not-7-so far as I am aware-apply to any other proposed duties, either protective or revenue, is that they must materially interfere with the consumption of wool, and thus tend to appreciably lower the price of Australian wool. A remunerative price for our wool is the very life-blood of our prosperity. In spite of the terrible losses in sheep, arising from the drought cycle, which is not yet over, Australia is still the greatest wool producing country in the world, growi ng aim ually about 1,250,000 bales. More than this, among all the varied sources of wealth enjoyed by the Australian Commonwealth, the wool-growing industrj' gives the largest result. Wheat, butter, gold, silver, and coal, though, products of great importance, all give first place to wool. A rise or fall of only I d . per lb. means roughly a difference of about £2,000,000 to our national income. The general impression seems to be that the consumption in Australia of goods made from wool is so small that it is hardly worth about. This, however, is not the case. the population of Australia seems small compared with that of other great countries, but against that the people of Australasia are among the Mr Page. largest consumers of wool per head (in its manufactured form) of anj' other people in the world. The result is that our importance as . customers of England's woollen manufacture is out of all proportion to our population. The Bradford Observer, some twelve months ago, wrote:-Taking our exports of all kinds of wool put together, 17 per cent, of the whole goes to Australasia, and 9J per cent, to Canada. Next on the list stands France, with 9 per cent. The United States takes only 8 per cent, of our'wool goods. The actual values of the exports from the United Kingdom during 1900, of manufactures of wool of all kinds, are thus given in Messrs. Helmuth, Schwartze and Co.'s annual wool report :To Germany £3,681,000 „ France 1,658,000 „ Australia 1,618,000 ,, South America 1,455,000 „ United States 1,212,000 . „ Canada 1,201,000 To all other countries and not specified 10,966,000 Total £21,791,000 Deduct imports 10,672,000 Net exports -£11,119,000 It will be seen that of the net export of £11,119,000, those to Australia amounted in -. . 1900 to 144 per cent. The United States, France, & c , have of course and large manufactories of their own, which accounts for the comparatively small consumption of British goods, but the above figures show that the consumption of woollen goods, worsteds, and carpets in Australasia must already be an important factor iu the demand for. wool throughout the world, and as the population of the Australian Commonwealth 'expands, its demand for wool-if not interfered with b j ' hostile legislation-mus t become greater. Isi t wise, therefore, that the Commonwealth Tariff should do anything to restrict that demand? That the proposed duty of 20 per cent, will tend to diminish tbe consumption of wool goods in Australia and thus restrict that demand is an absolute certainty. The injustice to the whole of those engaged in the wool industry is all the greater, From the fact that it is now quite possible that the materials which compete with wool, and which drag down its price, will be admitted free, I allude to calico, and to various forms of manufactured cotton, and particularly to what is known as ""flannelette. with the duty proposed 1 w it h it , from the producer's poin t of view.

246,Mr Page,"It has everything to docountry oi fche world, it is grown and handled almost exclusively by white labour, and at every stage it employs the highest wages. Its merit is not cheapness, but its great suitability for clo'thing, and above all its acknowledged healthiness. "" Wool is the best material for all kinds of underclothing,"" says an eminent authority on hygiene. Bufc its high cost ex poses it to the merciless competir tiou of an infinite variety of cotton fabrics. When cotton has been so cheap, and wool so costly, the resources of inventive genius have been well nigh exhausted in the effort fco substitute cotton for wool, either by fair means of foul. cause many of fche most successful usurpations of wool by cotton, have been made by deluding the consumers into the belief thatfcheywere buying wool materials, when they were only getting imitations made chiefly from cotton. Those engaged infchewool industry of Australia do not ask for any special favour from the Commonwealth Tariff. They do not ask that the consumption of cotton shall be repressed in order to encourage the consumption of wool. But what they have a right to expect, and what I doubt not the Federal Legislature will on reconsideration grant them, is that t i e Federal Tariff shall not discriminate against Australian wool in favour of its greafc rival, Cotton. Wool is grown in Australia. It is grown by white men. It employs labour at high wages. On the other hand, cotton is not grown in Australia. It is almost exclusively trrown by black labour, and probably by the lowest paid labour of any important industry in the whole world. What, therefore, justice demands, and what reason and statesmanship dictate, is that under no circumstances shall any higher duty be imposed upon the manufacturers of wool, than are to be imposed upon the manufacturers of cofcton or other competing textiles. The present position is a serious one to the wool industry. The w r it er concludes by sayingI t may not be out of place to refer here to fche terribly low price to which Lincoln and coarse cross bred wools have now fallen. These wools, which are mainly grown by small farmers, are now selling at the lowest prices ever recorded, and at those low prices are sometimes almost unsaleable. member see t h a t if we use t h a t wool here, # we can pay the growers a better price. ber w ill not catch old birds w it h c h a f f ; the w r it er f u r t h e r saysCoarse cross bred and Lincoln wools are a glut and a drug in the markets of the world. This is simply because the demand for goods made from them has fallen off. Surely then, this is not the time to place a duty of 20 per cent, on woollen goods,worsteds, and carpets, and thus discourage their use and diminish the demand for them in one of fche great wool consuming countries of the world. Those are the words of a practical squatter in Queensland, where they have to p u t up w it h everything as well as the drought.

I do not know what more honourable members want to prove that this to be a tax is upon the consumer, not only of 20 per cent., but of 15 per cent, in addition, because he must pay that before he can get a yard of cloth to make up his clothes. Mr Thomas M. Gobie, managing partner of fche Albion Mills, was examinedThe Chairman -Hav e you seen bhe cloth submitted to us as shoddy, made in Victoria? Yes.

The honourable me/nber for Southern Melbourne has prompted fche honourable member for Corio, and I am pleased that he should have interjected that I was an advocate for the squatter. The growth of wool is the only industry in the district I represent, and the pastoral district of Queensland is as large or larger than New South Wales. I have said that we do not want protection, but we do want a square deal.

All that is necessary to encourage woollen factories is a duty of 15 per cent. Considering all the charges incidental to the export of our surplus wool and its return in the shape of woollen goods, a duty of 15 per cent, ought to give a very fair impetus to the manufacture of woollen goods in the Commonwealth. I feel that with the aid of that duty the industry will prosper. far has been of a representative character, inasmuch as we have had contributions to the discussion from representatives from four out of tlie six States. Not only so, but the interests of the manufacturers, the pastoralists, and the consumers have been advocated. The honourable member for Corio represents an electorate in which the woollen industry is a very important one, and he was performing his manifest duty in seeking to influence the committee in favour of the imposition of a high duty. On the other hand, we find the honourable member for Gwydir, as a leading pastoralist, distinctly opposed to the duty, whilst the honourable member for Maranoa has spoken most forcibly from the point of view of both the consumer and the pastoralist. The honourable member for Tasmania has expressed himself as being content to have the duty continued for another four or five years at the rate of 20 per cent. But, if we grant assistance for that period, we shall have tlie greatest difliculty in discontinuing it . which the duty shall operate. duce the committee to do that. The honorable member for Corio would not be content to have the duty limited to any particular period, and members of theMinistry, who apparently regard this as a revenue duty, would be similarly disinclined to fix any specific term beyond which the duty should cease to operate. This cannot be looked upon by the Government as a protective duty in the sense of its operating to the exclusion of imports, because the Government expect to receive from it revenue to the extent of £100,000 per annum in I hope to see Victoria, and £115,000 in New South Wales, whilst the total to be derived from I can the whole of the Commonwealth is £335,000. We have some very successful woollen mills in operation in New South Wales, and the prosperity of the industry is there indicated by the recent extension of the Marrickville mills in the electorate of the honourable member for Lang. Large buildings have recently been erected there, and the extension of operations thus provided for was decided upon long before any information could be obtained as to the fiscal policy that would be adopted by the Commonwealth. The success of our woollen mills depends very largely upon the introduction of the latest and most approved machinery, and upon enlisting the most expert assistance from the old world. If we are to compete successfully with the woollen manufacturers of Great Britain and elsewhere, we shall have to follow their practice of renewing the mill machinery every five years, and incorporating the very latest improvements. This will involve the employment of large capital and ""the most efficient managers. It has been stated that one reason why Australian woollens have not met with general acceptance in the local markets is that they lack variety of pattern. The material is good and thoroughly serviceable, but it does not attract the public taste, and this is a matter that will require to be remedied if success is to be assured. In New South Wales, under free trade, the woollen industry has been built up on a thoroughly sound foundation, and, after the experience gained in that State, we free-traders cannot be expected to consent to an increase of the duty as desired by the Victorian manufacturers. If the natural protection afforded by freight and other charges to which the imported article is subject is added to the 20 per cent, duty It will be difficult to inproposed by the Government, the protection given to the local manufacturers will amount to 30 per cent., and that should be more than ample to meet all the necessities of the case, even from the point of view of the local manufacture.

Objection was taken to the statement of the honourable member for Maranoa that he supported the wool industry of Australia, and consequently objected to anything likely to reduce the consumption of wool. 'The honourable member was charged with being^ a squatter's advocate, and replied that if he were, he was advocating an industry which asked nothing from the country, -whereas the industries advocated by others have asked for very considerable concessions. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said he could not understand the argument of the honourable member for Maranoa that the pastoral industry would be injuriously affected if the prices of woollen goods were forced up by a high Tariff. It -cannot be said for a moment that local buyers of wool will give anything more than the London price, less the cost of sending it to London. .able member that in connection with several industries in which woollens are used, far higher prices are paid. member is asking us to give protection to men who manage their business in such a -foolish manner as that,' we should refuse to -do so. If a squatter can get a certain price by sending his wool to London, he will readily accept that price, less transit expenses, if offered on the spot, without having -to wait until the London returns come back. If we give consideration to manufacturers we must see that we do not enable them to raise the price of their products unduly, -so as to force consumption on to other .goods, and consequently reduce the consumption of Australian wool. If any in-dustry should prosper it ought to be the woollen industry of Australia under the new -conditions of federation. I do not say that the industry had the same opportunities under the old conditions, because the -difficulty of providing diversity of pattern, make, and weight for the small population -of one State must have met manufacturers -frequently. -disadvantage in the smallness of the market, in competing with the manufac-turers of other countries ; but now there is -a large and increasing market of nearly 4,000,000 of people, and a much smaller duty 23 Q ought to be sufficient. One ""Victorian manufacturer, as we know, wrote to the newspapers saying that he did not require the duty; and no manufacturer would do that if it were not a fact. He admitted that for some time he had not been prosperous, but he showed that that was through following wrong methods, and that, now he had obtained proper machinery and system, he did not require, any duty. There is a natural protection of at least 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, in sending the wool to England to be manufactured and returning the cloth j and, under, these conditions, the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth is sufficient. There are in-, eluded in this woollen duty a large number of items which were free in the Victorian Tariff, and there will consequently be a considerable accession of revenue. The value of the importations into Victoria of such items, principally dress goods part wool, was £300,517, and a duty on that amount: at 20 per cent, would realize £66,000. while a duty of 10 per cent, would, of I can assure the honorcourse, produce exactly one-half. The im ' portations into the other States of these ' materials represented a much larger revenue, and, with these other goods included, I do not know how the Minister comes to anticipate from a -20 per cent, duty on all woollens, only some £300,000 odd. If we take the same rate of imports as we find in .Victoria, these extra goods ought to yield about £198,000 at 20 per cent. that there be a 15 per cent, duty, and in view of the proposals to increase the duty to 25 per cent., and to reduce it to 10 per cent., I should like to know my position. member can move that the amendment be amended by omitting 25 per cent, with a view of inserting 15 per 'Cent.

If the amendment-now before the committee be defeated,, There was a considerable the lowest rate proposed will'then be put to the vote.

I do not feel disposed to support a duty of 25 per cent. In South Australia there are a couple of woollen factories which have progressed very well under a protective duty of 15 per cent. I have had no request from them to support a higher rate, which is pretty good evidence that they do not desire one. They turn out a very good article which competes fairly well with the imported article. I fear, however, that a 5 per cent, margin between the duty upon piece goods and made-up apparel is scarcely a sufficient protection to the local manufacturer W it h a low margin there is a greater chance of slop goods coming in.

A fair compromise has been offered by the Govermnent, and most honourable members, when addressing their constituents, said that the Tariff would have to be a compromise between tlie two contending parties-the free-traders and protectionists. We all felt that there could not possibly be anything approaching prohibition, any more than there could be anything like free-trade. I believe that the Government have struck a fair average in suggesting that tlie duty should be 20 per cent., and I therefore.urge upon the honourable and learned member to withdraw his amendment. inclined to withdraw my proposal. TheI f tlie course sugGovernment have compromised when they should not have done so.. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, has asked whether I expect the committee to accept the amendment. In reply I desire to say that I expect the committee to act with common sense, and to deal out justice to established industries. Even the acting leader of the Opposition, when .addressing the electors, said that he would endeavour to preserve vested interests, and established industries. It is veiy unfair at this stage to t r y to wipe out those industries, to reduce the wages of workmen, and diminish the output of Australian factories. The honourable member for South Australia has said that the factories of that State got on very well with the aid of a 15 per cent, duty. But I would point out that from a return presented to this House at the instance of the honourable member for Kooyongi t appears that there was only one factory in South Australia in 1898, one in 1899, and one in 1900.

In 1899 it was 1150, which represents an increase of 50 per cent., and in 1900 it was 1305, an increase of nearly 100 per cent. That is the best answer that can be possibly giveu to some of the statements which have been made by various honourable members. The result of tlie operation of a 15 per cent, duty in the other States is only too. apparent. Under tlie Government compromise it may be possible for the industry to struggle on, but it will certainly never prosper and expand. I therefore ask the committee to vote for 25 per cent, as the minimum amount of encouragement which the industry is entitled to claim. honourable members who urge that the proposal of the Government constitutes a fair compromise, upon what premises they base their calculations? The"" t in p o t "" industries which have been referred to have not commissioned any honourable member as special pleader for them. I am perfectly certain that no honourable member has received a single letter from the woollen manufacturers of Queensland asking for a higher duty, and those factories pay big dividends. If what have been so contemptuously referred to as "" tinpot"" industries can pay their way without increased protection, the sooner the big industries of Victoria go to the wall the better. If an industry, however small, pays fair wages, and is able to disburse dividends, that is the industry in which the honourable and learned member for Corio would invest his money. I do not believe that the honourable and learned member knows upon what he bases his calculations. necessary to keep a Victorian factory in existence. 23 Q 2 member to come to Queensland, and see the industry flourishing under a 15 per cent, duty. wish to tell the committee that there are two of these mills in my own electorate, and I have no hesitation in saying that I shall vote against the increased duty proposed, and for the reduction which is contemplated later on. The honourable member for Corio says that if this increased duty be not granted, the mills in the district he represents cannot carry on. If that is so, the industry there is not a natural, but an exotic one, and it ought to be allowed to drop out of existence. I object to the statement that this industry cannot be carried on even at a lower duty than that which the Government propose. So long as these industries are coddled-they will work with obsolete machinery, and will not supply themselves with the latest appliances, and so long will we have a condition of enfeeblement and a small output. The great thing required in connection with an industry of this kind is a large output and a ready market, and that can only be secured by up-to-date machinery, ancl by up-to-date methods and styles. I venture to say that this industry will receive more benefit from the act of federation, and the opening up of the markets of the Commonwealth, than from perhaps any other we could think of. All that has been wanted has been an enlarged market and an enlarged output, which will enable those engaged in the industry to meet the constant demand for new patterns and new fashions. AVoollen mills have been enabled to exist, and do well in New South Wales, where there are no duties, and there is no reason why they should not do equally well in Victoria. The Parramatta mills in my own electorate turn out a quality of tweed equal to that turned out anywhere. They have paid 6 per cent, dividends for a long time, they have doubled then capacity, the 1 number of hands employed has been largely increased, and they are prospering exceedingly. The tweed mills in another portion of my electorate are also doing well. The output is constantly increasing, and I beg leave to doubt the statement that the industry in New South Wales is declining. The two mills which I know particularly , are decidedly on the up-grade, and are prospering without any duty at all.

If an industry is coddled and insured a market, and is not exposed to the healthy competition of the world, those engaged in it will not take the trouble to bring their methods up to date. That is why, mill for mill, those in coddled by enormous duties have not done so well as mills in other parts of the Commonwealth where tlie duties have been extremely low. I do not believe that people should be asked to pay these enormous duties for the sake of finding work for anybody, nor do I believe that the removal of this duty will lead to the lowering of wages and to the reduction of employment. have already had an experience of this kind in New South Wales. We were told a few years back that if we took off certain duties there. would be nothing but collapse and stagnation. some of these industries a little fresh air, with the result that they have continued to exist and flourish, and to-day the industries of New South Wales are in an infinitely healthier condition than industrial enterprises in Victoria. Parliament I have lieard nothing but an outcry about the precarious character of the national industries of Victoria, and a feeble wail that if the infant is taken from the State breast it will immediately Nothing of the kind would occur. industries would have to accommodate themselves to the new conditions, and would be all the healthier for it. The sooner we stop this feeble wailing in this Chamber on behalf of the industrial enterprises of the continent the better it will be for all concerned. There are all the elements here to make this a mighty industry in the Southern Seas. The wool is at its doors, and there is everything to enable it to manufacture cloth in such a way as to compete with the older countries of the world. The natural protection due to the isolation of our geographical position is very important, and it must be remembered also that the wool, which is the staple of this industry, has to be sent home to those engaged in it on the other side of the world, and the product has to be exported back to Australia. I was very much surprised at an expression used by the honourable member for South tralia, who spoke of the danger of slop clothing coming in .here from as though it were an invasion of some Mr Joseph Cook. outside enemy who would come in and ruthlessly destroy our industries and our domestic life. I have yet to learn that the readiness with which a man can acquire clothing for his wife and family is to be regarded as a danVictoria which have been gerous thing. Why should we fear an invasion of this kind when we know that these goods are not forced upon us, and that tlie people engaged in this industry in the old countiy will send nothing here unless there is a demand for it 1 Apart from that aspect of the matter I believe that the industry will get along very well if the duty be reduced to 10 per cent.

The moment this proposal was made. I asked the Treasurer if the Government intended to countenance it, and I was told that they intended to adhere to theirownproposal. Underthecircumstances I thought they would have used their influence to get this out of tlie way, but members have been speaking on one side as much as on the other. The honourable member for Gwydir has an amendment to propose if mine fails, but half the members of the committee have gone. This is a very important matter, and the duties to be imposed upon the other items will largely depend upon those which we fix in this case. There has been no obstruction that I know of to-night, and as we have dealt with duties in this list -which represent a i«venue of £338,000, I think it must be. admitted that the progress made has been fairly satisfactory. We have now sat from half-past 2 o'clock until a quarter past twelve, and it is utterly unreasonable for the Government to wish to proceed at this hour. The debate has been general to-day. As many speeches have been made on the other side as on this side, and, so far as I could see, there has been no attempt to take up time unnecessarily. We can never draw the line as to whether there has been more debate than has been necessary. I must, in all fairness, ask for an adjournment after the amendment has been disposed of. We have had a long debate, which, to a large extent, affects the whole of this section. When we fix the duty on woollen piece goods, we to a large extent determine the duties on the remaining items in the division. I did not object to extra time being given for the consideration of the Tariff, but it was a distinct understanding, at any rate among ourselves, that if it were given we should be able to adjourn at a reasonable hour. It is absurd to suggest that after this long sitting any man is fit to consider any large question. Honourable members on the other side are -able to leave the Chamber when they like, but we have to sit here constantly. I ant quite Avilling to go to a division on the amendment. Minister has stated his desire to get on with business, and as I see that the Government will not support my amendment, and that I am not likely to carry it at this* stage, I ask leave to withdraw it . Before the amendment is withdrawn, I wish to reply to a statement made by the honourable and lefirned member for Corio, that in the South Australian woollen factories only eight males and five females are employed. The return from which he quoted is absolutely incorrect, because immediately below it says that on the salt works in that State only twenty hands are employed. When I was at the Loberthale Woollen Factory eight months ago, I saw from 60 to 70'hands at work. There is also a factory in Hindmarsh. I am positive that the return is wrong. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. worth) I desire to ask the Government how they intend to conduct the business of the committee in view of the long sitting we have had. The country does not desire that we should sit here until the early hours of the morning. It is now past midnight, and we are not fit to debate matters of great importance. We are discussing a Tariff which may affect the fiscal interests of this country for the next generation. When we consider the time which it usually takes to pass a Tariff, it must be admitted that on the whole we have done very well. Wheni t is considered that we have passed one half of a £9,000,000 Tariff, certainly the discussion cannot be said to have been unreasonable. We owe a duty to the country. I do not wish to have long debates on the Tariff, and if we were to adjourn now, I should do my utmost to get a vote taken within a reasonable time to-morrow. A fte r sitting here for ten hours, I object to being asked to discuss an important item on which so much depends. on one item. does not matter.

We cannot expect the press to report our proceedings at this late hour. We are simply dealing with the Tariffi n camera, and that is a very bad precedent to set up. I think the Prime Minister has been one of those who have condemned, as I have had to do, unreasonably sitting beyond tlie hours at which honourable members can intelligently do their duty.

The only understanding to which I committed myself was that it was the duty of the Government to see that there was progress made with public businessthat if good progress was made within the ordinary sittings of the House which were reasonably short, we should be ready to adjourn ; but that if we could not make progress we should have to sit here in order to make progress.

Attorney-General, who was then a raem,ber of the Victorian Ministry, deprecated) the proposed increase of duties for pretty well the same reasons as those advanced by the other gentlemen I have quoted, namely,, that the mills did not seem to have prospered under the protection which had beon given. I point to these facts to show that the Victorian mills have not succeeded as well as those in New South Wales, notwithstanding the heavy protective duty in fche former State. The public have to pay not only the duty, but an increased price, for the local article, the difference going, not into the Treasury, but into the pockets of the manufacturers. (Committee counted.) Of course I know that honourable members opposite argue that a protective duty upon any particular article does not increase its price to the consumer. But I have in my hand a pamphlet containing the retail prices of Dr. Jaeger's firm, which carries on business in Sydney and Melbourne. From this pamphlet I gather that in Sydney the price of stocking material, quality K , size 45 inches, prior to the introduction of the Tariff was 5s., whereas in Melbourne, where a duty of 25 per cent, operated, it was 6s'.. 3d. The price of another class, quality KK , 42' inches, was 5s. 6d. in Sydney, whilst in. Melbourne it was 7s., thus snowing that the duty of 25 per cent, had again been added! Tfie price of satin, natural wool lining, upon which there was no duty, was 3s. 9d. in Sydney, and the price was the samein Melbourne. The cost of men's under^vests, K brand, was 8s. 6d. in Sydney, and 10s. 6d. in Melbourne, whilst that of men'spants was 8s. in the former city, and 10s. in the latter. These prices bear out m y contention that a protective duty -upon any article enhancesifcscost to the consumer. Last eveningsomehonorablemembers endeavoured to make ifc appear that we were fighting in the interests of the merchants. But itporting houses, if fchey studied their own interests, ought to be in favour of protection. Under a free-trade policy in New direct. This step encou raged the smaller storekeepers, and enabled them to do business, because the manufacturers gave them termsThe they were called upon to pay anything. But what happens under a system of protection ? As soon as we impose a high duty tlie local storekeeper is called upon to pay it, and if he is in a small way he is unable to do so. The result is that he is forced to go to the merchants, and thus instead of getting the advantage of direct trade with the manufacturer, and being able to sell at a cheap rate, he has to purchase from the merchant and pay increased prices, which in turn have to be paid by the general consumer. In this connection I notice that the Age saysEven the old established and legitimate merchants of Sydney are now regretting that Mr Reid went so far in his fiscal proposals. They wore doing well enough under the semi-protective Tariff of the Dibbs administration, but Mr Reid's extreme free-trade Tariff has led to an influx of foreign agents and representatives, who employ little or no clerical labour, and occupy no warehouse, but are cutting into the trade of the old merchants in indent orders. All this goes to show that a duty levied upon any article at the Customs means a heavily increased cost to the consumer. It is the duty of honourable members to use every legitimate means to protect the general consumers against the dastardly attempt to bolster up industries for the sake of ' a few manufacturers. The money collected from the consumer will go not into the Treasury, but into the pockets of the manufacturer. nothing on the colonial article. will, because the price' of the local article will be increased by very nearly the amount of the duty imposed' upon the imported article.

Every ""one of the Customs omcers has been supplied with a copy of the Tariff; they are all in communication with the right honourable gentleman by telegraph, and all he has to do is to wire to each officer to send to him direct a full statement, showing the amount of revenue received on every item of the Tariff for the months of October and November, and the telegrams need not be so long as that which the Minister to his constituents ""his position. We are promised the information day after day and week after week, but in the meantime we are piling these burdens of taxation upon the people. In view of the statement that the revenue for October represented an annual revenue of about £10,000,000, and that there was an increase upon that for November, this information ought to be supplied. dealt with this Tariff in a reasonable way, and, personally, I spoke only for a few minutes to-night, because we are anxious that the Tariff should be passed as quickly as possible, consistent with our duty to our constituents, which is the first consideration. Before we .consent to these proposals we ought to know whether, as a matter of fact, we are not proposing the imposition of taxation £2,000,000 a year more than is necessary. I shall be obliged, in the public interest, to take other steps if the information is not.supplied. I have no desire to take that course, but certainly the information should be supplied at the earliest possible moment. ( Committee counted). worth) I think the honourable member for Macquarie has very nearly concluded his .speech. The honourable member for Grampians wishes to speak, and perhaps another .honourable member, and I should like to dis..cuss this very important item at an hour when there is a reasonable hope of being reported in the press. I do not wish to dictate to the Government, but I urge that it would facilitate the progress of business if they would agreefcoan adjournment. I shall do all I can within fche first hour or I know I two to-morrow to get a vote taken on this item.. I had no opportunity until half-past twelve o'clock to speak. Buti t is not fair to me, as representing the Opposition and the I do not think it free-trade party of Australia, to be expected to speak at this hour. Compared with this tically a matter of form. It involves the question of the protection to be given to the manufacturers. When this item is dealt with, the way will be cleared considerably for the consideration of other items, because it iS the basis of the system we are-building up under this division. It is no pleasure to me to see time wasted or extreme measures taken. for Defence sent debate on Mondayt does not affect this item. The debate we have had so far has been chiefly on purely revenue items, in which fche question of free-trade or protection was not introduced. We have now reached the first item in this division in which that question is involved. I am not very sanguine of winning, but the very fact that I am weak in numbers ought We have to induce Ministers as a matter of honour and chivalry to give me a reasonable opportunity to declare the position of this party. I have never sought to take the business of the House out of the hands of. Ministers, but have always tried to help them to make progress, .and when my own followers have been in the wrong once or twice, I have been one of the first to intervene, as I did this afternoon when an effort to the extent, perhaps, of was made not to give fair latitude to fche Treasurer. I would remind the Minister for Trade and Customs, who seems disinclined to yield, that the Tariff is the property of the committee, and if it thinks that a reasonable amount of business has been done, Ministers ought not to say-""We demand that you shall go on with this most important item, and we shall keep you here until it is decided, whether there is a reasonable attendance or not."" In this matter a little wise concession will do no harm. Any honourable member who knows my responsibilities and my work will realize that I am as anxious for the session to close as any man can be. Not being very strong physically it is no pleasure to me to be sitting here at this hour, and, therefore, I ask for an adjournment.",69,Geobge Turner Th E Honourable Has Greatly Increased I N Ten Years That

330,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"I am sorry to take this course, but it has been forced upon me, to a large extent, by the obstinacy of one Minister. I believe that if I had to deal with the Treasurer only the reasonable request I have made would have been' agreed to, but ever since it was made clear that the Opposition are only a minority of this Hou?e the Government have treated us with systematic disrespect. AlthoughI have shown a fair amount of magnanimity and fairness, the Government have treated us with the utmost contumely. The people of this country boast of their desire that work shall be done within reasonable hours, and I am sure they do net desire us to sit up t ill all sorts of hours in the morning in order to transact their business. It is unfair .and cruel to ask honourable members to sit here into the small hours of the morning, and I refuse to go on transacting public business in the way the Government desire. If it comes to a test of physical strength I may be injured, but in the in terests of the country I intend to make the most effective protest I can, and to use every constitutional means to assertour rights. I know the unfortunate tactics which used to be pursued in the local Parliaments, and what an amount of deterioration ""has resulted. We have only to look round the Chambernow to see honourable members lying on the benches absolutely oblivious of the business, and during the last hour or so the 'bells have been ringing continually in order to summon members from all parts of the building. When I was elected, honourable members on both sides of the House will, I think, agree that I took a high standardin regard to the conduct of the business. I went so far as almost to reprove honourable members on my own side, and did every' thing I could to restrain that kind of conduct which can only lead to disorder in a deliberative Assembly. During tlie months that we were dealing with machinery Bills, this side of the House, and especially myself did everything possible to assist the Government, and to remove the party element. (Committee counted.) I was desirous of giving fair play to the Administration, and, recognising their enormous difficulties, I never made an attack on the Government with regard to the state of business, except, on those occasions.when honourable members 'were really puzzled as to what was going on. ,We had three or four second-reading debates on hand, and when honourable Sir William McMillan. came here not knowing what business was to be taken, I made a' certain amount of protest. But I never made the charge to which the Government, is open, and to which I only refer at present as a justification of our position.. Whose fault is it that the Tariff has been delayed right up to Christmas 1 Isi t our fault that, in consequence of the mismanagement of the affairs of the country, and the absolute want of business administration, we have been forced into the latter end of the year. This Government is more wanting in common sense and business administration than almost any other Government we have had in Australia. They have crowded on measures which might very well have been left for a more convenient period, and it is because the Government know so little of the conditions surrounding them, that the Tariff, instead of being ready months ago,, has only been before us for about a month,, and instead of having two or three months to devote to its consideration, we have had only so many weeks. The object of federation was to fuse the people into one homogeneouswhole by Inter-state free-trade and a uniform Tariff. But the Government were sodiffident and frightened of results that, instead of simply introducing the Tariff, they brought in anything and everything in order to postpone its consideration. Yet, because of this maladministration of the affairs of the country, His. Majesty's Opposition, who bebeve they practically represent the majority of the people of Australia, although a minority of the House, are to be told by political autocrats that we must consider the Tariffi n a few weeks. The Treasurer,, who tells us we are not dealing expeditiously with the Tariff was, I understand, fivemonths in passing a similar measure forthat small portion of Australia comprised in tlie State of Victoria. So narrowis the conception of these gentlemen that they think this is a Tariff for Victoria. ; (Committee counted). This frequent calling attention to the absence of a quorum is the most telling comment on the present scandalous condition of affairs. Honourable members who have stoppedl here to coerce the Opposition into voting at this hour of the morning have not had thedecency to remain in the House to listen to our arguments. That shows what a hollow fraud the whole thing is. (Committee counted.) I am very much obliged to members' the gentlemen who are good enough to give me a quorum. Weakness must use its own weapons, and there have been struggles .amongst British communities before, in which the minority have had to fight strenuously until public opinion has ultimately come round to their views. I am not doing anything hypocritical. I have asked to-night, in the most respectful manner, for an adjournment at a reasonable hour. I have not sought to take tlie busijiess out of the hands of the Government. An adjournment has been asked for thousands of times by an opposition, and has been granted under reasonable circumstances. WhilstI have a certain constitutional power, I say that every time the Ministry attempts to force any debate upon .a great subject connected with the Tariff-one of the salient parts of it-a t an hour in the morning when honourable members -are not fit too debate the question, and when the committee is in a disgraceful condition. means to prevent the debate from taking place, until there is a representative assembly present. mittee in a disgraceful state ? disgraceful in that honourable members are lying asleep in a ll parts of the chamber. It is disgraceful in that 75 members were returned to it in the expectation that when .subjects of the greatest importance were being discussed they would be in their places. Header of the Opposition. .are reasons for the absence of my leader. 'On a previous occasion the Government -whip went round attempting, in the most --suave manner, to pair every honourable member that he could. better go home,"" said he, to one and to smother. I am sure that honourable members left the chamber last evening, as they did on that occasion, without any idea that this outrageous forcing of a division was to take place. All they expected was a vote upon the proposal of an extreme Government supporter who is accountable for the absorption of two and a half hours of public time tomight. I intended to propose a reduction -of 10 per cent, upon the line now lbefore the committee, and was ready to make my speech when the honourable and learned member for Corio intervened, and out of courtesy I gave way to him. ThenI said to honourable members opposite that I would not make my speech upon his extreme proposal. I asked the Treasurer if he intended to support the proposal of his friend at the back, and he replied, "" No, we will stick to our own measure."" (Committee counted.) I was willing that within a reasonable time a division should be taken upon my amendment. When the Treasurer informed me that he intended to adhere to the proposal of the Government, I said that I would not make my speech on the veiy important amendment which I intended to submit whilst the extreme proposition then under discussion was before the committee. I waited patiently for the conclusion of that debate, and upon one or two occasions suggested that we should take a vote upon the matter and be done with it. Two hours I will use every constitutional elapsed and midnight was reached. I was thus baulked in making my speech, and the committee were preventedfrom coming to a vote upon my amendment, not by reason of In what way is the comany obstruction on the part of the Opposition, but owing to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corio. It is The moment that proposal was got rid of, I asked Ministers to adjourn, and was met by an absolute refusal. I do not pretend to dictate to Ministers how they shall conduct their business, but I think there is some courtesy due to this side of the House and to the leader of a party who is in a very difficult position, because he is fighting against a big force and long odds. We have now reached a division in regard to which the position we take up is that, whilst we are willing to agree to a moderate duty for incidental protection, we absolutely object to the wholesale protection which has been imported into it . ""Oh, you had Yet at twelve o'clock at night, when there has been no unfair dealing, Ministers refuse to. adjourn. I leave the country to decide between us. Whenever an attempt is made to force the Tariff through in the small hours Of the morning when honourable members are weary, and when the Government supporters will not do the Opposition the courtesy of remaining in their places, I am content to leave the country to judge whether the committee is doing its duty.

It is the intention of the Government to ask the committee to sit sufficiently late to-mori-ow night to enable us to dispose of the remaining items in division 4, with the exception of those which we intimated our intention to postponeMy honourable friend was present, and he did not raise the slightest dissent. If we had applied ourselves to the work which we are sent here to do as business men would, we should have been a long way further through the Tariff than we are. My honourable friend and others on his side have time after time deliberately told us that they do not intend to allow us to get on with the Tariff. The members of the Opposition told us no later than last night that they were going to use every constitutional means in their power to prevent us from going on with the business. My honourable friend, the acting leader of the Opposition, told us the other night, when we paid him the courtesy of permitting him to make a general statement, that unless the Opposition had thenown way they would use every constitutional means in their power to prevent business from proceeding. More than that, the honourable member has done it, and he apparently intends to block us in every possible way. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN fair interpretation of my words. on that occasion, but now, my honourable friend has shown a deliberate intention to block us from going on with the business. He says there is going to be a trial of strength. Well, let it be a trial of strength. Theactingleaderof the Oppositionhas clearly shown to-night what is the intention of the Opposition, and it is time that we understood each other. bers of the Opposition block business, we shall either conduct the business as we think proper, or the leader of the Opposition will have to take the responsibility of conducting it . As the acting leader of the Opposition has thrown out a challenge we accept it, and we shall not let the committee rise until we have done what we consider to be a proper amount of business. to me that the two Ministers who have just spoken have evaded the main points under discussion, and have ignored the chief reasons brought forward by the acting leader of the Opposition for his action to-night. Neither Minister contended that the committee is in a f it state to transact tlie business of the Commonwealth. An y work performed at the present time must be done in a perfunctory manner, and I consider that the blame for the present situation rests upon the Government. Half the members at present in the chamber are asleep, and all are fagged out after the labours of the daj'. The Prime Minister spoke about keeping up the prestige of the Federal Parliament, but surely he hasadopted a very curious way of doing it . The dignity of Parliament is not likely to be maintained by keeping us here t ill this hour of the morning. tervening time 1 had brought in their Tariff earlier in the session, their proposals would have received full consideration, and there would have been no. necessity for rushing business, through. have acted in exactly the same way if the Tariff had been brought in six months ago.. ment. the honourable member does. Government by their actions. The first four or five months of this session wereoccupied witha number of machinery Bills, and amajority of the members of the Opposition sat calmly in their places whilst oneafter another of the Government supporters discussed the whole of the details of those measures. The time thus spent would have been far betteremployed over the Tariff, and the Government must be held entirely to blame for If the memhaving brought about the present situation. The experience we have had of these long sittings is not a favorable one, for no progress has been made, and nearly the wholetime has been wasted over recriminations. The Opposition are doing their plain duty to the country in seeing that the publicbusiness is transacted while honourable members are capable of giving due attention to the matters brought before them. The condition to which we are now reduced is not quite so had as that which has prevailed in some of the State Parliaments, and I should be very sony to see this Parliament degenerate until it reached a similar pass.",77,Smith I See No Diffi Portion All The Rest Of The Tariff Is Prac

We have affirmed the principle of an eight hours' day, and the people of the Commonwealth do not desire that honourable members should not only sit for an unreasonable length of time, but overwork all the officers of the House. If the Government were so anxious to get through with the business, why did they not arrange to sit in the mornings ? several nights and mornings as well now. absurd if the House is kept sitting day and night, because no satisfactory work can be done under such circumstances. There is a lot more work to be done this session, and late sittings will retard rather than facilitate business. No one is more interested than myself in getting an adjournment for a month or six weeks, in order to attend to my private affairs in Western Australia, but I am here to do the work of the country as satisfactorily as possible. The Government put us in an unfair position by attempting to rush items through, when honourable member's are really tired out, and I must protest against this mode of conducting the business of the Commonwealth. trouble has arisen through the action of Ministers themselves, seeing that honourable members have conducted the business very expeditiously as compared with the progress made when Tariff changes were discussed in New South Wales and in Victoria. The federal compact was that every State would be considered, and none ignored, but the case of New South Wales shows how that compact has been departed from. The Prime Minister has distinctly 23 R z broken faith with the people of New Soiith Wales. under tliis motion the honourable member is in order in discussing the action of the Piime Ministeri n that regard. I find on further reference that this debate must be confined to the subject-matter of the motion, not leave the chair. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I understood that a general discussion could take place on tliis motion, and that we were not confined under the standing orders to theexact question as to whether it is necessary that you should leave tlie chair. orders says that in cases not otherwise provided, the usages of the House of Commons are to be adopted. If my memory is correct, there were some rules adopted in the House/ of Commons twenty years ago, which laid down what you, sir, have just Stated, namely, that a debate of this kind must be confined to the subject-matter of the motion. In the going to sit for case of Taiylw v. Barton, to which so much reference has been made, it was decided by It will be very the Privy Council that a standing order of the New South Wales Parliament, which was similar to our first standing order, did not apply to standing orders of the House of Commons passed after the standing order of New South Wales had come into force. But the court intimated, that the case would have been different if tlie standing order of the House of Commons had been passed before the local standing order had come into force. The latter is the exact position here. Ministry do not properly represent thefeeling of the countiy, and we know tliat if this motion is successful, it means that they must resign. While the House is constituted as at present, it would be impossible for the present Opposition to cany on the business, and a dissolution would have to be asked for. (Committee counted.) The Government ought to have been only too happy to. accept suggestions -from the Opposition; but we have found that fche only way to meet the Minister for Trade and Customs is to fight him determinedly.

They could have brought in a Tariff after passing the This Tariff should have been Customs Bill and Distillation Bill, and, if thej' had done so it would have received that consideration which its importance requires at our hands. What more vital question could be submitted than a Tariff which affects the welfare of thousands of people? When we find that the incidence of the taxation is arranged to fall on the great bulk of the people, we are In my opinion the Ministry justified in taking care that the Tariff shall be considered in the full light of daj', and at an hour when honourable members are in a condition to listen to our arguments.

Parramatta has attributed to me conduct which is unworthy of a member of this House, but there is only one statement of his on which I desire fco make a personal explanation. The honourable member accuses me of including certain member of the labour party with the Opposition; but if he was in fche chamber when I made my statement, he will remember that, in answer to an interjection as to whom I included, I said "" Every member on the opposition side of the gangway."" charge of wasting time has been levelled against members of the Opposition, and I am giving this information to the comI mittee in order to refute the charge. On our side those who took part were the honourable members for Wentworth, Soutli Australia-Messrs. Glynn, V . L . Solomon, Poynton North Sydney, Parramatta, Werriwa, Robertson, Macquarie, and Dalley. The figures I have given are sufficient to sihow how unfair is the charge made by the honourable member for Laanecoorie against the Opposition, who are endeavouringfcopreventfchelevying of taxation to the amount of £1,000,000, when hardly a quarter of the members arepresent, and the press are not fully represented. We are perfectly prepared to let the people judge between us, and. to say whether we are not justified in preventing the imposition of -taxation, when no opportunity is given for fair debate. The measures dealing with a white Australia were measures which required f u ll discussion, and upon which the proceedings of Parliament should have been fully reported in the press, and honourable members will remember that those measures were not discussed later than about 11 o'clock at night, and there was no attempt to rush them through without consideration. No action has been more justified by subsequent events' than the action taken by the Opposition in connection with the motion of censure. That is proved by the alterations which have been made in the Tariff, and which will yet be made in it. The Prime Minister told the people on one occasion that a revenue of not more than £4,000,000 would be required, and it is the more necessary that we should do our duty in the consideration of this measure in view misled and deceived by the right honourable gentleman. entitled to say that I deceived the people ? used is offensive to tlie Prime Minister, I must ask the honourable member for Macquarie to withdraw it . the expression, but we shall have plenty of time to deal with these matters before the next election,and on the public platform we shall be able to speak as plainly as we like, AVe should not be doing our duty if we did A certain not eiiter our solemn and sincere protest against the attempts being made to rush this legislation through.

It has been sought time after time to fasten on the Opposition the responsibility for the length} debates on the various 7 items. But again and again we have shown that invariably these are owing to the loquacity of Government supporters. Tonight has been no exception to the rule. Up to midnight more speeches were made on that side than upon this. This is the first time. I have known the supporters of a Government to exhibit the same tendency to loquacity as has been shown on the other side. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has been guilty of playing a political trick. ""He used right figures in the wrong way, and he has been the means of showing that honourable members on his own side have occupied the tim,e when there was a possibility of being reported in the press. After having wasted the evening, in vapourings in many cases, these honourable members go home to their beds, and then the complaint is made by the Prime Minister that the business of the country is not being transacted. On this side we have to seriously complain of our treatment by the Government. Why should we be made to suffer because their supporters abuse their privileges ? The Prime Minister has never known a party of Government supporters who talked so continually as his side does, and he cannot blame us if we resent his attempt to make us sit all night, and transact tlie business which has been blocked by his own supporters. He also accused the acting leader of the Opposition of not having control over his party. (Committee owmted.) There is a great deal more control exercised on this side than appears to be exercised over the members on the Government benches The Opposition is as much a part of our parliamentary institution as is the Government. side seem to suppose that there is no function for the Opposition except to acquiesce most mildly in every suggestion from thatside. The Prime Minister's taunt to the acting leader of the Opposition to-night has a little in this case. basis of fact, but that arose from the complacency of my honourable friend to the Prime Minister on a former occasion. On that* occasion had my honourable friend taken the advice of a few of us, he would not have made the compact which he did, and would not have agreed to the proposals which were then supposed to be agreed to, because we know how easily compacts can be got rid of when it suits the Government to get rid of them. The compact, as I understood it that evening, was that, so far as he could, my honourable friend would help the Government to get the Tariff passed before Christmas. He has not departed from that compact yet. If any one has wandered from the compact, it is the Government, who talk persistently as if they were going to stay here until eternity broke upon them, and have no regard for the way in which business should be conducted. When all considerations should have led the Government into a course of moderation as regards talk and criticism, we find tonight that thej' have to their credit 49 speeches, as against 28 speeches from this side. W it h such facts staring the Prime* Ministeri n the face, he should direct his criticism to his own followers, and not to the Opposition. What control has he over the tongues of honourable members who sit behind him 1 We are to take the consequences over here, too, and he declared almost dramatically as he sat down that there is a public opinion outside. Public opinion does not all centre in the metropolis of ""Victoria. It varies oyer the continent. The great controlling organs of public opinion in other parts of the continent describe the conduct of the Government quite differently from the way in which the leading Government organ of this city does. New South Wales believe in a waste of public time 1 in New South Wale's' does not believe in the Prime Minister, as he would find out if he went there.

The Opposition cannot be accused of obstruction, because there cannot be any higher duty than that of resisting these unjust proposals. The iniquitous system of protection, when once established, is with the greatest difficulty uprooted, and wherever the theory has had the opportunity of working itself out, we see the most dreadful consequences. (Committee cou/ivted.) A debate conducted throughout the night, as this has been, does no credit to the high arena into which we were supposed to have entered when federation became an accomplished fact; and if adverse criticism, which, in some degree, may be deserved, be directed against our proceedings, the responsibility lies with the Government. Nothing can exceed in importance the consideration of this Tariff, and the fag end of a weary night should not be devoted to so weighty a matter. We are here at this hour in consequence of a challenge thrown out by the Government, to whom I shall make no appeal for quarter. In my opinion, the leader of the Opposition has been too abject in his petitions to the Government from time to time; indeed, he goes out of his way to sacrifice us to the wishes of honourable gentlemen opposite. Why do we take this course 1 The item we were debating when the debate was interrupted by this motion had reference to woollens, on whioh the Government proposed a duty of 20 per cent. (Committee counted.) That item concerns very largely the working people of the Commonwealth, and the duties which have caused the greatest trouble and the fiercest debate are those upon articles which are in common consumption by the poorer classes of the community. We are justified in complaining that we are asked to debate this matter entirely in the dark. It is true that we have had estimates of probable receipts issued by the. Treasurer, but what reliance can be placed upon those estimates. (Committee counted.) I am afraid there I urge the Government to have some consideration for the officers of the House, who are working two or three shifts in one. (Committee counted.) The tactics adopted by the Government to wear down the patience and physical endurance of members of the Opposition are devoid of reason and opposed to the best parliamentary traditions. But I appeal to the ""Prime Minister to have some consideration for the officers of the House. We hear much of the importance of good working coiiditions for people outside the chamber, but these proceedings are simply sweating the officers of the House. (Committee counted.) members going to leave off playing with public business ? pile up speeches in the early hours of the sitting, and then seek to force the business through at an unreasonable hour, when honourable members are not fit mentally of physically to proceed, who play with public business, not those whose voices are raised in protest against the brutal conduct of the Government. honourable member to withdraw that term. word. This Parliament has time and again expressed its sympathy with the labourers of this continent. But who are sweating the officers of this chamber, and belying to that extent all their protestations of sympathy for those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow 1 The Government ought to have some consideration for the officers of the House, if they have none for honourable members on this side. If any man deserves the good will of the Government it is the acting leader of the Opposition. Time and again, at his request, honourable members on this side have desisted from making remarks, in order to help the Government to get items passed, but to-night, when he asked for an adjournment at a most reasonable hour from our point of view, it was refused, and he was accused of want of honour by the Prime Minister, who, in his closing remarks, spoke most bitterly of his conduct.

427,Mr Joseph Cook,"I withdraw thehold in the affections of the people. It is we who are trying to prevent the Government from degrading our institutions, and endeavouring to have the debates carried on with dignity and clearness of purpose. It is a fine notion for the Government to engage in an exhibition of strength with the Opposition, to see if they can beat us down. The Treasurer said to-night that if we were to have a test of strength, let it come, and yet here he is stretched on the benches. (Committee counted.) It has been pointed out with a great deal of force that we cannot adequately debate this question until we are supplied with further information. As the Tariff has been in operation for nearly two months, it ought to be known what revenue this duty is likely to yield, but the Treasurer has not taken us into his confidence, and the only information we have is that which he gave us in his financial statement. Last evening he said that the expenditure is piling up at an enormously rapid rate, and that he has many liabilities to meet, but he did not give any information about the state of the revenue. Surely he ought to have given f u l l information as to the revenue as well as the expenditure. He sought to pile up an enormous burden on paper, in order to create a justification for this enormously high Tariff. able member for Melbourne Ports, as well as the honourable member for Echuca, has said that the Tariff is too moderate. to show the honourable member the Tariff which the protectionists wanted, and then he would see what sort of a Tariff"" this is. that the protectionists would like to get a very much higher Tariff than they have. In New South Wales we have not been accustomed to pay heed to the demands of our manufacturers. We have had our say as to what was a fabthing to do by our industries, but apparently in Yictoriai t has been with the protectionists a case of "" ask aud ye shall receive,"" and no doubt they have piled up their demands in the hope that they might get a little less. Does the honourable member mean to suggest to me that it has been the custom even in Victoria to give the protectionists all they asked for, or that he thinks it would be a fair thing to accede to their requests 1 The protectionists would not be human if they did not come, like Oliver Twist, for more, when they have in power a Government which is complacent to their claims, and seeks earnestly to satisfy them. The function of the Government is not to consider what the protectionists or the manufacturers want, but to look to the interests of the consumers. I have not heard the case of the consumers put from the other side of the Chamber either to-night or at any other time. Now and again there has been a vague statement that protection cheapens the price of goods, but that has been all we have heard from that side. The GHAIB.MAN -The honourable member is now debating the Tariff, which is outside the scope of this motion. to an interjection. AVe are told that the desire of the Government is to get this Tariff through before Christmas, because the business people are at a loss what to do until it is passed. It must be remembered, however, that when the Tariff leaves this chamber the perplexity will be rather increased, seeing that the measure goes to another Chamber which has powers of suggestion which amount to powers of amendment. I should be delighted to get the Tariff through before Christmas, but I shall The honornot allow any question of adjournment to interfere with free discussion.

It is perfectly clear that, in the consideration of this Tariff, the Prime Minister, although he nominally represents the Government, and, perhaps, is unequalled in Australia for. his knowledge of constitutional and international law, is, in matters of finance, a perfect child alongside two such men as the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs. That opinion was expressed by numbers of other members to their constituents in New South Wales, and I have found it an absolutely correct opinion. (Committee counted.) The Minister for Trade and Customs has claimed that this is a protectionist Tariff, and we know it has not been put forward to conciliate the different States that have come into this union, but solely in the interests of Victoria. Tlie CHAIRMAN able member not to discuss the Tariff; such a discussion is outside the limits of debate upon this motion. The honourable member must confine himself to the reasons why I should leave tlie chair. one of the reasons why you should leave the chair is that we have a Government introducing a Tariff which will not tend to conciliate the States forming tlie Commonwealth. If we are to have a true federation of Australia, it can only be by union of the hearts of the people of the different States. I call the attention of the Chairman to the fact that honourable members on the other side are snoring, and I consider that that is distinctly out of order. The Tariff the standing orders, or in the practice of the House of Commons, to support the contention of the honourable member, and there is nothing directing the Speaker or the ChairI f this House could have man of Committees to awaken honourable members' under such circumstances. , Ministers to say that they have charge of the business of the country. They certainly have; but the Opposition have also a duty I hope that the reasons I to perform in connection with tlie proceedings of Parliament, and they are entitled to speak on behalf of a large majority of the people of one or two of the States. We have heard something about the rising of public feeling in favour of the actions of the Government, but really the rising of public feeling has been in the opposite direction, and if Ministers appeared before the outraged people of New South Wales they would find that that is the case. It has been claimed in connection with the item under discussion that it is in consequence of the system of ' protection that large woollen mills have been established in Victoria, but if, after having had the advantage of protection for from 25 to 30 years, those engaged in the industry are not able to get along by themselves, it proves that their industry is an exotic, and the sooner it is got rid of the better. I do not, however, admit that the wool-manufacturing industry is an exotic industry in Australia. We know what was said on the subject by the honourable member for Maranoa. Tlie CHAIRMAN. I would remind the honourable member that he is again dis. cussing the Tariff, and it is not competent I mustask thehonorfor him to do so or. the motion before the committee. dentally to the fact that the honourable member for Maranoa, who said he represented the squatters in this matter, It appears to me that explained that they did not wish any duty imposed in connection with this industry.

""When the Constitution Bill was submitted to the States, it was declared that the Commonwealth would require a revenue not higher than £9,000,000, but now we learn that the return will reach £12,000,000. is so, surely it is a reason and a justification for the Opposition fighting the TarifT in a legitimate way. I feel sure that no fair man can accuse the Opposition of unduly occupying the time of the committee. The records which have been quoted by the honourable member for Macquarie fully bear out that view. It has been clearly proved that the honourable member for Laanecoorie was mistaken in his estimate of the time taken up by the honourable members on the Government and Opposition sides. Up to the time when he received his figures from fche Chairman, 28 speeches had been delivered from the Opposition side by 18 speakers, occupying three hours eighteen minutes, while from the Government side and the labour corner 49 speeches were delivered by 30 members, occupying three hours thirty-one minutes. favour of the Government proposal 1 Opposition speeches 1 of the Opposition only speeches which were delivered by its members. Are we to be held responsible for speeches delivered by honourable members sitting on the cross benches on this side 1 Or is the Prime Minister to be held responsible for anything which may be done by the labour party sitting on the cross benches on the other side ? If the Government attempt to force business through in this sort of way in the future, I shall be one to. sit behind the leader of the Opposition to do what is best in the interests of all Australia. be perfectly clear to the Ministry and their supporters, that the right course has been followed by the Opposition in submitting this motion. Hadi t not been for the action of the Government, members would not have been detained over night, and would have been more fit for the work which awaits them to-day. The Government in the beginning, as old parliamentary handSj ought to have been able to foresee what work could or could not be done during the session. The greater part of the strain could have been obviated if the Ministry, as one of two courses which might have been followed, had, instead of submitting the Tariff this session, allowed If that commerce to be conducted on the old lines, and had introduced the necessary machinery Bills. Had that plan been adopted, we should now have had a Judiciary Act, and a Court sitting to decide those points of law which are likely to be numerous, instead of citizens being left without redress for damage which they may have suffered. When the Government have blamed members on this side for wasting the time, have they reflected that they have themselves been the primary cause of any waste of time there has been ? If Ministers had first of all brought on the Customs Bill and the Distillation Bill, and had then proceeded with the Tariff, we should have had it dealt with by Christmas time. If they had not cared to adopt that course, they should have announced to the people of Australia that, owing to the delay which must necessarily take place while machinery Bills were being passed, the Tariff could not be dealt with this year, and if that had been done the operations of commerce in the various States would have gone on. as before, and were they not there would have been no dislocation of the trade of the community. Machinery BillsI put down to the blame -have been introduced for which there was no necessity ; and the Post and Telegraph Bill, instead of affording relief to the various States, has only added to the confusion existing. The framers of tlie Constitution never dreamt that the first Eederal Ministry would think of dealing with these matters, when it was clear that the bookkeeping clauses would prevent any real good arising from the immediate transference of such departments. Another reason for delay in dealing with such a matter is that the Ministers in charge of the departments would have had time to make themselves acquainted with the requirements of the different StatesI t could not be urged as a reason, and I do not think it is urged as a reason, even amongst Ministers, that merely because they had appointed a Postmaster-General they should at once take ov.er the Postal department.

On these grounds alone the Government should have delayed bringing in the Post and Telegraph Bill. There were many thoughtful men who saw that it would be a mistake to take over the Postal and Telegraph departments before we had had time sufficient to become acquainted with all the requirements of the States. The bookkeeping clauses in the Constitution also prevent the introduction of a uniform stamp. which the Australian people looked forward it was the introduction of a uniform stamp. Yet we are told that the reason why it has not been introduced is because of the existence of the bookkeeping clauses in the Constitution. Those provisions did not come into existence after the post-offices were taken over, but long before. It is idle, therefore, for Ministers to say that they were misled. They must have known the condition of affairs. The telephonic system is also in a bad condition, especially in Yictoria. In New South Wales the arrangements are first class, except that the introduction of the electric tramways into Sydney has disturbed the electric currents. (Committee counted.) I feel a certain amou nt of pleasure in the fact that the Government should have given us such an opporrunity as this to draw attention to tlieir delinquencies. I do not suppose there ever was a Government found so wanting when weighed in the balance, and I feel confident that at the first opportunity the people will declare in un1 mistakable terms that their places shall know them no more. Tlie Ministry are willing to impose a burden of 3s. or is. in the £ 1 on what the people use, while at the same time they tell us that the wealth of the country cannot bear one penny of extra taxation. If the wealth of the community cannot bear taxation, how is it that the Government think of imposing taxes -upon the poverty of the countiy? The Government even put a tax upon Bibles, so that the rising generation shall not have a chance of being educated on the lines so dear to those who believe that no nation can advance that has not grasped the great fundamental principles of truth and morality. Isi t not clear that the wealth of the House is to be found on the other side, supporting protectionist doctrines, and assisting to impose duties regardless of consideration for the great mass of the , . Tariff. 8193 community ? Every penny taken in taxation, whether from rich or poor, lessens the amount available for productive purposes, and lessens the amount to be distributed among the wage-earning classes. It is ridiculous to think that any community can be made wealth}* by taxation. Eveni f the representatives of the people consisted solely of the wealthy leisured classes I do not think we should see so many exhibitions of selfishness as we have witnessed from the Government side. On the other hand, If there was one thing to judgment upon the Opposition has been passed in advance, and the cheers and approval of thousands of electors show that they are beginning to recognise that the cause of freedom of trade is the cause of the masses. In the end we must triumph over the Government, who in this matter think only of men with £20,000"" capital, who dub themselves manufacturers. The Government Say of the manufacturers "" These are the men we are inclined to help."" Does any manufacturer ever give employment unless he is able to make a profit out of the-men he employs ? Protectionists always talk as if the man who provides employment is a public benefactor. It is the old idea of the squire. I should like to see a state of things in which the man who gives employment is just as thankful to the worker as the man who takes the employment is to hun. (Committee counted.) One of the most remarkable arguments ever addressed to the commitee was that which we heard yesterday from the Treasurer. He expressed regret that he was cut short in his speech in regard to the intentions of the Government. I also regret thatliis speech was interrupted, because it would have enabled us to show very clearly that the Government are not conducting the business of the countiy properly. The Treasurer stated that the Government wished to obtain some thousands of pounds more revenue, because thej' intended to increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth, perhaps, to the extent of .£1,000,000. The sooner the people know that the better, and no time should be lost in tabling a motion condemning the proposals of the Government in this respect. The people expect this House to exercise economj* for all time, and when the news goes forth that the Government contemplate a largelj' increased expenditure there will be a thrill of indignation throughout the community. In this respect the Treasurer's statement differs materially from that put before the country hy the Government federal elections. In' order to provide for tliis increased expenditure necessary to raise another through the Customs. the Commonwealth requires a revenue of only £S,000,000 to satisfy the needs of the great majority of the people. We claim that this is a democratic House, and, representing the people as we do, it is highly important that we should see that the taxes fall upon them as lightly as possible; that a sum in excess of what is absolutely necessary is not raised.

If they believed that they retained the confidence of the people they would not hesitate to do so. They know full well, however, that they do not, and that on the very first occasion they are called upon to vote the people will show their recognition of the fact that the Ministry have gone back on their election pledges. No clearer proof of that could be given than the fact that since the elections the Prime Minister has not dared to go back -' to Maitland and address a meeting there for the purpose of showing that his Government have endeavoured to keep the promises made by them. This indicates that the Prime Minister has some sense of shame. It shows that he recognises that he has done such violence to the political he made that he feels he cannot stand up before any audience, even in his own electorate, and expect to receive one solitary cheer, except, perhaps, from the half-dozen men in his constituency on whose behalf he introduced the proposal for a. duty of 4s. per central on broom millet. cannot too strongly , condemn the Government for their action in seeking to impose these burdens upon the people, apart from any considerations of revenue. should not ask us for more than is absolutely necessary to meet the demands of Mr Conroy. the great bulk of the people.

Why will not the Prime Ministez; accept the fact that this, is a federation of people as well as a federation of States? And why, in the face of such an admission, does he come forward and ask for a Tariff exceeding £7,350,000 ? (Committee counted.) I ""wisb now to raise a point of order.

When the people of Australia entered into this union, one of their principal hopes was that, so far from the union increasing the taxation of the people, their burdens would be reduced, and they would not continually have the tax-gatherer at their"" door. cient reasons can be given as to why the Chairman ought to leave the chair. In the first place, I call attention to the fact that the proper Chairman of Committees is not in his place. We now have a deputy-chairman, the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, in the chair. Our regular Chairman has left the chair without permission having been given tb him. This fact shows the indebtedness of the Government to the Opposition. They cannot get on with business without talcing a Chairman from the Opposition. that the honourable member for Dalley has no right to reflect upon the Acting-Chairman, who is strictiy impersonal. The honourable member has called attention to the politics of the Acting-Chairman. I maintain The ACTING-CHAIRMAN -There is no doubt that the standing orders provide for the appointment of an Acting-Chairman to occupy the chair at the request of the Chairman of Committees. It is at the request of the Chairman that I occupy the chair, and I ask the honourable member for Dalley not to pursue his statements as to the side to which I belong. Chairman should leave the chair can be grouped under four heads-first , fiscal.; secondly, financial; thirdly, personal; and, fourthly, political. There are many subdivisions, which I shall explain as I proceed. If the right honourable member for East Sydney were present we can imagine how he would handle the fiscal aspect of the question. He would have made the public understand the attitude of the Opposition in defending the principles of a life-time The ACTING CHAIRMAN He would have pointed his digit of caution to the opposition, benches, and with his power of declamation would have made himself understood all over Australia.

The ACTING CHAIRMA N Upon the point of order raised by the honourable member for KennedyI rule that, under the standing orders, whenever attention is called to the want of a quorum, undoubtedly the bells must be rung. that the standing orders are not very clear upon the point, but they provide that when a rule is not clear, we shall adopt the procedure of the House of Commons. In the House of Commons, tlie Chairman or Speaker need not ring the bells if of opinion that there is a quorum within the precincts of the chamber. That practice has always been followed in Queensland. Chairman will put as liberal an interpretation as possible on the standing orders in this respect. able aud learned member for ""Werriwa was quite within his rights in drawing attention to the state of the committee, but I would appeal to him, as a fellow member, to allow honourable members to have an opportunity to have the chamber for such time as is necessary for them to perform their ablutions. No honourable member has received more consideration from his fellow members than has the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, and if I find him wanting in that good feeling which he should display towards others, I shall take an opportunity of making him aware of the frequent breaches of the rules which he himself commits. vides that a certain proportion of honourable members must be present in order to constitute a quorum, and exercise the powers committed to the House of Representatives. do not provide that the Chairman need ring the bells. members present to form a quorum, and the fact of their being within the precincts of the chamber does not affect matters. The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN. The point of order raised by the honourable member for Kennedy is covered by Standing Order 233, which says that if notice is taken that a quorum is not present the I should be exceedingly Chairman shall leave the chair. The latter portion of the standing order, by consent of the committee, has been suspended for the time being, but the first portion of it is operative. Therefore, when attention is called to the absence of a quorum, the bells must be rung. that has been wasted upon the discussion of this point of order. The progress of the I would point out committee is not to be judged by the number of items passed in a night. The item, ""woollen goods,""'is sufficiently important to warrant a long debate, but there are many items which the Opposition have allowed to pass on the voices. We are not anxious to prolong the business before this committee. The position is that when a request was made last evening that progress should be reported, I hope that the Actingthe Prime Minister took the view that sufficient items had not been disposedof during the sitting. (Committee counted.) No one regrets needless obstruction more than I do, because I realize that it is a twoedged weapon, which some day the Prime Minister and his present supporters may use against the party with which I am associated. I believe that an arrangement could be made by the Prime Minister with the leader of the Opposition and leader of the labour party, by which a certain number of items could be disposed of at each sitting. In that way, the transaction of public business might be materially expedited, and honourable members would be enabled to close the session earlier than would otherwise be possible. B ut if items are to be bludgeoned, or forced, through the committee, the Senate will not be influenced by the actions of this committee in the same way as that Chamber would be if the items were passed after deliberate and earnest discussion. The importance of the item which was passed last night was sufficient to justify the Prime Ministeri n moving the adjournment of the House, and allowing us to go to our homes. The Opposition have abundant warrant for making the protest which they are making. Last week they made a similar protest, but when the ordinary hour of meeting came round they proceeded with the public business. The Treasurer has admitted that the revenue derived from this Tariff has so far exceeded his expectations; but he urges that this excess is due to abnormal conditions which cannot be expected to continue.

476,Mr Wilks,"I deeply regret the timehowever, is not correct. I wish also to point out another danger with which the Government are threatened. We are aware that in the near future it is proposed to extend the franchise to women, and I , for one, should not like to see an army of women, simply because their wearing apparel has been excessively taxed, hold up the Barton Ministry to the execration of the womanhood of Australia. I believe, however, that this a contingency which has to be calculated upon if the Government insist upon levying such a heavy impost upon drapery. The officials of the House, who owe no man a grudge and to whom no one owes a grudge, have been subjected to a great physical strain. As far as I am concerned, I offer them my most sincere apology, but I am compelled to continue the process of slow murder, which they have been called upon to endure. If they had not to endure it at the hands of myself, probably they'would have to do so at the hands of some other honourable member. In my early days I had a pretty strong theological training, although honourable members might not think so, and I was always told that before a reverend gentlemau addressed his congregation he should divide the text of his sermon into four headings. That is why I have divided my remarks into that number of headings. The people of Australia realize, I think, that the parliamentarians of the Commonwealth are not now at play. Good work has been performed. Anenergeticand intelligent minority using the powers at their command are to force from a brutal majority an opportunity of discussing fully, and voting upon items of the greatest concern to every individual of the Commonwealth as a citizen of the Commonwealth and of the State. {Committee counted.) While the bells were being rung, a leading Government supporter approached me with the rude suggestion that it was time. I devoted my attention to the classical side of this question. In order to supply me with matter in that connection, he referred to Euripides, and asked me to quote him in order to show the Treasurer how dangers in the past had been avoided by a willing and discerning Government paying a due regard to -an intelligent Opposition. The honourable member no doubt could quote not only Euripides, but that well-advanced thinker of the democracy of Athens, Alcibiades, who was a patrician, but who cultivated, like the Prime Minister,, the democratic vote He was afraid to be seen in public on horseback, and afraid to be seen by his friends taking walking exercise. Between the two, he neithertook walking nor equestrian exercise in public. He was the man who introduced the principle of sitting upon a rail. The politician who sits upon a. rail nowadays can well afford to urge that the Opposition are obstructing business. But they are doing no such thing. The Treasurer has urged that the revenue derived from, the operation of the Tariff during the months of October and November is due to abnormal conditions. Such, however, is not the case, and I challenge the Treasurer to prove his contention. It would be interesting to know the intentions of the Government with regard to the duties on tea and kerosene. I have lieard it stated that the Governmentare verydeeply concerned as to the attitude of the labour party, and that the Treasurer is anxious to obtain all the revenue possible from apparel, in order that he may be able to make concessions in regard to the duties on tea and kerosene. I should like to hear from the Treasurer whether the intention of the Government is to redut-e the duty oneitherkerosene or tea, or both. We should not trifle with the finances of the Commonwealth, and we should not attempt to raise more revenue than is required to meet' the necessities of the Commonwealth and of the States. It is all very well to say that we cannot earmark the revenue that is handed over to the States, and that our responsibility as a Commonwealth ceases when we transfer to the States the proportion of customs, revenue to which they are. entitled; but the citizens of the Commonwealth will expect us to exercise such discretion that only the amount of revenue absolutely necessary will be collected. It is not fairto dispose of important proposals such as we now have before us without the fullest consideration, and I shall regard it as my duty to protest against the business of the country being conducted whilst members are mentally and physically exhausted. The Treasurer not only knows the effects of these long sittings upon the capacity of honourable members to attend to public affairs, but he is also aware of the extent to which mental and physical exhaustion react upon their private business, and his experience has been such that I understand he has said he will consider very serious'y whether he will continue in political life much longer. proceedings such as these must have a serious effect upon honourable members, and it is regrettable that members of the Opposition should feel called upon to adopt -their present tactics as 'a protest against the action of the Government. I am anxious to see the Tariff passed, but it is necessary that the Senate should fully understand that the Tariff when it -goes forward to them will represent the deliberate opinions of this House. By hurrying through the Tariff without proper discussion the Government will excite not only the resentment of the public, but also, possibly, a great deal of opposition in the other Chamber. brought face to face here with certain concrete facts, and the whole situation amounts to this-You, Mr Chairman, do not wish to be where you are, and we do not want to be here, and the question I submit is, why are we all here ? Obviously, there is no sensible answer that can be given. We ask you to leave bhe chair, because we desire to bring to the discussion of these items some degree .of rationality. We have been sitting here for some 22 hours, and yet the Government remain obdurate, neglectful alike of their own interests, and -deaf to the pathetic appeals of honourable members on this side. I wish bo know whether the Government thoroughly realize that we will not have any all-nightsittings in this Parliament? Until they do, you, Mr Chairman, will have before you a long vista of wretched nights in this Chamber. We are sitting here because two obstinate men, who have had no experience of what a determined Opposition can do, believe that by the mere force of their dicta they can overwhelm us. Apparently the Treasurer -does not derive any benefit from experience, learnt a lesson -from the events of last week. Isi t to be supposed that the resources of our party are to be exhausted in a few hours, or that we are going to permit the people of this country to be subjected to taxation which may endure for a decade without giving every item the fullest-consideration ? I defy any one to say that we wasted any time in.the consideration of the duties on cotton and linen goods. My speech on the subject was brevity itself, and I do not think I took up a quarter of an hour altogether in discussing the veiy important item upon which I moved an amendment last evening. Yet the Government were not content, and have now entered upon a course of action which will visit the most dire .personal consequences upon themselves and upon all their following, and will retard the progress of public business. These late sittings must impress the public with the fact that the Federal -Parliament is being asked to proceed with its -grjeat task hurriedly, and without that due regard for that rational and intelligent investigation which a national subject demands ; and it is worth our while to consider what the effect of this course of procedure will be upon the deliberations of the Senate. W ill -it not be open to honourable members in .another place to say that these items have not received the attention they demand, and that they do not represent the calm and deliberate opinion of the majority of honourable members in this Chamber? Therefore, the Government is seeking to make haste in a way that will tend'to delay, and in the end bring about disaster and defeat. The Government ought to proceed upon some wise and regular plan, and to put before us a reasonable daily task. We did a good day's work in disposing of the duties relating to linen and cotton-goods, -and it was too much to ask honourable members to dispose of two items involving £750,000 in one day. Let us do our work in broad daylight. I do not propose to sit up all night to pass any Tariff, or save any Government. The Government will study their own convenience if they agree to conduct their business within reasonable hours. If there should be any delusion in the minds of the Government that they are going to pass the Tariff before Christmas-unles s they make Christmas a moveable 'feast-suc h a delusion had better be dispelled at once, otherwise he would have because they have .no chance of doing any such thing. To discuss the items in this Tariff fairly and fully before Christmas would be an impossible task. If they propose to exhaust the patience and physical energies of honourable members, in fact to exhaust everything in order to rush tlie Tariff through, the. people of Australia will know what term to apply to such conduct. I could wish that the Constitution provided means by which the people at large could express their opinion upon this Tariff. I have no doubt in my mind as to what their verdict would be.

It would be to the interest of the manufacturers themselves if this Tariff were submitted to fche people. If fche Tariff is to be revised at triennial periods, what security will any man have for fche investment of capital in industries which are affected by the imposition of import duties ? If , however, we had a solemn assurance, based upon the verdict of the people that a protectionist, or revenue, policy would endure for ten years, the people of the Commonwealth, and particularly those of New South Wales, would know exactly what to do. The Government have, so far, entirely changed fche fiscal policy of Hew South Wales, and the effect of placing duties on certain articles that have hitherto been admitted free, will be to stimulate the manufacture of certain articles. which the Tariff is being passed, so far from inducing a feeling of security on the part of those who are anxious to invest capital in industrial enterprises, will lead to chaos aud uncertainty. guarantee that the whole policy of the country will not be changed when the next appeal is made to the people. The Treasurer presented ns yesterday with a schedule of items of increased expenditure, as a reason why we should agree to extra taxation, but that affords no sufficient ground for adding to the burdens of the people. The Government make no attempt to adhere fco their original declaration of policy. They tell us in one minute that they must have protection, and in the next moment they tell us that they must have revenue. In connection with the duties on linen and -cotton goods that were dealt with last night, I was interviewed this morning by men engaged in the manufacture of cotton shirts, who asked me if no one had raised a voice on their behalf. The Government were absolutely silent on the point, and yet I find that a large number of people get their living by making up goods which the Treasurer was ready last night to admit free. I am now in possession of information which, if I had had it yesterday, would have turned the minority of six in the division on "" cotton and linen goods n.e.i."" into a majority. I shall now concern myself particularly with the question, which is that the Chairman 23 s 2 leave the chair. (Committee counted.) I ask that the motion shall be carried, or that the Ministry shall consent fco some modus vivendi by which we can proceed to the consideration of public business. The responsibility for this prolonged discussion rests on the shoulders of the Ministry; but now there is no reason why we should not proceed with the ordinary business in a rational way. I ask the Government to disabuse their minds once and for all of the idea that it is .possible at unearthly hours of the morning to force through committee the consideration of these important items. The woollen industry, with which we are immediately concerned, is a lamentable illustration of the inefficiency of protective methods, and we ask that the people generally shall not be preposterously taxed for the benefit of a few manufacturers. I am not one who either in the New South Wales Parliamenfc-or in this Parliament have ever lent myself to obBut the circumstances under struction, and I ask the Government to allow us to give these duties the consideration they deserve. The importations of woollen goods show that the local manufacturer is not seriously competing. The There will be no reason is that the local article is notoriously unfit to compete, and a huge duty is asked for in order that the manufacturers may give the public an inferior article at a superior price. The Government, I presume, have some intentions in regard to this and similar items, and I am anxious to know what they propose to do. I suggested that they should set a certain task each day, but apparently the task, they set is too great when they propose to deal in one afternoon with taxation amounting to £750,000. A t that rate the consideration of a Tariff of £9,000,000 would be completed in twelve or thirteen days, and such expedition was not anticipated. quest which the honourable member made yesterday, but we did not get through the work we ought to have accomplished. arrangement I made ? what we propose to do.

But that up to the particular item we have the Government were met by the motion reached, we have passed nearly £4,000,000 that the Chairman do leave the chair. of Every one who has had any experience of £9,000,000, and that the items completed Parliament. knows that that motion is an in this division aggregate £338,000-no t a attempt to takefchecontrol of the business small achievement for five or six hours out of the hands of the Government, and work.

485,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"In all honesty I was perfectly' ready to make my speech, and, of course, I had a sort of right to open the debate upon such a subject after a Minister had spoken. I was anxious that a division should, if possible, be arrived at upon that item. The honourable and learned member for Corio occupied some time in moving his amendment, and the debate upon it then became general. It continued till twelve o'clock, at which hour he agreed to withdraw his proposal. This particular item formed the key to the whole division which the committee were discussing. I explained last night that when we dealt with the previous item of cotton and linen piece goods we were dealing with an entirely revenue item. It was not a matter of any principle. It did not enter into the great controversy of free-trade versus protection. But the item "" woollen piece goods "" is the base of the superstructure, which means a great deal to the people of Australia. If we put a duty upon woollens, which form the raw material for the madeup article, there naturally should be some scientific proportion maintained between that duty and the charge levied upon the made-up clothing. I was very anxious that the first real matter connected with the manufacturing industries, which are said to he peculiar to ""Victoria, should be treated exhaustively. Thus, when it came to my turn to speak at half-past twelve o'clock this morning, I pointed out that I was not physically fit to do justice to what I considered to be one of the most important parts of the whole schedule. I assured the Treasurer that if he would consent to an adjournment, I would give him my assistance as far as I cbuld-and I know that my party would have stood loyally by me-to bring the debate on this matter to a close this afternoon. But Ministers would not budge. The Prime Minister let the cat out of the bag a little when he said that it was the intention of the Government to force through the whole of the items of this division. cat out of the bag, because the Minister for Trade and Customs openly asked the committee on the previous evening to come prepared to finish this particular division. not grasp that, at any rate. HadI done so I should have remonstrated with the Minister, or have interpreted his remarks as a rather cumbersome joke. Upt ill half past twelve a.m. there was no obstruction to the progress of business. The debar! a upon the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Corio had occupied two hours. A t half-past twelve a.m. the honourable and learned member saw that the prospect of carrying his amendment was so hopeless that he withdrew it without endeavouring to take a vote upon it, and without obtaining a single supporter. A t that hour I think it was a fair thing to ask for an adjournment, especially in view of the fact that certain honourable members had left the House in the belief that business would not be proceeded with after midnight. Upt ill twelve o'clock, two hours and thirtyeight minutes had been occupied by Government supporters, and one hour and fiftyeight minutes by members of the labour party, or a total of four hours thirty-six minutes, as against three hours and eighteen .minutes absorbed by members of the Opposition, despite the fact that it is only reasonable to expect that the Opposition, who have to fight this Tariff tooth and nail, will occupy a longer period in discussing it than will those 'members who are perfectly satisfied with it . Between half-past twelve a.m. and half-past one a.m. I repeatedly, but vainly, urged the Government to adjourn ; and, finally, I was compelled to move that the Chairman do leave the chair. That is the history of the whole matter, and I leave it to this Chamber, and the country, to decide upon which side lies the right or the wrong. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I would suggest that the Government and the Opposition should arrange a compromise. This House ought to be governed by reason, and honourable members ought not to do anything which they cannot defend in the high forum of the human conscience. Therefore, with all due humility, I suggest that the Government, the Opposition, and the labour party should confer together with a view of expediting the transaction of public business. The Britisher will not stand bullying of any kind. He is a most extraordinary animal, and will fight to the last ditch. That is the position of the Opposition, and it is also the position of the Government.

487,Sir William Mcmillan,"to say a word or two by way ofpersonal explanation. I was the first to draw attention to the time occupied by various sections of the House. I . followed the practice to which I was most accustomed, namely, that of the Legislative-Assemblyi n Victoria, in classing honourable members either as Ministerialists or Oppositionists according to the seats which they occupied in this Chamber. WhilstI was speaking, I was asked what I called the Opposition, and I replied, that I included those honourable members who sit below the gangway. The action which I took was subsequently questioned by a number of honourable members. The reasons why I classed honourable members as I did was, firstly, because of the position which they occupy in this Chamber, and secondly, because of the automatic attitude which they adopted towards the Government business presented to them during, the sitting of yesterday. I was not aware at the time that members of the labour party held themselves.absolutely free from the control of the leader or members of the Opposition. But I have since been made aware of that fact through' conversation with members of' the labour party, and by reason of the action which that party took when the Opposition adopted the course which they followed last evening. W it h one notable exception, no member of the labour party assisted the Opposition. The exception was the honourable member for West Sydney, who was absent earlier in the evening, and who has since explained why he took that action. I desire to congratulate the party upon having no connection whatever with the Opposition, and upon their public-spirited attitude in re' framing from obstruction last night. bane) I rise to offer a few words of expostulation in regard to the conduct of this Chamber during the past week, and particularly during the past 24' hours. Last week I was paired, and during my somewhat rapid passage by train and steamer to my home, as, also, on the return journey, I found that my principal duty was to listen to unwholesome encomiums, which were passed upon the Federal Parliament, and particularly upon the House of Representatives. has not got over his sea-sickness. honourable member is politically sea-sick.

Mr O'MALLEY -Then we will march in an army. wish that the honourable member who interjects would speak from his place in Parliament. That is one of the rules which has been very much abused. I have in my mind two or three honourable members who come to the table and there lose their individuality. Do they go there with the idea of having their photographs taken by some gentleman in the gallery? Every honourable member, excepting. Ministers, to whom the use of the table is a great convenience, should speak from his place in the House. I say that in all the Australian States, a quarter of a century ago, parliamentary warfare was conducted much better than it is in this House at the present time. I am ashamed of the conduct of some honourable members. When I came down here, after making a big fight in the ultra-democratic region in Australia, I thought I was going to learn something. I am humiliated and abased at what has been going on. Perhaps both sides are to blame, but certainly we cannot continue to conduct our business in the way we have been doing. We are making ourselves the jest of the Southern. Hemisphere. We talk about,the great nation which Australia is to be in the future, of her sea-girt shore, and of one people with one destiny this flow of irrelevant eloquence.

The whole difficulty may be overcome by the exercise of a little common sense. We did a good day's work yesterday, and I do not think any exception could be taken to the way in which the discussion proceeded upon the items which engaged our attention up to midnight. No attempt was made to block legitimate business, the whole discussion was fair and reasonable, and the Government were not justified in making an attempt to force the committee to give their consideration to -further items beyond the ordinary sitting hours. After midnight we were asked by the Government to take up the consideration of an item which was quite -as important as we had spent some eight or nine hours just before; and if we had acceded to their request we should have renounced any claim we might have to be a deliberative assembly, prepared to discuss honestly and fahiy'all the matters brought before us. The conditions under which the Government desired us to continue the debate were utterly inimical to good work; and I now ask whether in the interests of the community generally some arrangement cannot be arrived at by which the business of the country may be carried on in a reasonable way. Instead of keeping us here all night the Government should arrange for morning sittings. I shall be prepared to sit here from nine or ten o'clock in the morning until midnight, but I will not sacrifice my health by remaining here all night. I hope that the acting leader of the Opposition will now withdraw his motion so that we may be able to get to work. my privilege yesterday to oppose an amendment upon which the committee ' occupied ' most of its time. It was known to this House that certain results would follow from the manner in which the Government dealt with the matters that were then under discussion. Here are two samples of cotton, for shirting, which this morning passed the Customs, one of which is charged 10 per cent., and the other is free; 'and I ask the Minister of Customs or his experts to say which is which. One is invoiced as cambric, and the other as calico, but anything may be called cambric ; and there is no guarantee that next week the material which paid 10 per cent, duty this morning may not be admitted free, and vice vend. Officers of Customs cannot be experts in every branch of industry, and I ask the Minister to see that these anomalies are rectified. bane) -An honourable member has stated that I have been absent from my duties. I was absent four sittings last week on important business, and I was properly paired by the Government whip. I think I am justified in saying that the honourable member puts in a great deal less time in this House than does any other honourable member, and it does not lie in his mouth to cast all sorts of aspersions on honourable members, their qualifications and their States. T^he Opposition cheerfully that over which take the responsibility for what they have done, but they contend that the delay is entirely owing to the unreasonable attitude of the Government. The Prime Minister said the Government would not suffer the dictation of the minority ; but the Opposition are the victims of what they believe to be the coercion of the majority. We ought to take every reasonable care that the Tariff is one which will appeal to the intelligence of the community, and will bear the strictest scrutiny. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has endeavoured to clear away some misrepresentations which he made at arr early part of this debate, when he led honourable members to believe that the whole responsibility for delay was due to the Opposition. I have obtained some information from the same 'source as the honourable member, and I find that he credited the speeches of the whole of the labour party to the Opposition in the discussion of linen goods.

Motion, by leave, withdrawn. worth) -It is a very curious circumstance that at this hour of the afternoon there is absolutely nobody except the honourable member for Laanecoorie upon the Government benches.. I do not altogether dissociate the proceedings of this committee from the idea of a deliberative assembly. When I move in favour of reducing the ad valoremduty upon woollen piece goods, 1 think that honourable members upon the other side of the House might at least extend to me the courtesy of being in their places. I feel great interest in opening up this question, because it affects one or two phases of the great controversy of free trade versus protection. I have asked myself upon several occasions whether in a protective country like Victoria there is any possibility of protectionists deciding that some particular industry could reasonably live uponitsown merits. I have been wondering whether there is one industry here which is so surrounded by circumstances favorable to its growth that oven the most extreme protectionist will say"" That is an industry which can afford to live upon its own resources."" When dealing with the soap industry, honourable members had to take into consideration the fact that a tax had been imposed upon the raw materials used in its manufacture. Therefore, we had to deal with the soap industry in a way different from that in which it has been dealt with under free-trade conditions. We had to give it a moderate protection. But in this case we have an article which stands absolutely alone under conditions favorable to its manufacture. It I say that in England, is made up of wool, upon which there is no duty-woo l which is obtained in this country. The raw material can be secured at ascheap a rate here as can any raw material in the would. Such an -industry to my mind does not require protection, although I am not going to attempt to place it upon the free list. In the first place, it has a natural protection in the initial cost of the raw material-wool . It has a natural protection of 10 per cent, as compared with the manufactured article brought toour shores. AVe propose now to give it a 10 per cent, protection. If , therefore, we have regard to the first cost of the wool here, to bhe 10 ,per cent, charges for bringing the manufactured material to Australia, and to a 10 per cent, duty, it will be seen that we are giving it a protection of 30 per cent, ad valorem. I should likefcoknow if that is not sufficient to cover all labour conditions and everything else 1 Honourable members have talked"" about this industry in New South Wales. I know well enough that it is not developed to the same extent bhere as it is here. A few years ago, a 45 per cent, rate was imposed upon the industry in A ic7 toria, as a result of which it was forced into existence. Therefore, it is impossible to argue under the two conditions. But the fact remains that New South Wales hasbeenable to carry on the manufacture, of a certain quantity of woollen goods without fche aid of any duty whatever.

515,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"10 per cent, rate is to my mind. a. sumcient protection to confer upon the local manufacturer of this article. (Committee counted.) If it were possible to apply the bonus system to many industries which honourable members desire to protect, there is no doubt that they could be well protected by that means. All I wish to do is to ascertain the point up to which it is necessaiy to protect an article of this kind. Has there been any exhaustive statement made concerning the histoiy of these industries, andas to how rnuch money they are making ? Have the com' mittee been informed why 20 per cent, ad valorem is put forward as the proper measure of protection which this industiy should enjoy ? I do not believe in arriving at such a limit by mere rule-of-fchumb. The most extreme protectionist should desire the imposition of only that amount of duty which is really necessaiy to the establishment of the industry. What have we before us to justify a rate of 20 per cent. ? We have not one jot of information except that 25 per cent, was the duty which formerly operated in Victoria. There is absolutely no evidence before the committee. The whole thing is taken for granted; Of course the Government have a majority, and I suppose that they can take anything for granted-under the circumstances; Many of the companies engaged in this industry are limited liability companies. Have we any information before us as to what profits they are making, and as to whether the duty proposed is excessive or too little 1 We have none whatever. one exception. I know of one particular case in which a firm admitted that they could carry on their business successfully with the aid of a smaller duty, but when they were questioned as to the duty for which they intended to ask, they replied"" We are going to get the highest duty that we can."" What will be the effect of the proposed duty in a country like Australia, a large area of which possesses a tropical and sub-tropical climate? Honourable members will not deny that if we impose a 20 per cent, duty upon woollens, we shall make them practically 30 per cent, dearer than the imported article. The result will be that the working man will be driven to wear cotton goods, and do we not know thattheindividual who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow should for the sake of his health use woollen goods? Some honourable members favour this duty, and profess to be democrats, b u t that is the most unutterable hypocrisy ever known in the political life of this country. I am perfectly satisfied that the worse thing that can happen to the manufacturersi n Victoria is a continuance of' the operation of these high duties. There will be such a reaction in Australia, that probably the whole of these duties will be swej)t away. In the interests of the workers of Australia and as a compromise, I beg to move That the words ""and on and after oth December, 1901, 10 rjer cent."" be added to the duty ""Piece goods -Woollen, or containing wool, n.e.i ad valorem 20 per cent."" would be far better if we credited each other' with honest intentions. I fail to see why charges of hypocrisy should be levelled against this side, or that the desire to do what is best for the working man rests entirely with the other side. I do not believe that there is hypocrisy upon either the Government or the Opposition side of the House. I am glad that the acting leader of the Oppositiori proposes to give these articles some measure of protection. He has now admitted that many industriesare entitled to reasonable protection against what he described the other night as tlie "" sweepings-,"" which are landed here from foreign markets. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I said that I believed in compromise owing to the existing condition of affairs in Australia, but I never gave up my free-trade principles. able member certainly said that the "" sweepings "" of the foreign marketscame into Sydney. honourable friend allow me to make a personal explanation? I was twitted the other night with being interested as an importer, and I said that as far as those interestswere concerned, a reasonable duty would benefit me far better than a free port, because Sydney received the "" sweepings "" of the world. When I saw the sense in which the word ""sweepings"" was interpreted, I substituted the words, "" surplus products of the world."" These, I said,, came into the port of Sydney, and were inimical to my business. But I never in any sense gave up my free'trade principles.

It was sbated last night that one Sydney firm had paid a dividend of 6 per cent., but I do not think that is a retrurn such as we should expect from any manufacturing concern. I fail to see why we should be forced to send raw material from Australia to be made up in Great Britain or some other country, and then re-import that material to enable us to make up the clothes that we have to wear. The woollen industry is one to which we -should give a fair amount of protection, so that we may be able to make up our raw material here. would apply to everything else-wh y should we import at all 1 already stated my reasons. It was stated by the honourable member for Macquarie that some woollen articles were dearer in Victoria than in New South Wales, and when inquiry was made it was found bhat these were Jaeger's goods. Of course those are not made here, and the imposts upon such articles are revenue duties. We know that where there is no competition within the Commonwealth, a revenue duty undoubtedly adds to the price which the consumer has to pay ; but where there is competition here, we certainly do not have to pay the whole, if we have to pay any, of the duty that has been imposed. I would °ask the honourable member for Macquarie to mention some goods which are imported, and which are .also manufactured here, so that we may compare Sydney and Melbourne prices. plenty of comparisons before I have done. heard a great deal about -the natural .protection which is afforded by the freight and other charges nipon imported goods. We have been told that the natural protection added to the .10 per cent, duty which the acting leader of the-Opposition proposes, will give the local manufacturer an advantage of 30 per cent. I presume 'that the -freight and charges include the cost of carrying'the raw material to the -factory in England, and bringing it out here in a I think it will be found manufactured form. We know, with regard to the question of freight, that concessions are made when goods are sent out to .Australia, and that every effort is being made by building large ships, and in other ways to cheapen freights. Then again, as a set.off against this natural protection, we must not forget that the cost of freight 'from woollen mills at such places as Castlemaine and Ballarat to Melbourne must be very considerable, and that it probably bears a fair proportion to the freights which are paid on goods imported. t not represent more than is paid for railway carriage in England. may not be. If , however, we are to close up our woollen mills and not manufacture any woollen goods, what benefit will the purThe same thing chaser derive from this natural protection 1 The purchaser has to pay all this natural protection if he buys imported goods, and I have whilst I am not going to deny that the manufacturers in some cases derive benefit from this natural protection, I contend that if we abolish our production here, the purchaser will have to pay the whole of the natural protection, which will be added to the price of his goods. If we once k i ll our manufacturers, the consumer will have to pay a little more for the manufactured article than if a little protection were .granted to local manufacturers. I quite admit that this is a very important question, because we have to deal with a very considerable industry, and we are-proposing what we consider to be a fair, and reasonable rate of protection. Some of the imported woollen articles will have to be used in the manufacture of made-up goods, and we believe that we are fixing a rabe which will give a fair though not too high a margin to the manufacturer",105,Smith Is The Honourable

Erom the Statistical Register of New South Wales and the Statistical Register of Yictoria, I find that in New South AValesi n 1900 there were 460,000 yards of woollen piece goods manufactured in four mills containing 221 operatives, there being no duty. In Yictoria, under a employing 917 operatives, though Victoria has the smaller area and population, and a smaller demand. In Victoria during tlie same year there were manufactured 2,160,015 yards of woollen piece goods, 33,427 pairs of -Eo r as long as it blankets, and 3,200 rugs, or altogether five times the production of New South Wales. Admitting that the advantages of the two States are equal, these figures show that a duty has helped the Victorian woollen factories so far as production is concerned. That the duty in Victoria was not prohibitive is shown by further figures from the Statistical Register. The imports of woollen goods into Victoria are divided into those which pay 25 per cent., those which pay 15 per cent., and those which come in free; and of the £700,000 worth ,of woollen goods, or goods containing wool, which in 1900 were imported into Victoria, £300,000 consisted of dress pieces, which came in free.

567,Mr Fowler,"Then what is the use of agive the local manufacturer something to compete for, because otherwise he could not get the market or keep it, owing to the cutting of prices, which is an every-day market operation, and against which the greatest force is that of the State. In 1900 the imports into New South Wales of all kinds of woollens came to £769,748, while in Victoria, including £300,000 worth of dress pieces, they totalled £700,000. The reason for this equality in piece goods was that New South Wales imported manufactured apparel much more largely than Victoria. This manufactured, apparel, valued at 1,250,000, came from all sorts of places, where wages and theconditions of production are such as would not bo submitted to in Australia, even if the alternative were the closing of all our factories. The re-exports from New South Wales last year of woollen goods amounted to £78,563, whereas those of Victoria were valued at only £45,038. A t first sight it might appear that New South Wales was establishing a foreign trade by means of her unprotected factories, which Victoria could not do under protection. But out of the £78,563 worth of reexports only £ 1 1 0 worth represented Australian-made goods, the rest being of foreign production; whereas the £45,000 worth of goods re-exported by Victoria had, with the exception of £2,000, been made in that State. I have always been what I call a moderate protectionist; that is, I believe that the barrier which we put up to protect our internal trade should be high enough to secure the chance to the local manufacturer of a footing in the local market after paying proper wages, and to enable him to get a sufficiently large market for an output great enough to make it possible to provide a reasonable article at a proper price. Above such a limit there is the danger, which always exists, whether in a free-trade or a protectionist country, of combinations to take undue advantage of conditions. So long, however, as the barrier is not too high the danger is minimized, because the moment prices are unduly raised, imports from abroad, at prices reduced so as to secure the market, destroy combinations and maintain things at a proper level. In Victoria' the duties have been reduced from 45 per cent, to 25 per cent.,.which rate has prevailed from 1895 ; and the proposed reduction of 5 per cent, is a serious matter for the mills. 23 T Victoria produces more locally-made woollens than the rest of the Commonwealth put together, and, so far, it is specially a Victorian industry, because in that Statei t has been specially looked after. more locally-made woollens, relatively, than does Tasmania. MrM c CAY I am not speaking relatively, but of absolute products. There is no reason why this industry should remain purely Victorian, now that the border barriers have been removed, and there is one fiscal wall against the outside world. Woollen mills inside must now take their chances one with the other, and in an Australian industry of this character the fact that New South Wales, with all her advantages, has . only four mills, is sufficient proof that reasonable protection is necessary. To offer the woollen industry of Australia a duty of 10 per cent, is offering a stone where bread is wanted. Personally, I think a duty of 25 per cent, is not unreasonable, but, in a spirit of compromise, T am ready to accept 20 per cent., in the hope that the larger markets now available will make up the difference. leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer have both dwelt on the question of natural protection, but there is one aspect on which they have not« touched. The fall in the price of wool in the last few years seems to me to have veiy much increased the natural protection of the industry. Wool which was sold a few years ago at Is. is now not worth more than' 8d., representing a fall in value of something like 33 per cent. When we come to the lower-priced wool, we find a greater relative fall in value Wool which a few years ago brought 9d. now brings only 6d., and in the coarser crossbreds there has been a fall of something like 50 per cent. I think I am well within the estimate when I say that the cost of taking the raw material, say to Bradford, and bringing back the manufactured article is not less than 2d. per l b ; indeed, I am informed by an expert in the trade that the cost is a good deal more. But' if we take the cost at 2d. per lb., and apply it to wool selling at Is. per lb., that means a natural protection of 10§ per cent., but on the same wool selling at 8d., the natural protection is 25 per cent. Taking the wool which sells at 9d., the cost means a protection of 22 2-9ths. per cent.,' and on the same woolat 6d. it",108,Smith Is The Honourable

The medium arid lower classes of woolsare those which are most used in the factories, and if we apply the same test to wool sold'at 4d. per lb. we find that the natural protection is 50 per cent. I do not advocate a duty so low as that proposed by the acting leader of the Opposition. The Treasurer has on occasionsendeavoured to strike an average as amongst the various States, and if, taking into consideration that New South Walesis free, he does so in this case, he will find that the average duty is something like 14-jjper cent.

My own cross-bred wool in London one winter month from burns, the result of has not been sold yet, because the price of wearing cotton apparel. Moreover, it seems that class of wool is so low that I hope it to me exceedingly unfair that the use of the may improve; the comparison is not a fair one, because the price which the honourable member takes tested, it would be a veiy good thing to is altogether too low, and he will not sell absolutely prohibit their importation or to at it . wool, but I fear that I shall not get a higher price. Somelittle time ago the Minister for Trade and Customs said it was preposterous that.we should have to ' send our wool to the other side of the world in. order to. get it converted into the manufactured article, and afterwards brought back to Australia. Buti t is not preposterous advocate of a duty of 1.5 per cent. ad valorem to urge-, that an industry which has been so I wish to reply to one or two statements: heavily protected for over. 30 years as has which have been made during the course of the woollen industry, is not able to flourish , the debate.

I am quite willing to vote for a 15 per cent, ad valorem if the Government will agree to it . I do not know of any companies interested in this industiy which are paying high dividends, but I believe that under a more moderate duty, and with tlie keen competition which will ensue between W h e n we comthe different States, they should be able to benefit than they can be afforded by means goods form a much healthier apparel than do into Australia is not only unhealthy, I think the value of especially for children, but is very dangerous word "" flannelette "" should be permitted in connection with cotton goods.

575,Mr Cruicksha Nk (Gwydir),"As anin Kew Soutli, Wales command only part of the market of that State. Moreover, the producer there has not been able to send his produce into Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, or New Zealand. Then again, if he shipped his goods to England, he would have to compete with advanced machinery, and larger and older established factories. I wish further to point out that the Treasurer seems to have made no allowance for an increased population, and, therefore, for an increased demand. Personally, I believe that our trade will be doubled. Last night I stated that the whole factor in this matter was one of tlie freight between 'here and England, and of the difference between the wages paid here and those paid in England. I believe that the cost of manufacture in the old country represents 15 per cent, as against 25 per cent, in Australia. To my mind the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent, would constitute too sweeping a reduction for Victorian factories. Fifteen per cent, is the rate which has hitherto operated generally throughout the States, and I hope to have an opportunity at a later stage to move for the imposition of that rate of duty. ray mind the acting leader of the Opposition has offered a very fair compromise to the Government. According to the experience of the honourable member for the Gwydir,. the cost of manufacture in England is 15 per cent, as against 25 per cent, in Australia, or a difference of 10 per cent., which is the amount of duty proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth. But the local manufacturer enjoys a natural protection because of the freight between here and the mother country, which upon the statement of the honourable member for the Grampians represents about 33 per. cent. That is quite as much protection as. any Australian manufacturer can expect, seeing that in New South Wales the industry has had no protection whatever. In most of the States1 know from experience that the superior class of textiles are not manufactured. According to the testimony of experts* the best tweeds worn in Australia are imported. The honourable and learned member' for Corinella. said that the imports into New, South Wales and Victoria were very similar in value; In this connection I wish to mention, that in 1900, New South Wales imported £682,759 worth of -superior tweeds, whilst Victoria 23 T 2 imported £668,419 worth. These goods were imported into Victoria because they cannot be manufactured here. They are manufactured in England and Scotland, and the duty which it is proposed to impose upon these materials would constitute, a direct tax upon the consumer. It represents upon every suit of clothes made of that material an extra cost of 15s. I would further point out that tlie honourable member for North Sydney has definitely stated that woollen dress material cannot be made in Australia. The standard width is 44 inches, and it is used by women only, because the width is not suitable for . the manufacture of men's clothing. The honourable member's argument was to my mind most convincing. Upon this particular line of goods, which cannot be manufactured in Australia, I find that the Treasurer estimates he will derive a. revenue of £198,000. I might also mention another, line of goods which is not made in Australia, and which has hitherto been admitted free of duty. I refer to dress melton cloth. To impose a duty upon that will be of no benefit to the manufacturer. He may be able to charge an extra price upon the duty which is paid, but he cannot produce the class of article which is used in the manufacture of caps. In connection with saddlery and horsecollars, we know that the cloth and serge used constitutes the raw material for themanufacturer. Yet the Government propose to levy a 20 per cent, duty upon the importations of this material. declare those things to be minor articles if they are not made in Australia. the acting leader of the Opposition has made out a very strong case indeed, and I hope that the Government will accept the reasonable compromise which he bas offered. that this matter of woollens, is one of the most important which we have to consider, because the woollen, industry is the industry of all Australia. The total product from pastoral pursuits isput down at £33,000,000 out of £1.11,000,000, which represents the total annual proceeds of our staple industries.

579,Mr Kingston,"I venture to thinkthink we can draw a very comparison between an industry of this description which is protected, and an industry which is not. I take the case of New South Wales where there has been an absence of protection, and that of Victoria where there has been a reasonable protection. What is the natural position 1 It is that New South Wales has an immense advantage over Victoria in that she produces a far greater quantity of wool. I find that in 1891 New South -321,000,000 lbs. of wool, as against Victoria's 69,000,000 lbs., whilst in 1899 the -former State produced 252,000,000 lbs., as -against 64,000,000 lbs. produced by the latter. natural advantages were with New South ""Wales as regards the quantity of wool -available for -local. manufacture. standing some criticisms to the contrary, I think it is highly desirable that we should be able to produce such woollen manufactures as we require for local consumption. It is to be deplored that we have to depend to any considerable extent upon an outside supply. difference in the position of Victoria and New South Wales as regards their use* of wool for local manufacture. quoted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella in this connection show that Victoria has far outstripped New South Wales. ;New South Wales was 460,000 lbs., whilst in Victoria it was 2,160,000 five times the quantity. .221 persons were employed in the industry in ' New South Wales, as against 917 in Victoria, As a result of the imposition of the duty to -which I have referred, a woollen manufacturing industry has been established in Vic-toria which altogether outstrips the industry in fche older and equally powerful and resourceful country. propose is intended to be levied for protective purposes and for revenue purposes. As -regards protection, honourable members see that fche result of the adoption of that policy is that 700 more hands are employed in this industry in Victoria than are employed in New South Wales. revenue, what is the position 1 We hope to receive £336,000 annually on the basis of a duty of 20 per cent, ad valorem upon a total value of £1,680,000 of local manufacture. side of the House propose to reduce that Mr Kingston. interesting duty by 10 per cent -to outfit down from 20 per cent, to 10 per cent. That means that we should lose revenue to the extent of £168,000 unless the imports increase to the extent necessary to make up the difference. Unless we import double the quantity of goods, we shall lose that revenue on a 10 per cent, as compared with the 20 per cent, basis. We are now importing £1,680,000 worth of woollen goods, on which we expect to realise a revenue of £ 3 3 6 , 0 0 0; and if Wales produced we reduce the duty we shall either lose half this revenue, or else have to increase our imports from other parts of the world, and transfer fche money which has hitherto passed into the pockets of our own people There is no denying that all the into those of manufacturers on the other side of the world. We need only look at these figures to have the conclusion forced Notwithupon us that the additional revenue, if we are to get it, would be dearly bought at the price we should have to pay through the limitation of our local manufactures and the loss of profitable industrial employment for our people. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I wish to call attention to the -The question for us to consider, is whether if we reduce this duty we shall do any serious and. permanent injury to the The figures woollen manufacturers within the Commonwealth. It has been urged by the Treasurer that we shall not only lose revenue by reducing this duty, bufc that we shall cripple We find that the quantity used in the local manufacturer of woollen goods. It seemed to me, however, that the honourable lbs -nearly member for North Sydney utterly demolished On the other hand the right honourable gentleman's arguments. I admit that protection has done something towards establishing the Victorian woollen industry, bufc it has been done at a tremendous cost to the whole community -1 do not see any force in the argument of the Minister for Trade and Customs that if we import more of these woollen goods we shall The duty which we incur a national loss. If the men now employed in the woollen industry can no longer find employment at that avocation, they will have to obtain other work, and it does not follow that their labour will be entirely lost to the community. I coutend that it is natural for us to carry As regards on fche manufacture of woollen goods, and that we ought to be able to do this without the assistance of a protective duty. It has been stated that certain natural advantages, which are enjoyed in New South Wales, Honourable members on the other enabled fche manufacturers there to succeed without the assistance of any protective duty, whereas the Victorian manufacturers -withou t these natural advantages-hav e needed the assistance of a protective duty of 25 per cent. If this is a correct statement of the position, and natural advantages have enabled New South. Wales woollen factories to succeed without the aid of protection, the effect of imposing a duty of 20 per cent, upon woollen goods will be not to protect the Victorian manufacturer, but to hand the amount of the-duty over to the manufacturers who will start operations in New South Wales, and eventually be able to wipe the Victorian manufacturer out of existence. There are otherplacesin Australasia in which the manufacture of woollens has been carried on with great success, and without any such natural advantages as it is claimed are possessed by New South Wales. Take the case of New Zealand. Her woollen manufactures, in the shape of rugs, tweeds, and blankets, have been exported to New South Wales for many years past, and have been able to compete successfully, and in the open market, with the rest of the world. The New Zealand goods are selected as the very best obtainable, and the fact that they have been able to compete successfully with foreign manufactures affords a very strong argument against any excessive protection. It may be stated that New Zealand exports her surplus manufactures to New South Wales, and that she is able to dispose of them at a cheaper rate to outside customers than to consumers in New Zealand itself; but as against that, I can quote the case of Aitken'e woollen factory at Hobart, the products of which command a ready sale in Sydney. do not send their surplus products to the Australian market, because their woollen goods in the form of dress materials, blankets, and flannels, are so eagerly sought for that they have no surplus at a l l ; the orders they receive are very much in advance of what they can produce. Immediately the ports of Australia are thrown open to these woollen goods, more capital will be embarked in the Tasmanian industry, and Messrs. Aitken Bros, will be prepared without any duty to carry on a successful business for the benefit of tlie whole of the Commonwealth. I agree that we should raise revenue without destroying industries, and I am prepared to give some protection to industries now established. A t the same time, I shall be no party to imposing a duty such as is now proposed by the Government, and I shall, therefore, support the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth. . out in reference to the New Zealand woollen industry that the manufacturers there are protected by a duty of 20 per cent., and that in spite of this the imports of: woollen piece goods into New Zealandi n creased from £170,000 worth in 1894 to £297,000 worth in 1899. Therefore, thewoollen industry of New Zealand cannot be making any great headway, and it isuseless to point to that colony as affording an example for our guidance. It might be assumed that woollen goods were displaced to a very great extent by theimportation of appareland slops, but thestatistics show that the imports of apparel and slops increased in value from £300,000 worth in 1894 to £395,000 worth in 1S99This increase in apparel and slops has taken place in the face of a protective duty of 25 per cent. agree with the proposal of the Government, nor with the amendment proposed by the acting leader of the Opposition, as I think that a 15 per cent, duty would besufficiently high for the purposes of reveHue, and in order to afford some degree of protection to local manufacturers.. I do not think the duty is imposed so much for revenue purposes as for the protection, of the woollen manufacturers of Victoria. This industry has been heavily protected! for many years, and by this time it should be in a position to compete with the outsideMessrs. Aitken Brothers world, with a far lower rate of duty than that proposed by the Ministry. Considering the duties which have hitherto been levied upon woollen goods throughout the States, I think 15 per cent, would representa fair compromise, and that by adopting; that rate we should be showing plenty of. consideration for the Victorian woollen industry. claimed by-some honourable members that protection reduces prices, but judging from the experience of two ladies from Western Australia, whom I met soon after my arrival here, woollen goods-blankets , ,at any rate-ar e dearer in Melbourne than in Western Australia.

These industries have been flourishing for a considerable time, and ifc has been found necessary, more particularly in Victoria, to reduce the duties. In AVestern Australia there is a 10 per cent, duty, and our imports, considering the population, are large.

But I cannot forget that a condition of things has been created in Victoria which it is not part of my commission to destroy. I am strongly of opinion that this is one of the industries which should receive such assistance as, keeping the revenue in mind, may be given fco it, and I shall be glad to support a duty of 15 per cent. In considering this question we must have regard to the duty on the manufactured article which we shall subsequently have to consider. AVhile theoretically in favour of the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, I cannot see my way to vote for ifc in view of the existing industries. not want"" the House fco be-under any misapprehension as to how my vote will go, and I at once say t h a t . I cannot support the proposal of 20 per cent. Ifc may seem strange that, entering the House as a pronounced protectionist, I am not able fco see eye to eye with my friends of Victoria. This'is not a matter of revenue so much as a matter of protection, and the Ministry would no doubt be quite satisfied, so far as revenue is concerned, wifch a 15 per cent, duty. I might almost say that I am more in sympathy with the views expressed by the acting leader of the Opposition than with those of the Government upon this question. It may be correct that 10 per cent, added to the natural advantages would be sufficient to ensure fche development of this great industry in the'Commonwealth, but I am anxious to make sure that there sliall be no doubt of the establishment of the industry. I am, therefore, prepared to compromise, and vote fche natural advantages added the protection willcome to over 30 per cent., as shown by the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Gwydir. I am sorry to differ from fche Government, but I must follow the dictates of my own conscience, and remember the pledges I gave to my constituents, as a moderate protectionist. sence of any proposal fora lower duty, I shall support a reduction to 10 per cent. This is an industry which ought to be carried on without any protection.

As to the competition of the local article with the imported article reducing . prices, that might be the result if we had three or four competing companies here, but with a Tariff such as the Government proposes, which would prevent importation, it would not be very long before the four or . five manufacturers amalgamated and had the community at their mercy. If a duty of 25 per cent, gave the whole market, it would not be long before some home firm to whoma million of money would be nothing, would come out and crush the local manufacturers. If the duties were all removed and woollen articles were admitted free, I should be prepared to subsidize local manufacture to the full amount of the labour . they employ. 'Treasurer was speaking, I asked how it was that prior to any duty being imposed in Victoria, there were woollen mills established in that State, one of which at least was paying dividends. The Treasurer seemed to doubt my statement, but according to evidence given before a Tariff commission in Geelong in 1881, Mr Nicholas, the sec, retary of the Woollen Cloth Company stated that that company was established in the year 1866, which was five years before any duty was imposed. secretary for about only'twelve months when he gave that evidence, and he knew nothing about the matter. the pompany, I presume, and he said that the first dividend was declared in 1869, which was two years before the first 10 per -cent, duty was imposed in Victoria.

In 1878 when the duty was 10 per cent., the people employed in the industry in Victoria was 736, whereas in 1895 when the iniquitous duty of 40 per cent, was imposed, the number decreased to 710. The total number of hands employed in the Woollen mills throughout the Commonwealth is not more than 1,500. in Victoria number at 2,000, we must remember that there are nearly 4,000,000 people in the Commonwealth who use woollen goods. Are we to have regard to only the 1,500 or 2,000, and neglect the interests of the great mass of the people of the Commonwealth 1 MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I would urge the honourable member for Wentworth to help the Government to carry the proposal for a duty of 20 per cent.

He desires to see the establishment of industries in which his children can find employment. The early slave-masters of the southern States of America did not want to see factories established, because the people could go for relief to such places. To-day the millionaires of this country do not want to see manufacturing industries built up, because they constitute a relieving valve for the children of Victoria, and obviate the necessity of all of them becoming servants. I hope that the Government will adhere to the duty of 20 per cent., and that even the honourable member for ""West Sydney will assist us to obtain it . the Minister for Trade and Customs whether, if these items are passed as the heads are at present arranged, he will consider the subject matter of two letters which my colleague, Mr Poynton, handed to him from the warehousemen of South Australia. It was suggested in those letters that the heads should be simplified by the omission of many of the details. For example, it was put that two heads would be sufficient for item 64, piece-goods containing wool or silk'that upon these the duty should be 15 per cent, ad valoremand piece goods made of cotton, linen, or jute, or of any combination of any or either of these materials, not elsewhere industry is handicapped more by the quality cluded , the duty upon those being 10 per cent. of the water than is the industrj' in VicTo my mind there is a good deal of force in the suggestion that two sub-heads would be sufficient. Dealing with the general question which is before the committee, I would point out that in South Australia this industry enjoyed a protection of 10 per cent, in 1887, but after ten years' trial it was raised to 15 per cent. Yet the result is that we have onlj' one factory established in that State, namely, the Lobethal factory. Altogether there are only 78 hands employed in the industry in South Australia. Even the Lobethal factory is a failure. It cannot keep the dyes in the wool, and the result is that, after a very short time, the latter becomes baggy. I gave it a trial myself, and as a result became nearly as The factories of angular in my proportions as the mind of the Minister' for Trade and Customs will probably be at the close of this session. There is another reason why the committee should decide in favour of a lower rate of duhy. Some eight or ten months ago I saw a calculation made in one of the newspapers as to the natural protection which was enjoyed by 1,000 bales of wool, each containing 360 lbs., and the selling price of which was Is. per lb. It will be seen that the value of the wool was £18,000. The natural protection upon this amount, including all charges, from the appointment in England of a buyer to come to Australia to purchase the wool to the final landing of the manufactured article here, was £3,875. Surely that constitutes a pretty stiff natural protection. Yet, in addition to that, the acting leader of the Opposition proposes a further protective duty of 10 per cent. To my mind that is eminently a fair compromise. In Victoria attempts have been made by means of all sorts of protective duties, ranging as high as 45 per cent., to establish this industry, notwithstanding which it has been a comparative failure. The Minister for Trade and Customs made a comparison between New South ""Wales and Victoria, but was careful to avoid making a similar comparison between the latter State and New Zealand, where a 20 per cent, duty has been operating. Some time ago I learned from an expert the reasons for the comparative failure of the woollen industry in Australia. The Lobethal factory in South Australia has failed to a great extent, owing to the peculiar quality of the water. In New South Wales the intoria, whilst in New Zealand its greater success is largely due to the appropriate quality of the water. It is impossible to force an industry against natural conditions. In view of all these circumstances, I regard the compromise of 10 per cent as a very reasonable one, and shall, therefore, support it . marks of the last speaker go to prove",115,Geobge Tukner Is Wool Low Or Cotton Goods The Flannelette Which Comes

600,Mr Kennedy (Moira),"If the' reanything, it is that 20 per cent, is a proper duty to impose. We all know that natural conditions constitute an important factor in the success of any industry, and in this connection the kink, of mind of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is most extraordinary. He goes so far as to compare the conditions of to-day with those which existed 37 years ago. When the honourable member talks of the success of the factory in Geelong 37 years ago without the aid of protection, and says it should be a success today without any such aid, he leaves out of consideration most material factors. Thirty^ seven years ago the freight rates alone constituted a splendid protection to the Victorian manufacturer, provided he had the necessary machinery to begin operations. But times have changed since then. The honourable member has attempted to compare things which are utterly unlike. Surely' he will admit that Kalgoorlie could not be developed if the same conditions prevailed there to-day as obtained 10 years ago. I cannot support the proposal to reduce the duty upon this article to 10 per cent., although it has that I have committed myself in writing to a maximum of 15 per cent. I hope that whenever that statement is repeated in this Chamber, those making it will produce some evidence in support of it . The view which I take of the situation in connection with this particular industry is that the wider market which has resulted from the adoption of Inter-State free-trade, will enable the industry to succeed in Victoria with a lower rate of duty than that which has hitherto prevailed. It is not the manufacturer, however, who has derived the benefit of the dufcy which formerly operated. As a matter of fact, I am credibly informed that the b6st class of woollen cloth is obtainable here at a. rate which approximates very closely to that ruling in Yorkshire. But from some peculiar set of circumstances, the manufacturers of woollen cloth have not been able fco get their goods direct on to the market, and the warehousemen of the city have been distributing those goods and obtaining the spoil. But with the wider field for operations which is now available, it is certain that such conditions will not be allowed to continue. In conclusion, I might point out that there are some, classes of woollen piece goods which we do not manufacture within the Commonwealth, such as dress piece goods,and woollen material; also serge, which is 'used in connection with saddlery. . A t a later stage, I shall move that these articles be placed upon the free list. worth) I think it would be a fair thing to take a vote upon this item without further delay. Whatever may be the arguments in favour of this industry from a protectionist sfcand-doinfc, not one single reason has been adduced during the whole of the discussion to show that a 10 per cent, dufcy is not sufficient to carry out any reasonably protective system. In the course of my remarks I pointed out that collar checks, kersey, and serge were extensively used in connection with the saddlery industry, and could not be manufactured here. I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to this important fact. look into it . the material from .which wa.terprqof cloth is been stated manufactured placed upon the free list, as it is well known fchafc ifc cannot be made here. Accordingly' I shall move for an exemption in that direction later on. would simplify matters considerably if the list of exemptions were put together. The Treasurer expects to derive £338,000 of revenue from this particular line. Honourable members have been asked to recollect that there are 1,500 men employed in this particular industry throughout Australia. But the fact has been carefully ignored that over 200 of those men have been employed in New South Wales, where the industry receives no assistance whatever. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Piesse, has also pointed out that there are 158 men employed in that State who, as tlieir chief market is New South Wales, have evidently been able to flourish under free-trade conditions. I would further point out that out of a total of 1,500 hands employed in this industry over 600 would find employment in it as'a natural industry without the aid conferred by the imposition of any duty whatever. Buti t would even pay the State to give each of those 1,500 men £ 1 0 0 annually to remain idle, rather than to allow them to continue in this industry, in which their wages do not average more than 25s. weekly.

If there be any trade natural in a new country apart from consists of putting things together. In the early days we imported all the material for carriages and put them together, and so we garments by a process known to every housewife. In New South Wales 75 per cent, of the whole of the clothing worn is made in that State at a rate which will compete with that in any part of Australia. Everybody must wear clothes, and on this commodity depends the comfort of all classes of the population, especially the working classes. When we consider that 25 per cent, means 35 per cent, under certain circumstances, it will be seen that an increase of the duty is a very serious matter. If the duty does not increase the price, and we can compete without any duty, where is the necessity for any impost? Under the system which has been adopted, there is supposed to be some additional rate for the finished article, but to make this duty 25 per cent, is to give 5 per cent, more than is necessary for carrying on the industry. The wages paid in New South ""Wales are practically the same as those paid in Victoria, and we are willing to make a concession to meet.the views which have been rampant in the latter State; but this extra 5 per cent, is practically a present to the clothing manufacturers.

That is the reason why we fixed the duty upon silks at 15 per cent., instead of at 20 per cent. We wanted to allow of that margin between the duty upon the raw material and that upon the finished article, but found that we could not accomplish our purpose without asking for too large a duty upon the manufactured article. In connection with woollens, we were forced to leave a difference of only 5 per cent., or else to ask for a dutjof 35 per cent, upon the madeup article. We therefore elected to leave a margin of 5 per cent., although I think that it should be at least 10 per cent. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN fair to New South Wales. New South Wales in the future will make almost all the apparel and attire which her inhabitants need.' As I understand the matter, New South Wales imports a large quantity of apparel and attire which ought to be manufactured in our own States. Surelyi t is not unreasonable to say that in this industry, which employs a very large number of people, who would find it difficult to secure other employment, there shall be a margin of 10 per cent, between the duty upon the raw material, most of which has to be imported, and that on the madeup article. Under the circumstances, I hope the committee will not reduce the impost. wish to make an earnest appeal to the committee to support the proposal of the Government. That proposal is to afford protection to the female workers in connection with industries, nearly all of which are controlled by wages boards. A great deal has been said about the Tariff and its effects. In this connection I should like to direct attention to an important article in the Drapers' Record an English trade journal-o n Saturday, 12th October. It saysTrue, a dutj' of from 20 to 25 per cent, is to be put upon woollen and silk apparel, and one of 10 to 15 per cent, upon cottons and linens ; but this ought not to enable the Australian manufacturer to keep out the wares of his British competitors. In another part of the same journal the views of Mr Robert Reid, junr., of the I merely well-known firm of Robert Reid and Co., Limited, are thus summarizedIncidentally he remarked that the new rates would disturb manufacturing in Victoria, and upset the working of the Factory Act in that State, under which there was a lot of unnecessary restrictions. He thought for a year, at any rate, the export trade from Britain would be considerably less than it had been. Naturally people would want to know what they wore doing before they shipped largely, and it was a known fact that houses on the other side were carrying very large stocks at the present moment. These are not the words of an interested Australian manufacturer, but of one of the leading warehousemen in England. ThenI quote from the Financial Times, the following extract, having reference to the present Tariff:To take as an example one class, namelythat in which the dry goods trade is interested, the best informed opinion is that this country It is very unwill hold the trade. The local manufacturer will not find himself much assisted by a 10 per cent, duty on cotton materials, with onlj' 20 per cent, I hope that on cotton apparels, while his position is even less favourable 'in the case of silks on which the dutj' is to be 15 per cent., with only25 per cent on apparel, and also on silk woollens, where the duty is 20 per cent., with only 25 per cent on woollen apparels. These are the opinions of English journals and manufacturers regarding the effect of the proposed duty. But I have other evidence here. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to a sample blouse which has been sent out from Germany. I have the German letter accompanying it , which has been translated as follows :This tennis blouse I can supply j'ou at Fl 7.50 or Marks 12.50 per dozen less 30 per cent, for cash, free rail station ""Vienna. Accompanied are strips of various colours which can be supplied, but without guaranteeing the design. Theprice quoted is equivolentto 7s. perdozen. The material of which these blouses is made costs 10s. per dozen in Victoria. I have also received &sample of collars which can be supplied at Is. 3d. per dozen free on board in London, whereas we pay more to the people who make them. I have still another sample which costs 2s. a dozen. I am anxious not to detain the committee, but I warn honourable members that if they reduce the duty upon these articles, they will bring disaster upon one of the best regulated and well paid trades in Victoria.

These workers are all over the continent, and I shall give them the benefit of the doubt in this particular instance. that the position has been made worse, because no matter what the composition of the article may be, the same rate will apply. All I can do is to enter my protest. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). It seems that there will be a margin of 25 per cent, protection in addition to the ordinary natural protection. tection does not come into operation, because the raw material has to be imported, and the charges are almost as much as those on the made-up articles. Mr V. L. SOLOMON -Having the workers in cotton piece goods I do not think there is much necessity to give 25 per cent, protection on the whole of these other goods. How many people are employed in hosiery manufacture 1 MrV . L . SOLOMON -Many of those are employed in making up the material which is imported shaped, duty free in some instances. suburb of Melbourne there are people making hosiery from the raw material on their own machines. MrV . L . SOLOMON -The proposal of the Treasurer puts the poor man's goods under the same rate of duty as those of the well-to-do man, and the scheme is utterly inconsistent with the policy which the Government have hitherto adopted, notably in the case of cigars and the cheaper calico goods. Sir that by putting on a composite duty. MrV . L . SOLOMON -It seems strange that the Government should put the whole of the different lines of apparel, irrespective of their composition, on exactly the same basis, and I should like to see a lower rate of duty, because I consider the protection is too high. dustry depends entirely on imported yarns for the raw material, and I would suggest that the duty on the latter should be reduced. Would that place the industry in a better position ? not taxed before to forget that they form part and parcel of the Commonwealth for which we are now legislating. If there was a 30 per cent, duty in Victoria before, it only means that there was 20 per cent, too much. If we reduce the duty on the raw material, what will be the position with respect to the 25 per cent, duty ? of 25 per cent, on the made-up article, and 15 per cent, duty on the raw material, there is a margin of 10 per cent. It will probably be desired to give a greater measure of protection to the hosiery manufacturers than 10 per cent., and it will be competent to reduce the duty of 15 per cent, on yarn to-10 per cent. On the other relieved hand, it is said that this particular yarn is manufactured to some extent in Ballarat, but we can deal with that when we reach the item.. about 500 operatives, including home workers employed in the Commonwealth in the hosiery manufacturing trade. Owing to improved automatic spinning machinery, the number of operatives employed to produce a given value of yarn is infinitesimal COOK -In almost every in comparison with those employed in knitting the yarn. About £5,000 spent in spinning machinery would probably not employ more than 20 operatives, whereas it would place 500 operatives under a disability. Knowing the conditions under which the operatives, especially women, work in Great Britain, I am going to be a protectionist this time. If we allow the cheap goods to. come in and affect our women in the same way we might as well give up the ghost as legislators.

660,Mr Sydn Ey Smith,"I do not thinkAmendment proposedThat the words'' and on and after 5th December, 1901, 25 per cent."" be added to the duty ""not containing wool or silk, partly or wholly made up . . . ad valorem, 20 per cent."" worth) I do not think that the Treasurer is treating me quite fairly in this matter. I told him that I did not desire the debate to continue on item after item in this division, because I looked upon the duties on cotton and woollen piece goods as the foundation of this series, and thought that once we had settled these duties the others would be fixed in proportion. When we came to cotton goods, we excised the duty of 10 per cent, that it was proposed to place on about one-half of the articles enumerated, and we agreed to fix a 10 per cent, duty on the other half. Now we have all these cotton piece goods subject to what is practically an average duty of 5 per cent. We fixed the duty upon'woollen piece goods at 15 per cent., and I think it has been generally understood that a difference of 10 per cent, would be maintained between the rate imposed upon tlie raw material and that upon the made-up article. Yet in direct opposition to the understanding which has been in vogue, the Government now desire to impose a duty of 25 per cent, upon the cotton finished article. Their action is not in keeping with the proposal which was made when this matter was fought out. I appeal to honourable members not to stultify themselves byvoting for the imposition of a 25 per cent, duty upon the finished article, when the charge upon the raw material is only 5 per cent. I think that the Treasurer has treated me very unfairly in regard to this matter. I intend to move That the words "" and on and after the 5th Decemfactured article, whilst the rate upon the ber, 1901, 15 per cent."" be added to the duty, ""not containing wool or silk, partly or wholly made up (not being piece goods), including articles cut into shape . . . ad valorem, 20 per cent."" objection to the honourable member appealing to the committee as many times as he chooses, but I strongly object to his allegation that I have dealt with him in any way that he is justified in characterising as unfair. Even when he had allowed an item to be passed I asked the Chairman, with the concurrence of the committee, to practically suspend the standing orders, in order that we might do something which we had I the slightest ground for complaint. I am sorry that he embraces every opportunity of charging me with unfairness. I would further point out that I never practically agreed that the difference between the duty upon piece goods and that upon the manufactured article should be 5 per cent. I did the reverse. I stated time after time that there should be at least a 10 per cent, difference. ' I . also told the committee that I intended to ask them to make the rate upon both lines 25 per cent. Whilst the honourable member, therefore, has a right to carry the vote against my proposal if he can do so, he has no right to accuse either myself or my colleagues of having treated him unfairly. I move That tbe words ""and on and after the 5th December, 1901, 25 per cent.,"" be added to the duty, "" not containing wool or silk . . . ad valore 20 per cent."" worth) I fully appreciate what the right honourable gentleman did in rectifying an error which I should have rectified myself under similar circumstances. Surely the Treasurer is strong enough not to desire to take a vote upon any misunderstanding. When the struggle took place in connection with piece goods, there was an understanding arrived at that a certain relative proportion between that class of goods and the made-up article should be maintained. I told him that when once we had established that proportion I did not intend to talk very much over the remainder of the items, because we should then have practically fixed the duty upon the finished article. I repeat that I have not been fairly treated. The original proposal was that a duty of 20 per cent, should be levied upon the manuraw material was fixed at 10 and 15 per cent. Now, however, the Treasurer actually proposes to increase his own Tariff after having reduced the proportion established I have no between the two lines. That is absolutely unfair and unreasonable. the arguments of the acting leader of the Opposition ought to be convincing. When the duties upon cotton piece goods were fixed at 10 and 15 per cent, under the Government proposals, the duty upon the manufactured article was set down at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Now that the duties upon these two great classes of goods",125,Pairs
