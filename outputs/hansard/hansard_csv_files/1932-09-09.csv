In Committee of Supply: Proposed vote, Â£175,000. honourable members must be anxious to pass the Works Estimates, so that the relief which the proposed expenditure will give may be provided as speedily as possible to persons out of work. Unemployment is now so widespread that it constitutes a very grave problem to Australia at the present time. It would be unreasonable to say that it is for the Government to solve that problem. As I have said before, no one government can solve it. It will require the co-operation of all governments, and of private employers as well, even to ameliorate the position. In saying that, I am a good deal more generous to this Government than honourable members opposite were to me and my government when we were in office. They then constantly hurled across the chamber at us the gibe that the volume of unemployment was growing, and had grown enormously since our assumption of office. They quoted the statistician's figures in support of their statements, but they neglected to add what every one knew, that the times were calamitous and the whole economic system seemed to be crashing about our ears. honourable member say when he was in Opposition ? tilings of which I am now complaining, but I shall mention some of the things that were said by the Assistant Minister and his friends during the last election. If ever there was an election fought on the promise to restore a job to every man out of work, it was the last election. doing it. Interior( Mr Parkhill) used to be very ready to quote, as a means of discrediting the last government, the statistician's figures regarding unemployment. that? member was in Opposition, and had less responsibility than he has to-day. If honourable members will study the statistician's figures now, they will realize how far the present Government has fallen short of honouring its promises. The figures to-day show a record percentage of unemployment. During the election it was pointed out by honourable members opposite that 28 per cent, of the members of trade unions were unemployed. That was a very high percentage, aud I do not deny that the position was serious, nor do I deny that the percentage of unemployment increased during my term of office. That, however, was not because of anything done by my Government, but in spite of what we did. Honourable members opposite charged us with raising the tariff, and with thus contributing to unemployment, but most thinking persons are now beginning to understand that, had we not increased the tariff, unemployment would have been very much worse in our time than it was. The party opposite covered the hoardings of the country with repetitions of the statement that, if it were returned to power, jobs would be found for everybody. At the present time the Government professes to be most anxious to keep men in work, and to find jobs for those who are unemployed. A certain amount of money is being provided for new works, but this is only a drop in the bucket compared with what is needed. As the Prime Minister stated in his budget speech, we must look to private industry for the greater part of the relief needed to solve the unemployment problem. The Government professes to be hastening on with new works to relieve unemployment, but, at the same time, it is destroying the country's power to absorb unemployed",13,Special Adjournment

66,Mr Scullin,"When the honorableworkers by reducing the protective duties under which industry has been operating. I draw the attention of honourable members to the appeal published in the press this morning by the Prime Minister. Already notices of dismissal have been issued to hundreds of employees in factories throughout Australia because of the reduction of duties, and the Prime Minister has appealed to the manufacturers to stay their hand. The suggestion is that the Government has not definitely made up its mind, and that an appeal to the Tariff Board by the manufacturers might, still be successful. there in the manufacturers' attitude? member were one of those threatened with dismissal he would realize that the situation was serious enough. The Prime Minister asks the manufacturers not to dismiss their employees, stating that the reduced duties will not operate until after they have been agreed to by Parliament. In the meantime, if they feel aggrieved, they can approach the Tariff Board again. These ditties have been considered by the Tariff Board, and have been reconsidered by the Government, and the Government now proposes to reduce them to the 1928 level. This is what the Prime Minister stated in his appealAlthough a resolution has heeti tabled in the House of Representatives under which it is announced that Parliament is to be invited to reduce duties in certain cases, these reductions of the tariff do not become operative until such time as the tariff has passed both Houses of Parliament. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) made a similar statement yesterday, saying that that was an effective answer to the manufacturers who had threatened to dismiss employees. As I understand the position, every one of the new duties which have been tabled except those which reduced the Scullin tariff below the 1928 level, operated the moment they were introduced. If that is so, this House has been seriously misled by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. right honourable member must realize that, even though the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General may have misled the House in regard to tariff items, this is not the proper time to discuss the matter. The Estimates for new works and buildings are before the committee. pursue that subject at length; but I claim that I am entitled to draw attention to the Prime Minister's appeal to employers of labour to give work, and not to dismiss men because of any reduction of the tariff. Are employers to take his statement as a declaration that the Government will back down or, at least, stay its hand ? If not, will the employers be justified in continuing to make goods 'which will be of less value when the flood gates are opened to the products of cheaplabour countries? More unemployment has been created during the last few months by the Government's policy than will be compensated for by the employment which these new works will give. I want these works to be proceeded with in addition to other works. I drawi the atteution of the committee to the annual report of the Chief Inspector of Eactories for Victoria in which he shows that, despite the depression and the shortage of money for industry, 221 new factories employing an additional 5,700 workers were established in Victoria in 1931 as a direct result of the increased' duties. His statement that in Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Warrnambool, Castlemaine, and other places, woollen mills and textile factories were busy, particularly in the latter part of the year, shows that only when the .local stocks of imported goods became low did the Australian manufacturers begin to gain substantial advantage from the tariff of the Scullin Government. Since the present Government assumed office, many hundreds of employees engaged in the manufacture of matches, glass, and iron and steel have been thrown out of work. Yet the Government says that its policy is to help the unemployed to find work. the right honourable member to proceed further along those lines. General should let this committee know the facts. I ask him to say specifically whether these reduced duties are actually in operation. My opinion is that, with tlie exception of those duties which are lower than the 1928 tariff, the reduced rates are already in operation, and that'",14,Department Of The Interior

I support those works estimates, but I repeat that they provide only a small measure of relief compared with that which would have been given had the Government not tampered with the tariff, thereby making it impossible for our industries to retain the workers employed in them. General) [11.17] -The total of the estimates for additions, new works, buildings, &c, is Â£963,000, of which Â£231,500 is for departments and services other than business undertakings and territories Â£655,000 is for business undertakings, ancl Â£76,500 for territories of the Commonwealth; The actual expenditure under those heads last year was Â£832,622. The new Estimates, therefore, provide for an increase of .Â£130,378. Estimates for the year 1932-33 will lie taken in detail, and should honourable members desire further information concerning the various items, the Minister concerned will be glad to supply it. The right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) referred to the difficult subject of unemployment, and the relation'of governments to unemployment. I think that he will do me the justice of admitting that, in both the last Parliament and this Parliament, I have consistently contended that no government, of itself, can handle the Unemployment problem satisfactorily. So far as there is an answer to that problem, it will be found in a sound general policy rather than in relief provisions. protect Australian industries. ticularly, a sound Â«policy in relation to finance, tariffs and industrial conditions, will, if properly administered, give our citizens a better chance to obtain employment than is possible otherwise. from what the honourable gentleman said in 1928. thing throughout. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Later, when the action already announced Scullin) said that the reduced duties now actually in operation, and the further reductions, contemplated by the Government, had led to manufacturers throwing large numbers of men out of work. As to the facts, I direct the attention'of honourable members to the statement of the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins) yesterday. The Minister explained that, in cases in which the result of the proposed reductions would be to bring the duties down to, or below, the rates which operated in 1928, the reductions operated immediately, but not below the 1928 level. Prime Minister says in this statement; nor is it what the Attorney-General himself said yesterday. curately set out yesterday by the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs. duties had been reduced, and some had The not; he'gave no accurate information. ter for Trade and Customs drew a distinction between those reductions which brought the duty down to or below the 1928 tariff and those which did not. That, at any rate, is the position. As to the dismissals and threatened dismissals mentioned by the right honourable gentleman, the only case of which I have knowledge is that of a company which is engaged in the manufacture of glass. Honourable members were given the facts in relation to that company yesterday. . statements, which were alleged to be facts. now. Eor some time the Customs Department had been conducting regular weekly investigations into the industry concerned, at its factory. About ten days before the tariff schedule was introduced a customs officer, in the course of his investigations at the factory, was informed that the management proposed to close down the works at an early date for five or six weeks for the purpose of reconditioning, or altering in some way, a tank used in the manufacture of clear sheet glass. That information was reI have said the same peated the day before the tariff schedule was introduced into this Parliament. by the company was taken, certain newspapers attributed it to the Government's policy in relation to the tariff.

Should it be found that the effect of an alteration of duty is gravely to reduce employment in an industry which is suited to Australia, the Government, realizing that the employment of our citizens is of fundamental importance in our social economy, will certainly reconsider it. The Government desires to act in the best interests of the community as a whole; it will consider uot only the effect of a duty upon a particular set of men but also upon employment generally. So far as the particular proposals made are concerned, the right honourable gentleman is really going a -little too far when he suggests that the Government has been engaged in an indiscriminate slaughter. There is not .tlie slightest justification for .such under the River Murray Waters Act and a charge, particularly when we reflect that some of tlie duties which have been reduced were the highest iu the world, and that in no case has a duty been reduced other than ou the recommendation of the Tariff Board after a more exhaustive inquiry than auy honourable member in this chamber -could possibly make. The duties recommended are regarded by the Tariff Board as sufficiently high to protect the Australian industries concerned, on the basis of Australian conditions. In all these matters the Government will be guided by the facts of the case, as ascertained by the best authority available for the purpose. It will undoubtedly consider the effect on employment of any reduction of duty both in the industry particularly affected and in relation to the community generally. I am not sure whether in saying these things I have been strictly in order. In any case there will be another opportunity to deal with the tariff. the honourable gentleman has gone a little further than is strictly permissible under the Standing OrdersI wish to refer to the item relating to but I wanted to set out clearly the attitude of the Government on this important matter. may be that the .Government's desire Dismissals, or threats of to provide money for the relief of unemployment is the reason why these estimates provide for an increase of Â£130,378 on last year's expenditure. If the latitude which has been given to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) and the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) is to be extended to all honourable members, I desire to draw attention to the Tariff Board's report, which completely refutes the views expressed by the former. The board states that high tariffs create unemployment, and that every increase in the rates of duty has been accompanied by an increase in unemployment. The present Government came into office pledged to do its best to reduce unemployment in this country, and to that end it applied its mind to the tariff. the Ohair is the Department of the Interior, included in which is expenditure the War Service Homes Act. SinceI allowed considerable latitude to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) I felt that the Attoruey-General( Mr Latham), in replying, was entitled to similar treatment, but honourable members generally, will realize that the Chair cannot allow a general discussion, on the tariff under this item. I , therefore, ask them in future to confine their remarks to the item -for the time being before the Chair. Mr Chairman, but this morningwhether rightly or wrongly-ther e has been recorded in Hansard for the information of the public of Australia, a statement by one honourable member who represents an important electorate, yet another honourable member who represents an electorate just as important is debarred from commenting upon it. If the statement of the Leader of the Opposition is important, I contend that its refutation is more important to the community generally. I was afraid of that; the River Murray Waters Commission.

89,Mr Gibson (Corangamite) [11.31].,"previous Government. It seems to me that the river Murray scheme is one of the greatest sinks for public money that we have ever had in Australia. It is surpassed only by Canberra. About Â£10,000,000 has, up to the present, been expended on the river Murray works. There is no use for the water that is being stored in the Hume reservoir. There are 500,000 acre feet of water impounded at Lake Victoria in South Australia. In the river Murray, which is locked to its mouth, is impounded an immense quantity of water. The total area of irrigated land in South Australia is 30,000 acres. In New South Wales, there are stored millions of acre feet of water, and the total area of irrigated land is 90,000 acres. Neither of those States wants additional water at the moment. Victoria is practically in the same position. The Hume reservoir may be necessary in 50 years' time, hut it is not necessary to-day. able member. ber cannot show one instance in which the water in the Hume reservoir has been used for irrigation purposes. The only benefit from, the Hume reservoir will be obtained by those persons who have land which will, iu future, be irrigated from that source. The cost of construction has been out of all proportion to the value to be derived ' from it. Five complete plants costing about Â£100,000 each have been erected for the building of the locks and weirs in the river Murray. Those plants belong to the State Governments, which have the right to write off the cost of them in the construction works. Naturally, the cost of the plants is being written off to the extent of about Â£30,000 or Â£40,000 for each lock and weir. By the time that the whole of the locks are completed, the State Governments will have unloaded a charge of Â£500,000 on to the Commonwealth Government, which is the fourth partner in the building of the whole of the locks and weirs. A certain amount of revenue is derived each year from shipping on the river Murray-about Â£10,000-bu t the Commonwealth Government is not entitled to any share of it . Yet it has to stand for all time the cost of maintenance on the whole of the weirs and locks. This is a national work, and the people of Australia are finding the whole of the money that is being expended upon it. I can quite understand the representatives . of South Australia and Western Australia protesting against the expenditure of Â£10,000,000 on this scheme. Â£14,000,000. share in the eost of construction and maintenance for all time, and yet obtain no result from the scheme. The people of Victoria and New South Wales are helping to pay for these works, although the owners of the land which will be irrigated by the scheme contribute nothing to the cost, excepting by way of ordinary taxation. The Government is going a step too far in finding this money at the I disagree with the honorpresent time. It should hold its hand and simply make provision for safeguarding the work already completed. money is necessary for that purpose. has been submerged as a result of the construction of this scheme. The work has been of no use up to the present, and it is 50 years before its time. I do not agree with the previous speaker that it is unwise for the Government to spend this money on the river Murray works. My regret is that in time of prosperity the governments of Australia expended on public works large sums of loan money which would have been better expended in giving relief to the unemployed at a period of depression such as that through which we are passing to-day. The governments of Australia, instead of withholding the construction of necessary public works until a return of prosperity, should put them in hand immediately, so as to give some relief to hundreds and thousands of our * workers who cannot to-day be absorbed in industry. Our secondary industries, if allowed to develop along proper lines, could employ many of these men. Some honourable members will say, "" Put them on the land"".

It said that if returned to power unemployment would soon be at an end. This morning the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) quoted figures showing that unemployment had increased since the advent of this Government, and had now reached record figures. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), speaking at. Launceston before the elections, said that with the return of the United Australia Party to power, things in Australia would begin to improve, that there would be no necessity for further cuts in the wages and salaries of public servants or pensions, and that there would be immediate relief for the unemployed. Unfortunately, when this Government was returned to power no action was taken to give effect to its promises. Many new works could be put in hand by the Government to give relief to both skilled and unskilled workmen. The work of painting the post office buildings throughout Australia could be proceeded with. Other works that are being held up could be put in hand. We were told that with the restoration of confidence money would flow and that, plenty of credit would be available to enable these works to be undertaken; but the position is that the Government is adopting the policy of inaction which was instituted by the previous Nationalist Government. which appeared in this morning's Canberra Times, is a gross misrepresentation :Regret was yesterday expressed by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) that one or two firms, apparently affected by the decision of the able member to confine his remarks to Government to reduce tariff rates, were disthe item under discussion. missing employees. member must confine his remarks to the been permitted to make a statement and department under discussion. the Prime Minister has misled the people appreciate the difficulty which confronts of Australia by stating that the reductions the Chair.

The Minister for the Interior( Mr Parkhill), when a private member, had a lot to say on the subject of unemployment. Now that he is MinisterI ask him to deliver the goods. Unfortunately for the community generally, he is taking a leading part in strangling Australian industry and throwing additional people out of work. Much comment has been made about unemployment. Last year the expenditure on public works was Â£832,000; this year the proposed expenditure is Â£963,000. Therefore, the Government is providing more money this year for employment on public works. This scare of unemployment has been raised time after time.

Wheni t was suggested that the river Murray should be locked, I strongly supported the proposal, believing that it would afford an opportunity to open up huge areas of productive country.

The first estimate of the probable cost was Â£4,600,000.

116,. Mr Archdale Parkhill,"Th egest to the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) that he is rather late in expressing such definitely hostile views in relation to the expenditure that has been incurred. I think that I am entitled to remind him that for many years he was a member of an administration which spent large amounts on these works. If he held the view that that expenditure was not warranted, he ought to have been able to use some influence in the direction of having it reduced. I differ from any honourable member who says that the scheme is not going to be of national importance. It is the greatest scheme of its land that has ever been attempted in Australia. years hence. shall not have to wait so long as that. We are certainly looking ahead, and are providing an additional quantity of water for some of the best land in the world. The result will be to bring substantial wealth to this country. The honourable member for Corangamite pointed out that each State had installed a separate plant, and alleged that one plant would have done the work equally as well. That is true. Efforts were made to repair such extravagance, but the internecine jealousies of the different States concerned prevented that from being accomplished. An act to relieve the situation by providing for the operation of only one plant was passed by this Parliament and a couple Â©f the State Parliaments, but I understand that it was defeated in the Legislative Council of New South Wales. Therefore, this Parliament cannot be blamed for what has happened in that direction. The contracting parties are shouldering their proportion of the depreciation, which has been spread over the whole of the construction, and covers a certain period of years. I urge the committee to realize, first, the immense national conception of the work; secondly, its undoubted value to Australia in the comparatively xear as well as the distant future; thirdly, the expenditure that already has been incurred; and, foiu'thly, the urgent and clamant necessity for providing at least sufficient to make; reproductive and valuable what has so far been done. That is the aim of the Government. I am pleased that the Minister has given an explanation of this item. In my opinion, however, he has not answered the very strong indictment of the scheme of the honourable member for Corangamite Mr Gibson). I recognize, of course, that eventually the work' must be completed. At the same time, however, I believe that, on account of the small amount of money at the disposal of the Government, and that is likely to be available to other governments that probably will succeed it for a period of years, the operations should be suspended for a time. If the object of the Government is to provide employment, the proposed expenditure should be allocated to works that will be more productive and of greater utility to the people in the immediate future. If the present Government has Â£142,000 at its disposal, I suggest that that amount should be made available for the construction of sewerage works in some of the main cities in various States. It is a disgrace to Australia that some of its important cities are unsewered, or have incomplete systems, while in the United States of America towns of half the size are thoroughly equipped in that' respect. It has been suggested that more good land will be covered up by the Hume dam than is likely to be irrigated. rect, if we take the position as we now find it. ber assents to that proposition, and he is usually conservative in his remarks. along the river. who are said to be in need of the benefits of this irrigation scheme have been on the bread line, because of inability to dispose of their output.

One of our problems to-day is undoubtedly due to tbe -complete collapse of tbe railway systems. .Lines have been laid chiefly through undeveloped country. These show a great loss, and that is very largely responsible for our financial problem. That we have proceeded on wrong lines is proved by the fact that, after all these years, we are practically in a condition of national hankraptcy. The Murray waters scheme represents the first constructive effort by a government of Australia to develop a national water -conscience, and to make use of rivers which have been hitherto shamefully neglected. It is said that the undertaking .has developed into a much larger work than was originally anticipated.

One of the driest provinces in India was recently converted into one of the most productive tracts of country in the world, and that magical ehange was brought about by a water scheme. The British spirit did not fail because the job was big and costly. It is time that honourable members discussed the future of the Murray water scheme thoroughly, with the object of ascertaining whether the Â£8,000,000already spent has been wisely used and, what is more important, whether the Â£S,000,000 still required to complete the project may be expended with a reasonable prospect of ultimate and complete success. with the water impounded? has been thoroughly investigated long disaster-eve n greater in its magnitude before this.

As to the use of the water, ciates the gravity of the issues that I the theory is, of course, that if we provide the water, the population will follow it just as it was argued years ago, that if railways were provided in undeveloped country, the people would go there. Unfortunately, we have built too many railways. We must remember, in thinking about all these projects, that we are building, not only for to-day, but for to-morrow. We have been too restricted in our outlook. Many people imagine that if a work will not yield a return immediately, it should not be put in hand. But we are building Australia for the future, as well as for the present. I read in the press the other day, that the progress of the Murray waters works has been so slow that there has been practically no return from the capital already expended.

I take it that the honourable there are good prospects of making a success of the scheme, we should borrow, as soon as possible, the amount of money necessary to complete it. The money could be expended, not only to provide employment, but even more importantly to complete a valuable developmental project for the benefit of Australia. -The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), in discussing the Murray river water scheme, and the the necessityfor developing what he called a water conscience, gave me the impression that he thought Egypt was more developed than Australia from an irrigation stand-point. Egypt did not go half way with big undertakings of this kind, but finished the works that were put in hand. misinterpreted the honourable member's statement. I certainly gathered that he thought that Australia was backward in regard to water conservation schemes. As a matter of fact, Victoria has a greater mileage of water channels for both irrigation and domestic purposes than, posiaibly,. any other territory of its area in the world. She is certainly in a leading position in. that respect. Seriously conflicting opinions have been expressed this morning regarding the desirableness of spending more money on the Murray water scheme. In the circumstances I suggest that the Minister should agree to the postponement of the further consideration of this proposed vote until he is able to place before us detailed information on the whole subject. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), who was for some time Minister in charge of the Murray water scheme, has expressed the opinion that we are trying to conserve more water than we can possibly use in the immediate future, and that, therefore, the expenditure of additional money on the work is not justifiable at present. The honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , activities in the matter of additions and who was also the Minister in charge of these works for a considerable time, We should be informed, remarked by interjection while the honourable member for New England was speaking, that we had the water in the tank, but no taps through which it could member meant that there were no channels through which the additional water could be run from the reservoir to the land for which it was intended, which is some distance from the reservoir. The present Minister has told us that it is considered necessary to spend the amount provided on the Estimates in order to safeguard the money that has already been spent. The views of these three honourable gentlemen are therefore seriously diverse, and as each of them is in a position to express an authoritative opinion, it will be apparent that there is justification for my suggestion that further consideration of the subject be postponed until fuller and more detailed information has been submitted to us.,. I , therefore, appeal to the Minister to adopt the course which I have suggested. I desire some information regarding the expenditure of certain sums proposed to be provided for war service homes purposes. The vote uuder this heading for 1931-32 was Â£42,000. The Minister will remember that a week or two ago I introduced to him a deputation on this matter consisting of the secretary of the Bricklayers Union. Of the Â£42,000 voted in 1931-32, Â£24,000 was expended, leaving a balance of roughly Â£18,000. The vote for 1932-33 is Â£33,000, and I should like to know what work is likely to be carried out with this amount, and how far it will meet the requests that have been made from time to time. The members of the organizations associated with the building trade have experienced a very lean period during the last two years. As a matter of fact their circumstances are of such a character that it will probably take them a considerable time to recover; but that is an aspect of the matter which need not be discussed at this juncture.

The representatives of the building trade organizations asked me to .approach the Minister to see what could be done for them. He was good enough to receive the representatives of the bricklayers' union, but he said he could not .announce just how far the Government was prepared to make employment available in the direction suggested ; but that he would do all he could to secure the largestamount possible, and that when a grant was available, it would be distributed among the districts most needing it. I should like the Minister to say if the Â£33,000 now provided is in addition to the Â£17,000 or Â£18,000 left unexpended from the previous year. If that is not so, is it uot possible to utilize larly in country areas. A short-range that Â£.18,000 as well as the proposed vote? Perhaps the Minister can say how many requests have been received and to what -extent they can be met by the money available. The amount provided for a continuation of .the river Murray water scheme has been freely discussed this morning. AlthoughI represent a city electorate I join wholeheartedly with those who have .advocated the expenditure of public money for irrigation purposes and works of that, kind. In these days, when there is such a lot of talk about settling our surplus city population on the land, everything possible should be done to encourage rural development by providing for water supplies for irrigation and other purposes in districts where it can be profitably utilized to increase production. AlthoughI represent an industrial constituency, the early part of my life was spent on irrigable land. I realize the importance of water conservation and irrigation schemes, particularly when such schemes assist in making the land productive. I am unable to understand the attitude of the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr the scheme. I merely asked for full Gibson), who as the ministerial head of the department controlling this scheme once took a pride in its development up to the stage it had then reached. I hardly think it fitting that he should now suggest that any extension should be curtailed, particularly when the objects in view are the effective development of the land and the providing of employment. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.35] -As a city member, I join with the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) in his contention that the provision of water schemes has a direct bearing upon increased production and employment. We should not adopt a short-range policy such as that suggested by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson). should meet the requirements of the country as they arise. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Wate r conservation should be seriously considered by the National Parliament, and I shall support any proposal submitted to provide more adequate water supplies, particuwater conservation policy, such as some suggest, is detrimental, not. only to rural areas, but also to the capital cities. It was recently stated that if the City of Sydney experienced an exceedingly dry spell, its water supply might be in danger. In the absence of adequate conservation schemes, the capital cities of Australia, as well as outback centres, may be endangered. While the present depression is upon us, works of a reproductive nature should be seriously taken in hand. What more effective way could be suggested for spending money than the construction of reproductive water schemes? The construction of immense dams would provide employment, and at the same time remove the danger of a water famine. Moreover, an ample supply of water increases development and production. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) express some doubt as to the wisdom of the course which is being followed. information on the subject. Mr E. J. HARRISON I was also surprised to hear the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) express the views he did, because this scheme, when completed, will be of unquestionable benefit to primary producers.

Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, the utility of the Murray River waters scheme has been discussed when provision has been made in the Estimates for the expenditure of thousands of pounds to conrplete a portion of the work, which, it was said, was urgently needed. In the first instance, we were told that this scheme would not cost more than Â£3,000,000 or Â£4,000,000; but I think the iatest estimate for the whole work is Â£14,000,000. have seen give the amount as Â£14,000,000. Although the original estimate was Â£4,000,000, the estimated total cost is now approximately Â£16,000,000. This shows what vast sums of money have been expended, and that reliable information has not been given to Parliament and to the people. The estimates of so-called experts have beeu grossly exceeded. Every now and then additional sums are required to secure, it is said, an existing asset. Similar statements were made in connection with a certain work in Victoria, where a wharf was to be built on dry land, and money would have had to be spent to bring water to it so that ships could utilize the structure. Reproductive water conservation schemes are an urgent necessity, but I think honourable members will agrr>e that Â£14,000,000 or Â£16,000,000 would have dam practically the whole of the rivers in the western districts of Queensland and New South Wales, thereby adding to the productive capacity of the country. Before works of such an expensive character are embarked upon, a thorough investigation should be conducted by some competent authority into their cost and utility. The Bruce-Page Government appointed a Development and Migration Commission to fully inquire into such developmental undertakings and supply the Government with all the information that was required. Some time ago a similar water scheme was advocated in the northern part of Queensland, which it was estimated would Sitting suspended from 12.1,5 to 2.15 p.m. cost approximately Â£3,600,000. The government of the day appointed a commission, which cost a few thousand pounds. It reported that the expenditure was not justified, as the land could be put to a better purpose, and the Queensland Government was saved a very large expenditure. If that work had been undertaken it is only reasonable to assume that the estimated cost would; have been greatly exceeded. There should be a full inquiry by unbiased' experts before works of this nature are undertaken. Downs) [12.43] -As one who. was associated with the Murray waters scheme at its inception, I feel that there is a good deal of misunderstanding concerning the whole 'undertaking. Eor instance, it has been suggested that this scheme was launched without proper consideration having been given to it ; but such suggestions show utter lack of knowledge of what actually occurred. For some time prior to the present scheme being adopted there was considerable controversy between South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales over the Murray waters question. It was felt that the best use was not being made of the greatest of our Australian rivers, and in order to obtain independent and reliable information the services of an expert from the United States of America were obtained to determine the best way to utilize the waters of what has been termed the Nile of Australia. South Australia insisted upon its navigation rights, and New been found' sufficient to South Wales and Victoria wished to preserve sufficient water for irrigation purposes. Ultimately the interested parties were brought together by the Commonwealth agreeing to make available Â£1,000,000, and the present scheme evolved. Reference has been made to the extent by which the original estimate of the scheme which was prepared by an American engineer has been exceeded. At the time the estimate was prepared it was impossible to foresee how costs would increase. It was realized, however, that the scheme would be of tremendous value to Australia, and provide an insurance against drought.",25,Department Of The Interior

151,Sir Littleton Groom (Darling,"Sir estimated cost of the complete Murray River waters scheme, as first contemplated, was given at Â£4,663,000 in the Murray River agreement dated the 9th September, 1914. Of this amount the Commonwealth was to provide Â£1,000,000 and the States of New South ""Wales, Victoria and South Australia Â£1,221,000 each. ""With costs as they were at that time, the scheme presented to Australia one of the most promising that could be embarked upon and a consideration of drought periods established the wisdom of its acceptance. It was, however, only the advent of the Commonwealth with its proposal to provide Â£1,000,000 which brought the three States together after they had been fightcourse. But it is highly desirable that ing over the question for nearly half a century. After the war, construction work was resumed and I was president of the commission for three years from March, 1918. ""We were really then just commencing operations and had the task of adjusting equities of the administration between the different States. The scheme provided for the appointment of a commission consisting of an expert engineer from each of the contracting States with a Commonwealth expert and presided over by the Commonwealth Minister of ""Works. A very capable secretary was appointed. No engineers could have had greater experience in such matters than the four who were selected. They were faced with a difficult problem, the construction of reservoirs, locks and weirs in a country with special features of its own. They did not have huge rock formations to aid them. They bad to provide weirs across rivers running through vast alluvial beds into which deep foundations had to be sunk. But I do not desire to go into further detail. After the war, costs increased aud conditions changed in several aspects. Eor instance, the navigation aspect originally emphasized by South Australia has been somewhat modified, State railways having been built up to the Murray valley enabling the carriage of produce previously carried by river steamers to be undertaken by the railways. Present conditions have to be grass land. scheme. In ray opinion, the governments concerned were quite right to build the Hume reservoir without delay. We have not, as other countries have, huge mountains covered with snow providing for our rivers a steady flow of water all the year round. We have to build artificial reservoirs to maintain a flow of water when required for irrigation. The Hume reservoir is essential for that purpose. The complete construction of the scheme, of course, must depend on the financial condition of the country. requirements. SIR LITTLET ON GROOM -Of the irrigation areas should be brought into a state of production at the earliest possible moment so that a return for the money already spent upon these works may be obtained. That is a matter for sound administration, and I am sure that it is in the minds of the Minister and the commission. Settlement should certainly be extended. This scheme will provide a water supply for a large area in all seasons, and will be a great insurance against drought. One of Queensland's problems to-day is to conserve fodder to meet its periodic droughts. Unfortunately, Queensland has not a great river like the Murray to provide it with irrigated areas on which fodder crops can be grown, but there are possibilities for irrigation in that State. The Murray River scheme will prove a guide to the States generally. Irrigation has\ not been carried on extensively in Australia. In 1929-30, the latest returns available, the irrigated areas of the Commonwealth were as follow:Acres New South Wales .. 126,321.

The less we think as States, and the more we keep national ideals before us the better for all concerned. Party divisions should not cur across national ideals. representative of a constituency bordering on the Murray River, and as one who is deeply interested in irrigation and knows something about it, I rise to express my disagreement with the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr tance through Victoria, with branches Gibson). The honourable member suggests that the amount provided on the Estimates this year for the Murray River works should not be spent, and that the works are very much ahead of the times.' The scheme ""provided originally for 26 weirs ancl locks on the Murray River, 1 and nine on the Murrumbidgee River, together with the Lake Victoria storage, and the Hume Dam. at a total cost of Â£4,663,000. The reservoir was to be situated a little above the junction of the Murray River and the Mitta River, and was to have a holding capacity of 1,000,000 acre feet. Some years later, it was considered advisable to construct the dam below the junction of these two rivers and to increase its capacity to 2,000,000 acre feet, which would have made the reservoir the second largest in the world. its present capacity of 1,250,000 acre feet to supply the immediate requirements of Victoria, South 'Australia, and New South Wales, but unfortunately, Victoria has not taken advantage of the water impounded. I was not able to ascertain Total during the lunch adjournment whether a .. 170,796 at the Hume dam. I am of opinion that . . 426,171 the only outlet to-day, other than the by. . 128,296 wash, is through the huge needle valves that discharge into the river. There is .. 45,555 not a single place on the river where .. 770,818 water can be diverted by gravitation, other than Torrumbarry. It is suggested thatwater should be ""diverted at Yarrawonga, over SO miles below the Hume dam. When I was Minister for Works, it was suggested that an outlet should be provided at the Hume dam, in order to divert the water at the highest possible level. If that outlet has been made, it is the duty of Victoria and New South Wales to provide water channels. No better reproductive work could be .undertaken, assuming that the outlet has been provided, than to construct those channels. They would enable the whole of the area between the dam and Echuca to be irrigated. It was suggested at one time, that the main take-off should be at the dam itself, that a main channel should be run for some disoff it, and that an aqueduct should be run across the river at a high level to keep water always >above the surface level in New South Wales. Apparently that is not going to be done, with the result that a diversion weir is being put in at Yarrawonga. If there is one thing more than another which will provide employment on reproductive work, it is the construction of channels in these areas. I know that something like 500,000 acres of good irrigable country has been surveyed in New South Wales and Victoria on both sides of the river Murray between Albury and Echuca. It is useless to say that that water cannot be used to advantage. At times, there is a slump in dried and soft fruits, but we have to view the matter nationally. Generally speaking, large areas of cultivable land are necessary, particularly during dry years, and times It is large enough with like the present when wheat is sold at such a low price.

I am confident that there is room in the Murray valley for more people than there are at present in Victoria, provided that water is made available and that reasonable prices obtain for our products. get those prices? to-day for practically everything that our farmers can produce, provided that some of their many burdens are removed. If the Japanese were in possession of that area, with its water storage of 2,000,000 acre feet, the Murray valley would be populated by 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 people, all living like fighting cocks. I do not want our people to live under the conditions favoured by the Japanese, but I point out that we have close to hand delightful surroundings, suitable land, and plenty of sunshine and water; everything that is necessary for the man on the land. Yet we are doing nothing with all that splendid irrigable country. It is like possessing a tank filled with water, and not having a tap to the tank. The original estimate for the river Murray 1,000,000 acre feet dam and locks and weirs was Â£4,633,000, while the cost to date is Â£8,837,000, almost twice what was expected. I believe that before the work is finished, including locks and weirs on the Murrumbidgee, it will run into Â£14,000,000 or Â£16,000,000. We cannot do better than go in for water conservation. Certainly, I represent a constituency bordering on the river Murray, but I venture the opinion that had our rainfall for the past couple of years not been above normal, the farmers in my constituency would have been prepared to shoot the Government if it had not consented to go on with these works. It is all very well, while we constructed by the Victorian authority at have an abundance of rain, to say that irrigation is unnecessary. But immediately we encounter dry years, everybody wants to know why the government did not put in the channels. I have tried my utmost to persuade the State Government to proceed with the channelling, but if the outlet is not also provided, the outlet at the Hume dam. If that is to whole effort will be wasted, so far as tbe land immediately below the weir is concerned. I have no hesitation in saying that much of the work has cost a good deal more than it should. Each weir and lock constructed by South Australia cost approximately Â£100,000 less than those carried out by Victoria and New South Wales. New South Wales constructed a weir and lock at Wentworth which I had the pleasure of inspecting some time after I became chairman of the River Murray Commission. I was surprised to find a substantial brick house, an attractive garden laid out with beautiful lawns, rose and citrus trees. The adjoining buildings were all beautifully painted, and there were roads about the place-bu t nothing had been done in connection with the weir although those people had been there for about eighteen months. Eventually the weir was finished and, speaking from memory, it cost well over Â£100,000 more than identical weirs and locks immediately below it, constructed by Victoria and New South Wales. Again, the weir and lock at Torrumbarry, the only one at present taking out water by gravity, cost in the vicinity of Â£350,000, or Â£100,000 more than those constructed by the South Australian Government. have been different. favoured Victoria and New South Wales, for in South Australia the river is very much wider. The explanation is that South Australia had a standardized plant. It was American, but it worked well. A ll the parts were interchangeable, and, as two or three plants' were working simultaneously, the South Australian Government was able to do the work much more economically than it could be done in New South Wales or Victoria. The weir Mildura cost something in the vicinity of Â£369,000, again well over Â£100,000 more than the South Australian average. I entirely support the Government in this matter. I believe that the money will be well spent, but I do hope that something is being done to provide an be done, it is up to the River Murray",28,Littleton Groom Th E Taken Into Account In Dealing With This

The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), stated that there were 30,000 acres of irrigated land in South Australia, excluding grass.

I contend that we want all the water conservation that we can afford. I shall vote for this amount without any qualms of conscience. I am surprised that any honourable member should challenge a vote for the conservation of water. Had we spent more money in that direction instead of building the Federal Capital, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Brisbane Town Hall, and the Adelaide. Railway Station, Australia would be in a much better position to-day. glad that honourable members have made up their minds to vote for this item. My only regret is that the amount is not three times as great, so that more employment could be given through these agencies. I agree that we have no greater insurance than that of water conservation. The governments that were responsible for the construction of the Burrinjuck Darn, the Hume weir, and the ""Wyangaia dam beyond Cowra will have the thanks of posterity. The people of the present day will not reap the full benefit of these national works, which will, in later years, obviate moving the expenditure was attaining, and two stock from otherwise dry areas. If we foster the idea of water conservation, and ment branch and by the Governments add to the storage already available, we shall do something to justify our existence in this Parliament. I approve of the proposal of the Government. When I referred to this matter I did not think I would create such a stir. I have been accused by several members of being opposed to the conservation of water for irrigation purposes. I am not. WhatI endeavoured to point out was the extravagant waste of money under this scheme. I should like to see the Government keep a storage of water to meet the demands, and as development proceeds, construct the weir to a higher level. At present there is about 250,000 acre feet in the Hume reservoir. If there is a demand for 500,000 acre feet, by all means build to a higher millions of money to provide 2,000,000 acre feet of water when it cannot be used ? I propose to direct attention to the serious waste of money that has been incurred in connection with this huge scheme. At present I shall merely add that no honourable, member is more anxious to see the development of irrigation in Australia than I am. ringah-Minister for the Interior) [2.44] -There are two points on which I should perhaps have given some information at an earlier stage. I am constrained to bring them before honourable members, particularly in view of the remarks by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson). The money which he declares is being wasted is iu respect of a storage of 2,000,000 acre feet of water. The proposed expenditure is for a storage of 1,250,000 acre feet, a much more economic scheme than if the storage were 2,000,000 acre feet. If the latter were the case the honourable member would have some real grounds for his contention, as that quantity of water could not possibly be used for many years, except at great expense. The alterations to this scheme have not been adopted without the most complete preliminary investigation.

The best advice available to the Government is that the work now being proposed is the quickest means of deriving a real benefit from tlie scheme. The total area of land to be submerged under the 1,250,000 acre feet proposal w ill be 30,000 acres, whilst tlie land irrigated already is approximately 175,000 acres. In New South Wales alone, at least 250,000 acres w ill be irrigated, and probably that could be increased to 5,000,000 acres by gravitation if the water were available. In Victoria, the increase would be almost equally as great, whilst considerable expansion is possible in South Australia. Those figures show the mammoth character of the scheme that has been undertaken by this Parliament. Works of this nature will make for the greatness of Australia: The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrA . Green) spoke of employment. works do provide employment, and the people in country districts are as much entitled to have work as are those who would be employed on the sewerage schemes which the honourable member says should be substituted. He asked why when there is already a glut of commodities. That contention, carried to its logical conclusion, would lead to the stoppage of all production. The present glut w ill not continue for all time. W it h the facilities th.at are being provided this country will produce huge quantities of commodities that w ill be sold overseas, even where there is no market for them to-day. Every scheme of any magnitude has been attacked by Jeremiahs and small-minded objectors. Some undertakings which were most bitterly attacked have been remarkably successful, and are already proving in adequate. I repeat that the works in connection with the Hume reservoir are based on expert advice, and are designed to safeguard the money already expended and yield immediate benefits. though the Minister for the Interior( Mr Parkhill) glut of production, it is an unfortunate-fact that our people are not able to get enough of the foods and other commodities produced in their own country. The honourable gentleman castigated somehonorable members for not having vision,, and said that in the past there had been men who had taken the courageous view that Australia must advance, and had by their f a it h achieved great things. I agreewith him. Not long ago, Mr Lang enunciated a plan which was called repudiation. Order! ber for New England( Mr Thompson) said that we on this side of the chamber do not represent country interests. But the Labour party has had a country policy for many years. I remember when the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman), at that time Labour Leader of New South Wales, used These to go into the country districts and in his inimitable fashion, tickle the ears of the farmers with the golden promise of the Labour platform. He spoke of water conservation schemes which would make the desert to blossom like the rose, we should continue production and visualized the day when the wife of the small farmer would do her washing and ironing with electrical appliances. Rural audiences applauded these sentiments aud cheered the speaker. The Labour party has still a policy to improve the lot of rural communities. There are other reasons why we desire to develop the country. Capitalism is crumbling, and the time is not f a r distant when the present social system w ill be changed. We believe that we should proceed with water conservation schemes throughout Australia, in order to make life easier for the people when we take control of the real workers' Parliament.

Interest to be allowed on sinking fund deposits . . Miscellaneous items I am hopeful that, if the financial position improves, it may be possible to make some provision for the building of additions to homes because an extraordinary number of applications have been received by the department. Many purchasers and occupiers find that, owing to the increase in their families, tlieir existing homes are too small. The Government appreciates the problem which confronts them. assist them, at the earliest opportunity, and when funds are available provision will be made to meet urgent cases. 1, like the honourable member for West Sydney, am most anxious to do all in my power to relieve unemployment, and I very much regret the unfortunate condition of the building trade, but I can assure the honourable member that, when the financial position improves, I shall be glad to do all that is possible to make provision for the extension of existing homes. am pleased that the Minister has given details of contemplated expenditure in respect of war service homes, because that is the information which I have been seeking for some time. I notice that Â£1,200 is set aside for the adjustment of applicants' claim for their equity in homes of which they have been dispossessed. In view of what has happened honourable members should seriously consider the advisability of expending Â£18,000 on ref airs and renovations to reverted homes, am afraid that much of this expenditure Â£ will be so much money wasted. Under a recent amendment of the act a certain proportion of this expenditure is chargeable against the soldier who has been dispos641 sessed. This, I maintain, is unfair, because in not a few instances homes upon respect of reverted which expenditure to the amount of Â£50 .. .. 3,260 or Â£60 has been incurred to make them fit for re-sale, have been allowed to stand unoccupied, and, as a consequence, have fallen into the hands of vandals. .. 2,176 I cite the North Belmore settlement as of applicants' a case in point. Much damage has been .. 1,200 done there to renovated homes which were unoccupied. I therefore question the 18,200 wisdom of expending Â£18,000 on repairs to these homes this financial year if the 7,443 80 commission is not going to accept some responsibility for their effective maintenance. If the Government spends Â£100 on repairs to a home, and debits a proportion of the amount to the returned soldier who has been dispossessed, what chance has he of securing a reasonable proportion of his equity'if the commission allows the home to .stand idle and at the mercy of vandals? Would it not be better, as has been suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), to It is anxious to expend this money on additions to existing occupied homes ? Apparently, no effort is being made to rent reverted war service homes at a reasonable rate. It would be much better to allow returned soldiers to remain in occupation, even if they are unable to continue their payments, than allow them to get into the hands of vandals. I have here a list, supplied to me by the Railway and Tramway Returned Soldiers Association, of homes upon which money has been expended, and which, as I have explained, have been allowed to fall into disrepair again. The list contains full details of each property; it shows the approximate date when repairs were effected, and gives an estimate of the damage done by vandals. The figures are impressive, and suggest that it would be better to allow returned soldiers to remain in occupancy rather than to dispossess them and spend Â£18,000 on repairs.

It has been sugr gested in Sydney that Mascot is not suitable, in view of the probable future developments in aviation, and it has been urged that other areas in the vicinity of Sydney should be developed for that purpose. I should like to know if the department is satisfied that expenditure on the Mascot thoroughly suitable for all future requirerients. ' I desire some information about the item Â£8,980 for arms, armament, and ammunition. The public generally, more particularly those who are about to suffer at the hands of this Government through reduction in wages or pensions, or loss of employment, will not look upon this proposed expenditure with approval. During the Scullin administration the present Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) was sent abroad at the expense of the Commonwealth taxpayers to attend a disarmament conference at Geneva, and more recently the Attorney-General( Mr some of the military clothing held in store Latham) also represented this country at another disarmament conference. Their mission cost our taxpayers a considerable sum of money, and, notwithstanding the attitude of the people towards disarmament proposals, this Government is now setting aside a considerable sum for arms, armament, and ammunition. not appear that there is any intention to deal with disarmament in a serious manner. I cannot allow the item to be passed without drawing public attention to this matter, and particularly the attention of those who are called upon to suffer a reduction, in the miserable pittance they receive, namely, the old-age pensioners. The sum of Â£1,000 has been allocated for the provision of aircraft, equipment, and plant, including spare parts, machinery, tools, ordnance and engineering supplies and ammunition, and the preparation of aerodromes for the Royal Air Force. It would be interesting to know where this money is to be spent. Isi t to be at Point Cook, that sink for the taxpayers' money? Much interesting information could be obtained by holding an impartial inquiry into the administration of Point Cook, and the expenditure in connection with it. We know that Rolls-Royce engines were brought out from England, and, after lying at Point Cook for some time, were sold for Â£30 each. "" Wizard"" Smith bought one of them, and later used'it to break a speed record in New Zealand. Two thousand, seven hundred pounds is set down for the construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and earth works, and aerodrome will make it preparation of aerial routes and landing grounds. Where is this work to be done, and for what purpose? For the acquisition of a small arms factory at Footscray, Â£19,153 is provided. The committee is entitled to know something about that matter also. I feel that the Defence Department is oue which should be closely watched. It was always inclined to spend more than the country could afford, even in prosperous times, aud this applies much more in times like these. Instead of spending this money on defence, it would be more fitting if we allocated some of it for the relief of people in need. We might distribute for the benefit of those who at present are not adequately clad. Money is spent every now and then sending delegates from Australia to disarmament conferences in Europe, but, in the meantime, we are arming ourselves to the teeth. In the circumstances, our representation at It does disarmament conferences is a farce. This country ought to give a lead to the world, and scrap its arms to show that it is genuine when it subscribes to the doctrine for the outlawing of war. We should then be able to spend the money formerly allocated to defence on the relief of unemployed persons and their dependants. This department, which specializes in the training of youths in the noble art of killing, recently turned 80 unemployed persons out of the Maitland camp so that training operations might be carried on. At the present time, large stocks of military equipment are lying in store,",32,Littleton Groom Th E Taken Into Account In Dealing With This

They cannot even have their representatives in the corridors of Parliament House, engaged in lobbying in their behalf. honourable member may make passing reference to the reduction of pensions and the maternity allowance, but he may not discuss those subjects. sented in the vote for the Department of Defence would mean only about 9d. to each pensioner. here and 9d. there makes up the total of over Â£1,100,000 which they will have to provide. The pensioners will be called upon to contribute to the grant of Â£1,000,000 to South AustraUa. The most callous individuals in the world would not treat the poor and helpless in a worse manner than this Government proposes to deal with them. The actions of the Government are both a tragedy and a disgrace. I shall record my vote against this item. This is the first opportunity I have had in this chamber of discussing matters associated with our naval, military, and air forces. have a voice, I shall raise it against a continuation of the accursed system which brought about the devastating war of 1914-18. It is remarkable that while the Goverument is using the pruning knife ruthlessly in other directions, and preaching economies to those least, able to bear them, it should provide Â£4.1,592 for new works to build up a system of navy and army expansion in this country. Still more remarkable is the fact that of that sum over Â£27,000 is for [14] arms and ammunition, to be wasted, as I indicated last night, in an amateurish attempt to build up an army of school for defence purposes, children to defend this country. Over Â£41,000 is to be spent in preparation for another war, and only Â£3,000 for the purpose of assisting mentally afflicted ex-soldiers. What a commentary on our The Government boasted civilization! I suggest that it would be better to spend Â£3,000 in preparation for another war, and Â£41,000 on the men who were maimed and otherwise afflicted in the last war. Those ultrapatriotic individuals who urge that we should prepare for war, lack a sense of proportion. Another remarkable thing is that the Government is prepared to The feed, clothe, and shelter a soldier, in order to make him good fodder for cannon, while hundreds of men who returned from the last war are left to walk the streets of our capital cities in search of food. The Government boasts of its patriotism; it would show a truer patriotism if it spent a little more money in supplying food to those who came back maimed and crippled from the last war than in preparing for another such adventure. What is the use of preaching disarmament, and spending thousands of pounds in sending representatives to peace conferences, if at the same time we do oiir utmost to build up another army, navy, and air force with which to start another war? It is'time that the people were awakened to the situation. The Government preaches the gospel of peace. Why does it not ptit theory into practice, and expend the money now earmarked for military purposes in directions better suited for the conditions under which ""we are living to-day? The Government is adopting a hypocritical attitude by sending its delegates overseas to a peace conference, So long as I ,and immediately they return, expending Â£41,000 in preparing for another war.

This Government, as did the last Government, is taking every opportunity to bring nearer the day of disarmament throughout the world. Until that time arrives this Government will continue, as far as the depleted funds of the Commonwealth will permit, to honour its sacred trust and maintain the defences of this country. West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asked for an explanation in regard to certain items. First of all, he wished to know what was covered by the item ""'arms, armament, and ammunition "" under Division No. 5, and he incidentally expressed the desire that there should be no provision for munitions at all. Yesterday, he made a' strong appeal for continuing the operaearth works, and preparation of aerial tions of the' small arms factory at Lithgow, which was established for the manufacture of rifles and munitions. The honourable member cannot have it both ways, and I shall be glad to know what he really desires in regard to the expenditure on munitions. The item in question provides for an increase of only Â£3.780 on last year's vote. It covers signal cartridges and munitions generally for various types of guns, such as eighteen-pounders and howitzers, smoke shells and other miscellaneous stores required for this year's operations. for Hunter objected to the small provision made for civil aviation. tlie whole of the vote was more or less for the Air Force. The honourable member will find, in Divisions Nos. 6 and 7 that the total provision for the Royal Australian Air Force is Â£3,850, and for civil aviation Â£10,280. The expenditure under Division No. 6 for the provision of aircraft equipment and plant, including spare parts, machinery, tools, &c., is only Â£1,000. That is really to make provision for emergency expenditure on urgent purchases which may be vitally necessary later in the year. vision No. 7, provides for an expenditure of Â£2,700 towards the cost of construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and earth works, and preparation of aerial routes and landing grounds. Ilr. Frannis. mainfy to Point Cook and' Laverton. At Laverton, it is proposed to provide a ventilation system in the paint room to afford some protection from the fumes arising from the paint spray. It is also proposed to erect a pyrotechnic store at Laverton. The proposed expenditure for works at Point Cook is Â£2,340, the chief item of which is Â£1,500 for the The* honourable member for erection of an explosives store; the next mdst important Undertaking being the undergrouiiding of a power line leading to headquarters. The provision for works at Richmond, New South Wales, is Â£2,100. Item No. 1, under Division No. 8, provides for ah expenditure of Â£10,030 towards the cost of construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and routes and landing grounds. A sum oi Â£2,466 is to remain unexpended. While many new works are required, the present financial stringency has involved drastic curt-ailment of the new proposals, those covered by the remaining vote of Â£7,564 being vitally urgent and essential. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) referred to the Mascot aerodrome, and wished to know what provision had been made for landing grounds in Australia, and whether it would not be possible to abandon Mascot Aerodrome. Before any proviThe honourable member sion was made for the Mascot aerodrome ( Mr James) strongly careful inquiries were made by the Public Works Committee and all branches He claimed that of the air services. The unanimous decision was that the work should be proceeded with. The proposed vote provides for only part of the requirements. Each year the Mascot aerodrome is nearing perfection. Work is being undertaken in progressive stages as funds permit. The aerodrome has been considerably improved, and this year's vote provides for further improvement. It is proposed to erect an office building at a cost of Â£200, and to provide a public enclosure, fencing, paved taxi-way to public enclosure, and roadway through public Item No. 1, under Dienclosure at a cost of Â£2,200. The work of completing the filling of public enclosure, the filling for hangar sites on south side of public enclosure, drainage, &c. will cost Â£1,600. The surface treatment adjoining taxi-way will cost Â£150, and This expenditure applies the extension of paved taxi-way in front of public enclosure, Â£500. Other proposed works and services are as follows:Archerfield, Queensland-Concret e tarmac for proposed new private hangar Maylands, Western Australia-Various works . .

The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has for the third time referred to the Rutherford military encampment. I assure him that that matter .has been carefully investigated by the department. Labour and Industry Department assures me that ample provision has been made for the accommodation of 39 single men ancl one married couple who are domiciled there. The equipment is being checked and returned to the department, and particular"" satisfaction is felt at the manner in which the department has met the needs of the unfortunate unemployed in that district. A change would not have been made had not tbe barracks been required for defence purposes. I hope that the vote will now be agreed to. [3.36] I find it very difficult to vote against this provision, because it embraces work for some of our unemployed and expenditure on what is absolutely essential to the development of this country. I refer to civil aviation. But I am sorry to find that we are asked to agree to an increased expenditure on f purely military operations. That makes it very difficult for me to vote for it. 475 Last night I listened carefully to the very fine speech of the Attorney-General. . 2,405 ( Mr Latham) in connection with in180 ternational conferences that are wrapped up with this particular question. There 250 can be no questioning the honourable 250 gentleman's knowledge of the many important conferences that have been held .. .. 100 since the war. He must agree with the fundamental principle underlying the 200 whole of the operations of the League of Nations. It is hoped that eventually international peace will be achieved as a result of the maintenance and extension 150 of social justice in all countries. Clause is money w e ll 13 of the Peace Treaty distinctly lays it down that there can be no international peace that is not founded upon social justice. In the Estimates that we are now discussing, the military side is exaggerated at the expense of the breaking down of our social justice. It is unfortunate that in one set of items we are tearing to pieces and ruining some of the best social legislation in this country, and, at the same time, increasing the grants for purely military matters. That is what I object to. If it was intended only to maintain what was already in existence, and to add to the comfort of the people concerned, it would not be so The State bad. I was informed, in answer to a question that I asked this morning, that the Government is awaiting the result of the Disarmament Conference before definitely deciding upon its defence policy. One is placed in an awkward position when one believes that there is some hope of sooner or later achieving international peace, and that that is not possible except by the extension of the principle laid down in clause 13 of the Peace Treaty, which calls upon all countries not only to maintain' but to increase their social legislation so that others will be envious of it and endeavour, to emulate it, thus placing it on. an international basis. I object to the proposal to expend an additional Â£3,000 on arms and ammunition,"" because it does not involve any work for the development of Australia, but simply means the production of more cartridges to be' blown away",35,Department Of Defence

I have no wish to retract anything that I then said. My aim was to enable that factory to continue a class of work in which, I think, it should be engaged, rather than in the making of arms and ammunition, namely, the manufacture of combs and cutters. Auy attempt to convert this and similar institutions from the sword to the ploughshare should be encouraged by all parties in this chamber. I witnessed such a transaction at Krupps works, Essen, in 1926. Huge workshops, which had been used for purposes of war, were, in a few months, converted to purposes of peace to meet the agricultural requirements of Germany and adjacent countries. she is to-day the greatest exporting country iu the world. shall never regret having witnessed. My efforts will always be directed towards conversions of thatcharacter. I am certain that the men at Lithgow would stand behind any one who was prepared to take up that attitude. They do not desire to produce what will be used for the purpose of destroying their own class, found that the aerodrome from which either in Australia or abroad. Our aim will always be to develop those industries he had to continue further southward. that are of real use to the people of this It would be better to provide services of country. I urge the Government to expand the operations of the Lithgow fac' tory along the lines that are now being followed. Let its activities be extended so as to embrace the production of wireless equipment, for which it is eminently adapted. I shall seize every opportunity that presents itself to speak and work for the utilization of these factories in such a way that they will be of real use to the people of this country. regret that no provision has been made for the establishment of an aerodrome in a convenient situation at Cairns. This work has been recommended on more than one occasion by tbe Cairns City Council, and other local bodies. An aerodrome has been established there, but at high tide it is completely submerged by water, with the result that a plane cannot land unless it does so on property belonging to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, twelve or fourteen miles distant from the city. The desirability of having an aerodrome at Cairns is indisputable. Recently, because no communication waf available, two men died on the Batavia rjold-field before a doctor could reach them. Had there been an aerodrome at Cairns, rapid transport would have been available, and that would not have happened. It is regrettable that no provision has been made for this very important centre, which is the outlet for an enormous area of back country that is a considerable distance from the coast. Rapid transport is possible only by aeroplane because of the poor type of bush road that is met with. I know that one officer of the department recommended the establishment of an aerodrome seven or eight miles out of Cairns; but because of the lack of funds, no action in that direction could be taken. The same gentleman then suggested, as a suitable one, the present site of the so-called aerodrome. On his recent visit to North Queensland, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith landed at Cairns. Subsequently, he proceeded to the district of which I understand he is a native, or iu which he spent the early part of his life. When he returned to Cairns on the following afternoon, he he had taken off was under water, and that kind than to produce material for the destruction of human life. Proposed vote agreed to.

For two years the department has been backward in providing telephonic facilities for the people in outback areas. Only Â£20,000 is allocated under these Estimates to ""Western Australia, as against Â£111,500 to Victoria. I cannot understand why the telephones of the present type are not regarded as satisfactory; and if the Government has money to spend in supplying new instruments, I claim that more money should be made available for providing ordinary telephonic facilities for the people in the back country. Preference should not ""be shown to the subscribers in the cities. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [3.55] -I cannot understand the policy of the Government respecting ""buildings and sites "", for which Â£25,000 is allowed on these Estimates. Some time ago the municipal council of Woollahra made certain representations to the Government. The pret'jnt post office site was possibly reasonably situated years ago, but is now not by any means in the centre of tlie business locality. A request was made to the Government that a more central site should be used, but it was refused. ' The council then offered to make a central site available for a period of twelve months, to demonstrate to the Postal Department that a more centrally situated post office would result in a larger volume of business; but this offer was also rejected. Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) that the council should know the needs of the district. Lf he cannot accede to the request for a more central site, I trust that he will take steps to put the present building in decent repair. some information in regard to the building of official post offices. I have tried on a number of occasions to get the Government to build official post offices at Edwardstown and St. Morris, suburbs If all the particulars of Adelaide, and at Wanbi, in the country, but I have been told that it is not the present policy of the department to build official post offices. I wish to know whether official post offices are being built in other States. I ask the Postmaster-General( Mr Fenton) to give special consideration to the installation of additional rural automatic telephone exchanges. We know very well that it is impossible for financial reasons to give a continuous service in exchanges with only about twenty subscribers. The office hours in such circumstances are necessarily limited. Buti f automatic telephone exchanges were installed in such rural areas a continuous service could be provided for the people with very little cost to the department. Some such exchanges were installed during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, and they have given remarkably good service. I appeal to the Postmaster General to extend the scope and number of these most useful adjuncts to country life. I trust that the Government will not build any more official post offices. Visitors to the Old Country never see official post offices. The policy of the British Postal Department is to give service to the people, and that, I submit, should be the policy of the Commonwealth Postal Department. Our money should not be spent on ornate postal buildings in cities and country towns, but in the provision of facilities to the public. master-General) [3-59] -The details of the proposed expenditure on buildings and sites have been submitted to the Minister for the'Interior( Mr Parkhill).

Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed vote-(Northern Territory Â£16,000) agreed to. Proposed vole, Â£60,500. Yesterday I made a number of charges against the Government in respect of its treatment of the unemployed in Canberra, and the Minister for the Interior( Mr Parkhill) made certain statements in reply which, as usual, were of an outrageous nature, and completely misrepresented the position. The Canberra Times of to-day's date, in its report of the discussion, used the headalso made for the expenditure of Â£6.000 line, ""Parkhill facts answer Blakeley Fiction "". In its usual one-eyed way this newspaper gave a most partial and biased account of the discussion which also completely misrepresented the' position. The irresponsible statements of the Minister were repeated in an equally irresponsible way by this newspaper. For the edification of the Minister, and the instruction of the Canberra Times, I wish to state the facts very clearly. The present administration has been in office for six time it has spent on unemployment relief Â£23,000 less than the amount provided in the Estimates of the Scullin Government, for expenditure in this direction in the Federal Capital Territory. That amount has therefore been, lost both to the unemployed and the business community of this city. The amount provided for the -iuinc purpose in the Estimates for 193233 is Â£30,000 less than the amount so provided in the Estimates of the Scullin Government. It will be seen therefore, that even if this Government expends the whole amount which it is providing in the Estimates, the amount that will have been spent on unemployed relief in Canberra in eighteen months will be Â£53,000 less than it might have been. Iii the general Estimates Â£15,000 less is berra on unemployed relief than was provided by the Scullin Government. Thus in the short period of eighteen months ing in Canberra will be Â£68,000. So much for the alleged fact3 of the Minister for the Interior, who, I am sorry to say, is not at present in the chamber. I very much regret that the real position has been misrepresented. I could say a good deal more on this subject but I shall large sum of money is provided on these Estimates for the purpose of still building up this white elephaut. A sum of Â£7,000 is provided for architectural and Â£-11,000 for engineering services. It seems extraordinary that such large amounts should be provided when no constructional work is being undertaken. What works does the Government propose to carry out in the Federal Capital Territory? Provision is in connection with forestry.

Of this amount, Â£250 is a revote to complete works which were in progress at the 30th of June. The items mentioned total Â£6,000. That work is not associated with the Forestry School as such, and in the circumstances, I suggest that the honourable member should withdraw his amendment. for architectural services is to cover the cost of alterations and additions to cottages in Canberra, including the enclosing of sleepouts, the provision of garages, and the like. The item is reproductive as increased rents are received to cover the capital outlay. The vote also covers alterations and additions to schools, the provision of sanitary conveniences at the Manuka oval, and at, Kingston and Manuka, the abseuce of which has been the subject of complaint. Provision is made for public shelter and office accommodation at the cemetery. necessary to provide further accommodation for the staff at the pumping station in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Board. The balance of Â£1,500 is required to complete works already in progress. The engineering services are on a larger scale. Some small extensions are being made to the sewerage system including the sludge beds at Western Creek sewerage disposal depot, which are insufficient, and must lie looked after. Some steel mains are required to replace the cast iron mains which have worn out, particularly those which serve the Canberra Hospital Whatever degree of blame may rightly be attributable to some one in the past in relation to that particular expenditure, this provision must be made. An item of considerable importance is Â£12,150 for a reservoir on Black Mountain. My information is that the water supply to the northern suburbs is inadequate, especially as regards fire protection, and that the proposal forms part of the general developTiicnt of the water supply reticulation of Canberra, and will involve tbe expenditure of further amounts of Â£11,000 in each of the two following years for mains. The other large item is Â£15,000 for road work to improve the surface of certain city roads with bitumen, and seal coats to bitumen and gravel roads on bus routes aud other thoroughfares. These roads must be maintained, and this work has to be done. Another substantial item is Â£750 for a bridge over Paddy's Elver. In winter, the landholders on the other side of the river are frequently unable to cross it . For electrical reticulation services, Â£1,200 is provided, and for a quarry on Mount Ainslie, Â£1,800. The quarry at Mugga has been abandoned, The amount provided because the stone worked there has turned out to be very bard, and, as a consequence, the jaws of the crusher required constant replacement. Furthermore, the length of haulage was a serious matter, and the silica dust in the stone was a detriment to the health of the workmen. A site for a quarry has been chosen on the slopes of Mount Ainslie, and a road already built to it . So far, Â£4,250 has been spent on the installation of plant, and the Â£1,800 on these Estimates will complete the project. I suggest that an examination of these items will show that It is also they are only reasonable provisions to meet the requirements of the community: Amendment-by leave-withdrawn . session I recommended that some of the local unemployed should be put to work on Mount Stromlo. I had noticed that some of the trees planted sixteen or seventeen years ago had a diameter of not more than 5 inches or 6 inches, showing clearly that there is something wrong about the forestry methods adopted here. After sixteen or seventeen years, a pine tree should have some commercial value. These particular trees were planted in the correct fashion, 8 feet apart, but should have been thinned out years ago. T recommended months ago that every other row both ways should be cut out, leaving the trees 16 feet apart. That would give them room to grow. Portion of the money provided on these Estimates for afforestation might advisedly be used in that direction, otherwise the Stromlo plantation w ill be useless.

As the rainfal l in the Territory is inadequate, it is a pity that a large expenditure should he incurred in afforestation in the Territory. I have had sufficient experience of forestry work to know that pine trees seventeen years of age should have a -diameter of close on 20 inches. Eveni f the Stromlo trees had been given room to grow in the manner I have suggested -they would probably have only half that -diameter to-day. There is not sufficient rainfal l here for successful pine-growing. When speaking on this subject previously, I drew the attention, of the House to the fact that it would cost at least 38s. par 100 super, feet to land the Stromlo pine in one's backyard, whereas a f a r superior Canadian timber could be delivered at 15s. 9d. per 100 super, feet.

247,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"AttorneyMy attention has been drawn to a statement in the press to the effect that it is possible that, within the next few weeks, the Federal Parliament will adjourn for a fortnight to allow the holding of a Premiers conference at which the long range problems facing Australia will be dealt with. Whilei t is proposed to hold a Premiers conference"", no decision has yet been come to regarding the date, nor has it yet appeared that there will be any necessity to adjourn the House for the purpose. That aspect has not been considered by the Government. concerned about the developments that are taking place in different parts of Australia, and I ask the Attorney General( Mr Latham), who is at present in charge of the House, to consider whether something can be done. I am informed that there was a broadcast in Melbourne to-day, which gave the reassuring message to the manufacturers and workers of Australia that the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) had indicated that there would be no immediate application of any cut in the tariff, but only after Parliament had dealt with it, and that, in the meantime, .manufacturers may make further representations to the Tariff Board, and for further consideration to other proposals. I presume that is based on a statement made by the Prime Minister. Prime Minister is reported in to-day's newspapers as having saidI learn with regret that one or two firms which nre apparently affected by the decision f the Government to reduce tariff duties are dismissing employees. There is not the slightest justification for this action being taken at present, because, although a resolution has been'tabled in the House of Representatives, under which it is announced that Parliament is to be invited to reduce duties in certain cases, these reductions of the tariff do to keep their employees at work in the not beoome operative until such time as the tariff has passed both Houses of Parliament. Consequently, if in the meantime any industry haB reason to believe that its case has not received, at the hands of the Tariff Board, the attention of the acting leader of the consideration to which it thinks it is ontitled, it is open for the industry concerned to make further representations to the Tariff Board. I appeal, therefore, to those industries which may consider themselves adversely affected by the decision of the Government, to hold their hand, and refrain from dismissing their employees, and to take the action which is open to them. In the meantime, they have the same measure of protection that they had previously. The newspapers publish a further statement that between 50 and 60 employees of Bryant and May Proprietary Limited, match manufacturers, in my own electorate,have received notice of dismissal as the result of the tariff. Other similarstatements have been made. The Prime Minister has stated deliberately on behalf of the Government, that, pending the further consideration for which he invites manufacturers to apply, their industries will be protected as they were previously. A ll I ask is that steps be taken by the Government to give effect to that assurance. I assume that the Prime Minister is under a misapprehension as to the effect of the tariff schedules, which, I understand, applied from the day on which they were tabled in this House. match industry. they do. There are six or seven items in the schedule iu respect of which the ful l reductions will not take place because they are below the 1928 level; but every reduction of the duties imposed by my Government will apply except those below the 1928 level. The duties below the 192S level do not operate tc the full extent immediately, but in those cases the reductions apply at once down* to the 1928 level. The Apparently the Prime Minister was not aware of that. With few exceptions the lower duties are operative, and, as a result, employees have been dismissed, although Parliament has not yet ratified the reductions. The obvious step to be taken is to restore the old duties until Parliament has given its decision. If that is done I shall join with the Prime Minister in appealing to manufacturers meantime.

That arrangement, no doubt, is convenient to New South Wales members, enabling them to spend at least half of the week at their homes or in tlieir constituencies; perhaps that was why they hurried the transfer of the seat of government to Canberra. But members from other States should not be penalized. I have no desire to dodge my job. The running of sleeping cars between Canberra and Sydney and .TVfplbourne in order that members may sit here for two aud a half clays in each week is not economical. I may be told that the State Governments are paid by the Commonwealth for the conveyance of members; that does not alter tbe fact that the running of the car3 more frequently than otherwise would .be necessary is extravagant. This House has made very little progress with its business during the last fortnight. terday and to-day. spurted in the last few hours. The bills providing for grants to three of the States have already been discussed for one day, and will presumably occupy another sitting. In every session we have the same experience; the House sits for two or three days each week at the beginning of the session and then rushes through a mass of business towards the enfl. Probably the present Goverument, like its predecessor, will endeavour to bulldoze the Esti^ mates through the House in one night without affording members an opportunity to discuss them. A few months ago the Bankruptcy Bill of about seventy clauses was passed through all stages in this chamber in less than half an hour because members wanted to return to their constituencies. It is reasonable that the House should commence immediately to sit on Tuesdays. We have to deal with the decisions of the Ottawa Conference, and the consequential alterations in the tariff, as well as the budget proposals, the Estimates, and other measures. The Financial Emergency Bill alone will occupy two weeks unless the Government applies the gag. Having regard to the extensive programme of business' to be transacted, I appeal to the Government to arrange for the House to meet on Tuesday. T Adjournment. I am much concerned about the conflicting explanations of the tariff schedule given by members of the Government. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins), in reply to a question, saidTaking the schedule generally, the majority of the duties will not operate until they have been authorized by Parliament; but in a few instances in which the Government has reverted to the 1921-28 tariff they become operative immediately. To-day the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) broadcast the statement which has been read by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) to reassure the manufacturers who considered that the lower rates of duty would commence from the dates upon which the amending schedules were tabled by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) and the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins). The tariff schedules introduced by me were validated for three months. On the day before the expiration of that period the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced further schedules which automatically took the place of mine. The new rates of duties applied in all instances except those in which the rates were below the level of the 1921-28 schedule. The rates of duty specified in the 192S schedule will apply in the case of only six items until Parliament authorizes the new tariff proposals. In certain items, including matches, the duties go even below the level of the 1921-28 schedule. In one item affecting Queensland interests-I refer to the duty on Diesel engines over 100 horse-powerthe rate in the new schedule is free, British -Order!

It is no wonder that the Melbourne Age, in a leading article on the 5th September, said thisMr Latham asserted that in the hands of his party tlie policy of protection would be safe. . . . cerned the Lyons Ministry won tlie election on false pretences. I now ask the Acting Leader of the Government ( Mr Latham) to accede to the request made by the Leader of the Opposition. All who have at heart the interests of Australian industries, and particularly the workers in them, will agree that we cannot afford to see hundreds of workers thrown out of employment in Australian factories as the result of the lower duties brought in by this Government. I hope that the promise of the Prime Minister as published in the press this morning will be honoured. the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). I am very much concerned at the black outlook in many industries that have been established during the last year or two as the result of protection given to them under the Scullin tariff, or under tariffs introduced by previous governments. I should like to refer particularly to the glass manufacturing industry, which, taking advantage of the deferred duty imposed in the Scullin tariff, commenced the manufacture of sheet glass.

Because of the lower duties fixed by this Government, a number of manufacturers have threatened to dismiss employees and close down their works. suggested that, in the case of the window glass industry, the threat was merely so much bluff. members that the management was very much in earnest; but, following urgent appeals made by myself and also other honourable members on this side of the House, yesterday I received the following telegram from the manager:In view your telegram yesterday, Australian Window tilass Coinpuny will act on your recommendation and keep plant in operation until Parliament has decided fate of industry. It is all very well for honourable members who do not represent industrial constituencies ' to treat this matter lightly. As far as the tariff is' conLet me tell them that members of industrial electorates are not unmindful of the welfare of our primary producers. I , for one, am always prepared to render them all the assistance in my power. to sheepskins! that. That they ueed assistance is evident from recent statements in the Melbourne press that prices for certain classes of wool lately have been so low that growers have been forced to burn or bury their skins. The Attorney-General has suggested that statements of certain manufacturers that, because of recent tariff alterations they were closing down, was merely a threat. I assure him that, in many cases, this is the renl intention. The Australian Window Glass Company had intended to close down this week-end to effect repairs to its furnaces; when the industry received this death-blow the management resolved to cease operations because of the impossibility of competing with overseas manufacturers. I appeal to the Government to give the House an early opportunity of discussing its drastic tariff proposals.
