269,Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 8 p.m.,24702 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 Wednesday, 28 February 2001 ----Goods and Services Tax: Price Rises cently about grocery prices, a survey has shown 22 of 28 food items surveyed have increased in price since the GST was introduced. If Minister Hockey spent more time sitting at the kitchen table than he does sitting at the boardroom table, he would understand how Australians are being hit with GST-inflated price rises at the supermarket. Yesterday Minister Hockey deliberately misled the House about the results of my Lilley Pricewatch survey. statement. Competition and Consumer Commission, predicted before the GST was introduced that 24 of 28 food types in the Lilley Pricewatch team survey would fall in price. Only four food items surveyed have fallen in price since June 2000; 20 items did not. Nearly all of these 20 food items have risen in price despite the fact that they do not attract a GST. The introduction of the GST and the removal of embedded wholesale sales taxes have not produced the falls predicted by Mr Hockey. The nearest Minister Hockey has been to a supermarket is in a plane flying over the Marrickville Metro when coming in to land in Sydney. Sure, the battlers are better off with the GST if they live on tomato sauce, pasta, sweet biscuits, tinned tomatoes and then go partying with Coca-Cola. The government said it would take six months for prices to stabilise after the GST was introduced and for embedded wholesale sales tax savings to flow through. Six months are up and prices have moved-in some cases savagely upwards. For example, the Lilley Pricewatch team found that Vegemite, which was expected to fall by approximately 3c, has risen by 10c and bread, which was expected to fall in price by 2c, has risen by 9c. These price increases all add up. Women are also feeling the GST. Women are now paying 46c more for tampons than they were six months ago. Already we have seen essential services rise in price above 10 per cent, including gas and electricity. Any compensation that families, pensioners and self-funded retirees have received has already been gobbled up. We think these price rises are the tip of the iceberg. Our survey shows there are more price rises in the pipeline. This hard data shows how consumers have been dudded by the Howard government, just as they were on petrol. All these price increases may seem small to the government, but pensioners and families are feeling it at the checkout. I have written to Minister Hockey and the ACCC with the Lilley Pricewatch team’s findings and my concerns about the impact these price hikes are having on shoppers. Estimates of price changes were an important factor in the government’s determination of compensation to families when the GST was implemented. Our survey shows prices on basic groceries have risen more than expected, eroding the compensation. The GST is hurting families and people on low and fixed incomes. The government made a lot of promises about how people on lower incomes would be better off under the GST, but they have not delivered on these claims. It is just over six months since the GST was introduced and already our average basket price is well above pre-GST levels. Consumers watch out! There is sure to be more to come with Hockey and his hogwash.",131,Appropriation Parliamentary Success Of Many Of The Work For The Dole Departments Bill No 2 2000 2001 Schemes Provide Hope And Assistance To The

273,Mr Swan,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The government, through the AustralianWednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24703 Health: MRI Machines Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.58 a.m.)-I would like to speak today about the lack of an MRI machine at the Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane. The Prince Charles Hospital is one of Australia’s leading cardiac respiratory hospitals. It is an ongoing problem for the hospital in that many people from the country come there for emergency operation services and for a long time now it has been without this very basic technology. Some months ago I wrote to Wendy Edmond, seeing it is a state public hospital, asking her to look at the situation. I was sent back a letter saying that there was no funding in the Queensland health budget for such a valuable piece of equipment. I noticed, however, just prior to the state election that a promise was made by the state government that they would put an MRI machine in the Prince Charles Hospital. I find that quite amazing because, at the moment, an evaluation committee is being set up to look at all proposals for MRI machines. There are no funding models, no criteria, no position as to what the Commonwealth or the state will fund and absolutely no decisions as to where these MRI machines are to be placed in Australia. It follows the recommendation of Professor Blandford in the Blandford report. In that report he recommended that several MRI machines, at the very minimum, should be placed in Australia. So, at the moment, the committee is going through the evaluation process and trying to work out the best system of funding the MRI machines. But, from a local level, it is very disheartening to see a hospital such as Prince Charles not having this valuable piece of equipment. Things have moved on in terms of medical technology. I understand that the only way patients who come to have procedures can have an MRI scan at the moment is if they are put in a taxi with a full-time nursing staff member and travel all the way to the Royal Brisbane Hospital. This is outrageous. I ask that it be looked at. the time allotted for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 December 2000, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Customs Tariff Act 1995 but want to make a couple of observations. The first is an observation that flows from the way in which nuisance tariffs have been removed. It is plain to see that on a number of occasions we have had to return to the parliament, having had so-called nuisance tariffs removed and then on further investigation discovered that there remains a local manufacturer, to have the tariff reinstated. It is simply stating the obvious to say that it is unfortunate that the initial inquiries undertaken by the government did not identify these factors in the first place, because, plainly, manufacturers for whom the small five per cent tariff still remains of economical value are placed in an awkward position if that is removed on the assertion that there is no local manufacturer. There is one provision in this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000 relating to a woven fibreglass fabric which falls squarely within that kind of circumstance. The government, having identified that such a manufacturer exists, is reinstating the five per cent rate on duty on that woven fibreglass fabric. One cannot oppose that, but certainly we draw attention to the fact that it would be better if such errors were not made in the first place. The second point of note regarding the specifics of the bill is that it implements the duty reductions on tariff items from five per cent to three per cent, which flows from the settlement reached between the Australian and the United States governments in the Howe Leather trade dispute. There are few in this chamber who would not believe that the issue of Howe Leather",132,Representatives Main Committee
274,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A,",133,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Kerr (Denison) (10.00 A.m.),"The opposition support the proposals contained in the24704 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 could have been handled better. It has been a running sore. The resolution of that-whilst of necessity a matter which comes before this chamber and which we support-again reflects poorly on the administration of the government over a substantial period of time, a period of time which has caused considerable uncertainty to those employed by Howe Leather, and no doubt has caused considerable concern to those in the management and ownership of that company who have seen this battered around the place like a ping-pong ball, with their interests not having been given paramount attention. Both those points need to be made, but nonetheless, given the circumstances and the background, we see no alternative but to support the measures in the bill that provide for the removal of tariff on the items relating to the Howe Leather settlement. We include in the bill provisions which add Angola and Madagascar to the list of least developed countries for the purposes of the Customs Act. It is useful to reflect a little more broadly on the way in which global trade requires us to develop a more comprehensive approach to the difficulties faced by least developed countries. All the research shows that, on average, open markets and freer global trade lead to average increases in general wealth-and that is to be welcomed-but it ignores the distributional consequences of the way in which that wealth is shared. The research that is available to us shows that both within countries and between countries there has been an increasing gulf between those who benefit from open markets and globalisation and those who have been left behind in that very high-powered game. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, speaking in Davos just last month, drew attention to the fact that in his opinion it is unsustainable to continue a system of global trading which ignores the growing gulf between those most advantaged by the economic growth that has been stimulated by open markets and those left behind. In particular, he drew attention to the fact that the least developed nations have suffered real declines in their living standards over the time in which global wealth has increased very substantially. It is very important for us in this parliament to realise that we are not, as John Donne says, an island. We have to take into account the fact that our actions impact on others and theirs on ours. We now live in an increasingly globalised environment where the very concept of what is foreign and what is national has become blurred. It is impossible for us not to find ways to address this growing gulf of inequality. We also have to address it within our national framework. There is no doubt that there is considerable unease in sectors of the Australian community that have not benefited, as have some parts of the country, from the economic growth generated through open markets and global trade. For example, Sydney is plainly becoming a global city and is benefiting immensely from internationalisation of trade, the growth in the services sector and the new economy that has been generated from the technological revolution of the late 20th century. However, other parts of Australia have been left behind, and the cost of ignoring that sector of the community is being imparted very dramatically to us as members of the Australian parliament. The practice of turning a blind eye to that, on the basis that globalisation and economic openness are essentially good things because they promote growth, is, in the long term, quite unsustainable if it ignores those who are actually being left behind. These are factors that we need to take into account when we think about our responses to legislation such as the Customs Tariff Act, but it goes more broadly into how we approach negotiations such as the coming World Trade Organisation round. The last millennium round ended in failure and, whatever the specifics of why those negotiations ceased and came to no fruition, one of the underlying arguments which was used by those opposing the WTO millennium round-notwithstanding all the political difficulties associated with the United States’ commitment to labour standards, which were thought unacceptable by large components of the least developed countries and others-was that, with economic growth, attention Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24705 had not been sufficiently focused on fairness. We all have to carefully bear in mind that when we say that economic benefits have been flowing from open markets and globalisation we are speaking of averages, and averages can always be deceptive. If, for example, we all start on the same level with an income of $5 and, at the end of two years, half have found that their income has remained unchanged, a quarter that their income has doubled and a quarter that their income has been slightly reduced, it is perhaps easy to say, ‘Well, on average there has been a benefit flowing from globalisation,’ but it ignores the fact that the greatest benefits have gone to a few, many have not been significantly advantaged, and some have actually been left further behind. When, amongst those who have been left further behind, there is a significant component of those who already were the least advantaged and least developed components of our communities internationally and those who were struggling domestically, it is a recipe for political instability and for lack of commitment to long-term economic cooperation. Those are some of the larger questions which I believe we need to address as parliamentarians. We are being forced to address them by growing community unease, but we need to address them, simply because they are the correct issues for us to identify and respond to; and responses increasingly need to be transnational as well as national. Without wishing to be a self-promoter, some of these issues have been identified in my recent publication, Elect the Ambassador!: Building Democracy in a Globalised World, which Pluto Press published about a fortnight ago and which I hope some of my colleagues are taking the trouble to read and take account of. With those few remarks, I commend these measures. The opposition commends some of these measures reluctantly, simply because they reflect the tidying up of mistakes that ought not to have been made in the first place. Others are important because they recognise the particular difficulties that some of the least developed countries face and the need for them to be treated in ways which are more generous than those that apply to countries generally. The opposition supports this package of measures. member for Denison that, while I have not read his book, I did hear him discussing and promoting it on the ABC. Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000. I remind the House again that we owe a lot to a former member of the chamber-the former member for Wakefield, Bert Kelly-who tirelessly fought a campaign to reduce tariffs in this country against considerable opposition from within his own ranks at the time. He certainly went against the prevailing idea that tariffs were some sort of protection and showed that, in actual fact, all tariffs ever did was make consumer goods more expensive and industries lazy and inefficient, and stop innovation. As a result, industries were not able to compete overseas. The measures in today’s bill are fourfold. The major amendment proposed by the deal is the reduction of duty on 30 tariff subheadings from five per cent to three per cent. On a lesser scale, the bill adds Angola and Madagascar to the list of least developed countries in schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act, which contains a list of the countries and places to which special rates of duty apply. The effect of the change will be to accord a five per cent tariff margin to imports to Australia from both Angola and Madagascar. Item 17 of the bill provides concessional entry for goods that have been exported from Australia and are subsequently reimported in a non-altered condition. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify the operation of the concession so that the goods produced in Australia are not granted the concession if drawback or refunded duties have been claimed on them and not repaid to the Commonwealth or if the goods were excis-",133,Representatives Main Committee

Additionally, the proposed amendments are intended to ensure that goods are not granted the concession if they contain components which were previously imported duty free under the Tradex scheme or the Manufacturing in Bond scheme. Finally, part 4 of the schedule of the bill reintroduces a five per cent rate of duty on imports of covers of woven fibreglass fabric. This reintroduction follows the identification of a local manufacturer for such goods which has been a very strong part of the whole legislation and which has been supported by both parties for many, many years. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000 is quite an important piece of legislation. While it might sound fairly dry to many people listening to the debate, it is the culmination of events which began as a great travesty for an important Australian business which has a substantial number of ordinary South Australian workers among its stakeholders through their superannuation funds. This business is producing product of the highest quality. It is moving ahead, using the best technology that the modern era can supply, in order to grasp major export opportunities that would benefit this great nation, from the South Australian Superannuation Fund members and their other major shareholders, such as the NRMA in New South Wales, Perth’s Schaffer Corporation and Rothschilds, to the employees of the company and, indeed, all Australians, through their major export program. It is a company that has done everything right for the benefit of the whole community. That company is Howe Leather. The dispute that has led to the major amendment in this legislation began in 1995 when Howe Leather won a $US75 million contract to supply leather for car seats for General Motors in the United States of America. This showed that we could indeed compete globally with the best companies in the world, and that we certainly had a quality product. The foundations for the company’s present-day success were laid down in the 1970s after a management buyout. The new owners went overseas to look for new orders in the furniture and car industries. They also began to research dyeing techniques and invested to improve overall quality. During the 1980s, Howe Leather consolidated itself in the Asian motor industry, but it was the German car manufacturer, BMW, that guided them in making the decision to try to enter the United States market in 1994. BMW wanted to diversify its own suppliers and not be reliant on any one region for its product, to ensure their own stability. As I said, in 1995, Howe Leather won a $US75 million contract to supply leather for car seats used by General Motors in the United States. As more contracts followed, the two companies which had previously dominated the US market got a bit twitchy and lobbied the US government to launch a World Trade Organisation challenge to the industry programs which had rewarded Howe Leather for increased sales. These competitors argued that these programs amounted to export subsidies, which are illegal under the WTO rules. The Clinton administration then threatened Australia with the imposition of tariffs on a range of our imports, including wine, beef, car parts and other unrelated goods, unless Australia required Howe Leather to repay $30 million of government grants which the WTO had declared illegal. Under Australian law, the government had no power to take this action. But still the unprecedented harassment of Howe Leather continued. The issue placed an intolerable strain, not just on Howe Leather, but on many small Australian enterprises as the threats were made and as politicians and trade officials both here and in the United States argued about the grant that Howe had received. Howe Leather had been a shining example of a company that had displayed efficiency and professionalism. An ability to cut percentages in order to increase profits helped them to become an important global player and to ride the storm of the past four years. Howe Leather have been outstanding in their negotiations with our government. They have certainly done the right thing at every stage, in order to get the World Trade Organisation and Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24707 the United States government to resolve this matter. In June 2000, to protect the many other industries that were threatened by the United States with retaliatory measures, our government agreed to a number of measures that would protect our industries and allow Howe Leather to continue as a major global player. We agreed to remove tariffs from a wide range of consumer products, from microwave ovens to skis and condoms, which would reduce the price of about 30 items by up to five per cent from 1 July last year, thus cancelling out the price rises from the GST. I point out that all of these items involve products in regard to which there is no known manufacturer here in Australia. The deal is part of the package that has reduced the penalty to Howe Leather flowing from the World Trade Organisation ruling. The tariffs involved have no value to any Australian industry, but are of enormous value in preventing the Howe Leather issue escalating into a full-scale trade war with the US. Under that deal, Howe Leather is required to repay $7.2 million over 12 years. Automotive leather will be ineligible for grants under government industry schemes, and tariffs on microwaves and the other items will be suspended for 12 years. It is the removal of these tariffs on those 30 items which forms a major part of this amendment bill. As a result, this bill will protect the jobs of not only over 800 workers at Howe Leather but of countless thousands of other workers in industries that were under threat from the US government retaliation. Don’t get me wrong-I am not taking issue with the role of the World Trade Organisation, as the Pauline Hanson types and the League of Rights people might do. We have taken major issues to them in recent times and sought their assistance as a global umpire. There is no doubt that the World Trade Organisation has helped our lamb producers, not only in the electorate of Barker but all through Australia, with the ruling that what the US had done over the lamb import issue was quite plainly wrong. The World Trade Organisation can certainly be of great assistance to our producers in Australia when unfair actions have been taken by other governments. Our record in initiating dispute action-on prawns, music copyright protection, Canadian dairy assistance, Indian quantitative restrictions, Hungarian export subsidies, Korean beef and, most notably, the US lamb issue-highlights the active role the government pursues in this area. It is worth noting that all the major parties in Australia support this. They know that in the long and the short term we will all be better off being able to export and having freer trade throughout the world. It is a known fact that, because of our efficiencies-we produce five times what we consume in our home market-we need to export 80 per cent of what farmers in Australia produce. The best way to ensure that happens is to have greater access to overseas markets. We have established a dispute, investigation and enforcement mechanism through the department of trade to help exporters identify where challenges to the World Trade Organisation could advance their interests. The future of Australia’s lamb exports to the United States is now likely to be one of the first major decisions facing the new US President after the World Trade Organisation rejected US import restrictions as a breach of global rules. Political and farm industry leaders here rejoiced at the finding that was handed down recently by a disputes panel of the World Trade Organisation. At the time, the Prime Minister welcomed the ruling as the first bit of international trade justice Australian farmers looked like getting for a long time. He said that the United States restrictions had been wrong from the start but warned that the US was likely to appeal the ruling, which it has since done. According to the President of the National Farmers Federation, Ian Donges: These imposts have cost our lamb producers around $15 million a year, and caused unnecessary hardship to a number of rural communities. My electorate of Barker has the largest exporter of lamb to the United States, the Tatiara Meat Company. Indeed, I have personally sold many stock through the Tatiara Meat Company. It has been a very important decision for them. While there are still plenty of exports going to 24708 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 the United States, in some ways we have also given them a signal to look for other markets around the world. In the long term, I think the lamb industry will even benefit from this crazy decision that President Clinton made. Australia and New Zealand launched the World Trade Organisation action after President Bill Clinton decided, in July 1999, to cap their rapidly growing lamb exports to the US at 1998 levels, saying their growth threatened serious injury to the domestic lamb meat industry. Of course, that was nonsense. There were only 300 lamb farmers in the United States that produced over 100 lambs a year, so we were really looking at quite a small industry in itself, and the reasons given were clearly shown by the World Trade Organisation to be against WTO rules. Australian exports were capped initially at 17,500 tonnes with a prohibitive tariff of 40 per cent slapped on exports above that quota. Last year the quota was increased slightly and the tariff reduced to 32 per cent. Under the Clinton ruling, the tariff would fall to 24 per cent next year and end in mid-2002. But no doubt with congressional elections coming up in the year 2002 there would again be pressure on the Senate and the Congress in the United States parliament to bring back in lamb tariffs and quotas, but the World Trade Organisation ruling will, I think, ensure that they will not even think about that sort of decision making because they would already have previous rulings on it. At the time the government and the industry expressed enormous outrage, and rightly so, at this horrible decision. We believe that the administration’s decision went way beyond the ITC report and its recommendations. We always held that the decision was incorrect and inconsistent with World Trade Organisation rules. We have been energetically pursuing the case on behalf of the Australian industry within the WTO, and December’s decision in the year 2000 in our favour was certainly most welcome. Obviously, there is a process to go through yet. The US has appealed the decision but we will continue to assist the industry to pursue the case in what we are confident will be a positive outcome for our industry. Clearly, this is an indication that using the rules and disciplines within the World Trade Organisation to the advantage of individual exporting industries is worthwhile in that we can use them and we can win. This will be a great victory for another vital Australian industry. It should give Australian exporters great heart, and of course the government is prepared to put significant resources into prosecuting substantiated cases like this on the industry’s behalf with the assistance of industry. So while we were disappointed with the tactics used by the US against Howe Leather, we are still grateful that we can use the World Trade Organisation as a trade umpire to defend our industries. In reaching the solution of the Howe Leather issue the company displayed good grace in accepting the terms of the understanding, which will bring to an end the harassment inflicted on the company over the past four years. Last year after this agreement was reached, the managing director of Howe Leather, Mr Anton Mayer, was able to bring a totally positive quarterly report to his workers. He was able to report their first full year in the black since this debacle began in 1996. Group sales were around $200 million. The before tax profit was $12 million, and the automotive trim division, which is responsible for more than 70 per cent of their business, was increasing orders to at least $170 million a year for the next five years. This year they expect to process at least 1.5 million hides with 92 per cent of them exported to the big players of the international automotive industry. Of course, those hides come from our agricultural industry, and there is no doubt that, whilst the Howe company is doing well, it also puts a very strong base to our hide and pelt industry in Australia and it shows that we can produce very good quality leather. Ford, General Motors, BMW, Honda, Mazda and Subaru, big players in the international automotive industry, are all taking orders from Howe Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24709 Leather. This year it will also include the US cars of Mazda’s Tribute, GM’s Pontiac Aztec and Ford’s Escape. Such successes for both Howe Leather and countless thousands of other Australian small businesses and their contribution to our economy deserve to be assisted by the minor amendments arising from today’s bill. I again pay tribute to Bert Kelly, as I previously did. There is no doubt that his continued action to bring some sanity into the tariff debate has certainly proven to be one of those enduring policies that have taken over the minds and hearts of many of our decision makers here in Australia. I am pleased to hear that the Labor Party has agreed that a bipartisan approach will be taken on this matter. There has been a myth that tariffs protect industry; in fact, tariffs are a tax on consumers and that so-called protection leads to long-term inefficiencies, a lack of innovation and certainly an inability to compete on the world market. The member for Denison raised the problem of less developed countries and how free trade helps only to increase average wealth. He suggested that the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. That is an interesting statement to make; it is the sort of thing that people say. It ignores the fact that growth inevitably helps everyone. The alternative, of course, is not to have growth. ourable member opposite is talking about. does not have a lot to do with tariffs, but that has never stopped the Labor Party from making a story out of no facts at all. It is with pleasure that I support this bill. We should continue along this path so that we have industries that continue to grow and compete globally. There is no doubt that this sort of action will help that happen. Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000, I thank the honourable members for Denison and Barker for their contributions to the debate. The amendments in this bill have previously been tabled in the House of Representatives as customs tariff proposals. They now require incorporation into the Customs Tariff Act. Part1 of the schedule to the bill contains a number of unrelated amendments and is operative from 1 July 2000. The first of these amendments relates to preferential tariff treatment for developing countries. Following a review by the United Nations, Angola and Madagascar have been added to the list of least developed countries in part 3 of schedule 1 of the Customs Tariff Act. The effect of this change will be to accord, where possible, a five per cent tariff margin over the general rate of duty to imports from these countries. A further change acknowledges the renaming of Zaire to the Democratic Republic of Congo. As the member for Barker highlighted, the member for Denison was critical of this system of listing developing countries. In response, let me simply say that all this bill is doing is responding to a decision of the United Nations. It is not in any sense an occasion for a debate about the United Nations system. This part also implements the duty reduction on 30 tariff subheadings from five per cent to three per cent, as part of the settlement reached between Australia and the United Nations in the Howe Leather trade dispute. The final amendment contained in this part involves item 54 of schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act, which relates to the textiles, clothing and footwear import credit scheme. The member for Denison suggested that the Howe Leather dispute could have been handled better. That criticism is rejected, but this is not the occasion for de-",135,Representatives Main Committee

282,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (10.31 a.m.)-In closing this debate on the24710 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 bating that. What we are doing is responding, through this bill and the prior tariff proposal, to the resolution reached in the settlement between the two countries. The current wording of item 54 has been amended to reflect the administrative arrangements whereby import credits earned under the scheme may be used until 30 December 2001. Previously, the wording of item 54 only allowed the use of these credits until 30 June 2000. Part2 of the schedule, which is effective from 4 July 2000, contains an amendment to item 17 of schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2000. This item provides concessional entry for goods which have been exported from Australia and are subsequently reimported in an unaltered condition. The principle of the application of this concession is that duty is only payable on imported goods once and that the concession should not be used where a duty liability has not previously been acquitted. The current provisions of the item do not adequately reflect the original policy intent of the concession. The amendments are designed to clarify the intent that goods on which duties, taxes and charges of the Commonwealth have not been paid and on which drawback or refund of duties was not paid on exportation are excluded from the coverage of the item. Item 17A has been created to cover the situation where the returned goods contain components previously imported under the Tradex Scheme or the Manufacturing in Bond Scheme. The amendments provide for separate sets of entry conditions for each of a number of uniquely different import transactions. Part3 of the schedule contains further amendments to item 17 and 17A. These further amendments exclude goods that contain components which were excisable goods and on which excise duty was not paid. Part4 of the schedule, which is effective from 1 September 2000, reintroduces the five per cent duty rate on certain woven fibreglass fabric. The duty was removed from these goods from 15 December 1999 as part of the nuisance tariff exercise. The criteria used to identify nuisance tariffs were that the duty collected under an item was insignificant and that there was no local production of the goods covered by the item. The member for Denison was also critical of this in that it was going back on a previous decision. After extensive consultation with industry on a list of 268 nuisance tariff items, the proposal was created and the duty rate on these items was reduced from five per cent to free. Following the removal of duty on these 268 items on 15 December 1999, one local manufacturer wrote to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources seeking reinstatement of duty on one of the items, namely a certain woven fibreglass fabric. This was despite the extensive consultation with industry. As the original intent of cabinet was to remove tariffs only where there was no local production, the duty was reinstated with approval from Minister Minchin and Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Justice and Customs at the time, through Customs Tariff Proposal No. 6 of 2000 with effect from 1 September 2000. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 December 2000, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the bill be now read a second time. Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24711 for the second reading: That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ‘whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for putting in place an inequitable tax in the form of the superannuation surcharge which epitomises its lack of planning and series of poor decisions on superannuation’. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000 makes amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Superannuation Scheme, to make arrangements for the payment of the superannuation surcharge. The changes will allow members of the schemes who have taken their pension and have been levied with a surcharge debt after retirement to have the debt removed as a lump sum from their entitlement. That enables them to pay the debt as a lump sum, resulting in their pension being reduced over its lifetime to pay for the surcharge debt. This follows changes made in 1999 to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and regulations under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act that established this measure for the majority of superannuation members, so it needs to be understood that the arrangements that are being talked about here are already in force for other superannuation funds. We consider that these changes in themselves are uncontroversial, but it needs to be pointed out that the saga of the superannuation surcharge is a long tale of deceit, half-truths, pain, anger and waste. This is in fact the next instalment. We have had 15 pieces of legislation to get us to this point. We have had debates about what a tax is, about whether the government has broken its promises and about the efficiency of the collection of the tax. In a number of cases we have witnessed low income earners having to foot the bill for this tax. Labor will not be opposing this bill, which is about improving the capacity of certain members who are affected by the surcharge to pay the surcharge. I remind the parliament what a poor revenue measure this is. I also note that I, like everybody else in the parliament, have a vested interest in relation to this bill. It is often the case, as members would understand, that the surcharge assessment arrives well after the period in which it was accrued. This is not a problem whilst you have an active fund and the trustees can levy it against your entitlement, but when it arrives after you have left the fund, the bill still has to be paid. This piece of legislation, once it is passed, will allow the debt to be offset against your ongoing pension instead of your having to face a large, onceoff bill which you might not have the money to pay for. This will then result in the pension being reduced over its lifetime to pay the surcharge debt, easing the financial burden of payment on those members who are impacted on in this way. The superannuation surcharge was introduced in the 1996 budget, in direct breach of John Howard’s pre-1996 election promise not to introduce any new taxes or increase any existing taxes. When the surcharge tax was introduced, the Labor Party moved a range of amendments which were designed to improve the equity and fairness of the new tax. Unfortunately, despite Labor’s opposition in the Senate, the legislation passed through the Senate with the agreement and support of the Australian Democrats. As of August 1996 a superannuation contributions tax was applied to contributions made by or for members with contributions and income of more than $70,000 per annum. Contributions over the threshold attract an additional tax of 0.001 per cent per $1 of contributions in excess of $70,000, up to a maximum of 15 per cent in the case of contributions where income and contributions are $85,000 or more. The thresholds have been increased in line with inflation since that time. The alleged or stated purpose of the superannuation surcharge was to tax higher income earners. In fact, since its introduction, funds and the tax office have found that the surcharge",139,Representatives Main Committee
283,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.40 A.m.),"I move, as an amendment to the motion24712 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 tax collection method is inefficient and has resulted in increased fees and charges for all superannuation fund members, regardless of whether or not they personally have to pay the new tax. The reason it is inefficient is that it levies the superannuation fund for the tax. The fund has to administer this, which costs it money. That increases the administrative costs for the fund and those costs, in most cases, are paid for by all members. Even if they are not earning over $70,000 a year, they end up having to wear some of the impost, so it does impact on people earning less than $70,000. Another problem with the operation of the tax concerns instances where workers are on a base salary considerably lower than the threshold amount yet because they are earning extra money from overtime they are levied with the surcharge. You might think that is okay because they are actually earning over $70,000, but the problem for them is that they are only being paid the superannuation guarantee money on their ordinary time earnings rather than on the full amount. In extreme cases, you find that they are receiving the superannuation guarantee on only about half their total salary but are being required to pay the superannuation surcharge. Once again, the impact on retirement incomes for those people is substantially worse than it is for those who earn over $70,000 and get superannuation contributions on the full amount. As we pointed out at the time, so much for equity. In addition, some low and middle income earners have been forced to pay the tax because they have not provided their tax file number to their superannuation fund or to the tax office in the required time. That was a potential problem for up to 700,000 workers. In the end, the tax office issued 66,500 surcharge assessment notices to people who had not provided their tax file numbers to the tax office or to their fund. Knowing that many of those people would not be required to actually pay the surcharge, the tax office also issued a ‘get out of jail’ card to some 66,500 people, telling them that if they rang and told the tax office their tax file numbers they would be reassessed. All of this only occurred because of the cumbersome vehicle that was devised for the collection and assessment of the surcharge. With the tax office going around in circles like this, it has not been surprising that the surcharge tax has been a very inefficient tax in terms of cost of collection as against revenue raised. When the government introduced this measure, it was going to be levied on 355,000 people. It was expected to collect some $500 million in revenue. What happened in the first couple of years was a very sorry tale indeed, especially from a government that has tried to sell a message that it wants to reduce the tax collection costs and simplify the tax system for businesses. The amount that was collected showed that the tax was not very equitable at all. In fact, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA, conducted a survey of super funds and discovered that it cost them some $190 million to collect the surcharge from their members. That included set-up costs as well, but it was a cost that had to be borne by the funds and therefore came straight off everybody’s retirement incomes. If you add to that the fact that the tax office spent $23 million to collect the tax and set-up systems to do so in the future and that a further $3.4 million was spent by DOFA, you end up with a cost to the country of around $230 million to collect the superannuation surcharge. It must be world’s worse practice in terms of tax collection. Reports of these costs were brushed aside. Senator Kemp, who is responsible for explaining such government successes as the ‘no GST on high rollers’ and ‘why the surcharge is not really a tax’, told the Age back in 1999: The Government always recognised the surcharge would involve some cost to the industry. It certainly did. The government was in the happy situation of knowing that someone else would do their work. This is the government which has made a skill and a virtue of offloading its administrative work to others, to which any small business owner who spent January laWednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24713 bouring over the BAS-engaged in unpaid tax collection on behalf of the government-rather than at the beach with their families can attest. The funds also found that, while they had an increased administrative burden because of the tax, they also had an increase of around 28 per cent in complaints and inquiries arising from the surcharge. So the government managed to outsource the administration and the explanation of the problem to superannuation funds. Notwithstanding all this effort on collection and assessment, the ATO got rather short of its expected revenue. In 1996-97 it issued $454 million worth of notices. It only got $347 million by 30 June 1998, although the expected income was in fact later increased. There was an inquiry into the surcharge by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia and in October 1999 it released the results of that investigation. It stated: ... the surcharge does not deliver well targeted equity. Administrative costs are so high that all fund members, not just those with surchargeable contributions, are adversely affected-survey evidence reveals that most funds spread the administrative costs of the tax across all fund members. An alternative approach to addressing equity in the taxation treatment of superannuation saving is to integrate it with personal income tax. Interestingly, this was a similar recommendation to the one made by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in its inquiry into the tax. The majority of that committee’s members, the Labor opposition and the Australian Democrat senators, recommended that ‘an alternative collection mechanism utilising group certificates be adopted and that the advance instalments system not be adopted’. They said: As the surcharge Bills are currently framed every single superannuation member will pay-through high administration costs and lost opportunities to funds for long-term investment-for the inefficiencies of a collection mechanism that is targeted at only approximately 350,000 people. So we really do have to ask: why couldn’t the government find a more efficient way of collecting this tax? The answer was simply that they wanted to support or prop up a furphy-a spurious argument that this was not a tax but a surcharge. They wanted to make the case that, because they had promised not to introduce any new taxes or to increase any taxes, this was something else, a surcharge. This was similar to the Prime Minister on core and non-core promises or ‘We’re going to halve your small business red tape by 50 per cent’ or ‘Petrol taxes won’t rise as a result of GST’. It was the government trying to argue that the tax was a surcharge, black is white and it snows in summer. On that front, Senator Kemp said: ... a tax can be defined as a compulsory unrequited payment demanded by government for its support. A surcharge can be defined as an additional charge. It can be a charge on an existing tax which is applied in a particular circumstance. If you do not understand that, you are not alone. The Senate required the government to relent on this matter. It is worth asking-and many will ask-what Labor thinks about the surcharge and what our intentions for it are. We have said that the surcharge forms part of an array of superannuation taxes, including contributions taxes, and that the best way of addressing this issue, which goes to questions of simplicity of the superannuation system, is to have a proper review with a view to producing a long-term and, ideally, bipartisan outcome. We have endeavoured to persuade the government to do this through the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and we supported the Democrat terms of reference accordingly. Unfortunately, the government was not prepared to agree to this and the Democrats themselves backed away from those initial terms of reference. So we have not been able to get up that long-term bipartisan review of superannuation which should go to issues of simplifying the superannuation system. We regret the fact that the government has not been prepared to do that. Notwithstanding that, we have had the odd tease-Peter Costello talking the day after the last budget at the National Press Club about reviewing superannuation, and Prime Minister Howard suggesting this could be an agenda item for the no-agenda cabinet meeting held late 24714 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 last year. It is now blindingly obvious that the government is not prepared to do anything in the nature of a review of superannuation prior to the next election. It is engaging in a review of the superannuation legislation, as is required by the National Competition Policy arrangements, but it has been at pains to show, in announcing that review which has been carried out by the Productivity Commission, that it does not represent any change in the government’s position on superannuation and that the taxation arrangements for superannuation are not part of its terms of reference. We suspect that the Productivity Commission, looking at it through the prism of the National Competition Council, might endeavour to act as a stalking horse for the government’s choice agenda, which is not going very far. Setting aside that matter, it does seem that the Productivity Commission will not be looking at the real issues about superannuation in this country today-adequacy, simplicity, interaction with social security-and that is a matter for regret. In closing, I make reference to an amendment which has been circulated by the member for Calare, Mr Andren. I indicatetion in relation to that matter. I thank the parliamentary secretary for indicating that. In conclusion, we support the legislation that is before the House. We regret that it forms part of the government’s superannuation surcharge and the broken election promise that that represents, and we look forward to the opportunity to debate this matter again in the future. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (10.57 a.m.)-Given the proposed second reading amendment, I challenge the member for Wills to outline Labor’s policy on the super surcharge. What precisely is Labor proposing? What is its policy on the super surcharge? All that the member for Wills can say, in that lame way that is the hallmark of and besets the Labor opposition, is that Labor would like to review it. There is never a commitment to do anything. So while Labor condemns the government for its policies, it has not got the courage to say what it will do. I reject entirely the assertions about, and the motives attributed to, the government by the member for Wills upon which his proposed amendment is based. The government has taken some hard decisions to restore equity and fairness to superannuation, and none harder than the introduction of the super surcharge on contributions made by high income earners. SoI challenge the member for Wills: put up or put the amendment aside. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000 deals with aspects of the parliamentary contributory superannuation scheme and the consequences of the surcharge. That motivates the bill before the House today, and that is what I propose to deal with. In fact, the compulsory super scheme for members of parliament affords me the opportunity to speak about some of the issues that are facing retirees generally. All of us, men and women, have in common the fact that, barring misfortune, we all grow old, and barring great fortune, we all grow old on the income of retirement. Few of us would have the options available to Jean Paul Getty, who observed in his memoirs that-and I quote: ... at the age of 23 I was a millionaire and retired. Two years later I came out of retirement. A man in his twenties who has known what it is to work can only drink so much champagne and paint the town red only so many times before he wakes up to realise he is wasting time and energy. Very few of us would consider retirement at 24; fewer still would contemplate retirement on a Getty sized fortune. As we march into the 21st century we are all, young and old, going to have to consider how it is that we fund retirement. In the past 50 years, average life expectancy has increased from 46 to 66 years. By 2030, the number of people aged over 60 will have trebled from today’s figure.",141,Representatives Main Committee

287,Mr Sercombe,"I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24715 Globally, we are facing an ageing phenomenon. The massive general increase in the standard of living for all people, the gigantic steps taken in relation to disease and the breaking of the shackles of regular famine have worked to generate a looming demographic wave. To put in context the government’s commitment to the income needs of retirees, I make the following observations. In Australia, it is estimated that between the years 2012 and 2028 the number of people aged 65 years and older will grow four to five times faster than the total population. Of course, the ageing of Australia is partly a triumph of relative affluence and major advances in medical technology that have increased life expectancies and the quality of life for the aged. With respect to retirement, the vanguard is here now. The four million Australians born between 1946 and 1960, the baby boomers, begin hitting 55 this year. And 55 is no longer the young working age that it might once have been. Over the past century, the average retirement age has fallen steadily from 65 and now rests at 58 for men and only 51 for women. The average age of retirement for men and women has been falling steadily in almost every OECD country in the last 20 to 30 years. In fact, the private sector provides strong incentives for older workers to retire early. Combine that with an increased life expectancy and it can even threaten the retirement security of those who have saved on their own by forcing them to stretch their retirement savings over a longer period. The looming interest in how these retirements will be paid for concerns not only the potential retirees but also their families, colleagues and other fellow taxpayers. It is, of course, an issue for all policy makers. An ageing population will prove somewhat of a pincer movement on public finances. As the population ages and an increasing proportion of people leave the work force, the taxation revenue accessible by government declines, as well as the productive capacity of the economy more generally. At the same time the demand for government assistance to meet the financial requirements of retirees grows. Australia has much to be thankful for because, through a combination of careful consideration by those on both sides of the political fence and, some might suggest, some blind luck, we now have a superannuation system that is well placed to cater to these needs in the future. I was reminded of these issues by a recent presentation by Mr Andrew Mohl, the Managing Director of AMP Financial Services. The presentation was titled, ‘Rich, Retiring and Raring to Go’. It was a most interesting consideration of the issues facing policy makers and financiers in the new century. I am certainly indebted to his work for many of the quite remarkable statistics that I have cited. I remind the member for Wills that this government has done much to bolster and improve the superannuation system in anticipation of the demographic wave that is to come. It has introduced retirement savings accounts. It has, despite continuing and self-interested opposition from the Labor Party, sought to introduce real choice in superannuation. It has initiated the spouse rebate, enabling a contributing spouse to receive an 18 per cent rebate, capped at $540, for contributions made on behalf of an eligible spouse. That is a particularly important development for women who spend time outside the paid work force. The government has provided small business owners with capital gains tax relief in retirement. It has allowed for contributions to be made until a contributor turns 70. It has reformed arrangements for selfmanaged trusts and has combined the prudential skill required for the regulation of banking, insurance and superannuation into a single entity, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-Retirement Commutations) Bill amends the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act, the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990 to, first, allow beneficiaries of the superannuation funds in question to commute their pension to meet any surcharge assessment issued after retirement or death. Secondly, it provides for a special appropriation for surcharge payments from the PCSS. In 24716 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 essence, the amendments are intended to bring these Public Service funds into line with private sector schemes. Since the amendment of the tax laws in 1999, all pension superannuation schemes, including private sector schemes, have been able to provide for post-retirement commutations for surcharge debts that might arise. As such, the legislation before us will allow former members of the PCSS and the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme to commute their scheme pensions to lump sums to meet surcharge assessments that might arise as a result of their membership. Once the relevant amendments have been made to the rules of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, former members will be able to make similar arrangements. Where a beneficiary does seek to commute their pension in this way and for this purpose, the lump sum benefit in question is forwarded to the tax office to pay the surcharge assessment. In turn, the beneficiary’s pension will be reduced over the life of the pension in order to recover the amount paid out by way of lump sum. Considering that post-retirement surcharge debts can be substantial, this reform will be of benefit to many of these beneficiaries at a moment of financial need. In fact, this benefit has encouraged many pension schemes to make similar provisions, including those pension schemes operated by the state governments. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000 also changes the means by which moneys are appropriated to the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust for the purpose of paying pre-retirement surcharge assessments. It is important to note that this change has no effect on the existing arrangements, which require that members of the PCSS have their benefits reduced on retirement to take account of any surcharge for which they are liable. As the member for Calare knows, any mention of the parliamentary super scheme is bound to prick up the ears of many Australians-and quite rightly-for there are reforms, I believe, that need to be made to the fund in order for it to better express the public’s wishes when it comes to the remuneration of MPs. Nonetheless, in this instance, the commutation option made available to the PCSS is, in fact, the same option available to any pension scheme whether public, private or otherwise. In conclusion, I reiterate my challenge to the member for Wills to outline Labor’s policyjust once, just now-on superannuation generally. What precisely is Labor proposing in relation to the surcharge and what is its actual policy? It is not good enough for Labor members to say that they want to review it because they have been saying that about everything-‘We will just review it.’ It is time for the member for Wills to have the courage to state Labor’s policy. I commend this bill to the chamber. Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000. I have decided to withdraw a planned amendment after having discussions with senior staff of the department, and I thank the parliamentary secretary for arranging that briefing. However, I still have a few concerns that need to be put on the record. The amendment I had proposed required the minister to provide the parliament with details of surcharge payments made out of the consolidated revenue fund for each year. I was prompted to move this amendment, as noted on page 8 of the Bills Digest, which states: Item 27 will ensure that after 1 July 2001 surcharge payments will be paid from a special appropriation. A special appropriation is a standing authority to appropriate money from consolidated revenue for a specified purpose, and does not require annual authorisation from Parliament. As a result of this amendment, that cost of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme becomes less transparent. I have no objection whatsoever to the main objective of the bill-to allow for part of a retiring member’s or senator’s superannuation entitlement to be commuted in order to pay off a surcharge assessment received after they have ceased to be members of the scheme. However, if we have the opportunity to make an aspect of the parliamentary superannuation scheme more",144,Representatives Main Committee
288,Mr Andren (Calare) (11.07 A.m.),"I want to put a few comments on the record about theWednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24717 transparent, I think we should take it. For the moment I accept the arguments put to me this morning that privacy issues are at stake here. I note the findings of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in its 1997 inquiry into the parliamentary superannuation scheme. At page 41 of its report, the committee concluded: There is a lack of transparency in parliamentary superannuation, and that this lack of transparency gives rise to much of the criticism of the PCSS. I have given notice to the House of my intention to introduce a private member’s bill, which I see as a step towards bringing parliamentary superannuation more into line with public standards and expectations, and the amendment that I had proposed was similarly designed to enhance transparency. I am sure it was not the government’s intention to reduce transparency with this bill, perhaps just an oversight. I note the department’s inclination to make the current budget reporting of the surcharge more transparent, while not divulging individual tax arrangements. However, given that we register assets on the public record, I wonder if the publication of surcharges is not a healthy thing to enable our employers, the people, to understand the true financial status of our elected representatives and the inappropriateness and generosity of the current parliamentary superannuation scheme, particularly for short-term members. The perception may arise some way down the track that this information is being kept from the public and I take the view that that is not desirable. For the moment, though, I accept the privacy argument and urge members to show good faith by seriously examining my private member’s bill when it is introduced. Such support would be a call for a full debate for that. Among other things, that bill will ensure details of surcharge payments will remain private for those taking advantage of the provisions I have detailed in the bill. Thank you. stration) (11.11 a.m.)-in reply-In closing the debate I would just like to comment briefly on the third version of the amendment circulated by the honourable member for Wills. I must say that the government was not notified of this particular amendment, and as we sat listening to the contribution of the honourable member opposite we had version one, then version two and then version three. FinallyI see that the version we now have is the version which is ultimately being moved by the honourable member for Wills. Some would say that the movement in the wording of the motion and the constant changing of the position of the opposition in relation to this mirrors their attitude to the superannuation surcharge. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been around for a while in the parliament and you would be aware that in 1996, following the budget, Labor said that it was going to support the surcharge. But it is interesting to note-and I want to place it on record again-that Labor opposed the superannuation surcharge in the Senate and voted against the third reading of the bill. I would like to quote what Senator Sherry had to say on 15 May 1997: I want to say again for the record that, in terms of what was originally described as a package of legislation relating to the surcharge, Labor would not support the third reading of these mattersSo had Labor succeeded in blocking the surcharge, the surcharge would not have been collected. The Labor Party huffs and puffs about equity. As the honourable member for Curtin mentioned in her contribution, the Labor Party has not told us what it plans to do with respect to the surcharge. The surcharge was an extraordinarily difficult and, in some areas, unpopular decision that the government brought in as a result of the government’s wish to bring equity to the system. So what the Labor Party has done is simply to promise a further review. In other words, it is going to put it off until such time as it acquires the Treasury benches-and we all hope, of course, that that is not going to be anywhere in the immediate future.",146,Representatives Main Committee
289,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Admini24718 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 So Labor’s record in respect of the surcharge is one of twisting and turning, one of hypocrisy, one of constantly changing it position. What it is prepared to doMr Kelvin Thomson-Have you phoned the Prime Minister’s office recently? Party is prepared to do anything and say anything with a view to attacking the government, with a view to gathering up those votes which Labor needs to attain office at the next election. Labor’s policy on this matter is very bad, it is inconsistent, it is hypocritical and it is constantly changing. Quite frankly the people of Australia simply do not accept that politicians should be able to take the flip-flop approach that we have seen today from the honourable member for Wills. The honourable member for Calare, in his contribution, referred to privacy issues. I want to thank the member for Calare for his comments on the transparency of the parliamentary scheme costs. I was pleased to be able to provide a briefing to him with respect to the amendment that he had proposed to move. I was pleased that, upon consideration, he accepted that that was not an appropriate way in which to proceed. Mr Deputy Speaker, when you look at the second reading amendment that is before the chamber, you will see that the opposition seeks to attack us for our alleged neglect of the retirement income needs of Australians. I want to agree publicly with the member for Curtin that the government’s record on superannuation has strengthened the retirement income future for Australians and that the Labor Party is once again completely wrong in relation to this matter. In closing the debate, I want to point out as well that the bill that is under consideration by the House today will give retired public servants and parliamentarians the same options for payment of post-retirement surcharge assessments as they have for pre-retirement surcharge assessments. These options will enable the surcharge to be paid and the pension benefits to be reduced accordingly. All superannuation schemes that provide for the payment of pensions are able to amend their rules to provide similar options for their retired members. This bill will put retired public servants and parliamentarians in the same position as members of most state schemes. I thank all honourable members who contributed to the debate on this bill. I reiterate that the government does not accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills. I commend the bill, in its original form, to the chamber. Amendment negatived.

A substantive amendment in the bill is to define the term ‘recklessness’ in a number of acts. While the Criminal Code contains a definition of ‘recklessness’, it does not account for a situation of an omission being reckless. The bill ensures that recklessness may occur where an omission is made; that is to say, where someone does not take any action. The bill also amends the Corporations Law. The amendments are to correct for changes in the location and format of provisions dealing with the criminal consequences for contraventions of civil penalty provisions made by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Act 1999, known as CLERP.

Items 171 and 172 commence when proposed amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, as contained in the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill No. 1 2000, which is currently before the Senate, commence. It ought to be noted that the Labor Party will be supporting this bill, unlike the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill No. 1 2000 or existing offences. The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill, on the other hand, changed several offences applying to superannuation laws from ‘fault liability’-meaning that the prosecutor had to prove intention-to ‘strict liability’, meaning that the person who breached the law had to give cause as to why they should not be prosecuted. The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill No. 1 caused some concern within the superannuation industry, primarily due to the assumption that applying the Criminal Code to superannuation legislation meant heftier penalties for superannuation fund trustees and officers. However, as seems to be the case with this bill, the penalties themselves are not changing but some offences are being ‘clarified’ as either fault or strict liability offences. It is a shame that the government did not, as they did not with the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill, manage to consult on this bill. Indeed, when the Assistant Treasurer was debating the FSLAB in the Senate, he wanted us to believe the unbelievable, that this government was a consultative one. He said: I know Mr Hockey very well and he, like myself, is a consultative minister. This, as I have said, is a consultative government. This is the government that has brought us the BAS debacle, the GST debacle, the petrol debacle-the whole works-and its ministers and backbenchers are now frantically running around the country saying, ‘We’ve learnt our lesson. We weren’t consultative before, but we are going to be consultative in future.’ This is a government which is diabolically poor in terms of its consultative processes and its ability and willingness to listen. The government was reckless because it said that the bill was non-controversial as it was simply to ‘codify’ existing practice. Of course, the question of whether we are codifying existing practice or changing the legislative arrangements is indeed like beauty in the eye of the beholder. The comments that I have received indicate that had the government been engaged in a better consultative process it might have been able to address these issues in the first place. In order to make up for the government’s own recklessness in this regard-and I use that term advisedly-I have spoken to a number of people in the industry, in superannuation in particular, to gauge their reaction to this bill. There is some concern about whether the bill 24720 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 imposes a new hardship on superannuation trustees, but the general view of the superannuation industry is that safeguarding members’ money is a legitimate, important and essential government objective and, therefore, this bill should be supported. I note that sometimes this government wants to say that superannuation trustees are only in it for themselves, but I can assure the House that superannuation trustees take their responsibilities extremely seriously indeed. I want to put on the record technical points that have been raised with me by the Corporate Superannuation Association in particular, and I hope that I will receive a response from the government to them. Section 175 relates to section 68(1) of the SI(S) Act and deals with acts of victimisation of trustees. The omission of ‘intentionally or recklessly’ creates a question as to whether the person intended to commit what is a crime. In large organisations, a person can be made redundant without knowledge of the person’s position as a director of a trustee, yet it would seem that could be by definition victimisation. To victimise someone, you must at least know, or should have known, that you were doing it. I would be interested in the government’s response to this concern. In relation to sections 192 and 193, concern has been expressed that a fund can innocently become a public offer fund if it inadvertently accepts a contribution from a person and is not authorised to do so. On one reading of the act, a person would have committed an offence, even if he or she was not aware that the status of the fund had changed. In these cases it has been suggested to me that there should be a requirement for an intention to act contrary to the law or, at least, recklessness in that regard. The third technical issue that has been raised with me concerns section 214, which amends section 278(3) of the act. This change is a matter of concern to the Corporate Superannuation Association because it could easily involve an innocent person in an offence. It deals with the power of the regulator and others to conduct investigations in the presence of persons and to exclude those persons. It is an offence to be present, even if you thought you were entitled to be. This raises a serious issue about the right to be represented, and the intention would appear to be to exclude or limit the availability of legal representation when interrogations are being conducted. I hope that the government is listening to these issues because, while Labor will not be opposing the bill, we would like serious consideration of the issues raised. I also bring to the attention of the House for its benefit some of the background to the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Of course, this legislation is about the application of the Criminal Code and it is something that we are seeing in a variety of bills coming through the House. The Criminal Code Act 1995 deals with principles of criminal responsibility. It originated in the Model Criminal Code project, which itself developed out of the 1990 recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, headed by Sir Harry Gibbs. That recommended that there be uniform principles of criminal responsibility throughout Australia. In 1990, the question of the development of a model criminal code for Australia was placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, which then established a committee, called the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, to develop that model code. The final report of that committee, General principles of criminal responsibility, was the basis of the Criminal Code Act 1995. It is intended to codify the principles of criminal responsibility so that they deal with matters such as fault, burdens of proof and absolute and strict liability. The code has had a staggered implementation timetable, so it has been applying to all new offences from January 1997 and is scheduled to apply to pre-existing offences from 15 December this year. So this bill forms part of that implementation process, amending the criminal offence provisions administered by Treasury to bring them into line with the Criminal Code in readiness for the 15 December start-up date. Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24721 Traditionally, crimes have been analysed in terms of what is known in Latin as the actus reus, the guilty act, and the mens rea, the guilty mind. In the code, these elements are called physical elements and fault elements and to establish guilt it must be proven that the relevant physical and accompanying fault elements existed. The code defines the physical element of an offence to be the conduct, the circumstances in which it occurs or the consequences of the conduct. An omission to act can be a physical element if there is appropriate statutory provision or if it is the result of a breach of duty to act. Each element must contain at least one of these physical elements, but any combination of physical elements may be present in an offence provision. One of the things which is often misunderstood in this area is the difference between strict liability offences and absolute liability offences. Where a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact is available, that sort of offence is called a strict liability offence. Where the proof of intent is dispensed with entirely-that is, you have no defence of mistake of fact available-these offences are designated as absolute liability offences. So, through this code, the terminology of strict and absolute liability offences is being used consistently, whereas in the past that has not always been the case. As I indicated before, the opposition will not be opposing the bill. We would like consideration of the issues that I have raised in the course of the debate-issues which have been raised with me by the Corporate Superannuation Association-and we look forward to the government’s response in due course. tion of Criminal Code) Bill 2000 relates to the harmonisation of the Criminal Code through a whole range of government activities. It means that both the principles and detail of the Criminal Code will apply, in not only the area of Treasury activity but also Customs, Social Security and a whole range of government activity. I think it is one of the most far-reaching decisions on reform of the legal system that this government has undertaken. It is a very significant process and one that will dispense with the inconsistencies that have arisen between departments applying different principles, different understandings and different penalties to various areas where people contravene the requirements of the various acts. One of the stranger things in the way in which the law in Australia has developed is that it is the responsibility of each department-and the minister, of course-to apply the appropriate penalties and principles which they wish to see observed in their particular acts. To my knowledge, the first one off the rank is the Treasury legislation amendment, with the application of the Criminal Code and the harmonisation of the Criminal Code with Treasury matters. The code was passed in 1995. There have been amendments and discussions of various chapters of the code. It commenced in January 1997, and all new offences are now drafted according to the requirements of the code. I think this is desirable, but it will take some time. There will be a staggered approach to the changes because I am informed that it is not possible for Treasury or any other department to think through all the required changes at one time. I believe that the government should be commended for these decisions. The previous speaker talked about consultation. The Attorney-General has been very assiduous in consulting with not only the community but the parliament. I draw the attention of the House to the advisory report on the Criminal Code amendment bill 1999 and the advisory report presented to the parliament by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That is a matter on which the parliament itself was consulted in the application of the Criminal Code and its definitions. That committee made a number of recommendations in regard to the Criminal Code which will apply and which are part of the whole process of law reform. The members of the Labor Party who were involved in that advisory report were Duncan Kerr, Kirsten Livermore and John Murphy. They were all involved in that consultation. I point out that there has been significant consultation with a very broad range of people and that the",148,Representatives Main Committee
292,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (11.30 A.m.),"The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Applica24722 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 Attorney-General himself believes that the opinion of the parliament should be sought. If the previous speaker is so interested in these matters, he should make it a personal crusade to join the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. He would then be consulted personally on every detail when changes of this type were being made. He has only himself to blame if he now complains that there was no consultation. The code as we have it contains subjective, fault based principles of criminal responsibility. The defendant’s guilt will depend on what he or she thought or intended at the time of the offence rather than what a reasonable person would have thought or intended in the defendant’s circumstances. The changes to be brought about by the code reflect the view that proof of a guilty mind is generally necessary before a person can be found guilty of an offence. That is an issue that came before the House of Representatives standing committee. I noticed in one of its recommendations it deals with those very issues. The first recommendation of the committee to the government was that the offence of general dishonesty in the Criminal Code not be proclaimed until the Attorney-General and the committee are satisfied by the Director of Public Prosecutions that prosecution guidelines will ensure the proposed offence of general dishonesty will be applied appropriately. Those are the sort of principles and issues that are dealt with in this legislation. The code clarifies the traditional distinction between the physical act now referred to in this legislation as the physical element and the defendant’s thought or intended act which is the fault element. The distinction is set out in the code. The prosecution bears the onus of proving each of the physical elements. The physical elements provided in the code are the conduct, the circumstances in which it occurs and the result of the conduct. Each offence must contain at least one of these physical elements but any combination of physical elements may be present in any offence provision. In the examination undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs there has been the attraction of computer crime and the selling of databases and information-something which can be done with almost negligible physical involvement. The value of intellectual property and the way in which it is handled is something that has been exercising the mind of that committee. The code’s relationship to that process and privacy are complex issues which are being handled and dealt with in a planned and proper way by the government. I want to commend the Attorney-General and in this instance the Treasury for the way in which this is being done. It is systematic. It is slow, one would say, but they are significant changes that have to be done with great care, otherwise there will be ongoing concerns in regard to the application of the code. I confess that this is a very straightforward proposal. I came today prepared for what I thought would be a stinging attack by the Australian Labor Party on the goods and services tax and the BAS report. I saw Mr Thomson’s name on the list, and he never fails to vilify or criticise the government for its change to taxation. Because this is a Treasury bill, a fairly broad inference, I rather suspected that he would do that today. I am delighted he has not, which seems to indicate to me that the changes that the government has introduced have been some that have met with his approval and the approval of the Australian Labor Party. I will not let this opportunity go unremarked upon because it has been a consistent approach of the government’s opponents to move an amendment of a broad ranging nature and then speak on any issue whatsoever that comes to mind, particularly if they can vilify the government generally or vilify the government on its changes to taxation. That has not occurred today, and I am a little at a loss because I have come with wonderful material to refute those attacks. As you know, I have heaps of material to come back with on behalf of the government. I believe all of the opposition’s arguments on the BAS and the GST are absolute concoctions. When you get out in the community and you look at what people are actually Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24723 dealing with day-to-day, week-by-week, you would have to say that those in the Australian community have coped with these changes with a great deal of expertise and professionalism. They have been well advised by the accounting profession. I would also like to pay tribute to the Australian Taxation Office for the way in which it has supported those people. The situation that was expected has not eventuated. I notice that the minister who introduced this legislation is still with us. I want to compliment him for his work in this area because there is a need for the Australian community to be absolutely certain that the government will be unrelenting in bringing to justice those people who seek to abuse the processes of Treasury-whether it be superannuation or corporate law or any other area where finances are related. I note that the New South Wales Auditor-General, Tony Harris, made comments about the application of ethics to Australian business. I also note comments made within the last 12 months by Paul Barry in the Age concerning Alan Bond and his activities. Some of those comments are extremely critical and I do not intend to read them, but the fact of the matter is that Australians do not like people taking advantage of their wealth or their position and abusing a system that the average Australian has to live by. So whether it is the Auditor-General in New South Wales, whether it is the Commonwealth Auditor-General or whether it is the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, I think that they all have a duty. I want to thank the minister for pursuing his duty. I think he is the first minister to actually apply the Criminal Code in its changed form. I want to congratulate him for pursing the matter because it is a very important area that we have the Criminal Code applied to, and it is very important for it to be applied in the way that he is applying it. This will flow right through the activities of government. It is something that will bring consistency and an approach which will make it easier for prosecution, but it will also make it easier for people to be assured that the government will pursue criminal activity. Whether it be theft, fraud, bribery or other related offences of any type, this government will pursue them. I want to thank the House for the opportunity to commend the government on these changes. In conclusion, I note an article, which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 9 February, about fleecing the government. It speaks about the way in which the processes can be subverted by people with finance or with schemes. This is part of the government’s armoury, and I want to congratulate the government for introducing this legislation. tion of Criminal Code) Bill 2000 amends a variety of legislation to create a consistent position on the application of strict liability in criminal offences. I want to concentrate on part of one piece of legislation which is involved with this amending legislation for which I have responsibility, which is part V of the Trade Practices Act. PartV of the act, of course, contains the consumer protection provisions that were put in place many years ago by the former Labor government and for which these amendments apply with respect to the criminal penalty provisions. The amendments endeavour to identify the fault elements in each offence specified and to ensure that there is a clear definition of what defences are available. In particular, it is important to note it is implied that, for the various offences to which strict liability applies, there is no requirement to demonstrate deliberate intention on the part of the accused to defraud, or whatever the case might be. However, mistake of fact is a defence to the charges involved. I certainly support the strengthening and the introduction of some degree of uniformity of treatment of these kinds of provisions in various pieces of legislation. The federal opposition does accept the need to amend the Trade Practices Act to insert some degree of uniformity and certainty with respect to these kinds of offences. But I would",151,Representatives Main Committee
293,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (11.43 A.m.),"The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Applica24724 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 like to mention some related matters associated with the application of consumer protection at the federal level that apply to both the content and administration of the legislation. Firstly, there is an inadequacy in part V of the Trade Practices Act that certainly any future Labor government will be examining closely. It is the inability to pursue civil penalties for breaches of part 5 of the Trade Practices Act. This can be done under part IV of the Trade Practices Act, which deals with anticompetitive behaviour-retail price maintenance, mergers, monopolies and the like-but it is not available under part V. One of the issues that should be kept in reserve for potential future consideration, should we some day have a Labor government, is the question of whether indeed there is a need for a civil penalty regime to be inserted into part V. That would have knock-on consequences for the amendments that are being introduced today. The question of strict liability in fact may be appropriately moved to a civil penalty regime, leaving a criminal penalty regime based on the traditional intention test that applies to most criminal acts. I am simply raising that for consideration. It is something that I have not formed a complete view on as yet, but I think it is a weakness in the current legislation. Currently, if the ACCC wishes to pursue a matter under part V, it has to engage the services of the DPP, who of course have a variety of other pieces of legislation and responsibilities to deal with, many of them of much greater moment than relatively small and limited prosecutions with respect to consumer protection matters. It would potentially streamline the execution of consumer protection prosecutions and the pursuit of malefactors if the ACCC had the potential to pursue some form of civil prosecution. It is pleasing to see that the government and the minister are doing something to improve our consumer protection provisions, albeit with a fairly limited change and one that is being done for the purposes of getting some uniformity and consistency into the way that these matters are dealt with. It is perhaps appropriate to contrast this with other aspects of the government’s record in the consumer affairs area, which include abolishing the position of the Minister for Consumer Affairs, downgrading the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to a very small division of the Treasury and cutting its staff to a very tiny number, and slashing funding to consumer affairs organisations-which of course play a vitally important role in the community of pursuing consumer affairs issues and ensuring that there is a capacity for an independent public voice to put pressure on companies and organisations that provide goods and services to the community. There is no doubt that there are number of areas where reform of consumer affairs legislation and reform of the actions of government are required in this country. Unfortunately, the government’s track record in dealing with these matters has been largely regressive. I will quickly cite a couple of examples by way of illustration. The government has tried to remove the composition requirements for a variety of popular foodstuffs, such as meat pies, jam and ice cream. These products are ones that traditionally, in order to use their names, had to have a minimum composition requirement. To use meat pie, for example, you had to have at least 25 per cent meat in the pie. If you wanted to call something jam, it had to consist of at least 40 per cent fruit. The government tried to get rid of these composition requirements but fortunately the states-and not only the Labor states but some then conservative government states-jacked up and prevented that change from occurring. The government tried to water down the position adopted by the states at the council of health ministers with respect to the labelling of products containing genetically modified organisms. The government tried to weaken the position being adopted by the council of health ministers with respect to compulsory nutritional labelling panels on products. Again, thankfully, the states-not only the Labor states-forced the government to back down. In spite of the bravado shown in press releases and answers to questions by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who is present in the chamber, the government has failed to tackle the banks about issues such as disclosure of fees on ATMs. When the banks finally Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24725 started to move, it then tried to claim the credit for having initiated this move, which was entirely inappropriate. The government has failed to do anything at all about new consumer ripoffs that are emerging in the Australian economy in areas that have been dubbed the new economy-contracts associated with Internet service provision, mobile phones and various other information economy services, where we are seeing new kinds of rip-offs emerging which are not necessarily susceptible to being dealt with by existing legislation. We are seeing unconscionable contracts and ultra hard selling techniques being imposed in some cases on vulnerable people. I have had one example drawn to my attention of an intellectually disabled man who was sitting at an outdoor café in my electorate, who had somebody approach him and ask him if he would like a mobile phone. He then signed something and had committed himself to spending $400 on a contract to get a mobile phone, when clearly he was not fully aware of the nature of the undertakings to which he was signing up. Numerous other examples have been drawn to my attention of people entering mobile phone contracts with hidden fees that are not disclosed until after the contracts have been signed. There is a variety of that the ACCC is concerned about these things as well. There are a variety of abuses emerging and, because of the complexity of contracts which we are now seeing emerge in areas like mobile phone and Internet provision, it means that people in some instances are more vulnerable to being ripped off than they are with the provision of traditional goods and services which will not necessarily be provided in respect of such complex contracts. We are also seeing an emergence of fairly unscrupulous behaviour by telephone companies that is designed to maximise their market position. For example, if you wish to change your telephone company, then things can occur such as happened to a constituent of mine when he was arbitrarily disconnected almost instantaneously as a result of indicating that he wished to change his provider. Because he ran a small business, that had a devastating impact upon him for a number of days. It was only because of my office’s intervention that the phone company rectified what it had done. There was no reason for the disconnection; it was purely an action associated with his desire to switch from one provider to another. There are some good reasons why we need to contemplate amending part 5 of the Trade Practices Act to outlaw unfair contracts. The existing unconscionable contracts provision may not go far enough in dealing with particular kinds of grossly unfair and unequal contracts which, for example, give a provider of a particular service-for example, a mobile phonethe capacity to cancel the contract at any time and to retain any fees that are payable without any indication of any mitigation of the damage to the other party involved in the contract. That is just one illustration of some of the extremely unfair contracts that are out there. We have also seen a substantial delay in the introduction of portability of mobile phone numbers in this country, in contrast to the situation in a number of other OECD countries, where portability of numbers from phone provider to phone provider is now an established fact. We still do not have it in Australia. That, of course, inhibits competition, choice and the ability of individual consumers to move from one provider to another in order to get a better deal. There have been a number of instances where this government, because it is basically not consumer friendly and it is aligned with some of the shonkier business interests around the place, has appointed so-called consumer representatives to boards when these people are entirely inappropriate to the position. We have seen a substantial public outcry about the appointment of a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, but there are numerous other examples of similar behaviour. For example, a Mr",153,Representatives Main Committee

295,Mr Tanner,"These matters have been referred to the ACCC, so you can rest assured24726 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 Frank Hoffman was appointed to the Claims Review Panel of the Insurance Complaints Service. His sole credentials for being in this position were that he was a former insurance broker and a former president of the National Insurance Brokers Association-somebody clearly from the industry side of the fence who has been appointed to this organisation to represent consumers. Yes, he knew, and presumably still knows, a great deal about the industry, but he is hardly an appropriate person to represent the interests of consumers. It is also noteworthy that the government very ostentatiously declined to reappoint Alan Asher, the former deputy president of the ACCC, who was in charge of consumer affairs responsibilities. He is an internationally renowned consumer advocate, internationally renowned person in the area of implementation of consumer affairs laws, and now has taken up a prestigious international position. The government has taken no action on the emerging issue of people encountering enormous phone bills, often through no fault of their own, because there are no limits on the high cost phone accounts as there should be, as there are on credit cards. A number of examples have been brought to my attention. For example, a younger brother had got hold of his brother’s phone and run up $10,000 worth of fees on sex lines. In another example, people have run up $20,000 worth of fees on chat lines. In some instances, people do not even know what sort of fees they are incurring. The phone might be used without the person’s knowledge and they are liable for these fees. There is no mechanism to ensure that, at the very least, there is some sort of warning light that flashes up and says, ‘Hey, you are spending an awful lot of money. You should think about it.’ There is nothing like the limit that we have on credit cards which is designed to prevent people from spending way beyond their means. These sorts of examples are starting to become quite widespread. I was at a meeting in Sydney of ordinary ALP members only a few weeks ago and somebody asked me a question about this-I was not talking about consumer affairs issues; I was talking about general issues. Somebody who works in the Campbelltown area stood up and asked me a question about this very problem. He said that he knew of a number of instances of people who had been caught with huge bills, which were simply impossible for them to pay because there was no mechanism for establishing a limit on their phone use for these purposes. This is clearly a growing issue that needs some action from the government, but as yet we have not seen any indication of an acknowledgment that the issue actually exists. Finally, the government has been pretty weak on the question of e-commerce and the prevention of spamming, which is electronic junk mailserious problems around the rest of the world. Essentially, it has caved in to the interests of major businesses who want to be able to spam people, who want to be able to send electronic junk mail, and it has got a very weak position. It does not ensure that consumers have access to the actual costs that they are incurring as a result of the volume of spamming that they are receiving. is some intervention at all.

Finally, all of these issues are mattersMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-Member for Melbourne, you must use the appropriate title in the House, not personal names. You addressed the minister, so please use the minister’s title. Deputy Speaker. All of these issues that I have raised today are classic examples of the government’s failure to deal with consumer issues. It is quite interesting that I have run through about eight or 10 of them and the minister has actually got fired up in response to say, ‘No, it’s not true’ once. Presumably, we can assume from his silence on all the other matters that he actually concedes that all the other charges are accurate. He finally disagrees with me on one point, so perhaps we can have a debate on that, and all the other points have been proven. All of these things are matters on which the federal government needs to act, needs to take some sort of action on and which a Labor government will take action on the minister’s statements, on the question of ATMs. It is there in black and white. The policy was adopted at our Hobart national conference in July 2000 requiring disclosure of ATM fees. The minister accused us of having no position on that. It is simply untrue. The issues that are raised by this legislation raise broader questions of the appropriateness of the enforcement mechanisms with respect to consumer affairs issues in this country. I have adverted to the fact that a Labor government will examine the question of civil penalties as a possibility for part 5 of the Trade Practices Act. I think it is very important that we examine that particular issue and endeavour to correct that problem. The Labor Party has a very long and honourable history on consumer protection in contrast to the conservative parties. The Trade Practices Act is a monument to the late Senator Lionel Murphy, former Attorney-General, who put strong consumer affairs provisions in place in the 1970s. But the world has moved on. We now have a very different economy. We have a whole variety of new contractual arrangements, new goods and new services, which are not necessarily similar in content to the typical kinds of goods and services and contracts of the 1970s. So there is a case for improving and updating the regulatory regime, ensuring that people cannot be ripped off, ensuring that we do have proper consumer protection in our society and ensuring that, where there are problems that ordinary people are suffering as a result of the shonky behaviour of some businesses, they do have some form of redress. This government has abolished the ministry of consumer affairs and got rid of the Bureau of Consumer Affairs and shifted it into a tiny little cubby hole in Treasury, radically downgrading its resources. It has failed to act on a whole variety of significant consumer affairs problems, particularly emerging problems that are a consequence of changes in our economy and the introduction of the information economy-the Internet, mobile phones and a variety of other services. It is not interested in acting because, ultimately, it is beholden to interests that are out there trying to rip consumers off. For that reason, it will require a Labor government to take action for consumers. A Labor government will not be appointing a former head of the insurance brokers’ organisation to represent consumers in the industry. A Labor government will not be appointing a former industry lobbyist from the pharmaceutical industry to represent consumers on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

In particular, the bill defines the term recklessness as including acts of omission. That is, recklessness may occur when an omission is made where someone does not take action. Although the bill amends a range of acts administered by the Treasurer, I note that it does not amend the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980, which is aimed at the use of entities to avoid tax. It was introduced in 1980 at the height of the notorious bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and the paper rorts, the Curran schemes and the wet and dry Slutzkins. The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act not only relates to those who are directly involved, such as directors, shareholders and trustees, but includes those who have devised schemes that breach the act and advise taxpayers to utilise those schemes. Offences under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act are created by entering into so-called arrangements or transactions. The term ‘arrangement’ is used in part IVA of the Income Tax Act, the general anti-avoidance rule. The Prime Minister boasts that as Treasurer he introduced that general anti-avoidance rule. But he did so only in response to heavy and sustained pressure from Labor and a telephone book of advice from the tax office begging him to legislate. Nothing has changed. Liberal governments act on tax avoidance only when the revenue leakage becomes so massive and the pressure from Labor so great that they can no longer cover up the scams. The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act relates not only to the corporate and trustee beneficiaries of contrived tax avoidance schemes but also to the designers and those who aggressively market them. In particular, one of the offences under the act relates to persons involved in aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a person to enter into an arrangement or transaction. Under section 7(1) of that act, it appears that a director may be guilty of an offence if he or she abstains from voting or having the matter referred to the board where the result of a proposed transaction by the company will be a reduction in its capacity to meet its income tax liabilities. That is to say, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act appears to apply to an act of omission by a director, not just to an act of commission. Why, then, does the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill, which defines recklessness to include acts of omission, not extend to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act? I note that the second reading speech says: It is proposed to introduce a second bill in the spring sittings to make consequential amendments to taxation laws … which require consultation with the states. Let us hope that this is not another case of obfuscation by this government when it comes to anti-avoidance measures, because there has been plenty of that. Five times the government promised it would crack down on the use of trusts as tax avoidance vehicles. The National Party declared it would kill the proposal in cabinet, and the National Party has finally had a win over the Liberals, with the Treasurer’s humiliation completed when the announced in parliament yesterday that he had capitulated over the taxation of trusts as companies. Little wonder he was humiliated. Nine of his front bench colleagues have trusts. If the Treasurer had implemented this measure according to the timetable set out in the ANTS package before the last election, there would be no need for high petrol taxes. But the fact is that the Howard government never intended to crack down on the abuse of trusts. I refer to an article in the Australian of 24 September 1997, headed ‘Trusts safe from tax attack, PM tells troops’. It says: John Howard pre-empted a tax office review of trusts by promising yesterday that the government would not accept tax reforms that hurt small business. The Prime Minister gave his assurance in re-",157,Representatives Main Committee

Sources said yesterday there had been widespread concern within government ranks about Mr Carmody’s speech, which argued there was a strong case for some or all trusts to be taxed in the same way as companies. Mr Howard’s comments were believed to have appeased MPs who feared the government was planning a major crackdown on trusts... Mr Carmody was believed to have checked with Mr Costello’s office before delivering his contentious speech on trusts. In his speech he revealed that one wealthy individual was able to collect $19 million tax free through trusts in one year. Another collected $5 million a year tax free over three years. ‘Is that a fair system? Is it one that has integrity? Are they not reasonable questions for us to raise?’ he saidhe being the tax commissioner, Mr Carmody. The article goes on to say: A large number of Liberal and National Party MPs also use trusts themselves. It is pretty clear that the Prime Minister has never had much stomach for cracking down on trusts. The government’s trick is to boost the bottom line by pretending that it is going to crack down on trusts, and tax avoidance more generally, but never actually getting around to doing it. The Treasurer claims now that his backdown on trusts has only got minor revenue impacts, despite this advice by the tax office in its latest annual report, in the chapter titled ‘Aggressive tax planning’: The ATO expects that the government’s proposed systemic business tax reforms, such as the taxation of trusts like companies and the consolidation regime, will address major weaknesses in the current tax system. The government has completely ignored that tax office advice by backing down on the taxation of trusts and the whole entities regime. SoI ask: what business tax reforms is the tax office referring to? Sure, the government has cut the company tax rate, but when it has come to repairing the base to pay for the cut in the company tax rate the government has broken its promises and reneged on just about every commitment given to the parliament. The Treasurer promised he would deliver the so-called integrity measures on time and in full. He broke his promises and in doing so he has lost all integrity. He watered down his commitments on the alienation of personal services income. He watered down his commitments on non-commercial losses. He abandoned his commitment to tax widely held trusts as companies, then he abandoned taxing any fixed trusts as companies and now he has abandoned his commitment to tax family trusts as companies. Why has he failed to deliver on another of his promised integrity measures-a toughening of the general anti-avoidance rule? The new general anti-avoidance rule is supposed to operate from the date of its announcement, 11 November 1999, more than a year ago, but we have not seen any legislation and we have seen precious little detail. How can it operate at law from 11 November 1999 when noone really knows what it is? So why the big delay in rewriting part IVA of the Income Tax Act? The Treasurer does not want to offend his supporters, the high flying tax cheats at the big end of town. The Treasurer’s performance in relation to tax avoidance through executive share schemes has been disgraceful. As shadow Treasurer he said he would oppose Labor’s legislation to outlaw the abuse of employee share ownership schemes by company executives, ‘root and branch’. He boasted about blocking Labor’s anti-avoidance legislation three times, declaring ‘three strikes and you are out’. I refer to our report on employee share ownership plans, which says: Treasury began warning against a proliferation of employee share schemes involving aggressive tax planning for company executives as early as the beginning of 1994. In an executive minute of 12 January 1994, Treasury advised the previous Labor government that employee share acquisition schemes, involving salary sacrifice for the acquisition of share options, were being marketed to avoid FBT. The minute identified the Remuneration Planning Corporation as one of the companies that appeared to be 24730 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 “ahead of the pack” but warned that the big fund managers would be quickly into the field to protect their competitive positions if the government were to decide that the trend towards new generation arrangements should not be curtailed. The minute went on to advise that no-one was “able to say how significant this trend might become but the industry says that it could envisage amounts in the billions of dollars being channelled through these sorts of arrangements”. That is what led Labor to act and that is the legislation that Labor introduced, which was opposed three times by the present Treasurer. The opposition of the then shadow Treasurer, the present Treasurer, to the attempts of the Labor government to close these tax rorts followed intense lobbying by the promoters of the schemes and members of the business community. So the Treasurer, as I said earlier, is obviously a friend of the tax cheats. Belatedly and only prospectively has he decided to legislate against the use of offshore superannuation schemes by company executives as tax avoidance vehicles. These superannuation rorts and the other main form of abuse of executive benefit arrangements, executive share schemes, have been likened by the tax office to the infamous paper rorts of the late seventies and early eighties to which I referred earlier. The Second Commissioner of Taxation said: ... some of the arrangements that have emerged over recent years smack very much of the ingredients that were tax avoidance paper scheme rorts of the 1970s and early 1980s. The Treasurer finally legislated against the abusive executive superannuation schemes when the revenue leakage became too embarrassing. He legislated against these schemes despite tax office advice that they are paper rorts and will therefore be caught by the general antiavoidance rule, part IVA. Yet he has steadfastly refused to legislate against the abuse of employee share ownership plans by company executives, using the excuse that they are caught too by the general anti-avoidance rule. I refer to the Treasurer’s answers in response to a number of questions raised in the parliament by the member for Lalor on 6 September last year. The Treasurer said: ... the advice of the Commissioner of Taxation is that those schemes which are avoidance schemes are contrary to part IVA, and part IVA will be enforced through the courts. He went on to say: The way in which those ones which were contrived or abusive could and should be handled would be under part IVA. The advice of the taxation commissioner was that they would be prosecuted through the courts, which is what will happen. Not one case has been to the courts. He answered in similar terms to questions from the shadow Treasurer: Again, our advice to the government has beenand he talked about the advice from the tax office that the general anti-avoidance rule would do the trick. Again in response to a question on 6 December, this time from the shadow Treasurer, the Treasurer said: He has advised this government that it is his view that the general anti-avoidance provisions enacted by this government are sufficient to deal with any avoidance schemes which are improper; and we intend to rely upon his advice. So he is sticking with, ‘Well, we’ll fix it up with part IVA,’ and on 6 December, in response to a question from the shadow Treasurer, he said the same thing. Labor has persistently asked this obvious question: if both types of executive rorts are caught by the general anti-avoidance rule, why has the Treasurer finally legislated against one type, the superannuation rorts, but not against the other, the executive share schemes? The Treasurer has had fair warning of the use of trusts as vehicles of tax avoidance in executive share schemes. In this respect, the dissenting report of the Labor members of the inquiry into Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24731 employee share ownership schemes refers to the passage of division 13A, which was opposed by the shadow Treasurer. The report goes on to say: Faced with the challenge of this new anti-avoidance legislationintroduced by Labor despite the protestations and opposition of the then shadow Treasurertax planners quickly began to contemplate new ways of abusing employee share schemes for company executives. As the ATO advised the Committee: Their focus swiftly fell on trust structures, which provided adequate potential to avoid the operation of the increasingly restrictive legislation … The schemes have been too numerous to individually outline their mechanics. However, they evolved to the point where promoters were claiming ‘total tax wipeouts’. That is the tax office warning about the use of trusts so very long ago, but the Treasurer is saying, ‘I am not going to do anything about it because as shadow Treasurer I opposed any legislation to deal with this problem. I opposed any legislation, so I don’t care that executives are using these trusts.’ And that has been his position all the way through: it will be caught by part IVA, the general anti-avoidance rule. But something happened last night. The Treasurer changed his position, but he got his Assistant Treasurer to announce it. Five years later, in the face of rampant tax avoidance by company executives using trusts as vehicles in their executive share scams, and contrary to the Treasurer’s repeated assurances that the general anti-avoidance rule would catch these cheats, the government sneaked out an announcement last night that it would, in fact, legislate. actually discussing the application of the Criminal Code under the Treasury legislation amendment, not issues dealing with entity taxation, which is what the member is raising.

Last night’s announcement made it clear that the acquisition value is the value when the shares or options were provided by the company to the trust. But any company executive who has been participating in these tax avoidance scams until 5 p.m. yesterday is let off. In fact, if they had advance notice of the announcement, they could have extended the date at which ownership of their shares or options is to be transferred to them from the trust, thereby avoiding capital gains tax well into the future. That is, if you were in the know, you can now legally do what until 5 p.m. yesterday was, by the Treasurer’s own admission, illegal. Even if you were not in the know about last night’s announcement, you can still escape paying capital gains tax for the balance of the period from 5 p.m. yesterday until the ownership of your shares or options is to be transferred from the trust to you. Participants in existing schemes only have to pay capital gains tax if they change the date of transfer of ownership of shares or options from the trust to the beneficiary. Last night’s announcement legalises the existing tax avoidance schemes of company executives that Labor has been warning the Treasurer about for five years. The Treasurer is a friend of the tax cheats. And what about those honest employees and company executives who have either already paid capital gains tax on their shares or options or fully expect to pay it in the future? Does last night’s announcement entitle those who have already paid to a refund of capital gains tax? And does it confer a windfall on those who fully expected to pay capital gains tax in the future? These are unresolved questions, but I can be confident of one thing: when the explanatory memorandum to the bill becomes available, the revenue impacts will be listed as nil or negligible. The Treasurer is either guilty of gross incompetence in the administration of the tax system or he is a friend of the tax cheats-or, more likely, both. p.m.)-in reply-We can all feel reassured after listening to the comments made by members of the opposition on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000. When there are people with the talent of the member for Reid on the front bench of the Labor Party, Australians can sleep easy. They should know that, should there, unhappily, be any change of government, people like the member for Reid will have their hands on the till. That is a good thing if, of course, you are very closely related to the member for Reid. Perhaps for most other people in Australia it is quite a frightening thought. And it is also quite a frightening thought that the member for Melbourne should ever occupy the position of finance minister and minister for consumer affairs, because today he gave us a snapshot of his commitment, or lack of commitment, to the consumer affairs portfolio. He gave us a critique of the government’s performance in this area, and it added nothing to the debate on the new role of consumer affairs in a modern economy. We in the Howard government developed the philosophy of consumer sovereignty. We in the Howard government gave it its four basic criteria: firstly, the opportunity for consumers to be fully informed; secondly, the opportunity for consumers to have choice about what they can invest in; thirdly, that consumers should be protected if they are victims in transactions; and, fourthly, that consumers should have appropriate redress. The Labor Party is interested only in one pillar of that platform-that is, consumer protection. They think that the simple solution to every problem is to smash it with a sledgehammer and therefore to rob individuals of their right to choice and to rob them of their right to exercise their individual freedoms.

I think he does think about things. But when it comes to consumer affairs issues, you ask him what he believes in and he cannot actually say what he believes in. He believes in helping someone who has inadvertently, quite obviously, signed a contract with a mobile phone supplier. I agree-I think that any caring person in this room or all members of parliament would think, ‘Yes, we should try to do what we can to help someone who might have inadvertently signed a contract with a mobile phone supplier.’ Yes, we believe in transparency and yes, we believe in accountability, but the solution of the Labor Party is to legislate it. The solution of the Labor Party is, ‘Let’s bring out the old sledgehammer and crack this nut.’ That actually has the effect of robbing consumers of choice and individual freedoms and liberties. So what we try to do on this side of the House is strike an appropriate balance. That is why, when so many countries around the world are struggling to understand the true impact of e-commerce and m-commerce on consumers, Australia has developed the first best practice model in the world for electronic commerce. It is a model that was held up at a meeting of countries of the OECD as being the first of its kind in the world that understood that e-commerce is a global phenomenon and, at the same time, respected the individual liberties of consumers. Of course, the member for Melbourne just dismissed it. Why would he dismiss it? Because he does not believe in anything. You ask the member for Melbourne, ‘What is your policy on consumer protection and e-commerce or mobile commerce?’ He will say, ‘We don’t want someone to have to buy a mobile phone contract and not be properly informed’.

That is what a basic freedom is: it is the right to lose money and the right to make money. The Labor Party is saying that they want to socialise the losses and tax the gains. That denies the individual freedoms of consumers. I will respond at a later time to some of the other allegations made by the member for Melbourne; however, needless to say, I thank the member for Mitchell for his very well-informed response to this bill. The member for Mitchell has a very long history in this parliament of having done a hell of a lot of hard work in relation to Treasury matters well before I came to this place. His reputation is enhanced by the thoughtful speech that he gave today. The consequential amendments introduced by this bill reflect the application of the Criminal Code to certain offences provisions in legislation administered by the government. The amendments ensure that the physical and corresponding fault elements of offences are interpreted after the Criminal Code applies in the same manner as they were interpreted prior to its application. They also specify whether an offensive is one of strict or absolute liability. The bill does not change the operation of criminal offences; rather, it ensures that offences operate in the same manner following application of the Criminal Code as they operated before the application. The bill also makes amendments to the Corporations Law made necessary by changes to the Corporate Law Economic Reform Act 1999. The opposition has moved an amendment to this bill. We will be supporting that amendment because it corrects a typographical error in a provision introduced in the Corporate Law Review Act 1998. I commend the bill to the House. I note that there has been a reasonable debate in the Main Committee on this matter, and my only regret is that we did not get a policy from the Labor Party in relation to consumer affairs-just the same old babble that we are so familiar with after four years.

317,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (12.35 P.m.),"I am pleased to have the opportunity toWednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24735 the government has shifted considerably towards Labor policy. It thus represents a repudiation of some of the earlier, rather muddled thinking of coalition spokesmen. I will cite the two most blatant examples of earlier coalition thinking. Firstly, we all recall the severe embarrassment caused by the Prime Minister’s ill-considered interview with the Bulletin magazine in which he happily accepted the unfortunate characterisation of Australia as the United States’ military deputy in this part of the world. We also had the former and now notion of forward defence and canvassing the possibility of a future deployment of Australian ground forces on the Korean peninsula. We are pleased that the white paper very dramatically rejects the confused thinking that the government previously upheld. The white paper stresses that the primary priority for the Defence Force is to maintain the capability to defend Australian territory from any credible attack without relying on help from other forces. It says that the second priority is to enable us to make a major contribution to the security of our immediate neighbourhood. I emphasise the words ‘our immediate neighbourhood’. The third priority is to be able to contribute effectively to international coalitions beyond our immediate neighbourhood, including relevant United Nations missions. The opposition is comfortable with this statement of priorities, which reflects the approach that was adopted by Labor in government. I note that, when the Prime Minister tabled the white paper in the House, he went out of his way to emphasise the quote: We will not develop capabilities specifically to undertake operations beyond our immediate region. Again, this is consistent with Labor’s thinking and is obviously a total repudiation of the previous minister’s comments. I also welcome the broad thrust of the capability plan that is included in the white paper. There is no disputing that, to maintain a small but credible Defence Force, we need to plan for the replacement of various aircraft and ships when they become obsolete and to invest in new equipment and in communications and intelligence gathering systems. Rigorous priorities have to be set in this regard, and the acquisition process has to be managed effectively and efficiently by both the government and the bureaucracy. Given my shadow portfolio responsibilities, I would like to spend the rest of the time available to me in this debate considering the personnel aspects of the white paper. Labor’s starting point is that our key military capability is the skills and experience of our service personnelmen and women, regulars and reservists. They are a vital asset and not just a cost to the budget as many in the government seem to constantly bemoan. On the personnel side, it has to be said that the government’s white paper has left unanswered virtually all the hard questions. Take, for example, the decision to expand the full-time force to 54,000. I welcome that announcement but point out that it is a clear admission that former Minister McLachlan’s Defence Reform Program was seriously flawed. The fact is that the coalition inherited from Labor a full-time Defence Force of 58,000 personnel. The 1997 report of the Defence Efficiency Review actually advocated reducing this number to 42,500-a cut of 15,500 positions, which means retrenchment and disappearance for 15,500 Australians. In response, cabinet then set a target size of 50,000-still a cut of 8,000. Quite frankly, when the government now takes a totally different position, it is worth us recalling that none of the people on the backbench of this coalition voiced any criticisms of or mounted any attack on the attitude that the defence forces should be so significantly cut. The East Timor deployment from September 1999 onwards clearly revealed that the coalition’s earlier cuts to personnel numbers had gone too far and threatened our ability to sustain substantial deployments. Indeed, we were really only able to maintain our East Timor force at the size we did because a considerable number of reservists voluntarily agreed to serve on a temporary full-time basis to fill significant staffing gaps that were evident in the Regular Army.",164,Representatives Main Committee
318,Long,"gone Minister for Defence Mr McLachlan openly advocating a return to the discredited24736 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 In the white paper, the coalition is admitting that we need a full-time force of 54,000 for the ADF to perform its agreed functions. There is no explanation of why a figure of 42,500 could be considered a few years ago. In other words, it is now giving back half of the full-time positions that it deliberately abolished over the past five years. We will remember that when people are parading around in uniforms and marching around on ANZAC Day. That is the history, and that is the performance of the government up to this point. A U-turn will not negate that previous activity. This is hardly indicative of competent management at ministerial level or deserving of the self-congratulation that we have been hearing from the government in the intervening period. There is considerable doubt about the government’s ability to recruit and retain a force of the size that it has now announced as its aim. Under this government, a serious problem has emerged in relation to both recruitment and retention-and this is a matter that I have referred to on several occasions. Despite slick and expensive advertising campaigns, we have worrying shortages of doctors, fast-jet pilots and seagoing personnel, to name but three examples. It will take more than platitudes from Minister Reith and Minister Scott to turn around this deplorable situation. I note that the white paper, at page 63, claims that the retention of valuable personnel ‘is a priority concern of the government’. The new Minister for Defence, Mr Reith, said much the same thing in question time on 6 February. Given that the annual personnel separation rate is almost 13 per cent at present, compared with nine per cent a decade ago, there is no doubt that the issue should be a priority. In fact, the white paper is forced to acknowledge that if current separation recruitment rates continue then the ADF would be 12,000 people below strength by 2010; it would be 12,000 short. The white paper promises ‘firm action’ from the government to ensure that this does not happen. To date, neither minister has been able to articulate just what this firm action might be. Equally, the level of funding available for the task is nowhere quantified. All we are told is that the government has initiated a review of Defence Force remuneration arrangements to develop ‘options that improve the attractiveness of the total remuneration package within overall defence budget constraints’. These are mere words. Given Minister Reith’s track record, I suggest that few serving personnel would feel comfortable and relaxed about the fact that he is now supposed to be looking after their interests as far as pay and conditions are concerned. When one looks at chapter 11 of the white paper, which deals with the key issue of funding, one is immediately struck by a major paradox: on page 120 it is revealed that over the last decade per capita personnel costs rose by an average of 4.9 per cent per year. What, then, is the future increase that the government is budgeting for as part of its firm action on recruitment and retention? Amazingly, the answer at page 120 is: The government has factored into the projected defence funding increases provided for in this white paper an allowance for 2 per cent per annum growth in defence per capita personnel costs. In other words, over the next decade, the government is proposing to provide only 40 per cent of the increase in annual per capita personnel funding that successive governments provided during the 1990s. The firm action to remedy the crisis is to reduce the amount of money allocated to the problem. How this will enable an improvement in the current personnel situation is something that neither minister has even attempted to explain to date. Up until recently, the coalition has seen retention bonuses for personnel in key positionssuch as pilots, air traffic controllers, medical and dental officers, flight engineers and submariners-as one of its key retention measures, but in at least two separate audit reports the Auditor-General has been critical of these schemes. So in August last year I asked Minister Scott a detailed question on notice about Defence’s retention bonuses. The minister’s answer Wednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24737 of 1 November clearly indicated that every one of the eight listed retention bonuses had already closed or was about to close. I note that at no stage then or since has the minister bothered to make a public announcement to this effect. It is on the paper but it does not exist. The minister’s answer admitted that the medical and dental officers’ completion bonus ‘has not been effective in retaining the services of medical and dental officers’, and that the pilot retention bonus ‘was of only limited success in retaining pilots’. It also revealed that Defence had accrued liabilities of more than $40 million by the time the schemes were closed and that these liabilities extended for several financial years in the future and will have to be met by future governments. When an article on the retention bonus appeared in the Sunday Telegraph based entirely on the minister’s answer to parliament, he got one of his public servants to issue a media release describing the article as ‘incorrect’. As I said at the time, instead of hiding behind his public servants, Minister Scott should come clean. If the government has a plan to retain skilled military personnel linked to specific budget allocations, he should tell us the details straight away. Similarly, the government continues to run away from other key issues of concern to serving personnel. What is its response, for example, to findings of the community consultation panel, appointed by this government, that outsourcing of defence functions was the biggest influence on poor morale at present? We know that hundreds of staff at Defence warehouses, including those at the massive distribution centre at Moorebank, Sydney, in the electorate of Hughes, have been waiting anxiously for the government to make a decision on the outcome of the tender process for the Defence Integrated Distribution System. They were originally promised an answer by last June and have now been told that the department is waiting for the minister to make a decision on the recommendation of the tender assessment panel. I understand that the tender assessment panel completed its report in September last year; yet when the matter was raised in question time earlier this week, the minister appeared not to even know what DIDS referred to and made no commitment about when the staff involved would have their future clarified. He has got to think about the personal situation of those people and their families. The government made a commitment last June that it would get somewhere on this issue and knew, or had some idea, of where it was going, and still today it has been postponed. Equally, there has been no adequate response from the government on the changed offset arrangements for remote locality leave travel, which have caused massive discontent amongst the personnel in northern Australia. This was another personnel problem that was publicly highlighted to the government by the community consultation panel, chaired by none other than Andrew Peacock, and it has consistently been put to the parliament by the member for the Northern Territory and other opposition members. Yet Minister Scott simply defends his bureaucrats in the matter despite the very real suffering and loss of benefits to members of the defence personnel, in the Northern Territory in particular. Similarly, we all know that the fringe benefits reporting system continues to cause angst in the ADF as further anomalies continue to emerge. Finally, I would like to refer to the position of the defence reserves, men and women who voluntarily serve at the same time as they hold down a civilian job or undertake higher education. This is yet another policy area in which the coalition is engaged in a belated and inadequate catch-up effort. It is well understood by every informed commentator that decisions taken by the coalition in its first term of government seriously harmed the reserves. These decisions include the abolition of Labor’s Ready Reserves scheme and the removal of defence leave as an allowable award matter, a decision driven by the award stripping agenda of the new defence minister in his previous role. It is a decision that has been roundly repudiated by people who have been in the defence reserves, by those who are interested in their future and, 24738 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 28 February 2001 amongst others, by the Victorian State Council of the Liberal Party. They also repudiated this policy as a total waste of time and a failure. The introduction of common induction training for the Army was another bright idea. It required new reservists to undertake a full-time induction course away from home. As a result of these measures and the government’s procrastination on issues such as legislative protection, morale in the reserves reached rock bottom. Recruitment numbers fell to the lowest level in living memory. This, combined with retention problems, saw the number of active reservists shrink-at the same time as the government’s rhetoric said that the reserves would have to shoulder a larger share of our national defence effort. I have frequently referred to this issue over the past three years. I have been in close contact with bodies such as the Defence Reserves Association and members of the Defence Reserves Support Council, and I know they share the opposition’s very serious concerns. As a result of our combined efforts, the government was forced to announce a number of welcome, if overdue, measures last August. These measures are still awaiting implementation despite the opposition’s offer of bipartisan support for the necessary legislation. I acknowledge that the white paper does foreshadow a greater role for the reserves. That is consistent with the approach taken by the United States, for example, which has increasingly deployed reserves in recent years. It is not an issue on which there is partisan disputation. However, I caution the government that it is insufficient to simply include some suitably positive paragraphs about the reserves in the white paper; that would be counterproductive and would lead to further demoralisation. In particular, the role of the Army Reserve within the overall force structure of the Army needs to be properly thought through. In appropriate circumstances, consideration needs to be given to the deployment of designated reserve units rather than individual reservists. (Time expired) some note in recent months. The government brought it forward following the work of the community consultation group. This white paper, tabled in the year 2000, is the fourth one since 1976, the previous one being in 1994. One highlight is, of course, the significant increase in resources, estimated to be $23 billion over the next 10 years, a three per cent increase in real terms. I would think, despite my friend’s comments earlier, it would be the first real terms increase in defence spending in a very long time. I was particularly taken by the community consultation process-chaired, as has been mentioned, by Andrew Peacock, and the deputy chair being former senator, Stephen Loosley. The interest that was shown in communities such as Whyalla where I attended in the spring of last year was quite overwhelming. There is obviously a great deal of interest in the community from a whole range of perspectives, perhaps emphasised by the focus on recent events in East Timor. But more substantial than that is, I think, the belief in the role and the acknowledgment of the role defence forces have played over a very long time in this country. This community consultation highlighted the respect, the interest and the belief that Australia needed to be very acutely aware of its responsibility to this country, as well as to the region, in ensuring that we had a capacity to look after ourselves in all foreseeable circumstances. I remember two or three highlights of that evening in Whyalla. The focus was on the capacity to defend ourselves and also on the issues of industry: the opportunities in terms of investment policy so that there is some integration and a very strong strategic approach to our domestic industries so that they support our defence effort. There is, of course, a huge input from overseas nations in terms of the defence effort. The high technology required and the necessity to choose the best equipment does mean that we certainly do require the best that the world can offer so that we can look after ourselves.",165,Representatives Main Committee
319,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (12.50 P.m.),"The issue of the defence white paper has been ofWednesday, 28 February 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 24739 I will briefly touch on some of the issues in the white paper and perhaps return to some operational issues towards the end of my time. I would like to further highlight the issue of recruiting. I agree with the earlier member when he says there is a problem in recruiting. There is no doubt about that and there has been a significant effort made on advertising-with, I would think by anyone’s measure, fairly disappointing results. The one statistic that we do know is that something like 22 per cent of serving members in the ADF and 25 per cent of reservists come from the cadets. In spending some time with the former parliamentary secretary, Senator Abetz, in the electorate only a matter of few months ago, I was overwhelmed and a little surprised. I thought I knew my electorate relatively well, but the cadets were something that I had not focused on particularly. I was overwhelmed to see the commitment, effort and the absolute support from family and friends for the young men and women, as young as 12 and 13, in the cadets. I am delighted that the government intends to increase its expenditure to $30 million for cadets. I am unaware of what the previous expenditure rate was. It is something I must check. Nevertheless to see those cadets, to meet them and understand what they got out of what they were doing was quite enlightening for me, and I dips my lid to them. More fundamentally for the nation, the fact that so many of our reservists and our current serving ADF people come from the cadets is very important. I understand there are some members of the ADF who may not necessarily share my views. I would encourage them to have a look at these cadets. This is where our future lies for much of our recruiting, to address the issues of which the former member spoke. Those people put in considerable effort and have empathy with what I would regard as an important national purpose. In terms of what has brought defence more to our minds in recent months, there is nothing more outstanding than the INTERFET effort in East Timor. Many Australians had relatives-I would suggest millions of Australians around our country had some personal connection with people, as I did-who served in that effort. It was quite an experience to share the angst, concern and pride when these young men and women went off to do this task for our nation. It reminds us all of what this young generation is capable of, an outstanding performance of their duty. It reminds us all of that, if ever there was any doubt. It also reminds us of the exposure to risk that was required of these young people in their duties. Living with that risk, the relatives at home were reminded of just a small fraction of what our forebears and our mothers, fathers, uncles and aunts would have gone through in previous times. I was ever so grateful, as was every Australian, that we were able to get through the East Timor experience with minimal casualty. There were fatalities from accidents and subsequently there have been fatalities from incidents post-INTERFET. But what a remarkable experience and effort. That is why Australians now support strongly this government’s approach, and the opposition, in a bipartisan way, support much of the effort in this white paper. It is with pride and great regard for the ministers and those responsible for this white paper that I offer my support for this current effort and wish them well in the next decade. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Standing Committee of Attorneys-General: Human Rights (Question No. 1967) Further to the answer to question No. 1580 (Hansard, 31 August 2000, page 19956), will he update that answer in respect of the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General held in Brisbane on 27 to 28 July 2000.

321,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Did the Reference Group consider inviting more community representatives and fewer politicians to the dinner. (3) Is the Government planning to hold another Regional Summit; if so, are any plans being made to include more community representatives and fewer politicians. (4) Under what criteria did the Government invite all Coalition Members and Senators, but not all Members of other political parties. (1) The Regional Australia Summit as a whole provided the greatest opportunity to develop a better this. (2) There were more community representatives than politicians invited to the dinner. (3) There are no plans at present to hold another Regional Australia Summit. (4) The Reference Group, in consultation with the Minister considered it important that Summit participants had an opportunity to communicate their views directly with members of the Government. Tax Reform: Trusts (Question No. 2236) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 December 2000: (1) Did the Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommend a unified entity tax system in which all forms of companies and trusts would be taxed in the same way. (2) Did the Government announce in 1999 that these arrangements were due to start on 1 July 2001. (3) What progress has the Government made in implementing the recommendations referred to in part (1). (4) With the company tax rate at 30% and only one-half of capital gains subject to tax, how will the Government prevent wealthy taxpayers from incorporating, using family trusts and transforming their incomes into capital. (5) Are the incentives to engage in the financial activities referred to in part (4) now greater than when the Ralph process began. (6) What action has the Government taken to improve the structural integrity of the business tax system and minimise avoidance. (1) I refer the honourable member to ‘A Tax System Redesigned’ – the report of the Review of Business Taxation. (2) The Government’s position is outlined in my press releases of 21 September and 11 November 2000. (3) On 11 October 2000, the Government released an exposure draft of legislation to tax non-fixed trusts like companies. The Government is now considering the submissions it has received on entity taxation. (4) Measures were introduced in conjunction with the CGT discount regime to ensure that the CGT discount was not accessed inappropriately. These measures included: extending the general anti-avoidance provisions in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to cover schemes which seek to transform income into capital so as to access the CGT discount; requiring a 12 month holding period before the CGT discount can be claimed; preventing taxpayers from transferring assets into a company or trust to bring forward access to the discount by disposing of the equity interests in the company or trust; and denying the discount to taxpayers entering arrangements that artificially extend the period of ownership to avoid the 12 month holding period test.",170,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

323,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Also, the recent measures to address the alienation of personal services income will prevent individuals reducing their tax by diverting income generated by their personal services to a company, partnership or trust. The Government does not intend to prevent the legitimate use of family trusts and companies for carrying on genuine businesses. (5) No. (6) The Government took considerable action to improve the structural integrity of the business tax system and minimise tax avoidance in its response to the report of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. Measures have already been legislated to: prevent loss duplication on the transfer of revenue losses; prevent artificial loss creation from debt forgiveness; prevent tax avoidance through lease assignments; prevent loss duplication arising from defects in the continuity of ownership test for deducting company losses; apply the same business test to unrealised losses; prevent the transfer of loss assets resulting in the duplication of losses within a wholly owned group and the creation of artificial losses within a majority owned group; prevent avoidance opportunities by removing excess mining deductions; limit avoidance through the exploitation of non-commercial losses; restrict the ability of individuals to reduce tax through the ‘alienation of personal services income’; limit the use of ‘tax shelter’ arrangements by requiring the deduction of prepayments in respect of certain shelter arrangements to be spread over the period during which the services are provided, rather than being immediately deductible; and reduce avoidance opportunities by removing the inter-corporate dividend rebate on unfranked dividends. The Government had already taken substantial action to combat tax minimisation and avoidance prior to the Ralph Review, including: funding the High Wealth Individuals Taskforce within the Australian Taxation Office to investigate the tax-driven activities of High Wealth Individuals; closing abuse of the Research and Development (R&D) tax concession through syndication arrangements; stopping abuse of luxury car leasing; closing the Infrastructure Borrowings Scheme; tightening thin capitalisation to address tax minimisation by foreign companies; measures to address tax avoidance through overseas charitable trusts; extending the general anti-avoidance provisions of the taxation system to combat withholding tax avoidance; preventing the trafficking of trust losses; taxing distributions disguised as loans from private companies; denial of artificially created capital losses; measures to prevent trading in franking credits and dividend streaming; correcting abuse of trusts and superannuation funds by taxing non-arms’ length distributions from trusts to a superannuation fund at 47 per cent; introducing measures to prevent tax avoidance in hire purchase and limited recourse debt finance arrangements; combating tax minimisation in the cash economy; introducing ultimate beneficiary provisions.",171,XqghuvwdqglqjRiWkhQhhgvDqgFrqfhuqvRiUhjlrqdo$Xvwudold 7kh6xpplwGlqqhuSod HgDSduwLq
