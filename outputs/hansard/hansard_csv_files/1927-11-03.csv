J. Clarke, who has settled on an estate near Perth. She is reported as having said:' It appears that we do not want migrants. When in London last month ten Fife farmers of a community that had never recorded au insolvent, applied for passages and land in Australia, only stipulating that they should be settled together. The reply was that they must take what they could get, and a part of the best type of farmers possible was lost to the Commonwealth. I should like to know the opinion of the right honourable gentleman on the subject? ions when replying to questions. My attention was drawn to the report of the remarks of Sir Robert Cowan, but. it was quite impossible to learn f r om it exactly what Sir Robert Cowan was endeavouring to say. I have not seen the report of a statement by Mrs. Lindsay; but every possible step is being taken to have brought to Australia suitable m i grants whs desire to come here. It must be remembered, however, that migrants come here only under the requisition or S November, 1987. nomination system, and consequently the Commonwealth Government can do nothing beyond f ill in g the requisitions or (Hon.

As I said last night, I do not wish to do him an injustice, and, therefore, have made this statement. :'from what the honourable member for Bass has said, whether he thinks there was justification for the statement he made last evening; but on the merits of --the case as set out by the honourable memdefinite research plans? ber, quire apart from the facts, there is no justification whatever for the assertion taken to utilize to the maximum, the serthat Mr Good luck would have persisted in his candidature had I not promised to introduce proportional representation. There is no evidence of any such promise. Apparently, when asked whether I was in favour of preferential voting, I said that I was; but no relation, causal or otherwise, exists between preferential and prothe House in connection with the operportional voting.

I understand that recently British iron and steel goods, whicli were declared to comply with that regulation, were not allowed to enjoy the advantage of the preferential tariff. W ill the Minister for Trade and Customs explain what is the present position in regard to preferential duties? this Parliament provides that goods from Britain must, in order to be eligible for the generous preference accorded to British goods, contain 75 per cent, of British labour and/or material. While I was in London a question arose as to whether certain exports from England of iron and steel did comply with that condition. I decided that the ordinary duty upon foreign goods must be paid on any importations that were suspect until proof was given to the satisfaction of our investigating officer in London that the goods did contain the required proportion of British labour and material.

Has his attention been called to a film being shown in Melbourne based upon Kathleen Norris's novel, ""The Callahans and the Murphys,"" which holds, up the Catholic religion and the Irish race to scorn and ridicule? 2. Is it a fact that numerous protests against this picture have been made in the United States of America? 3. Isi t a fact that if a film has been passed by any censor, the Commonwealth Government has no further contr >1, notwithstanding how offensive or immoral tlie film may be? 4. Who is the cenor that passed the film in question ? honourable member's questions are as. follow:1. When my attention was called to this picture I had it at once re-inspected. The picture was extensively "" cut"" by the censor in the first place, and he directed in particular that the drinking scene between two women should be eliminated. This, however, was not completely done, and inquiry is now being made te ascertain why the censor's "" cut"" was not given effect to, and I will see that precautions are taken against a recurrence of so serious an omission. This scene has now been removed from the picture, and the allusion to St. Patrick's Day is also being taken out. With these features removed it is thought that the picture, while being low comedy of a rather coarse type, will not now give the offence it otherwise would, and I have ordered a stricter censorship over this class of picture. 2. The only information available shows that while some States in the United States of America passed the picture unconditionally, other States ordered "" cuts "" to be made, which being obtained as far as possible. in no case were as extensive as made by the Commonwealth censor. The complaints in the United States of America were against the uncut film. 3. The regulations require that each film shall be approved and registered. A certificate of registration is also provided for. In the absence of fraud on the part of the importer such a certificate of registration would hold good, but on several occasions during the past few years owners and exhibitors of films have shown a readiness to meet requests by me for the further elimination of any features capable of giving offence. 4. The film censor, Sydney, passed the film after ordering extensive ""cuts,"" as explained in (1). Will he state when applications were made to him in connection with the following matters:(a) For reduction of duty on electric floor polishers (domestic), electric ironing machines (domestic), electric hair dryers, electric fans (domestic and office type), electric washing machines (domestic); (6) for increase of duty on Ironclad air brake switches, Ironclad air brake switch fuses, and air circuit breakers; (c) for increase of duty on paints, anticorrosive and anti-fouling; (<i) for increased duty on white-lead, dry or ground, in oil; and will he give the dates on which the above items were sent on to the Tariff Board for inT h e answers to the quiry and report? being obtained.

In addition to the £400 per annum subsidy to the Finke River Mission, a loan of £500 free of interest for a period of ten years has been granted to the Mission to enable it to purchase bulls and make certain improvements. The loan is conditional upon the Mission expending £1,000 of its own funds on improvements. 3. In order to enable the Government to consider a suggestion that subsidies 'should be paid to Missions on a per capita basis, an endeavour was made to obtain figures under these various heads, but it was found impracticable to obtain definite figures from a ll the Missions. 4. Where Missions are educating children, the cost of such education is borne by the Missions. 5. No standard has yet been prescribed by the Government. 6.

It occurred through a water truck leaving the rails where the line had been temporarily deviated. An inquiry is being held as to the cause. 2. No breakdowns in rolling-stock have occurred, although on account of the heavy railway construction traffic several engine failures made by the Queensland Government, and have taken place, which, to a certain extent, delayed construction. A new locomotive, more powerful than any of those in use in Northern Australia, arrived at Darwin on the 14th October, 1027, and should now be in running. 3.

86,Mr Yates (Adelaide) [3.20],"ITo understand the spirit prompting the resolution, one has to examine the position of people afflicted with blindness, the those men to take such a step, tragic nature of which malady must be recognized by all who are enjoying their lives to the full. The unfortunate blind, frequently from the cradle to the grave, have to bear a cross of suffering which must draw from us our whole-hearted sympathy. At the same time, it is not merely sympathy that I ask for. I ask honourable members to treat our blind sufferers in an equitable manner. admit that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has been a boon to many so afflicted, but its effectiveness is marred by an anomaly which I now seek to -eliminate. I have in my electorate an institute for the blind, which endeavours to employ blind people on a basis mutually profitable to the institution and the afflicted. Unfortunately, the act provides that a blind person must not earn in the aggregate an amount more than the basic wage-wliic h in most States is £4 5s. When such a person has earned £3 5s., to which is added £1 under the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, all incentive to continue working is taken from him. ""working a dead horse,"" working for the benefit of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, his aversion to continue working is quite natural. This tends to demoralize men who are, in all respects, excellent workers. It causes a .hold-up of the machinery at the different institutions, and cannot be regarded as being economically sound. The. additional expenditure involved by the approval of my resolution by this Parliament would be comparatively negligible. surer, when replyinga few weeks ago to a question of mine, stated that there were 1,792 blind people in the Commonwealth, and they were receiving approximately £91,000 a year under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. If those people received the £1, irrespective of their earnings, the amount involved would be £93,184-approximatel y another £3,000. would not place a burden upon the Treasury. It may be urged that if the £ l were granted, irrespective of earnings, it would encourage other blind people to go into institutions and work. If that happened, the Commonwealth would be well rewarded for forcing as it would be to the advantage of the community generally. There is another aspect of the matter. These men are endeavouring to set aside something for the time when they reach the winter of life, and are no longer able to work. They should be encouraged in their efforts, and the passing of my resolution would supply that encouragement. I We frequently hear the catch cry, ""A fair day's work for a fair day's pay."" The only way to materialize that is to encourage a man to work to his f u l l capacity, by paying him for the volume of work he turns out. I appeal to the honourable the Treasurer to view the question from the point of view of equity, and I commend my resolution to the favourable consideration of honourable members. I have much pleasure in seconding the resolution. It is one that should appeal to all honourable members, and it does not in any way raise a party-political question. Doubtless, honourable members on After that he is simply both sides of the House have, like myself, received communications from those administering the various blind asylums. Those people have made out a very strong case why we should give our support to this resolution. RecentlyI received such a communication, which put the case very succinctly:The affliction of blindness depreciates our commercial value, because it limits our choice of occupation and our earning capacity. We cannot fail to realize the truth of that statement. The blind number only The Treaabout 1,792, and,' as no great sum is involved, the Government could readily agree to the concession, and thus allow them to earn whatever they can in addition to the pensions. Much can be said in favour of liberalizing the act generally. In addition to supporting the honourable member for Adelaide in his motion, I remind honourable members that serious anomalies are to be found in the act. To The payment of that amount thousands of persons throughout the community the further amendment of this legislation is a matter of vital importance. The extra few shillings a week that might be given, if necessary amendments were made, would mean a great",24,Pensions For Bli Nd Persons
87,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [3.32],"deal to those who are impaired in health and are unable to enter into active competition with able-bodied persons. One might say that the Commonwealth Government is indeed fortunate in having an efficient body of officers to administer the act. I believe that they have been specially selected for the work, and, if pensioners do not receive as much as they should be paid, no blame is attachable to those officers. Eor the first 28 days after pensioners, go into a hospital or other institution they receive no pension, although in their infirm state they need certain delicacies that they are now unable to provide. At the end of 28 days they are paid only 4s. a week, and the institution receives 10s. 6d. a week for each of them. As the pension rate is £1 a week, the Government thus saves 5s. 6d. on each pensioner who is in a hospital or other institution. The old people should receive the difference between 10s. 6d. and £1 to enable them to procure necessary delicacies, and have a'small balance on leaving the institution. Groom) -The honourable member may not discuss the administration of the act generally. The motion deals only with pensions for the blind. act is inadequate, and I should like to see the scone of the motion widened to provide for a general review of the whole measure. Not long ago the Treasurer said that that the difference between 14s. 6d. and £1 a week with respect to pensioners confined to institutions amounted to £40,000 a year. a conference of the depute commissioners of pensions in the various States and obtain their views as to how the act coukl be advantageously amended. Quite apart from Government institutions, such bodies as the Rockhampton Benevolent Society care for blind persons, invalids, and others in receipt of the pension, and should get a more liberal allowance from the Commonwealth. member not to discuss the whole subject of pensions. deals with the suggestion of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates), I hope that he will consider whether the act generally should be reviewed with the object of correcting anomalies. I shall bring these under the notice of the House on another occasion. Cowper) [3.45] -Al l will agree that everything possible should be done to alleviate the position of those who, through any cause whatever, are debarred from the f u ll use of their faculties. I suppose no section of the community makes a greater appeal to our sympathy than those who have been deprived of their sight; but, in considering the subject of old-age and invalid pensions, regard must be had to the general effect of the scheme, so that equal justice may be done to all sections whose health may be impaired in any way. Australia has led the world in the granting of generous conditions for the old folk in the community, for the injured and for those deprived of their sight or the ability to earn their own. living. .The blind are treated more liberally in Australia than in other countries, and Parliament has shown itself ready, whenever an opportunity has occurred, to extend the concessions made. In the last five years the cost of invalid and old-age pensions has increased by practically £4,000,000, from about £5,400,000 to £9,400,000. At the present time it absorbs more than one-sixth of the direct and indirect taxation of the Commonwealth. The cost per head of the population is, roughly, £1 10s. 2d. as against 14s. in New Zealand and 14s. lOd. in Great Britain. If a system as liberal as that operating in Australia were introduced in the UnitedI suggest that he call States of America, where the subject of pensions is raised .now and again, it would cost £180,000,000 annually. include the unemployment dole? pensions in Great Britain will cost £32,760,000, or, roughly, about 14s. lOd. a head. Special consideration has been shown in the Commonwealth act for the blind, who comprise the only class now permitted to earn more than a very small sum over and above the pension.

The words of the proviso in the section areProvided that in the case of a permanently blind person who is qualified under this act to receive a pension, the amount of pension may be at such a rate (not exceeding F if t y two pounds per annum) as w ill make the income of the pensioner and of the pensioner's wife (or husband), together with the pension, equal to an amount not exceeding Two hundred and twenty-one pounds per annum, or such other amount as is declared by any act, or by any authority constituted under an act, to be a basic wage for the portion of the Commonwealth in which the pensioner resides. In New Zealand, where the pension is 17s. 6d. a week, the pensioner may enjoy an inclusive income of up to £3 15s. a week, as compared with £4 5s. in Australia. Honourable members must recollect that the blind also receive a considerable amount of sympathy and help from the public. Schools and institutions are established for their benefit, and the lot of many of them is very much better than that of persons with bad hearts, paralytics, persons who have lost both limbs, and tubercular subjects, whose pension is limited to £1 a week, and whose earnings may not be more than 12s. 6d. inadequate. but Australia is doing more for the invalid and old-age pensidners than is any other country, and any liberalization of the act should have regard to all deserving sections of the community.

By reason of his past contributions a man will get his insurance payment quite independent of what he earns. propose to introduce the National Insurance BiU during this session? duced at the earliest possible moment. It is a very comprehensive measure, and requires a lot of preparation. At the present time, 1,792 blind persons are in receipt of pensions. Of that number, 1,596, or approximately 90 per cent, of the total, are being paid at the maximum rate of £52 per annum. In other words, the earnings of 90 per cent, of the blind are not interfering with the pensions payment, and, of the balance, it is estimated that at least half are receiving reduced pensions for causes other than income. Therefore, if the existing limitation were removed, it would merely increase the pensions of a few persons who are less in need than some other clases in the community. It is impossible to visualize at this juncture a complete change in the pension system, because of the enormously increased cost that would be involved. There are 53,350 invalid pensioners, and, if provision were made for the blind to receive a ful l pension i r respective of their earnings, it would be reasonable to enact that other deserving classes should be similarly dealt with. If all restrictions were removed, the increased burden upon the taxpayer would be enormous. This problem can be dealt with adequately only on a comprehensive basis under a national insurance scheme. spite the views expressed by the Treasurer, the general merits of the motion It does not require very much discussion.

The terrible affliction of blindness, which is accompanied by various handicaps and expenses, warrants a larger earning power than is prescribed in the act. I commend to the Treasurer's attention one aspect to which attention was drawn on a previous occasion by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), who, I regret, is not present, because he has manifested a keen interest iu the treatment of blind pensioners. There is an anomaly in the present administration of pensions in that blind pensioners are prohibited from following certain avocations. They may sell newspapers without being interfered with by the department, but if they sell tobacco, cigarettes and matches, they lose their pensions. That is an unwarranted discrimination. honourable and respectable as another. I of the Pensions Department is that the selling of tobacco and matches is one form of alms-seeking; but those who have observed the activities of the blind in this way know that there is no warrant for the department's prohibition. If the Government will not accept the motion, I hope that some action will be taken to discontinue the unjustifiable' interference with the blind pensioners' right to select for themselves a means of -earning a livelihood. An eminently respectable and. decent citizen named Christie in my electorate sells newspapers ancl desires to sell tobacco and cigarettes, but the department says he may do so only at the risk of forfeiting his pension. ""WhilstI commend the honourable member for Adelaide for the excellent motive which prompted him to propose this motion, I regret that it is not more comprehensive and does not draw attention to other injustices suffered by the pensioners. ordinary pensioner is allowed to earn without suffering a reduction of his pension is limited to 12s. 6d. per iveek; that amount is totally inadequate. Such a limitation penalizes, instead of encouraging, men. who display -euergy in increasing their incomes. Some months ago a deputation waited on the Prime Minister, who promised to call for a report from the Commissioner of PenMr Coleman. a married sions. So far that report has not been received. Surely it should not take the commissioner so many months to make a report to the Government on this subject. From all parts of Australia. I , in common with other honourable members, have received letters asking when the Prime Minister is likely to announce the Government's decision. I hope that some announcement on the subject will be made very soon. It is regrettable that the Treasurer should ask that all these matters shall wait until the National Insurance Commission's report is translated into legislation. ""We may have to wait months for that bill, and in the meantime the ameliorative proposal contained in the motion should meet with general acceptance. If honourable members opposite fear an undue increase in One occupation is as the pensions obligation of the Commonwealth, they should support the alternaunderstand that the contention tive proposal to increase the earning power of the blind pensioner from £3 5s. to some other amount more commensurate with the higher cost of living, and sufficient to enable him to maintain a wife and family in reasonable comfort. In stead of adopting a merely negative attitude, the Government supporters should suggest some constructive alternative. The best way to do justice to the blind, who, by correspondence, have supported the request made by the honourable member for Adelaide, is to waste no further time in discussion, but to vote upon the motion. a great deal of sympathy with the blind, who suffer the greatest affliction to which human flesh is heir. As the motion does not propose a greatly increased expenditure, I urge the Treasurer to open wider his already generous heart and include in the pensions payments those who beThe amount which an cause of their earnings are now ineligible. A blind person is in a different category from any one else; he must always be accompanied by some one to guide him.

110,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [4.11],"Ithat singles them out for special relief. Parliament has recognized that hy allowing them to earn sumcient to bring their incomes to £4 5s. a week; but no one will claim that that amount is sumcient for them. The honourable member for Balthe blind frequently employ attendants to guide them, or else keep some member of their family out of employment for that purpose. That, in itself, is a considerable financial burden. The Treasurer has stated that the national insurance scheme,, when introduced, will deal with all cases requiring attention. He used that argument after referring to the huge expenditure for pensions. would point out to him that the establishment of an insurance scheme would not reduce that expenditure, because millions of pounds would still have to be found in Australia by Australians. If this country cannot afford to add to the present pensions bill, then it cannot afford to give additional benefits under an insurance scheme. The money comes out of the pockets of the people, whether it is contributed directly or indirectly. From a souud economic stand-point there is no difference. I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide, that those who carry on the blind institutions should be given every encouragement. Nothing adds to-the happiness of people afflicted with blindness more than being given something to occupy their minds, These institutions teach a number of trades, and it is a pity to discourage the blind by the restrictions that have been placed upon them. Whether we should grant them pensions irrespective of their earnings, is for the Treasurer to decide. I hope that the Government will agree to the motion, and will give some relief to those who are unable to look after themselves. After all, any expenditure in this direction would not be a heavy burden upon the community. The money would be kept in circulation, and the prosperity of the country would not be affected adversely. [4.17] chiefly by way of a personal explanation. My previous opinions, as expressed in this House, have been referred to by honourable members opposite, particularly by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman). I should like to remind them that I have never in this House put forward a proposition similar to this motion. While I deeply sympathize with the blind, I think that a bald proposal to grant pensions irrespective of earnings opens up a big question; and, in view of the statement of the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page)-, that this and other similar matters are being dealt with under the national insurance scheme, I think that there is every reason for this Parliament to hesitate before it carries a motion like this. My previous speeches in this House on the subject of the blind referred solely I to the sellers of tobacco and matches. Those persons, twelve or eighteen months ago, were receiving no pension at all, and that was the subject of my complaint. I introduced a deputation from the Blind Association of New South Wales to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in Sydney. I also placed the position before this House, but no notice was taken of my appeal. I know that the Deputy Commissioner himself reported favourably to the Commissioner in Melbourne, Mr Collins, who was then in the unfortunate position of being Secretary of the Treasury, and also the Chief Commissioner of Pensions. Pensions were really a side line with him, and he could not understand the details of administration, or the questions of policy involved, in the same way as could the deputy commissioner. When a deputy commissioner, like Mr Theggie, recommends this reform, and the commissioner in Melbourne turns it down, things seem to be a little topsy turvy. I should think that we ought to respect the opinion of the man who is best qualified to express one. Blind sellers of tobacco, cigarettes, and matches are denied a pension altogether because the commissioner says they are mendicants, but blind sellers of newspapers are permitted to receive pensions. That is a serious grievance with the blind people. If sellers of matches are mendicants, surely the sellers of newspapers are also. The reason given by the commissioner is that it is possible -I wish to make a few remarks, to trace the earnings of the man who sells newspapers. Information as to his earnings can be obtained from the news agency or the newspaper office from which he gets his papers, but it is impossible,",29,Pensions For Bli Nd Persons
111,"Larat ( Mr Mcgrath) Has Mentioned ""That",,30,Pensions For Bli Nd Persons
112,Mr Thompson (New England),"says the commissioner, to trace the earnings of the seller of matches, cigarettes, and tobacco. I very much doubt if there is anything in that argument. The seller of matches cannot make a fortune; I do not think he can make anything like £3 5s. a week. He cannot be classed as a mendicant, as he offers f u l l value for the money he receives. The only difference between him and the shopkeeper is that he is out in the open, and the shopkeeper is under a roof. I tliink the Treasurer should use his influence to see that the sellers of matches, cigarettes andtobacco, and the sellers of newspapers, are placed on the ,'iame footing. Treasurer said that 1,596 persons were already in receipt of the full pension, and REFERENDUM AND INITIATIVE . that only 10 per cent, were not receiving the full amount.

I have been vember. in blind institutions, and I have noticed how much happier the inmates are when they are at work.

The building of this railway is of the greatest importance to the pastoral industry of Queensland and New South ""Wales. I regard the proposal as essential for the proper development of Australia. The construction of such a line is to me one of the most urgent public works requiring the attention of the Government. Australia has a huge burden in its national debt, which, on the 30th June last, was £461,067,000, the States' debt being given at ,£641,334,000a total debt of £1,102,000,000. That is a crushing burden of debt for a small population to carry. Fortunately our national credit is good, and that is due to our extraordinary potential resources. It should be the enit became established. The cattle indeavour of the Government to lighten the burden in every possible way, and the best way of doing so is to develop our national resources. The building of this line will help in that direction. It could be constructed by utilizing some of the money made available to the Commonwealth under the migration agreement with Great Britain. It is imperative that we should develon our pastoral industries, which are of the utmost importance to Australia. Eor the years 1922-1926, inclusive, the average value of the overseas exoorts from Queensland was £19,700,000, 75 per cent, of which represented pastoral products. Statistics also reveal the fact that 40 per cent, of the income tax paid in Queensland during the last financial year was paid by those engaged in pastoral industries. The construction of this proposed line from the Northern Territorv, across the Barkly Tablelands, through Camooweal, and the western districts of Queensland, to Bourke, in New South ""Wales, would greatly assist in developing our pastoral industries, and would, as a result, help to Australiabs are great meat-eaters, and reduce our national debt. The proposal to build this line is no new one, it being first introduced in the Queensland Parliament by Sir Thomas Mclllwraith, in 1883. Later it was again brought before the Queensland Parliament by the Hon. ""W. Kidston, in 1910, in a revised form. During the interval that has elapsed since, toral industry makes no increase-it has then the wisdom of putting the proposal into effect has been clearly demonstrated. The project has the approval of the Sec tional Committee of the Commonwealth Public ""Works Committee, which inspected the north-south railway route from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs and on to Darwin. Sir George Buchanan, KC.I.E., who was specially, brought out from Great Britain by this Government to investigate the development of thp Northern Territory, stated in his reportI feel satisfied that the development of the Northern Territory must begin through Queensland, in the first instance, by the pastoral industries. The history, of our pastoral industries indicates that the remote parts of Queensland were developed by means of the cattle industry, supplemented by the sheep industry. The one industry follows the other, each developing our back areas as dustry has been the pioneer of the great wool industry. The great need of the cattle industry to-day is the provision of adequate transport facilities, and they would be provided by the construction of this line. Such facilities would make possible the conveyance f early matured stock from remote areas to our populous centres for consumption locally and overseas. A t present cattle have to be kept two or three years longer than they should, in order to develop the constitution necessary to withstand the arduous journey from our remote pastoral centres to the populous areas in which they are sold. When they reach those markets they are sold at a price con* siderably less than would have been realized had they arrived in good condition two years earlier. That procedure is economically unsound, and causes a national waste. Four-fifths of the population of Australia is clustered upon the east coast of the continent, and half of our population is centred in Queensland and New South Wales. the establishment of the proposed railway would provide our population with meat at a reasonable price. The lack of adequate transport facilities has greatly hampered the development of the pastoral industry. If our population continue to increase a.t the present rate and the pasmade very little in recent years-it is",31,Railwa Y Construction
115,Mr J. Francis (Moreton) [4.29],"stated that in ten years there will be a meat famine in Australia. Recently we had the absurd position of tbe Commonwealth Government granting a bounty on cattle exported from the Northern Territory, while stock was being imported from New Zealand into the southern States. The building of this line would end such absurdities. Further, it would be a great insurance against drought. At no time has the whole of the area traversed by the proposed railway been simultaneously subject to drought conditions. In 1914, the southern States of Australia were afflicted by drought conditions, and lost over 10,000,000 sheep, in addition to cattlq and horses. Queensland, owing to good rains, was then like a garden of Eden. Last year Queensland had the misfortune to suffer a disastrous drought while New South ""Wales enjoyed splendid seasons. On each occasion, had a method of transport such as would be afforded by this proposed railway been available for the conveyance of stock to well-pastured areas, these huge losses would have been avoided to a great extent. It is said, and statistics support the stateregarding the development of that State ment, that Australia loses £20,000,000 worth of merino sheep every four years through droughts, an amount which would have gone far towards meeting twice the capital cost of this proposed railway. In the interests of defence, the construction of this line is vital. Northern Territory is the most vulnerable part of Australia, and is absolutely isolated. Over four-fifths of the population of Australia is to be found in the eastern States. The bulk of the men and material necessary for the defence of the Northern Territory in the event of attack would have to be drawn from there. The defence of Australia is the sole responsibility of this Parliament. ""We owe it to the people of Australia to see that we carry out this trust. The construction of this railway, when viewed strategically, has the approval of our most eminent soldiers, including Sir Brudinel ""White. member consider that the north-south north-south line should first be dealt with? approval of this Parliament, and is part of an agreement entered into between been raised. the Governments of the Commonwealth and South Australia. entered into. honourable member. I was unfortunate etiough to travel over that lie to a point 60 miles beyond Oodnadatta, at a time when drought conditions. prevailed. I believe that we should concentrate on building lines which will serve a purpose more useful than will be served by the north-south railway. However, the project had the support of the Leaders of the Government and of the Opposition during the last election, when a pledge was gven by those gentlemen' that the line would be constructed. That pledge must be honoured. The line proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie in no way competes with the north-south line. Eaoh serves a distinct purpose in the development of Australia. I hope that the bright hopes entertained by the honourable members representing South Australia by the north-south line will be realized. The proposed line is essential to the development of the Northern Territory and of the pastoral industry in the large areas of Queensland and northern New South ""Wales, and the further developThe ment of this industry would help materially to wipe out the huge burden of national debt. The country through which the line would pass is, from a pastoral view-point, unexcelled. The line could be constructed quickly and economically, because the decentralized system of railways in Queensland, which has four distinct lines running from the coast to the centre of the State, and even beyond, could act as a feeder in connection with its construction. No real opposition to the proposal has been offered. The only objection raised has come from honourable members from South Australia, who fear that the construction of the suggested line railway beyond Alice Springs.",32,Railwa Y Construction

120,Dr. Nott,"No logical objection hasground exists for the fears of the South Australian members. This proposed line and the north-south railway serve distinct purposes, and each, I hope, will ultimately be built. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has moved an amendment to provide for the construction of a line from the Northern Territory to Broome or Derby, to' serve the northern portion of Western Australia. Having heard the honourable member's remarks, and having carefully perused the report of his speech, I have no hesitahas been raised. I say definitely that it tion in saying that it favours the construction of the line proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr country that it would serve is of Manning); but the honourable member for Swan suggests that the line to which his amendment refers should be constructed first. I have nothing to say against the proposal for the building of that line. In due course its construction also will, no doubt, be authorized. The most urgent matter awaiting the attention of the Government, however, is the building of the railway proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie. New South Wales and Queensland should bear their respective shares of the cost of the underdatta northwards was being built before taking, and the carrying of the motion would be an instruction to the Government to open up negotiations with the governments of those States to decide a financial basis upon which this important national development work could be cooperatively carried out. have great pleasure in supporting the motion.

We struction of the line. benefit than the north-south railway? separate proposal. both lines, and, if the country were good enough, there would be plenty of scope for a third line between the two. The present proposal should not be regarded as an alternative route to the north-south line. Millions of stock have been lost in both New South Wales and Queensland because of the absence of such a railway. I take it that the work would cost £6,000,000 QV £8,000,000; but, divided between the Commonwealth and the two States concerned, that amount would not be too burdensome. It would be as nothing compared with the loss of stock that would be prevented during drought times. Queensland and New South Wales wouldeach have benefited to a greater extent than the total cost of the line through the saving of stock if the line had been constructed years ago. On several occasions the question whether the building of this railway should be delayed until after the construction of the north-south line should not. This is by far the more important project, and the infinitely better quality than the other. Many more stock would be saved in times of drought, and the line would open up the Barkly Tableland, which, with railway communication, would, I believe, carry from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 sheep, and would be capable of supporting a large number of successful settlers. Honourable members who know the difference between good country and bad would, on inspecting the Barkly Tableland, marvel, as I did, that the railway from Oodnathe proposed line. ment with South Australia. in .that agreement of the period within which the work should be carried out.

There is room-for The line would pass through good grazing country that could be settled in much smaller areas than that on the other route. Plenty of water is obtainable by sinking for it .

If any action is to be taken, now is the time, when many of the natives are still in virgin country and are uncontaminated by the whites. reason I cordially support the motion for the appointment of a select committee. few days ago I presented to the House a petition signed by over 7,000 persons praying for the creation of an aboriginal state. I did not move that it be printed because I learned from you, Mr Speaker, that such a motion would not be in order unless I intended to move, within fourteen days of its presentation, that effect be given to the petition.

Committee, which I understand w ill consider to-morrow whether the petition shall be printed. The treatment of the aborigines has exercised the minds of our people for very many years. Much legislation relating to them has been passed, but very little of it has been effective. To illustrate the governmental attitude It is impossible to in the early days of Australian settlement, I shall quote from a proclamation issued by Sir John Hindmarsh, Governor of South Australia, in December, 1836I t is also, at this time especially, my duty to apprize the colonists of my resolution to take every lawful means for extending the same protection to the native population as to the rest of His Majesty's subjects, and of my firm determination to punish with exemplary severity all acts of violence or injustice which may in any manner be practised or attempted against the natives, who are to be considered as much under the safeguard of the law as the colonists themselves, and equally entitled to the privileges of To those natives who British subjects. I trust therefore with confidence to the exercise of moderation and forebearance by all classes in their intercourse with the native inhabitants and that they omit no opportunity of assisting me to fulfil His Majesty's most gracious and benevolent intentions towards them, by promoting 1 their advancement in civilization, and, ultimately, under the blessing of Divine Providence, their conversion to the Christian faith. That was the official attitude of the British Government at that time. Since then abuses have been practised against the natives u n t i l the population has dwindled from about 300,000 to about 60,000, mainly because of criminal neglect and sometimes criminal persecution. There is a general idea that the aboriginal of Australia is of a very low type, some persons going so f a r as to say that he is the lowest type of human being in the world. I shall quote, not Eor that my own opinion, but that of persons who have lived amongst the natives and studied their habits. D r .

Andrew Lang, Dr. Basedow, DrRamsay Smith, und Bishop Gilbert White, who for a number of years was Bishop of Carpentaria, is one of the greatest authorities on the blacks, and he said that he did not believe that the Australian aboriginal was the lowest of the various races of the world. The innate degeneracy theory as to the Australian aborigines has been exploded Dr. Ramsay Smith and other anthropologists. In 1S26 Surgeon Cunningham, in his book "" Two weeks in New South Wales,"" wrote that the aboriginals were a stately, healthy race, easily civilized. All accounts from 1820-1850 refer to the aborigines in similar terms. There is no doubt that the native has deteriorated both morally ancl physically because of contact with the whites. Mr Buckley at the Inland stated:Before tlie entrance of tbe white races, tlie rounded up arid killed by native police within aboriginal was an upright and clean man, both morally and physically. According to information solicited from the oldest and most intelligent of the natives, neither syphilis nor gonorrhoea was known prior to the occupation of this country by Europeans. abundant evidence from many sources on that point.

Hood, S.M., the royal commissioner, leaves to others the apportioning of the guilt, but he finds the evidenec conclusive that eleven aborigines were shot and tlieir bodies burnt. Perhaps something may yet be learned about the nineteen other blacks who) in the commissioner's opinion, probably shared the fate of the eleven. If it came to the ears of the people of Australia that about 30 white people had been shot down, there would have been a great deal more notice taken of it than was taken of these atrocities. Just because the victims were black people, and because, in the opinion of some people the sooner the natives die out the better, the country is prone to take little notice of occurrences of this nature. They say, "" Oh, it was only a blackfellow."" Here is a further comment from Mr Arthu r James Vogar, F.R.G.S.:Mission conference In 1889-00 I wrote my book, Black l'olicn, obtainable in your public library.
