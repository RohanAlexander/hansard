the House or Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens or Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium round in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclear fission reaction. And whereas presently assured reserves or uranium in Australia represent a potential production or over 340,000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilised in Light Water Reactors overseas. And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation or Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram. And whereas Plutonium 239 is one or the most dangerous substances human society has ever created, causing mutations and cancers. And whereas there are no methods or safely and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quaner of a million years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud or micron-sized particles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the expon of uranium may return to us an import or Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation or the atmosphere, And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the military use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proliferation represents a prime environmental threat to all forms or lire on the only eanh available to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation to deCommonwealth respectively showeth: mand a halt to all expons or uranium except Tor bio-medical uses. Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: 1. That further mining and export of uranium Trom Australia except for bio-medical purposes be banned, 2. That the Australian Atomic Energy Commission be transformed by the rewriting of its chaner into an Australian Energy Commission to further the understanding or energy flows through our society and to promote national economic independence and self-sufficiency. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson, Mrs Child and Mr Kerin. Petitions received. Taxation: Education Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House or Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition or the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the reduction or the allowable deduction or education expenses under Section 82 J of the Income Tax Assessment Act from $400 to SISO is $50.00 below the 1956-57 figure. That this reduction will impose hardships on many parents who have children attending school, whether non government or government; and particularly on parents with more than one child at school. That this reduction will farther restrict the freedom available to parents to make a choice of school for their children. That some parents who have chosen to send their children to a non-government school will have to withdraw their children and send them to government schools already over crowded and understaffed. That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents or children in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. That parents should be encouraged by the Australian government to exercise freedom or choice or the type or school they wish for their children. The proposed reduction means an additional nnanciai penalty is imposed on parents who try to exercise this choice and discourages them from making an imponant nnanciai contribution to Australian education over and above what they contribute through taxation. That an alternative system, a tax rebate system, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with children at school. To compensate for the losses that will follow from the proposed reduction and to help meet escalating educational costs raced by all families your petitioners most humbly pray that the House or Representatives in Parliament assembled should take immediate steps to restore educational benefits to parents, at least at the 1973-1974 level either by increasing taxation deductions or through taxation rebates. by Mr Crean and Mr Oldmeadow. Petitions received. Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members or the House or Representatives of Australia in Parliament assembled. The humble petition or the undersigned citizens or the 1. That we have examined the Family Law Bill and substantially suppon the provisions therein 2. That the Family Law Bill takes into account the changing roles orwomen in modem society 3. That the amendment to the bill recommended by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights orwomen who play the traditional role in society will be protected, as will the interest or children. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill be debated and passed as soon as possible. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Holten. Petition received. Metric System To the Honourable the Speaker and Members or the House or Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens or Australia respectfully showeth:",7,Setup

That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the tradiuonal weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed, and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored in those areas where the greatest inconveniences and distress are occurring, that is to say, in meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Holten. Petition received. Baltic States To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: That the decision of the Australian Government to recognize de jure the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania does not in any way benefit Australia or the Australian people; That the occupation of these mentioned Baltic States by the Soviet Union was and remains illegal under international law; That the citizens of the Baltic States in their homelands are brutally deprived of personal, civil and religious freedom by the Soviet Union. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament will speedily revoke the decision of the Australian Government to recognize de jure the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union and place the question of oppression ofhuman rights in the Baltic States before the United Nations. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Jarman. Petition received.

That the need for the Government of New South Wales to raise addidonal revenue by way of the Business Franchise Licences Petroleum Act will impose an unwarranted additional burden on New South Wales residents 2. That the Premier of New South Wales has given a solemn undertaking that his Government will withdraw its harsh Petrol Tax immediately he can be assured of an equivalent additional revenue from Commonwealth Funds raised from New South Wales residents 3. That such additional revenue can be provided by the Australian Government if it returns to the New South Wales Government all moneys raised by way of taxes and excise on petroleum products consumed in New South Wales 4. That the New South Wales Government has available to it sufficient skilled personnel and equipment to undertake a continuing intensive programme of highway construction but is unable to fully use these resources through a lack of adequate funds. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will fonhwith do all things necessary to return to the States of the Commonwealth all moneys raised by way of taxes and excise on petroleum products And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Kerin. Peution received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed 'free' nauonal health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more than the present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a further erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and single persons. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ulumately remove an individual's right to choose his/her own doctor. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Petition received. the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade. I ask it of him in his position as the Treasurer elect. Does he still believe, as he told this House last Wednesday, that unemployment in Australia today is 'absolutely trivial'? With unemployment in Australia rising at the rate of 1,000 a day and the official seasonally adjusted figures for October showing 190,000 people, including school leavers, out of work, does he believe that is absolutely trivial? Has he been told that the Minister for Labor and Immigration is forecasting that unemployment will show a big increase in the next few months and that the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is forecasting that 300,000 Australians will be out of work in January? Is that absolutely trivial? Is the Australian Labor Party",17,Petitions

For it accordingly. Dr. J. F. CAIRNSMr Speaker, I have no shows that a subsidy amounting to $65m was intention of making a long answer to such a trivrequired. This has been the position over a long ial question. The right honourable gentleman, period of time. The Government has adopted as who purports to be a potential Prime Minister of a policy an 80 per cent recovery program in this country, began by asking me a question in which we are looking at an increase in air naviwhich he said he was quoting me exactly and gation charges from 10 per cent to 15 per cent that I had said that unemployment in Australia annually. Notwithstanding this increase the cost was absolutely trivial. He then referred to Hanrepresents only approximately 4 per cent of the sard and he by doing so showed that he left out total operating charges of an airline. In the case of what he said over and over again in all that of general aviation it represents an even smaller long preliminary that you, Mr Speaker, regarded percentage of operating costs. In respect of some as so long to be almost inadmissable, and what of the training and small commuter aircraft it is he in fact quoted from Hansard-that is, that I as low as about 2 per cent. As far as the Governwas saying that unemployment in Austraha was ment's priorities are concerned, the Government trivial compared with most other countries, and does have priorities more important than civil that is exactly what I did say. I did not say that aviation. I refer to the Department of Social unemployment in Australia was trivial. From the Security, the Department of Health and other point of view of Australia and the Australian departments which have been increasing their people who are out of work, unemployment is benefits and payments to people who really need not trivial, can never be trivial. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-I did say that and you for airlines to operate and charge fares well quoted it from Hansard. You gave yourself away below an economic level. We estimate that someby quoting it, which shows how incapable you thing in the vicinity of the first $6 of every fare are of doing anything straight. I do not know charged is paid by the Ausualian taxpayer. This whether it comes from your advisers or whether in itself is unfair in our opinion. That is why we you do it all yourself but it would be a miracle for are going for the 80 per cent recovery.

Does this not make it easier for Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to grant outrageous salary increases to pilots and to pass the cost on in increased fares? Is there any reason why the Government should provide civil aviation as a social service? Are there not higher priorities? Will the Minister give consideration not only to terminating the 2-airline agreement but also to reducing the Budget appropriation for airports, air safety and so on is borne solely by whether cessation of the Government assistance to Sir Reginald Myles Ansett will have the supexample, last year expenditure in civil aviation was $ 140m and revenue was $75m which clearly assistance.

MAIL SERVICES: LANE COVE POST OFFICE the Minister representing the Postmaster General. Has his attention been drawn to the dispute which has disrupted mail deliveries from Lane Cove Post Office, thereby causing substantial inconvenience to an estimated 30,000 people within the area serviced by that post office? Has this dispute been caused by a black ban placed on the post office by the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union of Australia on account of the employment at that post office of 4 persons who refused to join the union? Have negotiations to settle the dispute been underway, and if so, is the Minister in a posiuon to advise the House of the present state of these negotiations and the likely date of resumption of normal services from the Lane Cove post office? has been brought to my attention. It is the subject of discussions between the Postmaster-General and union representatives. I hope to be in a position to advise the honourable member on this matter later this day. Prime Minister as the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House. Is it a fact that the Palestine Liberation Organisation charter can only be understood as calling for the elimination of Israel as a sovereign independent state? Is it also a fact that Australian policy supports the survival of Israel as a sovereign independent state, and that this was again stressed by our United Nations Ambassador last week? As the PLO and AustraUan policies are obviously incompatible, and since support for the PLO, whether positive or passive, can only encourage the intransigence of that organisation, can the Prime Minister say why Australia abstained from, rather than opposed motions at the United Nations which unreservedly supported the PLO position? Will he confer with the Foreign Minister with a view to ensuring that the Australian view is asserted more positively on questions affecting the Middle East and that, in particular, we vote as well as speak in line with our clearly established principles? motions before the United Nations and its specialised agencies in the last few weeks concerning the Palestine Liberation Organisation. If honourable gentlemen wish to have the precise text and votes, then I would ask them to put questions on notice. I take it that the honourable gentleman is referring to the main resolution on therightsofthe Palestinians on which a vote was taken on 21 November. We abstained, in good company, because the resolution was directed only to satisfying the aspirations of the Palestinians and did not mention Israel. In his speech, the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Laurence Mclntyre, emphasised Australia's adherence to resolution 242 as the only basis for lasting peace in the Middle East, reaffirmed our strong desire that Israel's rights, as well as therightsof other States in the area to continued existence within recognised and secure boundaries be acknowledged by all parties to the dispute and declared our preparedness to accept the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, provided this is what the Palestinians wanted. I take this opportunity again to assure honourable members and the Australian people that the Government has every confidence in the positive, firm and clear manner in which Sir Laurence Mclntyre has consistently and frequently stated the Australian Government's position on these very difficult matters. the Prime Minister and is prompted by a report in the Press today that he intends to visit Paris during his forthcoming overseas trip.

I am not going to take up too much of question time except to bring out that contrast and to say: Listen in for the urgency motion and get the full story. view of his equivocation this morning with respect to AustraUa's stand on the attitude that it will take with respect to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, its use of violence and its attempts to destroy Israel, will he advise the House as to whether or not he subscribes to the attitude taken on the Arab-Israel dispute as pronounced by BiU Hartley, a fellow-member of the Federal Executive of the AustraUan Labor Party, or does he concur in the view as pronounced by Bob Hawke, who I understand is also a Federal Executive member of the ALP and who seems to hold almost completely contradictory views to those of Mr Hartley? expressed on behalf of the Australian Government by AustraUa's permanent representative to the United Nations during the debate on the question of Palestine in the General Assembly on 21 November. I ask that the speech by Sir no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)It is more than twenty-seven years since the General Assembly first turned its attention to the question of Palestine. In the two years following the adoption in 1947 of its first decision on the subject the Assembly tried and failed to create two independent States within the boundaries of the former British mandate. The recognition of the State of Israel and its admission to the United Nations was solemnly endorsed by this organisation, and Israel look its place as a member of the international community albeit without boundaries agreed under a proper peace settlement. From then onward the word Palestine almost disappeared from out lexicon for more than twenty years-excep t as a convenient way of identifying the Arab refugees displaced from the beginning of the hostilities of 1948. The question of Palestine became in turn the question of the Middle East, with all the unhappy consequences that still remain with us, until the re-emergence only a few years ago in decisions of the General Assembly of the concept of self-determination for the Palestinians, that is the Arab people of the former British mandate of Palestine. This, Mr President, is what we are discussing here. There is an element of irony in the fact that the General Assembly once again finds itself in its position of twenty-seven years ago-considerin g the possible establishment of two independent states within the area that constituted the former British mandate of Palestine. Mr President, we must only hope that whatever we may decide here will not merely prolong and exacerbate the intractable situation that the United Nations and all of us individually have had to cope with it in the Middle East for a quarter of a century, with all its constantly recurring crises and all its agonies for the countries and peoples of the region. We must hope lhat it will help to open the way for that just and lasting settlement that we have all longed for and sought by one means or another. A settlement that will give an assurance of the kind of peace that will enable all these talented people of the Middle East to live and work together in harmony among themselves and with the rest of the international community. So there is not much point in going back over the past and reviewing whatever errors and omissions there may have been in the last twenty-five years on the part of any of the parties concerned. What we now have to consider is the reality of the present, and we have to consider it in the light of the great and pressing need for a final settlement in the Middle East.",22,Income Maintenance Scheme

42,Mr Speaker,"I s leave granted? There beingAnd this, Mr President, is why my delegation has listened with more than ordinary interest to this debate. We have listened to the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Mr Arafat, and have heard that the PLO, as supported by the heads of state of all Arab governments, represents the Palestinians and all their aspirations. Whatever reservations we may have about methods employed in asserting those rights to self-determination and a recognised place in their original homeland-ther e is clearly a new and vigorous spirit, a new sense of destiny among the leaders of the displaced Arabs, a new confidence in their rights to self determination and independence within a Palestine state of their own. My delegation has taken note of all this, and we say that if the Palestinians want to create a state of their own alongside Israel, we will accept this. It is in harmony with what the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs said on the subject in his statement to this Assembly on 7 October last, when he recognised the concern of all Arab states, along with the rest of us, that the Palestinians should have proper treatment, permanent homes and secure hopes for the future. It accords also with the Australian Government's attachment to the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence if this is what they desire. Mr President, my Government is also firmly attached to a second principle-that of respect for the sovereignty and independence of states and the duty of all states to do nothing to threaten or undermine the right of any other state to exist and to enter into normal and peaceful relations with its neighbours. As applied to the Middle East, this means that we believe in the right of all states in the region, and I include Israel, to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries. In the course of the same address to the General Assembly that I referred to earlier, the Australian Foreign Minister affirmed that 'The existence of the state of Israel has to be accepted, it has to have assurance that as a permanent condition of life it will be secure and accepted by its neighbours.' In other words, Mr President, my delegation still believes in the fundamental lightness and fairness of Security Council Resolution 242, as reaffirmed by Resolution 338. And this leads in turn to a third principle to which the Australian Government is strongly attached-the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes. Australia still looks, as it always has looked, to the parties that have to find a way of living together in the Middle East to find that way themselves, peacefully, by negotiation, whether through the Geneva Conference machinery or among themselves. We strongly urge all the parties concerned to turn to negotiation. When a new state emerges from a negotiated agreement, alongside Israel in the former Palestine, among those parties, AustraUa will be prepared to accept it and to deal with it on a basis of equality. But we believe that any attempt to impose on the region a solution which does not accord with the provisions of Resolution 242 will hinder rather than help the search for a just and permanent settlement. It is on the foregoing principles, Mr President, that my delegation will base its attitude to any definitive proposals that may be put before the Assembly under this item. representations I made to him last month following an approach to him by the Minister for Agriculture seeking the establishment of a fisheries development loan fund of between $2m and $3m initially within the Department of Agriculture? Is the Treasurer in a position to state the result of his examination of this suggestion, which is designed to give urgently needed financial assistance to fishermen and fishing boat builders in order that our fishing industry can be upgraded by the purchase of more modern vessels and equipment, thus enabling our fishing industry to, among other things, compete with foreign fishing fleets around Australia's coastline? my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, and negotiations are taking place about it. I cannot give a detailed answer at this point but I shall supply the honourable member with the necessary information. WAGE INDEXATION the Minister for Labor and Immigration. Will he distribute in this House the paper on indexation prepared by his Department in which it is argued that wage indexation in itself must be inflationary and the more rapid the indexation the more rapid the inflation? Now that the Miners Federation in the United Kingdom has destroyed the social compact there and the air pilots have done the same thing here and have both shown that the concept of a social compact is a farce against society, will the Minister, in all decency, ensure that the Government's proposal to urge the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to introduce indexation is reconsidered by the Government and an opportunity given to debate the concept in this House? about the paper that the honourable member talks about. you can look for it. would not be proper in this place.

55,Mr Willisi Direct A Question To The Minis,"Minister for Labor and Immigration. Did the Minister say on Monday evening last when addressing the Australian Workers Union that he sees nothing of great appeal in the capitalist or mixed enterprise system in which he asserted we are now living? Did the Minister say that he is still a democratic socialist but that he had to wait temporarily until the system could be changed? Having those factors in mind, will the Minister explain what changes should be made to the system and how and when they might be implemented? the AustraUan Workers Union. I made remarks very much along the lines-no t exactly, of course-as the honourable member put them. I never read precisely what is on a prepared paper. I always embellish it, add something to it and make it a bit better. IfI find that I can improve on it impromptu, I always do. Of course I am a democratic socialist. I am very proud of that. I have been proud of it for all of my life-som e 50 years now. I hope that the day wUl come when we will have a system of democratic sociaUsm. in Australia. It is true that I said that we could not introduce democratic socialism immediately. I did not say that we wUl have to wait temporarily. I said that we wUl have to wait indefinitely because I could not imagine that it would be possible in the present climate to get the necessary referendum carried to give the Australian ParUament the power to introduce democratic sociaUsm. If the honourable member wants to know what is needed to make it possible, let me say that we will need to alter the Constitution in such a way as to give the people the right by plebiscite to decide which industries are to be brought under public control or ownership. If the people were prepared to alter the Constitution in that way so that as each industry became a burden upon society at large we could then submit the proposition to the people by way of a referendum, I believe that would be the ideal situation. I could nominate some industriesrightnow which would be first-class candidates for being put by referendum or plebiscite to the people to determine whether they should be brought under pubUc ownership or control. AND DURATION the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister have by more than 20 per cent. The Government a thorough examination made of the Australian introduced legislation to reduce that disparity to Constitution to ascertain whether there is any bar to any State government passing legislation to perpetuate itself in office without any form of election taking place? Will the Prime Minister also ascertain whether there are any means by which legislation proposed in Victoria, and already enacted in Queensland and New South Wales, whereby a conservative poUtical base is expanded by legislative means in order to deny to the people the opportunity to elect governments, can be prevented? that there is nothing to prevent any State government introducing legislation, and that there could be no challenge to any state legislation extending the term of office of any State Parliament or either House of a State Parliament. The one exception is New South Wales where, about 1950, the Labor Government introduced and secured the passage of legislation which Umited the life of the Legislative Assembly to 3 years unless that law were subsequently amended with the approval of the voters of New South Wales at a referendum. New South Wales, therefore, is the only State where there is any constitutional Umitation on the term of office of a parUament. The British ParUament, from which the State parliaments derive, has no constitutional limitation on the term for which it can last. There have been many cases in which the British ParUament has passed a law extending its own term of office, the most recent being the parUament which was elected in 1935 for 5 years and which was extended until 1945. So there is no Umitation whatever on the power of any State parliament, except that of New South Wales, to extend its term of oflice. The honourable gentleman asked me also about the electoral systems of the States. I beUeve there is no limitation in any of the State constitutions concerning the principles upon which electorates in their parliaments are to be distributed. What is being done now by the Liberal Government in Victoria may be unconscionable or even monstrous, but it is perfectly constitutional. Nor in fact is there any limitation in the Federal Constitution on methods of distributing the electorates in the House of Representatives. The only provision is that the number of electorates in each State shall be proportionate to the population of the respective States. For very many years, there had been legislation stating that the number of electors in divisions for this House should not exceed or faU short of the aver-",25,Newport Powerhouse

It failed to pass the Senate3 times. honour he would resign rather than find scapeIt has now been passed at a joint sitting following a double dissolution which was based on the first 2 refusals by the Senate. A referendum was put to the people at the Federal election in May which would have introduced the principle that there should be as nearly as practicable the same number of people in all electorates in this House and in each of the State parliaments. The referendum would have written into the Australian Constitution in respect of the Federal Parliament and the State parliaments the provisions which the United States Supreme Court, in interpretating the United States Constitution, has applied to the Federal Congress and all the State Legislatures. The referendum was carried in New South Wales. It was almost carried in Victoria. But it was not carried in the other 4 States, nor by the electorate as a whole. If that referendum had been carried there would have had to be democracy in all the State parliaments in the way that we have been able to achieve it statutorily in this Federal Parliament. I regret to inform the honourable gentlemen that the State parliaments, except that of New South Wales, can extend their lives for as long as they like and that supposed to be that every man has his price. This there is no constitutional limitation on their capacity to malapportion or gerrymander the electorates constituting each State Parliament.

Treasurer)Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. ber claim to have been misrepresented? references to certain things which have appeared in the Press and which were said over television in the last few days. First, I shall read from the 'Financial Review' of Friday, 22 November. An article appears under the name of Mr Brian Toohey with the description: 'Crean goes quietly'. This is a prime example of the mixture of fact andfictionwhich it seems is becorning the standard of reporting. I think the implication is extract goes from page 1 to a later page and it states: Apparently Mr Whitlam was also aware of the fact that Mr Crean would have to stay on as a Minister if he was to collect his full ministerial pension. A Minister needs 2 years in office before he can draw his full pension. This comes up at Christmas for Mr Crean, which means that if he really wanted to he could resign then, giving scope for a new elecuon to Cabinet and a reshuffle. First, I want to say that I was responsible more than a year ago for introducing legislation into this House to abolish the ministerial pension. Even before I became a MinisterI was qualified for all the pension entitlement that I can ever receive. I simply say that this is an example of the standard of reporting. Because there would be people. One is named Kelly who writes in a newspaper called the 'Australian' which once had the chance to be a great paper but is certainly receding from that position. The other gentleman is named Forsyth who writes for a paper called the 'Telegraph' which nobody ever thought was great.

One article purports to describe an incident which took place between my wife and the Prime Mimster( Mr Whitlam). This is an incident which never took place. Both parties will indicate that. Yet one of these journalists says that because the report came from an impeccable source he is prepared to print it. No denial has been made of the second incident. At least there has been no indication of a denial in the Press. On Thursday night the Leader of the House( Mr statement in connection with the report. Daly) spoke during the adjournment debate on my behalf. I am not normally an emotional man but I think I would have been a little too emotional on Thursday night to do what my colleague, the Leader of the House, did for me. That evening a television station put over a flash news item based on a telephone call. The item suggested that one of my sons had rung up the television station and had used language which I have taught my sons not to regard as the cream of the EngUsh language. Why would any television station base a news item on a telephone call without checking the source?

73,Mr Cross,"Honourabl e members may rereach Yirrkala as soon as possible after this, the moment of its presentation to Parliament. Honourable members will appreciate the reasons why the report could not be sent at any earlier time. In further keeping with its promise, the Standing Committee has agreed that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) and myself, as Chairman, should go to Yirrkala as soon as possible. Mr Speaker, I feel a need to say that every member of the Standing Committee ended the examination of the present conditions of the Aboriginal people at Yirrkala with a sense of regret that 10 years had to pass before any Parliament or Government after 1963 took up the recommendation made by the Select Committee in that year that the House from time to time, by means of a standing committee, should examine conditions at Yirrkala and monitor the carrying out of the Select Committee's recommendations. I am not sure, of course, but it is at least possible that had such a committee been in being over the decade 1963-1973 some of the anxiety of the Aboriginal people might have been mitigated, and some of the problems which now face them and governments alike might have been less difficult. I must not fail to say that every member of the Standing Committee also ended the examination with a heightened respect and deepened admiration for the Aboriginal people because of the dignity and forthright honesty of their testimony before the Committee. We hope that our better insight into the life values which the Aboriginal leaders are trying to protect and maintain will be evident in the terms of our report. I trust that these remarks will not be interpreted merely as conventional expressions of goodwill because that would devalue the sustained and patient effort made by both sides to reach a meeting of minds on some problems of extraordinary difficulty to which no-one at present has the precise answers. The Aboriginal people of north-east Arnhem Land had to learn how to adapt themselves, at least in a measure, to foreigners of different outlook and custom long before Europeans intruded on them. They did so very successfully but without surrendering their own integrity and identity. It was perhaps this experience, protracted over several centuries, which may explain 2 qualities forcefully borne in upon the understanding of the Standing Committee-the remarkably tolerant attitude towards other life styles, coupled with an insistence, at least among their leaders, on maintaining their own traditional ways. But the people of today face difficulties which have no real precedent and lie beyond the range of any experience they have ever had. I invite honourable members to reflect for a moment upon the differences of scale, rate and complexity in the technological and industrial revolution which has burst upon these people compared with anything that went before. There have been innumerable examples in tropical Australia of small scale ventures by Europeans investing modest capital for development at a leisurely rate with fairly simple technology and minimal labour forces. All too often the effects on neighbouring Aboriginal societies were catastrophic. At Yirrkala and elsewhere one looks at large scale investment-hundred s of millions of dollars compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars-alread y producing a handsome return and necessarily involving an enormously complex technology. It was impossible for the Standing Committee to avoid the conclusion that the Aboriginal people rightly fear the outcome upon the stability and sanctity of their own life style. These matters are dealt with at some length in the report. The experience at Yhrkala will relate to other enterprises of a similar kind which are under consideration elsewhere in Northern Australia or where Aborigines live in a traditional manner. We have expressed our appreciation to all who assisted in any way, particularly Mr Adamson, the clerk to the Committee, Mr Peter Reece, Miss Andrea Larkin and Professor W. E. H. Stanner, our speciahst adviser. I add our thanks to the Australian Government Publishing Service and the Printer for printing our report so attractively at short notice. I thank my fellow committee members of all political persuasions for their hard work and good fellowship. Our deliberations have been a pleasure as well as a duty. I commend this report to all members for their careful study and consideration. Discussion of Matter of Public Importance the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Lynch) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The dangerously misconceived view held by the Treasurer designate that Australia's high level of inflation and unemployment are derived from external economic events. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.",28,Standing Committee On Aboriginal Affairs
74,Mr Speakeri Have Received A Letter From,"(More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places) sition Parties have brought forward this matter today because of our serious concern at the recent pubhc statements made by the Treasurerdesignate, the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns), a senior Minister who was widely proclaimed throughout the media as the principal architect of the disastrous 1974-75 Budget. He is a Minister who gave his agreement to the destructive 'across the board' tariff cuts and who has in fact presided over a serious deterioration in Australia's balance of trade. The Treasurerdesignate of this country has consistently adopted the propaganda line that inflation and unemployment in Australia are products of the international economic environment or the so called system. The corollary of this argument is, of course, that neither the present levels of inflation nor of unemployment have resulted from Labor's economic policies. In fact, the honourable gentlemen has even exceeded this argument by consistently claiming that Labor's economic policies have been so appropriate that they have held back inflation to around 20 per cent when otherwise it would haverisento 30 per cent. This is a dangerous and irresponsible approach by a Minister who is to have the primary responsibility for the Australian economy within a period of some 3 weeks. It demonstrates, I believe, an attachment to propaganda and dialectic in place of disciplined economic analysis. If there is a public acceptance of the proposition that Australia's economic problems are externally induced or that they derive from the system itself, the Government's capacity to apply corrective policies and the community's willingness to accept those policies will be dangerously eroded. On 28 July, at the Australian Labor Party Conference, the honourable gentleman delivered a speech which could only be described as a gross distortion in terms of its economic analysis. On3 occasions he referred to the causes of innation, and I quote to the House each of them: The inflauon today is private enterprise inflation and it is raise funds. internauonal inflation. It is bank-caused inflauon at high interest rates. . . . inflation is not the result or the fault of the mentary statement which, of course, this ParliaGovernment.

In a short period of time, Chifley Memorial lecture: No one, and no government, need do anything but learn to live with inflation. Yet, in total and complete contradiction to these comments, on 30 May the honourable gentleman claimed that: Australia with a Labor Government has the opportunity to prove now that inflation can be brought under control . . . He was further quoted in the Melbourne 'Age' on 16 September as having said: Governments can and must lead in the fight against inflation. Australia's future Treasurer clearly has one view on Monday and is quite capable of taking the opposite view on the subsequent Tuesday. It simply depends on whom he is talking to or the last person to whom he talked. It must be understood and emphasised that the Minister has at all times been a senior and principal participant in those basic decisions which have led in this country to rampant inflation and an uncontrolled increase in the level of unemployment. As a member of the Cabinet he agreed to the famous July miniBudget which was introduced as a so-called tough and decisive measure towards curbing inflation. The extraordinary thing was, however, that the next day the honourable gentleman announced that the July mini-Budget was not deflationary; on the contrary, he believed that increased government charges would add to cost inflation. « The future Treasurer, on the subject of wages, has alternatively called for increased wages to protect workers against inflation and then dominated the Australian Press headlines by making so-called tough statements about restraining them. What about the multi-nationals and the flood of foreign money themes? The honourable gentleman was quoted in the 'Australian ' on 30 September as having said: Multi-national corporations, far from being"" sinister, are easier to deal with than some other companies. The honourable gentleman seems to have forgotten the evils of foreign money as well.

77,Mr Lynch,"That is a matter for a parliaeconomic trampolinist. He is all things to all men-a n alleged friend of business and at the same time the darling of left wing radicalism. If he speaks to the Labor Party he blames the system and private enterprise. If he speaks to business he talks about the importance of the private sector and the need for Australia to produce its way out of inflation. This matter of public importance has been brought forward today to discuss the question of imported innation and the so-called system. The Opposition Parties totally reject both arguments. We believe they are irresponsible and dishonest. The Deputy Prime Minister has an opportunity today to discount them or to re-affirm them. The 1972 Treasury White Paper on the economy concluded that external factors had some impact but that much the greater part of innation is derived from domestic influences. In spite of official requests and a series of requests by me the Government has refused to permit the Treasury to update that analysis. The Government has argued the monetarist theory of additions to liquidity via the balance of payments surplus-the flood of foreign money theory-bu t Australia has had a negative external balance during 1974. The Government has argued that world commodity prices have caused domestic prices, particularly meat prices, to increase in response but the food price index is becoming a progressively less influential component of the consumer price index. It has argued that the world oil crisis has forced up Australian domestic costs, but Australia is virtually isolated from international oil price increases and the price of domestic crude oil is fixed. The Government has argued that Australian inflation is simply reflectlong term average between 1961 and 1971. The ing the general price rises in comparable countries. That is demonstrably untrue. Inflation in Australia has increased during the past 12 months at a rate well in excess of that of every comparable world economy in relation to its long term average. Only one country has a higher rate of accelerating inflation than Australia and that is Greece. Japan's rate of 23.8 per cent is higher than ours. But, Japan, as honourable gentlemen on both sides of the House ought to understand, has had an historical long term inflation rate twice that of AustraUa. It is now less than twice the Australian rate of inflaAustralia's high relative rate of inflauon. It takes tion.

The table sets out the ratio of each country's present annual inflation rate in relation to its ratio for the total OECD is 3.8. AustraUa's ratio is 5.8. The rate of inflation in Australia has accelerated at a rate well above the average. The ratios of the major OECD countries are well below that of Australia. For example, in Japan the ratio is 3.8, in the United States of America 3.9, in France 3.4, in Germany 2.4, in the United Kingdom 3.7 and in Canada 3.8. All economic advice would accept that the extent to which economies have changed relative to their previous trends is the correct method of comparison. This comparison is a conservative analysis of no account of world oil price increases. The OECD has pointed out that around one-third of the recent increases in inflation in oil importing nations arises directly from increased oil prices. The simple fact is that Australia is not importing inflation; it is exporting inflation. On 20 November, in this House, the Minister referred",30,Inflation And Unemployment In Australia
78,Mr Speaker,"I s leave granted? There beingto income demand rising in 1971-72 because of international factors. At that time the Treasury clearly indicated that this was not a major element of the innation rate. In fact, the inflation rate was 4.5 per cent at the end of 1972. Of course, the Opposition Parties accept that some proportion of domestic inflation is imported. I emphasise that fact in response to a question answered by the honourable gentleman during question time in the House today. We have never denied that some proportion of the inflation rate in this country is imported. But the proposition that we put is that this is not the major cause. The major cause of inflation is the policy errors of the present Labor Administration. It is no use claiming that Treasury statistical advice led to the adoption of incorrect policies. The Opployment level of around 1,000 people, which is position's major economic policy statements, issued in April and July this year, clearly identified the future down-turn in employment and private sector activity. These are 2 major problems which are bedevilling the economy and this Government at the present time. I challenge the honourable gentleman to tell the House today during this debate just how and by what mechanism inflation is being imported into Australia. If he believes that it is, he should spell out what be well aware that the New Zealand Governthe transmission mechanisms are and what are their relative influences. I also challenge the honourable gentleman to demonstrate how unemployment in Australia results from external economic events and not from this Government's imposed credit squeeze and its decision concerning tariff reductions. In spite of the fact that a significant number of OECD nations have incurred a down-turn in economic activity, none of them have unemployment levels significantly higher than their long-term averages.

I challenge the Minister to say precisely why New Zealand has not suffered Uke Australia with skyrocketing unemployment. The Mimster should ment is deeply concerned by the prospect of unemployment being exported from AustraUa to New Zealand. As with inflation, AustraUa is not an importer; it is, in fact, an exporter of its economic problems. If the Minister seeks to make vaUd economic comparisons-thos e which have some prospect of forming a meaningful basis for an effective economic policyI suggest that he reads the OECD's 1974 economic survey of AustraUa. That survey said this: The available evidence suggests that . . . the change in the rate of inflation has been the greatest in those countries where the share of public expenditure has been most rapid. Australia's massive acceleration in public expenditure is entirely consistent with that significant OECD report. In short, the Opposition totally rejects the thesis of imported inflation which this Government has sought to bring down to confuse the economic debate which is taking place in this country. On no occasion has the Government attempted to substantiate that proposition with detailed evidence, which the honourable gentleman must know ought to be available from Treasury sources, either to confirm or deny it.

82,Mr Lynchi Will Answer The Honourable,"Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-(Lalor-Minister for Overseas Trade) (3.34)-In entering this debate the thing that strikes me the most is the ease with which speakers from the other side of the House openly accuse those of us on this side of the House of an immoral and corrupt attitude. The honourable gentleman says that we are doing something that is wrong. We could be wrong. But he goes on to say that we are deliberately doing this to deceive and to confuse the debate. He finds somewhere in us a significant moral fault. He thinks and argues that we are morally corrupt. I do not think it is necessary to conduct a debate using that language. I am constantly aware of it easily tripping off the tongue of people on the other side of the House who pretend to have a right to be a Minister. Frankly, I have had enough of it and I do not intend to enter into that kind of debate. We are debating an alternative view of the Australian economy at the moment. The Opposition is trying to say that what is happening in Australia today is almost alone the result of something that is occurring in AustraUa and that there is some influence from outside. It was only today that the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Lynch), the shadow Minister at the table, was prepared to make that admission. He says that there is some innuence, but not much. What is happening here, he has argued all the way through his speech, is the result of something that is only Australian. When we look inside AustraUa to try to find what that is, he is saying that it is simply Government policy, that nothing else is of importance in Australia but the Government. This political analysis, which ignores all the economic factors, is a dangerous analyis because it is hiding from the spokesmen of the Opposition as well as from those who lead the Opposition all that an analysis can tell them. On top of that not only is he saying it is the fault of Mr Meany is reaUy saying here that this is a the Government but also that the Government is deliberately doing this to deceive the people. He finds that moral fault and that corruption in the Government. I do not think that kind of approach helps in the solution of this problem at all. Today, in 1974, if there is any outstanding feathe honourable member of the statements of a ture of the world economy, it is interdependence few people who are not trade unionists. There is and interrelationship. Today we are part of a Saburo Okita, of the Japan Overseas Coworld economy and when something happens on operation Fund, and a leading spokesman in the other side of the earth, particularly in a Japan. He says: nation like the United States, it is not long before it is transferred round the world. When somecountry's excessive control could affect other countries, it thing happens in one part of the world which takes global co-operation to attack the problem. controls the greater part of the world's energy Through what Mr Okita says is the basic assumpresources, as does the Middle East, it is not long tion, which in every country but this is taken as before it is transferred all round the world. Today we Uve in a world which is one world and which is one economic system. Not only are those things transferred from one country to another but also we have the same kinds of systems. We have an economic organisation which is the same as that in the United States and in Western Europe. I have just recently been in 11 countries and perhaps I have had the opportunity, which is denied to the spokesman for the Opposition, of finding out what people in other parts of the world think. I find that they, in analysing their own economic situation in the United States or in Western Europe, are using exactly the same terms as we use here. I will quote just a few. If the honourable gentleman would Uke to find a precis of the comments he will find it in 'Newsweek' of 30 September 1974. The statements I intend looking at are representative of the comments of some of the leading minds in the world looking at the same economic problems as we look at. What did theyfind?George Meany, President of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organisations says: The most important single step the United States can take to improve the international economic picture is to solve its own economic mess. It must be remembered that one shot actions can compound world wide problems . . . America and the free world have very great capital needs Tor housing, business expansion and public services, and these legitimate needs should not be forced to compete for capital with gambling casinos. Similarly, we have long called for strict regulation of the commodity speculators . . . Mr Meany says that the 'paper' deals of the commodity speculators have had tremendous world wide consequences. He continued: The United States must solve its own economic problems before it attempts to solve the world economic problems. world situation, that the United States has a crucial situation in it, that the United States has to act in certain ways if the world problem is to be solved and that the solution is long term.

CAIRNS-I refer next to Ernst Mommsen, the chairman of Krupp in Germany, not a trade union leader, I hope honourable members opposite will notice, who says: The prevention of a world wide recession is the task of the boom in exports in 1972-73 and the capital surplus countries. They have to take care that their economic inflow. Changes in the economic system that growth does not decline. Efforts should even be made to raise the present growth rates . . .

But no, that is not something world seeking resources poured into Australia to that the Opposition in this country wants to the extent of $3,200m in a year 1972-73. That recognise. The Opposition in this country simply wants to which the spokesmen on the other side of the say that there is something terribly wrong here in House confine themselves to try to tell the people Australia; it has occurred alone as the result of something that is happening in Australia, and that something is the fault of the Government. I say that that is a completely deceiving situation. Not only do the price statistics show how deceptive it is; even the structure of industry and the changes within the structure of industry show how deceptive it is. I have here a document of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing price percentage changes for the year to September 1974. The change for Australia is 16.1 per cent. That of course is high. But what is the position of the other countries shown in this table? We find the following changes recorded: Japan 23.8 per cent; France Kingdom 17.1 per cent; Belgium 15.6 per cent; Denmark 15.9 per cent; Ireland 17.9 per cent; Iceland 41.4 per cent; Portugal 28.7 per cent; Spain 15.2 per cent; and Turkey 25.5 per cent. 14.5 per cent-al l comparable with Australia. If honourable members look at the causes of this development they will see the reasons for the changes in the rate about which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Warringah are trying to interject. The reasons for the changes in the rate are the different impacts upon those economies of the have followed are consistent and confirm that. In the case of AustraUa, there was a far greater tremendous amount of money was pumped into the Australian economy and hardly any ofit was boom. A minerals boom did not occur in Europe. What happened? Money from all over the did not happen in Europe. Those are the reasons for the difference in the rate.

89,Dr Cairns,"Yes, economic isolationism. European countries. But this political analysis toof Australia that there is only one thing wrong with the country, and that is the Government, is blinding honourable members opposite to all of these factors. We had a boom in capital inflow of $3,500m in less than a year. None of it was neutralised in those days. Every cent of it was allowed to come in here and push the economy into an inflationary phase. As soon as the Australian Labor Party became the Government it tried to regulate those 2 things and to reduce the rate of inflation. If the previous Government had acted properly and had analysed the situation properly this would have happened a year before. But this Government did it as soon as it was able to exercise control in this country. As I said the other day when debating this subject, top-ranking economists in Australia like Trevor Swan have expressed the opinion that if the Government had not appreciated the currency and taken other steps to control capital inflow, inflation would be 10 per cent greater than it is now. Having done that and having reduced the inflationary pressures, it is obvious that in circumstances like this there will be certain industrial changes within the country. The striking thing is that the pattern of industrial change in Australia is exactly the same as the pattern everywhere else. I have here production statistics for 1974. They show that, up to the latest figures, even in this period of recession in Australia, 19 out of 33 items in the recorded production statistics rose. Raw steel rose by 6 per cent, blooms and slabs rose by 8.7 per cent, tinplate rose by 13.9 per cent and so on. In almost every comparable country the number of rises is smaller than that but they are for the same commodities in which Australia shows rises. Up to the latestfiguresfalls were recorded in 14 items in Australia. If one looks at every one of the European Economic Community countries in the statistics of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development one will find that the number is about the same, with a dozen commodities showing falls. Not only in Europe but also in Hong Kong, Singapore and wherever else one likes to look, the falls are about the same and they are in the same industries. Pig iron is down 7.3 per cent, clay bricks are down 15.2 per cent, Portland cement is down 6 per cent, floor coverings are down 25.6 per cent, radio sets are down 73.5 per cent, cars and station wagons are down 3.2 per cent, and woollen woven cloth is down 38.5 per cent. These falls are mainly in 3 areas-the textile industry, the building industry and the electronics and automotive industry. In other countries the falls are more serious than they are in Australia, but they are in the same kinds of commodities. This suggests that inflation is caused by the same kinds of things-by the international flow of funds spent on exports, by international investment and so on-as in 1972-73. But the steps taken to control inflation are the same everywhere. I recommend to the Opposition spokesman that he look at 'Newsweek' of 30 September 1974. He will see that Paul Samuelson who is probably the most influential economist in the United States of America says that it is necessary to restrain the economy, it is necessary to have a credit squeeze and it is necessary that interest rates be higher. But, he says, whilst this policy is common throughout the world, it has the consequences to which I have referred in those production statistics. They are the same everywhere. What has happened in Australia is therefore the same. Samuelson goes on to say that, even though this is necessary, do not let it go too far. His advice to President Ford is: Don't encourage the overly tight policies of the Federal Reserve, which have been killing the housing market and gradually increasing the gravity of stagnation. Don't think that some puritanical budget-cutting will suffice . . . Don't listen to your advisers who claim that bringing unemployment up to 6 per cent and holding it there for a couple of years will restore the economy . . . This is exactly the kind of thing I have been saying over the last 6 months, not always with the agreement of some of the Government's advisers. This matter is one of veryfineand acute judgment in which the Government can perhaps be wrong. The Opposition can be wrong too, although it may never have occurred to its members. I am suggesting that unless the Opposition can make an analysis of the situation on economic terms and getridof the simple political stuff it has been pumping out to the House today, it is bound not only to be wrong but also to be seen to be wrong. Order! The Minister's time has expired. sition has today brought forward this matter of public importance: The dangerously misconceived view held by the Treasurer designatewho has just resumed his seatthat Australia's level of inflauon and unemployment are derived from external economic events. The whole tone of the speech of the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) was that none of the conditions in Australia today are his fault. Indeed, he adopted a very injured tone. He was inclined to take up some time in complaining",34,Inflation And Unemployment In Australia

91,Mr Garland (Curtin) (3.50),"The Oppothat we have an immoral position and that it is only he who has the moral position. Dr. J. F. Cairns-Surely this is a debate on the economy. Minister had more time than I have and he is just trying to squander my time. He quoted statements of various people overseas in a way that would indicate that they were quotes by eminent people which undercut the arguments of the Opposition. He laid great stress on saying that what we have in Australia today in high inflation and high unemployment is a world problem. He even made some attempt to bolster this argument by referring to the mineral boom of 1970, grasping at straws, and ended with these words: 'As soon as we became the Government we tried to reduce innation.' Those words are on the record. At the end of 1972 inflation was 4.7 per cent, and the Deputy Prime Minister knows that full well. His statement was made, I believe, deliberately to mislead. But the point I make in response to all his quotations is that nobody on this side-n o leader, no shadow Minister-ha s said that all the problem is made in Australia. The Goverament has made that case the foundation of its argument-that we have been maintaining that the problems in Australia are all created in Australia. Point out to me one shadow Minister or leading spokesman for the Opposition who has said so and where it is recorded. It emerges from the speech of the Deputy Prime Minister that he is not really trying to face up to the reality that Australia has to live with at the hatredI use that word deUberately-of busithe present. He is trying only to explain it away. He said at one point: 'Well, maybe I am wrong.' I believe he is wrong. But the rest of his speech does not indicate for one moment that he imagines he is wrong. On the contrary, he and the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) go round Australia finding scapegoats everywhere. Now it is the Treasury; it was the Treasurer ( Mr Crean). They sacked him. They blame the multinationals, the Press, big business, the nervous Nellies of the Caucus, world wide inflation, the Senate, the State Premiers-especiall y at the moment the Queensland Premier-the unions, the airUne pilots, the Caucus and the weather. AU those things in turn have been blamed but the fact of the matter is that it is the Government which has the greatest influence-no t the only influence-in this country, and it just wiU not face up to the facts. Let me quote the comment of an AustraUan on tion rate is half ours and, incidentally, the emthis. I think the comment is as succinct as any. It ploymentfigureis less than 1,000 there. There is was made by Sir John Marks quite recently at the something that this offshore island can teach us. annual general meeting of shareholders of F & T Industries Ltd. He said: True, we are not the only country in the world to experience inflation. We are frequently reminded of this and consoled with pious observations that our level is about half way up the world scale. Make no mistake about it-mos t of our inflation has the label 'Made in Australia' firmly attached to it. Our economy is quite different to those of most of the countries with which we are being compared. We do not, as yet, have to impon substantial quantities of oil; we are self-supporting in food, minerals and most raw materials; we have a strong secondary industry capable of meeting, if necessary, the greater pan of our requirements for manufactured goods. That gives the Ue to all those quotauons that were given by the Minister. The Government in fact during its period of office has failed to act when the money supply was too great, as it was in 1973. It allowed our great reserves, which at one stage were $6,000m, to be frittered away. It reduced that buffer we had against the outside world largely by its cut of the tariffs by an unselective 25 per cent. It has actively encouraged increases in wages demands and conditions demands. It bunt up in this country an expectation that every desire, every ideal objective, could be answered and answered quickly. The Government is the cause of the great cost push inflation and the rising costs in this country which allowed our inflation rate to get to a much higher level than it should have reached. This Government has indulged in business bashing to the point where very few companies in this country today wish to invest. They do not have confidence because they do not know what is around the corner. This position has arisen because of ness, which most members of the Labor Party in this place have, both international and Australian business. As a consequence the Government has ruined productivity in this country. It has ruined that confidence which is so necessary to expand the productive sector of this country. I do not mean only the private sector but also the sector that actually produces or attempts to produce a surplus. When Dr Cairns, the Deputy Prime Minister, comes in here and in order to make an argument which he can answer, says 'You are trying to say that aU Australia's problems are internal', he exaggerates the charge out of all common sense. No one is saying that. No one is making such an unquaUfied statement. But I will say that half our innation rate is caused by this Government's poUcies over the last 2 years. In New Zealand, as we heard earUer, the infla-",35,Inflation And Unemployment In Australia
92,Mr Garland,"Mr Deputy Speaker, theIt is well known that New Zealand's Labor Ministers privately criticise the Ministers of this Government and their silly pohcies. Anyone who cares to go there and talk to them will hear it said quite freely. On all these great issues facing the country the Prime Minister is virtually silent and when he does speak on economic matters, what an unconvincing man he is. The fact of the matter is that he is uninterested in economic matters. He is unsure and he runs away from them as often as possible. The Government has taken a number of steps in order to meet the situadon. It has received much criticism from its own back benchers and no doubt Labor Party branches and of course the Press. But the measures that have been takenunfortunately I do not have the time to analyse them as I would like to-hav e for the most part been ill-timed and spasmodic and in many cases the Government has let golden opportunities pass by. I will mention one of these. The Government had the opportunity before the Budget was brought down to have that conference which was so badly needed with unions and industry to provide a chance to make some sort of a contract, but it threw it away. There was an opportunity to say to the unions, 'We are prepared to do many things, for example, to alleviate pressure in the area in welfare and to help with other areas if you will moderate your demands' but it threw it away and it will not come again as easily as it did before. I have referred to the Government's attitude of finding blame. It blames everybody. It blames everybody who comes along. Most recently it is the Treasury officials whose dedication surely can hardly be doubted by any member of this House who has ever talked to them. But the crux of the matter is that this Government will simply not face economic facts. It encourages inflation and particularly cost inflation. It has mishandled the money supply from beginning to end. The Prime Minister's only economic knowledge is expressed in talking about 'too much money chasing too few goods,' but he does not even seem to know how to control this aspect either. The Government has put forward the view that it is trying to enter into some social contract with unions. It has no chance whatever of succeeding the way it is going about it. This matter of public importance has been brought forward today to point out to the Australian people the dangerous situation. It is dangerous because we are being lulled into a false sense of security. Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Security) (4.0)I am never quite sure what revelations are released for the listening public when we have debates on economic matters. I think the greatest fault that develops in these debates is the way in which they are exceedingly simplified and excessively confusing. I believe that that has been the general trend of the Opposition, and especially that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) in the course of the debate which he initiated to day. This tendency to over-simplify and confuse is not the greatest defect in the development of debate here. Probably misrepresentation is more pernicious, as is the misrepresentation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in asserting that the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has stated that the sole cause of inflation and unemployment in this country comes from outside forces. This is an excellent example of what I mean. I put it to the House that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made it quite clear in the course of the debate, when he quoted a range of statements made by the Deputy Prime Minister, that had he reflected on the speech that had been written for him and understood it instead of merely reading it, then he would have realised that a substantial content of that speech was based on quotations from the Deputy Prime Minister which reflected an understanding of the comprehensive range of forces which are at work in any economy, whether it is a stable or a destabilised one, and whether it is an economy that is or is not suffering from inflation and any other attendant problem that can come with economic management. There are a range of forces at work at any giventime.This was acknowledged again today by the Deputy Prime Minister. Thank goodness at least the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Garland) had the decency and the intellectual self-respect to acknowledge that external forces can affect the performance of a domestic economy. They are, he said, among many forces that can affect the economy. That is exactly what has been said consistently by the Deputy Prime Minister, not only in this House but also in statements which he has made outside the House. But I do not want to waste any more time on that point, except to restate for the record that it is foolish to a dangerous degree for speakers like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to stand up in this House and take one small sector of the economy",36,Inflation And Unemployment In Australia
93,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Scholes),,37,Inflation And Unemployment In Australia
94,Mr Hayden (Oxley,"Minister for Socialand try to dissect that and to assert that that alone is the sole issue that has to be discussed. Anyone who says that economic management in this country is a simple matter of saying something 3 times and thus making it right-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition adopts that principle; he is Australia's Alice of economic management-is talking nonsense. Anyone who tries to imply that, ignoring totally the forces that level of over $4,000m, was that money had been work internationally and which press in on this economy or any other domestic economy, proves that he is illiterate in economic matters. Let us quickly look at the international situation with regard to Australia and at how substantiaUy influential it is or is not on our domestic economy. The first point I make is that Australia has a very high involvement in international trade. The world is an open market; AustraUa is largely an open market. We have tariffs and of course we have other forms of protection. We are stUl involved very heavUy in world trade, and in fact exports as a percentage of gross domestic product for this country exceed 15 per cent, while imports reach nearly 18 per cent. So the immediate impression is that what is happening in overseas countries will have a fairly powerful influence on how the economy of this country performs. For instance, in a situation of international inflation, on the side of imports which are inputs for industry, especially capital inputs, there will be a push on prices and costs of production. So quite clearly there is a de-stabilising effect if there is rapidly accelerating innation overseas. Similarly, if a situation arises where exceedingly high prices are paid for our exports, and in conjunction with this a very high proportion of our goods are being exported but we are not importing a commensurate quantity of goods from other countries, then we get a very destabilising influence on our domestic economy. That is exactly what was set in train in the last part of 1972. The problem with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that he beUeves that if a person who has a large amount of money in his savings bank account can therefore be said to be in an economically sound position, a large accumulation of reserves in the nation's overseas accounts must be healthy for the national economy. That is utter nonsense. The high level of reserves which we inherited and which continued to build up because of the momentum which had been set in force by the actions of the last leave granted? There being no objection, leave is Government were, in fact, a reflection of a very granted. unhealthy economic situation. Because of AustraUa's unreal and completely irresponsible exchange rate it was a bargain for overseas countries to buy Australian resources in terms of their real spending power. Of course they bought Australian exports. People borrowed money overseas and rushed it into this country to buy up control of AustraUan resources, because the bargain was on. So we had an enormous accumulation of overseas reserves. All that meant, at that pumped into the AustraUan economy without an equivalent volume of goods and services and it accordingly swelled to a very unhealthy degree the money supply within the country. There alone are some of the forces at work. Let us look quickly at the international situation and how it impinged on the AustraUan economy. The year 1972 was bad for world food production. In the Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs, Africa, India and Asia food production was below normal and so grain prices, particularly for wheat andrice,rocketed. Naturally this country, because among other things it is a great grain producer, suffered-o r enjoyed, however you want to look at ita commodity boom. This is another reason why there were destabilising forces in the AustraUan economy. These effects fdter right through into the domestic market place, too. For example, in 1973 food prices in AustraUa increased by 21 per cent or were responsible for 47 per cent of the increase in the consumer price index. Even though we are more fortunate than most countries, we still face the problem of the oil crisis because we have a dependency on oU from overseas sources. Because we are so heavily involved in the international trade economy, what happens to our trading partners in their trade between each other and in their association with the oil supplying countries also filters into this country. The oil crisis had been one of the most destabilising, if not in the longer term devastating, economic effects that has hit the world economy. In fact, the sharp increase in energy prices is undoubtedly the most severe shock that the world economy has experienced since the Second World War. Present estimates are that approximately US$50 billion per annum will flow to the oil producing nations. That alone has an extremely destabilising influence on the world economy. I ask leave to have a table on this very point incorporated in Hansard. (The document read as foUows)-",37,Inflation And Unemployment In Australia

What is significant is the massive movement of reserves towards the oil producing countries. For instance, in the year ending 30 June 1974 Saudi Arabia had an increase over the previous year of 129 per cent in its reserves. In the same period Iran had an increase of 350 per cent in its reserves and Iraq had an increase of over 141 per cent.

It is an attempt to help the Aboriginal people to stand on their own feet and to hold situation, and the first one I shall mention is that their heads high.

101,"Try, Both State And Commonwealth, Should Honourable Member For Mackeuar ( Mr Went","all honourable members on this side of the House will applaud it. We believe in home ownership. I contrast what the Government is doing in this Bill with the shift in its policy regarding home ownership generally. The Labor Party, for some reason that I have never understood, seems to think that Australians would be better off in rental homes. At least for Aboriginal people the Labor Party has come to recognise the benefits of home ownership and the pride and care that go with it. In the past the Labor Party has said a lot about paternalism and in particular has criticised the paternalism of the missions. I caution now that we do not substitute for this paternalism by government because it would be equally, if not more, damaging for exactly the same reasons. There is a need to decentralise authority and to allow Aboriginals who are on the spot to make decisions about their own affairs for in that way will they best hold their heads high. In fact, my whole argument rests on the point that there is a need for the Aboriginal to feel that he is a part of what he is doing, to feel pride in what he is doing and gradually to build his own self respect. This Bill will help the Aboriginal succeed when judged by, what are admittedly, largely European criteria. But he is to be helped to do it in ways that will be more akin to the traditional Aboriginal ways. Hence this enhances his chances of success. What of the rest of the Aboriginal population? What of those who will not be helped by this honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Hunt) Bill? After all, this is a very selective measure, made a number of remarks on which the honourand rightly so.

It will be a long the abysmal situation as it existed then and still hard road for these people, and I think that the European community will have to be very understanding. I think that the European community has an obligation to be very understanding and to recognise that because these Abonginal people are different things will be difficult for them. The purpose of the Bill is to help a people move towards an honoured place in a society that will remain dominated by Europeans. The purpose of the Bill is to help the Aboriginal to help himself. The money to be provided under this Bill will not be a gift; it will be a loan. Consequently, it will not be something that saps the Aboriginal's will. The Aboriginal people have something to offer the European people. In spite of anytliing I can do to assist the Aboriginal people, I am a European and as such I will always think as a European. I will never be able consciously to think as someone else. Martin Luther King said referring to another substantial minority that these people will help towards achieving a society 'where we will come to see that integration is not a problem but an opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity'. That is a beautiful concept. It is a concept that will help us to value a minority group among the European population. nouncing the Opposition's attitude to this Bill the But I think that the honourable member for Gwydir could do a much greater service to structive attitude as far as Aboriginal affairs and",41,States Grants Aboriginal Assistance Bill 1974

It might be as well for him to heritage. I think that the relevant legislation remind the whites in our community today of the which exists there is probably the best in disgraceful record of their forebears and to Australia. This Bill-the States Grants (Aboriginal AsAustralians. It seems to me that is a far better sistance) Bill is mainly concerned with the proway of trying to fight the so-called white backvision of money. In effect it nearly doubles the lash than trying to hide the measures which this amount of money which the Australian GovernGovernment is taking and trying to explain them ment is spending on Aboriginal affairs. As far as away as if the people who receive the support Western Australia is concerned it provides for were not really deserving ofit. the amount granted to the State Government to increase from just over $ 11 m last year to exactly $14m this year. That compares more than lems which are being tackled by this Governfavourably with the provision in 1971-72, for ment and by the Western Australian Governinstance, of $2.5m. So one can say that there has ment as a result of the many initiatives which been a very massive increase in the amount of money which this Government has made available for Aboriginal affairs. Of course, the question we are talking about is far from being simply one of money. But, even though one can say that it is not simply a question of money, I think that one must see that provision of adequate fundsthe mobilisation of an adequate network-as being the first requisite. It was not really until this I do not want to remind the House of the remind them that the only reason that things are as they are is the ignorance and neglect of earlier I wish to refer to a couple of the sorts of probwere taken by the previous Western Australian Government and, insofar as it is appropriate, are being continued by the current Western Australian Government or have been taken over entirely by the Australian Government. When people talk about the need for Aborigines to be self-determining one must realise that one cannot just wave a magic wand and expect Aborigines to rise out of the horror of their own situation risen from two to ten. One wonders where those and to know exactly what they want and how they want to achieve it. It is important that we be absolutely strenuous in our attempts to provide for the Aboriginal groups, whom we are expecting to advise us and whom we are expecting to determine Aboriginal policy, the necessary back-up and support so that they are able to give us advice and be able to determine their own destiny. This is one of the areas which can easily be overlooked. It is fair enough for people to say: 'It is not our problem any longer. It is up to the Aborigines to tell us what to do. They are the only ones who know what the solutions are.' Unless we demonstrate our bonafidesby providing massive support and massive back-up services without impinging on their ability to make up their minds, the whole policy of self determination will be little more than a charade. I wish to touch on some of the policy measures and self-sufficient in at least one of their needs. which have been taken and which are a clear demonstration of the intentions of this GovernSpeakerment. There is a very extensive program of purchasing pastoral properties in Western Australia to provide a firm and stable support system for communities which have shown a viability, a coherence and an ability to support themselves economically. That is clearly an important measure to be taken. Rather than providing these communities with a few tumble-down houses on the outskirts of towns in the north-west they are given the economic wherewithal to provide for themselves on a stable and friendly basis. That is what is done in the remote areas. In relation to the metropolitan areas, I refer briefly to an organisation which has emerged as a result of this Government's policy not only of supporting State governments in relation to Aboriginal Affairs but also of providing grants directly to organisations, particularly those which demonstrate a significant amount of Aboriginal control. One of the organisations in Western Australia which has benefited from this policy has been the Aboriginal medical service which in a very short Ufe has grown into something of great significance not only in the Aboriginal community but in Western AustraUa generally. I have here a report of the Workshop on Aboriginal Medical Services which was conducted by the Department of Health in Albury in July this year. An appendix to that report indicates the progress which has been made by the Western Australian Aboriginal medical service. For instance, the appendix shows that from October 1973 until April 1974 the daily average number of patients which attended before it has Aborigines would have gone had it not been for the Aboriginal medical service. On an average that is 70 people a week or 300 people a month now receiving medical attention. It is doubtful whether those Aborigines would have received that medical attention or medical attention as good if this service had not existed. This medical service is controUed substantially by a-committee of Aboriginal people, together with European doctors and nurses and other people who are assisting with the administration. The service is working extremely well and is filling needs as Aborigines see them. It is obviously filling a great need as far as the community is concerned. I point to this organisation as one of the indicators or demonstrations of the way in which this Government is helping to overcome an enormous problem. The Government is helping these Aborigines to become self-determining Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah) (4.43)Mr Motion (by Mr Nicholls) put: That the question be now put. The House divided.

Bill (on motion by Mr Bryant) read a tliird time. 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 November on modon by Mr Daly: That the Bill be now read a second time. teenth of this month the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly) introduced a Bill to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act. When the honourable gentleman introduced the Bill he used a form of words in his second reading speech with which I find myself in complete and ready agreement. May I remind the House of what they were. He said: This Bill is designed to introduce several reforms of a fundamental nature to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The description 'fundamental reforms' is one with which again I find myself in complete and utter agreement. But there, I regret to say, our paths part. One of the melancholy facts of life under the present Government is that it is virtually impossible to have a considered Committee debate upon any measure. To stand in contemplation of having a leisurelyI do not use that term lightly-Committe e debate on this Bill is not something that would fill one with encouragement after the recent performance in the vote of this House just a few moments ago. I say to the Minister, not with any heat at all, because that is rather foreign to my nature, that one of the great pities of this Parliament is the reluctance of the honourable gentleman and of many of his colleagues in the Government to allow a reasonable Committee debate upon Bills. It is of the utmost importance that when we are dealing with the Electoral Act we should seek to reflect a bi-partisan attitude. Regrettably, if we take the view that amendments to the Electoral Act should reflect only one Party's point of view, to that extent, we encourage cynicism and suspicion throughout the entire community. I regret to say that the Minister for Services and Property has done very little to seek to reflect a bi-partisan approach to the question of electoral reform. For example, it would be rather fanciful to say of the honourable gentleman that he speaks from a position offierceneutrality in the matter of electoral reform. Some of his observations which I have listened to over a very long period of time certainly would not stir up in my mind the vision of one who is completely neutral in the matter of electoral reform. I would have hoped that the honourable gentleman, having set his hand to the plough in the matter of electoral reform, would have heeded the simple fact of life in this country that people are suspicious and cynical of governments which do not treat the matter of electoral reform with impartiality. I am talking now about the administration of the Act, the provisions which are to be inserted in the Act and the like. I am not talking about electoral redistribution on which we may all hold our own separate views. But unless there is an impartial approach to the reform and amendment of the ActI believe it is quite impossible to encourage in the Australian community or in any community the belief that we are dealing fairly and impartially with people. As a consequence I would like to see the Minister withdraw this Bill and appoint a joint all party select committee to examine the whole field of electoral reform. I will be referring to some of the aspects in the Bill which trouble me and which I know trouble some of my colleagues. There are 187 of us in this Parliament who are experts in the matter of electoral reform and I will be dealing with some of the matters that may possibly reveal the manner in which I am tinged in terms of disposition to give my support. But I hope the honourable gentleman will be inclined before we finish the second reading debate on this Bill to take a benevolent approach, to take a proper approach, to this Bill and withdraw it and ask the Parliament to appoint a joint all party committee to consider all aspects of the Electoral Act. I say to my friend in simple candour that there are a number of provisions contained in his amending Bill for which he would find generous support on this side of the House. I hope that the honourable gentleman would recognise that there is no virtue in seeking to dragoon members of his Party or, indeed, to attempt to do so in respect of members of this side of the House by saying: 'Vote for the Bill without having an opportunity to consider all of the proposals in detail'. After all, it is only 12 days since the honourable gentleman introduced the Bill. One could hardly describe that as being a substantial time for the members of this Parliament or for the members of the community to reflect upon the consequences of the Bill. I point out that the amending Bill runs to some 43 pages.",45,Pairs
105,Mr Killen (Moreton) (5.0),"On the thirIt has 65 clauses. The Minister himself has identified 34 major alterations to the law. He has described some of the other amendments as fairly minor amendments of a procedural nature. But when we deal with 34 major alterationsI take the honourable gentleman's assessment of what is major-w e are dealing with a matter of very great substance. Further, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I draw to your attention one clause of the Bill. Clause 21 deals with the printing of Party affiliations on ballot papersa provision to which I would turn later. It has no fewer than 22 sub-clauses. The honourable gentleman would need to be swept into the very outer region of expansiveness to give to honourable members a proper Committee debate on some 22 sub-clauses. Our fear, promptly and explicitly expressed, is this: There is no prospect whatsoever of considering in a detailed way what the Minister and the Government have proposed. That is a very great pity indeed. I have referred to this one clause, clause 21, dealing with the registration of political parties. It would be to adopt an AUce in Wonderland attitude to imagine that this one clause is free of controversy. I suspect that the community at large has not had the sUghtest opportunity to consider all of the ramifications in clause 21 of the Bill dealing with the registration of poUtical parties. With your leave, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I would seek to illustrate my general thesis as to the complexity of the BUl and the fact that many of its provisions are studded with contention by turning to clause 21 dealing with the printing of Party affiUations on ballot papers. In summary, this provision seeks to register all poUtical parties in Australia which contest elections. There are some rather curious provisions dealing with this aspect. For example, I turn to the clause which deals with the powers given to the very distinguished and able servant of this country, the present Chief Electoral Officer. These are immense powers. I have no quarrel with the present incumbent of the position holding those powers because those of us have known him over a long period of time recognise and accept the immaculate way in which he has discharged his duty. But the fact remains that these are powers of a very substantial nature which the Minister seeks to confer upon whoever the officer of the day may be. I shall read proposed section 58L. (1) to illustrate the point. The Chief Australian Electoral Officer shall refuse an appligement? Paragraph (i) states: cation for the registration of a name in respect of a party if, in his opinion, the name . . . That is all that has to be satisfied-'if , in his opinion'. The sub-section Usts various criteria ranging from (a) to (i). I shall deal with one or two of them. 1 am not culUng them in terms of offensiveness or curiosity; I am instancing them to express the point. Paragraph (b) of proposed section 58L. (1) provides: . . . if, in his opinion, the name(b) comprises more than 6 words. Why pick on 6 words? For myself I can see great virtue in 3 words-the Australian Labor Party, the AustraUan Country Party, the Liberal Party. But why 6 words? What is so splendidly virtuous about 6 words? Why notfive?Why not four? The Minister, in his second reading speech, I know with his typical consideration for aU honourable gentlemen, did not want to submit us to any form of tedium and so he restrained himself from entering into an elaborate exposition and indulging in detail on aU points. I would be interested to hear, from the hps of the honourable gentleman, an explanation of why 6 words have been chosen in regard to the name of a party. I turn now to paragraph (c) of proposed section 58L. (1) which states: . . . if, in his opinion, the name(c) includes the word'independent'; I can conceiveI speak now, I hope, as one with some affinity with genuine liberalism-of circumstances where, for example, a party may describe itself as the Independent Labor Party, the Independent Liberal Party or the Independent Country Party. Why trench upon basic rights further? Why trench uponrightsin that fashion? I move to paragraph (d) which states: . . . if, in his opinion, the name(d) suggests a connection with the Royal Family, the Crown or the Government of Australia or of a State: I am deUghted to see such a robust, monarchical sentiment expressed in a Bill drawn up by a Labor Government. I ask the honourable gendeman this question: What exactly does 'Government of Australia' mean? For example, what would happen if the term 'Australian Party' were to be used? As we all know, that Party played a role in recent elections. Could it be construed that the use of such a name might possibly infringe in the judgment of the person beckoned by law to determine whether there is an infrin. . . if, in his opinion, the name(i) is of a kind declared by the regulations to be objecing hour should remain at 8 p.m. I recognise the tionable.

To some people opposite that might mean that it is a good system. It may mean, of course, as it turned out in May 1974, that the Labor Party was denied a majority in the Senate, not because people did not want it but because of the system, because of the informal votes for Senate candidates cast in the safe Labor electorates. In the electorates of Sydney; Grayndler, the seat of the Minister for Services and Property; Hunter; Chifley; Newcastle and Cunningham-it will be a long time before the Liberal Party holds any of these electorates-the proportions of informal votes were: 20 per cent, 16 per cent, 15 per cent, 14 per cent, 14 per cent, and 11 per cent. Thousands and thousands of voters throughout New South Wales were denied their rights not because they did not want to vote formally, not because they did not want to understand for whom they were voting-the y wanted a Labor Government, which they returned in the House of Representatives-bu t because people were exploiting the system, the old archiac system by which if there are 73 candidates one has to vote one to seventy three.

In New South Wales, where there were 73 Senate candidates, no one knew for ties at hospitals. What a system we have here. whom they were voting or in what order. All one Give us a list of those people who had a postal knows is that one votes for one's team. Perhaps vote at the last House of Representatives election one knows for whom one votes first and second but from then on it is a guess to make sure that one numbers the ballot from one to seventy three and that nothing happens in the meantime to make it an informal vote. There were 73 candidates in New South Wales and a 12.3 per cent informal vote. Victoria had 48 Senate candidates and an 11.1 per cent informal vote. Queensland had 25 candidates and a 6 per cent informal vote. It dropped because of the number of candidates. South Australia, with 38 candidates, had an 11.4 per cent informal vote, and so it goes on through the list. The top percentages of informal votes of course are always in Labor held electorates. This is why honourable members opposite do not want amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This is why they say that the proposed system is unfair. If people want to vote one to seventy three, under the amendments to the Act that we are proposing they can do so. The people who do not want to go to that trouble and who want to vote only for the number of candidates required-in the case of a double dissolution, 10 candidates for the Senate and one for the House two teams. People do not want to vote one to sevto seventy three. One cannot convince the people that that is a good system. The present system, is Who argues against drawing for positions on the ballot paper?

It does not matter where people are, whether they were on holidays, in hospital or in an old age home, we want to exploit the system'. This is what honourable members opposite are again saying in opposing the amendments that are being put up. We are saying that the electoral officers or their representatives should go to those places and the people should vote and put their ballot paper straight in the box. There should be no more of this farcical situation of candidates trying to beat previous system. each other by sending out thousands and thousands of applications. One of the strongest features of the amendments that have been put forward is the provision of voting facilites for those people who are unable to reach polling booths. Under the present system we must wait 10 days after an election for postal votes to come in, so that we have speculation in the newspapers every day about which Party is going to govern Australia. We see news stories to the effect that there are six more votes to come from New Zealand, five more to come from Coolangatta, two more to come from the United Kingdom, seven more to come from France or somewhere. What a stupid system it is that those opposite try to justify and under which they want the Australian people to live. There is much in these amendments that mal votes, and what is being dressed up in the requires very little of my support because other cause of a very democratic and just procedure is speakers from this side, of course, will touch on really something that Labor wants to alter in them. One of the simple ones relates to the some ways because it can see some advantage to authors of advertisements on radio and teleitself in these alterations. If this Parliament is to vision.

In respect of signs of the 34 amendments proposed by this Bill are and so forth, it is just a recognition of common good, but the way the Government is proceeding sense that should apply under this Electoral Act. is not the way to achieve desirable results. The strongest argument that one can use in putting forward the view that this optional preferential system should be adopted is not that it gives thought it was an absurdity to wait for a postal anybody an unfair advantage because it does vote registered by Australians in France, Britain not, and it is not that it cannot be followed beor somewhere else to proceed in Australia before cause it is a simple system of voting for the the result of an election could be determined.

The votes of hundreds of thousands of voters were not counted because of the system. Almost all of those people, I would say, would vote only for the team they wanted and perhaps one other if we introduced the system that is part of the amendments which have been moved by the Minister. I hope they speed through both Houses and become law in this country as quickly as possible because democracy is based on the justice of systems such as the electoral system and this is far more just than any vious speaker, the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Young), rather protested too much and in doing so he gave certain things away. I presume his remark that the people did not get the government that they voted for at the last election did not refer to the House of Representatives although one could perhaps carry on in this vein and say that perhaps the people of Australia did not deserve the government that they got at the last election. In his protesting too much I think the honourable member reveals why the Government is pressing this Bill through with indecent haste-that is, that the system, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out, works against certain Labor electorates with the percentage of inforThe honourable member for Port Adelaide",50,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
117,Mr Lloyd (Murray) (5.34),"I think the preAustralia reaching their destination in time to be counted. I think one interesting remark in the second reading speech of the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly) has to be repeated. He said: Australians can be justly proud of their electoral machinall Parties to consider what is acceptable to all ery. We have not suffered the electoral malpractices common in many other countries. Those words make rather strange reading. After all the diatribe from the Minister from time to time both inside and outside this House on what he alleges are weaknesses, malpractices and undemocratic principles in our voting and electoral system, he is now saying: 'After all, Australia is far better off than other countries'. Perhaps we should rename him the Minister for Changing Colours. There are 34 amendments in this Bill and, as I have said, many of them are very good ones. One interesting exclusion from these 34 amendments is any proposal to drop compulsory voting. One reads about the Labour Party in Britain and Parties in some other countries saying that compulsory voting is not democratic. One would have thought that the Minister would have included the matter of compulsory voting in his list, or is the real reason for its exclusion the fact that the tance to all Australians and one should not in the dropping of compulsory voting would work name of over-simplification create weaknesses against the Labor Party?

Rarely in a multiple party system does than those proposed in the Bill. I think the reason the final vote on first past the post voting bring for their exclusion and the Government's wish to with it a majority of votes for the party which is race this Bill through the House in the guise of elected to government. How many times, parelectoral justice is really electoral advantage. If ticularly in recent years, has a British governthe Government is serious about having the good ment been elected with more than 40 per cent of sections of the 34 amendments accepted by both the primary vote? I suggest very rarely, if ever. If Houses of this Parliament, it should adopt the one looks at the votes for the Liberal Party in Briprocedure suggested by the honourable member tain where up to 20 per cent of the people have for Moreton( Mr Killen). He said that an allParty committee of both Houses of the Parlia : ment should investigate the matter of. electoral reform and report back to the Parliament early in the autumn session in plenty of time before any election. This would allow adequate time for sections of the House so that meaningful reform can be introduced in this important area. This Bill has to be through the House of Representatives by 9.30 tonight. There are many changes to consider, together with the long second reading speech of the Minister. I am told one of the clauses in the Bill contains 2,600 words. I think that the Government's action in rushing the Bill through reveals a lack of sincerity on its part. It has not provided adequate opportunity for proper consideration of this complex and important legislation which was introduced only on 13 November. There is also a lack of opportunity for adequate discussion and investigation into what some of these amendments will mean in practice so that genuine electoral amendments can be made. We are told in the second reading speech that the purpose of the Bill is to simplify voting and accelerate results. National elections are of tremendous imporand anomalies. For example, optional preferen T tial voting is first past the post voting and that is all. If people are given the option they will opt It is less democratic for a second very good",51,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill

This means that the system is less democratic because there is very rarely, if ever, a 50 per cent vote for the government there. If one considers the present system in Australia where preferences are distributed, at the last elections the party that gained the greatest percentage of votes-it amounted to more than 50 per cent-is now in government.

The Government also introduced the argument concerning 73 candidates from New South Wales in the recent Senate elections. I agree that people should not be expected to vote Nos. 1 to 73. The amendments also provide for increased deposits, with which I completely agree. They are long overdue. I believe that increased deposits, on the scale suggested by the Minister, would overcome the problem of large numbers of Senate candidates. Many people are prepared to pay the low deposit. They nominate for nuisance reasons or for taxadon purposes. The higher deposits, which are in line with inflation, possibly would reduce dramatically the number of candidates seeking election to the Senate. I believe that if higher deposits are required the chances of reducing the number of candidates are so great He also mentioned the balloting for positions on the ballot paper.

Perhaps the suggestion would have the advantage of getting rid of some of the false notions which some Opposition speakers have put this afternoon. In these days one cannot afford to wait too long. After all, one does not know when some steps will be taken to force an election. I remind the House of the recent spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) insisting on leading his supporters through the Valley of Death. It may be that they will have the death wish again very shortly and will seek to confront the Australian electorate with another election. The voting procedures in Australia are outto cast such a vote if there is no point in their dated and outmoded. The last election result was doing so? so long delayed that it was laughable.

The honourable member should not say that this cannot be done. I have seen it done. This is the system which is the most open to abuse of any system ever devised. have seen it done in all sorts of places. I do not propose to list them here and now. for Murray wants to see me afterwards I will explain it to him in detail in words he can understand. I hope that he will then recant and drop that suggestion because he might convince someone that the Parliament should be elected under that system. The essential purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the community view is expressed by the members elected to this Parliament. It is basic to democracy that people who sit in this chamber and in the Senate represent the majority view. There is an obligation on Australian citizens to vote, and the right to vote should be a right which is easy to exercise. At the present time we do not compel persons to fill in every square on a ballot paper. At least in the administration of the Act they are not required to fill in a number in every square. If they fill in all but the last square that is regarded as a formal vote. I do not know why the Opposition takes this intransigent view about this reform. It is a simple reform, it gives people a choice, and I think the Opposition should give some serious consideration to this matter. There are many aged people in our community who found grave and serious difficulty in voting in order for 73 Senate candidates at the last election, and I ask honourable members on both sides of this House who come from electorates in New South Wales to think back just a few months and remember the old people in polling booths who could not cope with the list of 73 persons on a ballot paper, a ballot paper which was longer than the writing surface provided in a voting booth. They had to take the ballot paper outside the little cubicles, sit on floors, look for somewhere to write in order to fill in this complicated ballot paper. Is it any wonder that some 12 per cent of the ballots cast were informal and, in the majority of cases, they were informal through no fault of those who were filling in the ballot paper. They were informal because the ballot paper was beyond people's capacity, due to the system and the number of candidates who were contesting that election. Do not cast reflection on older persons with failing eyesight, older persons who may be sick or infirm. It was a difficult task for them if it was not explained to them in great detail how to go about it in an easy and formal manner. There is an obligation on this Parliament and on every member here to take every step open to them to reduce the informal vote. It is basic to democracy that the informal vote be reduced if that is possible. The basic franchise must be open to all citizens. Every person who is a citizen of this nation must be entitled to vote. It would be just as right to apply a literacy test or some other test as to give some citizens a ballot paper which is so complicated as to ensure that their vote is never counted. I believe also that reduction of the informal vote is desirable because it will significantly reduce the time taken in counting the ballot papers, in counting the votes, in determining the result of an election, and that is important in a democratic society. I do not know why the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) decided to launch an attack on the registration of political parties. Surely that is a reasonable proposition? Its only significance is that the name of the party is registered so that there can be no duplication or manipulation of names to be placed on ballot papers by unauthorised persons. After all, trade unions in AustraUa are registered, with restrictions and constraints placed upon their activities, but not so poUtical parties in this Bill. Business names have to be registered under various State company laws. Why should there be an objection to the registration of names of political parties? The honourable member for Moreton criticised the number of words to be permitted in a party name. Why six, he said? There has to be a Umit, otherwise some people would abuse that provision and write perhaps a page describing themselves as the name of the party. In the United Kingdom it has been found that 5 words is sufficient, and six seems to be a reasonable number to accommodate every conceivable political party which is operating in Australia at the present time. But this is an essential point. Do not let us lose the point of this provision by putting up a smokescreen. Do not let us lose sight of what is involved. It is essential to ensure that every elector knows for whom he is voting, essential that there should be no mistake about the identity of candidates.

136,Mr Riordan,"If the honourable memberelector to know and to understand for whom he is voting. It should not be a difficult process. In respect of postal voting, I commend entirely the provisions in this Bill brought in by the Minister for Services and Property. We all know that the present system is wide open to abuse. We all know that there are ways of nullifying postal votes taken in hospitals and rest homes and elsewhere. The provision for mobile polling booths will overcome that to a very large extent, and every effort is required to ensure that all citizens exercise their rights. It is equally true that every effort must be made to ensure that all citizens exercise their right to vote in secrecy and that that vote is counted. These provisions are going to make a heavier load for the Electoral Office. I hope that when they are adopted by this Parliament, as I am sure they will be, the Minister for Services and Property will give urgent attention and consideration to ensuring that the Electoral Office has more permanent staff in order to carry out the heavy and burdensome duties that this Bill imposes on it. I conclude at this stage by commending the Bill and by asking all members of this Parliament to give serious consideration to the far reaching reforms contained in the Bill which, I hope, will be adopted without amendment. Deputy Speaker, this Bill seeks to amend in some honourable members opposite would suggest 34 respects the existing provisions of the Comthat we should introduce that system here, but, in monwealth Electoral Act. Whilst it is inevitable essence, that is the best system of aU because on 2 with legislation of this nature that there are some separate occasions if a candidate does not get an measures included in the amendments with absolute majority of primary votes on the first which I agree and perhaps with which all memcount people are forced to direct their minds to bers of the House agree, it is essential that we making a decision as to which of the three or four should turn our attention to the central proor whatever the number of candidates is they will visions of the proposal. The central provisions of vote for. the proposal, I beUeve, are the introduction of optional preferential voting and the requirements that political parties henceforth be registered, thus facilitating the printing on ballot interested not only in taxpayers but also in papers of the names of poUtical parties beside achieving democratic results. I think that the their candidates. I am opposed very strongly to honourable member for Murray( Mr Lloyd) has both of these provisions in the BUl. I am opposed to optional preferential voting first past the post system. In the elections in Brinot just in a party political sense but also because tain in February 1974 the Liberal Party poUed6 I believe that the existing system of preferential milUon primary votes, the Conservative Party voting in Australia is a system that can be favourpolled just on 11 milUon primary votes and the ably compared with systems employed by other Labour Party polled just on 11 million primary liberal democracies throughout the world. In his votes, yet in the House of Commons the Liberal second reading speech the Minister for Services Party got 14 seats and the other 2 parties got and Property( Mr Daly) said: Australians can be justly proud of their electoral machinery. in their readiness to distinguish between an I agree with that. I think that over the years optional preferential voting system and a first Australia has had a commendable record of past the post system to remember the words a integrity in the conduct of elections and a commendable commitment by its electoral staff. But I triink that the Minister might well have added that Australians can be justly proud not only of our electoral machinery but also of our electoral system. Australia in many respects had pioneered the introduction of electoral reforms, and it is rather a pity that this Bill represents in so many ways a going back on the fine standards that we have established throughout the years. An optional preferencial system of voting is, I believe, merely a half way house towards first past the post voting. I know that the Minister will respond by saying that we do not know what we are talking about, that the first past the post system is quite different from an optional preferential system and that you can express your preference if you wish. But I invite him in his reply to nominate any other country that can be categorised as a liberal democracy which uses an optional preferential system of voting. Our present system of preferential voting is as good a system for producing a majority result as can be devised with a minimum of inconvenience. Of course, the best way ofhaving a completely accurate reflection of the majority opimon is to have an exhaustive system of voting, as is used in single member constituencies in elections for the already categorised the electoral injustices of the almost 300 seats each. What sort of electoral justice is that? I ask honourable members opposite",55,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
137,Mr Howard (Bennelong) (6.1),Mr French National Assembly. I do not think that,56,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
138,Mr Cross,What about the taxpayer?,56,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
139,Mr Howard,"I thought that we werefew rninutes ago of the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Young). He said that people do not want to express a preference and that people will, if they are given the option, just choose between one of two parties. I can just imagine that if this Bill becomes law there will be a massive propaganda campaign by the Government to remind people that they no longer have to express a preference. There will be a bias in its publicity towards people not expressing a preference. Perhaps the shallowness of the Government's case in favour of optional preferential voting is best demonstrated by the remarks of the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Riordan) when he said people should not be compelled. I agree with that. It is a great pity that he did not extend the argument right through. I find it very hard to accept that the Government's arguments in favour of optional preferential voting are other than those to secure it electoral advantage when the Minister for Services and Property says, quite simply: 'It is our policy to have compulsory voting'. I am sorry to hear that. I , for my part, believe that compulsory voting ought to go. I have never believed in compulsory voting. For supporters of the Government to come into this House and in high-sounding phrases to say that we ought not to compel people to express a preference beyond theirfirstpreference and then to say that they believe in compulsory voting is to remove from their arguments and their incantations all sense of principle and logic. I turn to the second main limb of this legislation, that is, the registration of political parties. justice. We are left with a piece of legislation In a sense it belongs to the same stable as the proposals for payment into party funds of moneys from Consolidated Revenue and it belongs to the stable which believes that the system should be so ordered as to entrench the status quo. I do not believe in using the public purse tofinancepolitical parties, I do not believe in the compulsory disclosure of the sources of party funds and I certainly do not believe in the printing of party affiliations on a ballot paper. What has gone wrong with the supporters of the Government? Are they a little worried that in the next election they will not be able to get enough of their supporters outside the polling booths handing out how-to-vote cards? Is that their real concern? Is the real purpose of this legislation so to order the system that even if the Australian Labor Party suffers a massive deficiency on the ground it will be perfectly all right because 'Australian Labor Party' will be written after the names of its candidates? I am inherently suspicious of any system which will entrench the status quo in the electoral laws of this country. There is no reason why the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or the Country Party should be given any entrenched advantage. There is no reason why a splinter from any of those parties ought not in time to secure the same measure of electoral support in this country as the party from which it has splintered has at present. I believe, with respect to the Minister who introduced this Bill, that the move towards the registration of political parties will present some horrendous legal difficulties. My mind goes back to the Labor Party split in Victoria in the mid-1950s when a court ruled that the former Victorian Branch of the ALP was legally entitled to certain property and certain funds. I wonder what impact such a court decision would have upon the provisions of this Act so far as the registration of political parties is concerned. Perhaps it is part and parcel of this Government's approach to believe that every single thing can be altered by legislation, that it does not really trust the system and that it has constantly to patch up the guideUnes under which the system is carried out. There are a number of other peripheral provisions in this BUl. There is the reduction in the voting hours. I regret to say that I cannot agree with some of my colleagues on this matter. I believe that any reduction in the voting hours under a system of compulsory voting would be quite wrong. To compel people to vote and then to reduce their opportunities for casting their votes is, I think, an extremely odd form of electoral which contains a number of good provisions. I , too, support the idea of increasing deposits. I think that is a very good provision. I suppport the idea of drawing candidates' names out of the hat to determine the order on the ballot paper. I triink that is a reform that is long overdue. I support a number of the other reforms relating to the broadcasting of election advertisements and so forth. We are left irresistibly with the impression that there are only really 2 things in this legislation in which the Government is greatly interested. They are the introducion of optional preferential voting and the registration of political parties. Australia certainly does have an enviable system. I believe that to introduce these 2 elements into the AustraUan system would be to remove a lot of the virtue that we have presently. I am a little surprised to hear that the Government proposes to introduce in this legislation a restriction on postal voting facilities. The Government's leaders today have spent a great deal of time talking about how dreadful and how terrible it is that it took 2 or 3 weeks to determine the government. Of course, the truth of the matter, as honourable members opposite and all of us know, is that the real delay of 2, 3 or 4 weeks occurred because of the final calculation of the votes for Senate vacancies in the various States. What the Government will do now in the name of speeding things up and having a quicker finalisation of electoral results is to make it very, very difficult for a lot of people who are travelling overseas to cast their ballots. It will limit the Northern Territory when this provision was used opportunities that those people have to cast their ballots. I think that is a very, very odd kind of electoral reform for a Party that says that it is so interested in promoting the maximum amount of choice and the maximum amount of opportunity. I tliink a great number of things in our electoral laws need improvement. I think the Government has gone completely the wrong way about it. The honourable member for Phillip was candid enough to intimate that the Government wishes to have this legislation passed very quickly. It wishes to get it through very quickly because it wants optional preferential voting. The Government knows that a naked transfer from the existing system of preferential voting to first past the post voting would be open to too much criticism. Through the back door of optional preferential voting it is trying to achieve the result that it has long wanted, because the Labor Party has been ravaged over the years by preferential voting. That is why it wishes to change optional preferential voting and thereby introduce first past the post voting. The members of the Opposition recognise this move for what it is. I think this legislation ought to be opposed. Sitting suspended from 6.13 to 8 p.m. to have the opportunity in these few minutes to booths I am only sorry that the Government has support the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. not deemed it possible to go the whole way and The Minister for Services and Property( Mr to introduce a system of electoral visitor voting Daly) in his second reading speech explained for each and every person who is unable to visit a several reforms of a fundamental nature to the polling booth within the electorate in which he is Commonwealth Electoral Act. He also seeks to residing on polling day. I did my best to see that make a number of fairly minor amendments of a such a system was introduced but I am happy to procedural nature.

I say that we would be 15 of the amendments currently being considered in this Bill were proposed by the Opposition while it had responsibility for administering the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I am sure it is also appropriate to remind honourable members opposite that while they like to criticise the optional preference provision which it is suggested should be incorporated as an amendment in the Act, and while they suggest that this provision is being used for political purposes by the Government, in the recent election in the for possibly the first time, honourable members opposite-particularl y members of the Australian Country Party-loudl y acclaimed the great advantages of the electoral system when so many of their candidates were successful. So it might be significant for them to think again about what is proposed here and to see how democratic the proposals really are. The main amendment to which I wish to refer this evening relates to the conduct of postal voting. I applaud the Minister for introducing these amendments which will set up mobile booths and which will, to some extent, tidy up the existing postal voting system which operates under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. few things for which I applaud the Queensland Government but I certainly applaud it for introducing the system of mobile booths or the electoral visitor system. they will put in the 'Courier Mail' tomorrow. for Darling Downs suggests, that gets me headlines in the 'Courier Mail' tomorrow, it is the only way I will get them.

144,Mr Keogh,"If, as the honourable memberlucky if our people were allowed to visit 5 per cent of the nursing homes in Brisbane before polling day. We would be lucky if there were 5 per cent. The rest of the privately run nursing homes are kept as the exclusive preserve of Liberal candidates and Liberal members. Postal votes are almost exclusively preserved for Liberal candidates in the electorates around Brisbane that I know of. This is disastrous, of course, from the point of view of democracy. It is devastating from the point of view of the Labor candidates. It is singularly undemocratic and it is something that we seek to abolish in the amendment proposed to this Act. We seek to give the people who through age, infirmity or illness are hospitalised, or those who are permanent residents of aged persons' homes or nursing homes, the opportunity to have once again the privilege that they enjoyed when they were in good health. They should have the opportunity once again to cast a democratic vote without the surveillance of party scrutineers and without the watchful eye of the Liberal Party canvassers. I should like to cite an incident in my electortimes. It has changed to the extent that the Libate during the last election on 18 May. It is only for the sake of saving the person concerned embarrassment that I will not mention names. But let me assure honourable members that I could in fact name the individual who visited several nursing homes in my electorate before the last election on 18 May and told people in the homes: 'You must vote for the Liberal candidate. You must ensure that your vote is cast for the Liberal candidate because your future existence in this nursing home, where you are so comfortable, where you are so well looked after and where you know that you have got security of existence, is threatened if you return the Labor candidate and if he is part of a Labor Government returned to Canberra'. How disgraceful it is when party politics stoop possible for the honourable member for Griffith to this level, when Liberal canvassers solicit votes to stand here tonight and deny that he knows in this way from the aged and infirm in nursing anything of these practices that take place in his homes. I see smiles, smiles of disbelief perhaps, electorate and which are put into effect to try to on some of the faces of honourable members opre-elect him to this Parliament. He may not know posite. I suggest to them that if they are anything of them. He may not even know about interested in going around to some of the nursing the postal vote application forms that are prehomes to which I refer and masquerading as pared many months prior to the election in order Labor candidates or Labor scrutineers, they will to be sent out on his behalf. I am proud to say find great truth in the words that I have uttered. that the Minister for Services and Property proThe picture I have painted here tonight of the the proposed amendments to the Act. situation is clearly 100 per cent correct. I say it without fear of contradiction. If it is not then let some of these people come out and deny that of these malpractices. these practices have existed not only in my electorate but also in other electorates around the city of Brisbane. Let it be denied that scrutineers and canvassers for the Liberal Party, in particular, have gone to nursing home after nursing home and have stood over these people, the aged and the infirm, to extract votes for their candidates. This will be overcome by the system which we intend to introduce by the amendment to this Act. I recall speaking in this House previously about the abuses and the malpractices to which the postal voting system is subject, and which have occurred in several electorates around Brisbane. I spoke one evening in this placeI think the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron) also spoke-abou t the way some of these practices are carried out. I can recall that soon after the honourable member for Griffith came into this Parliament he took the oppor-. tunity to bemoan the problems that existed from his point of view. He believed that the Labor Party had supremacy as far as the collection of postal votes were concerned in his electorate. But of course, the situation has changed in recent eral Party in Griffith during the last election campaign was prepared to advertise in local newspapers and was prepared to solicit postal votes from people in the electorate of Griffith. Some advertisements were worded: 'Do you need a postal vote, electors of Griffith? You may obtain a postal vote for the election to be held on 18 May'. The advertisements went on and gave reasons for the elector to have a postal vote. They continued: 'We, the Griffith Liberal Party Committee to re-elect Don Cameron to Canberra and restore the same Government to Australia offer our assistance'. In fact, it was soliciting postal votes. If time permitted I could elaborate on other practices that take place in many electorates, including the electorate of Griffith. It may be poses to abolish these malpractices by means of",58,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
145,Mr King,"You seem to have a fair knowledgethat interjection from the honourable member for Wimmera. In Queensland it is vitally necessary, to have a full and adequate knowledge of these malpractices. I can tell the honourable member why one gets this knowledge, particularly if one is a successful candiate. I might instance my electorate of Bowman. In the House of Representatives election in 1969, when I was elected to this Parliament, the Liberal Party polled 42.1 per cent of the total first preference votes counted and I , the successful Labor candidate, polled 51.14 per cent. But at that election the Liberal Party gained 47.14 per cent of the postal votes whereas the Labor Party gained only 44 per cent. Let me quote another instance. In 1972 the Labor Party polled 55.2 per cent of the formal first preference votes and the Liberal Party gained a massive total of 39 per cent. But in that year the Liberal Party gained 41 per cent of the postal votes as compared with 51 per cent for the Labor Party. Does what I say make Country Party members opposite wonder why a Labor Party member from Queensland has to make himself aware of the malpractices that take place in regard to the postal voting in that State? Time this evening will not permit me to elaborate much more on that aspect. I do not have time to speak at any great length of many of the other worthwhile amendments included in this Bill that we are debating this evening. There is one other proposition upon which I congratulate the Minister. Finally voting hours are to be reduced from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., as they are at the moment, to from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. I know that the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen), who is leading for the-Opposition in this matter, shares the Labor Party's attitude on this matter. I recall the days of my closer association with him as a fellow candiate in 1966. He was a successful candidate on that occasion and at the declaration of the poll he spoke in high praise of such a change. I am sure that this evening he, on behalf of the Opposition, will support the proposal to close the polls at 6 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. Finally, one other amendment that I believe is timely is the change in the deposit required of Candidates. The Act requires, in relation to an election for the House of Representatives, a candidate to gain 20 per cent or one-fifth of the total number of first preference votes polled by the successful candidate in order to avoid forfeiture of his deposit paid upon nomination. The proposal is to amend the Act so that the candidate retains his deposit if the total number of votes polled in his favour as first preference votes is more than 10 per cent of the total number of first preferences polled in the election. There again, of course, it has been suggested that it is proposed to make this amendment because it will be to the advantage of the Labor Party. The Opposition has suggested that we are proceeding too quickly with all of these amendments. I have suggested to the honourable member for Moreton that he might give permission for the incorporation of a table in Hansard tonight. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard. leave is granted.

I am very pleased to support them in full. deep and so does partisanship in relation to debates of this nature. I must say that when the debate started off I was not at all in agreement with the propositions put forward by my friend, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen). Perhaps a joint select committee should be set up to consider electoral reform. However, the further this debate has gone the more apparent I think it becomes to everybody that political rancour, political suspicion and doubts must intrude themselves on this sort of debate. Having listened to the remarks of several honourable members. I have rather given up the unequal struggle. I rather doubt whether I will be able to adopt the lofty train of thought that I hoped I would be able to adopt. For instance, I was No. losing No. losing reminded by the honourable member for Bowdeposit if deposit if man ( Mr Keogh) a little while ago of a story I 20% of 10% of total first total first heard the other day.

Of course, I can quote no better auth17 7 7 7 ority in regard to these matters than the Leader of the House. He has specialised in this field. In fact, I would have thought that he was the expert political juggler of all time. I was interested in the comment of the honourable member for Bowman who said that he knew all about electoral malpratice, because in Queensland one could not win a seat unless one did know all about it. Quite frankly, here again is the problem with a debate of this nature. I must say that I am disappointed with the Leader of the House who has been in this place a great many years. One would presume that he would have acquired great wisdom, but he is not showing much wisdom when he attempts to bulldoze a Bill of this gravity through the House in a matter of 11 days since we first saw the Bill. given notice to the House that he will allow only 3 hours debate on this issue. Quite frankly, in my own Party3 hours would have been insufficient time for a debate of this nature. I would like to do what I do not normally do, and that is tell the House a little more than I normally think proper about Party meetings. I have had a matter on our Party agenda for two and a half months, and that matter bears on the central point of the Minister's Bill which we are debating tonight. Why have we in our Party not got to this agenda item? Again one enters this area of political rancour which makes objective opinions on this subject",60,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill

151,Mr Killen,Wefinishat 9.30 tonight.,61,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
152,Mr Giles,"That is right. He has alreadyso impossible. The reason is quite simple. The Government, in its wisdom, decided that it did not want a major debate in Caucus so it brought this Bill into this Parliament midway through last Wednesday morning. The Opposition, without all the knowledge of the Department to back it up or the ability to seek further information, was forced into the position of having to consider it, together with an avalanche of minor legislation scooped up and dumped onto it as though with a front-end loader. The Opposition has to spend the whole of its Party meetings considering this plethora of legislation, this rash of legislation which regrettably crops up towards the tail end of a sessional period. I mention that as a point at issue because the Minister for Services and Property! does not do credit to his own aims embodied in this Bill, if he is deeply sincere about itI see no particular reason to doubt that-by refusing to allow a proper atmosphere for rational consideration of this matter. To demonstrate my point, the matter I have had on my Party's agenda now for well over 2 months deals with limited preferential voting. I saw problems with such a system. I had heard the Minister in general terms give his views on it in the past. I felt nevertheless that there was some merit in it so I produced a paper which I have here-quit e a short one of 3 pages which many members of my Party have readcalled 'The Simplified Preferential System'. The only major difference between my scheme and the proposal in the Minister's Bill was that, whereas the Minister's proposal gives rise to the obvious doubt which exists in my Party and no doubt outside it-for example, in certain intellecone might say but there is a big difference in tual quarters-and which is implied in the Minister's scheme, as the honourable member for Murray( Mr Lloyd) described very accurately a while ago, that the proposal in the Bill could amount to a first past the post system with a certain amount of weakening, my proposal aimed at overcoming that. MightI add that I had a lot of support from many members in my Party, such as my South Australian colleague, the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson). My scheme aimed at giving 2 alternatives. It aimed at allowing people to vote precisely as they do now under the same conditions-ther e were minor amendments to the present voting method at the end of the paper but we will leave them aside-o r to vote for one candidate and no more. However there was a provision in my scheme which made it mandatory for every Party and every independent candidate to register a week before polling day, according to law, his preferential order. His party's preference would be superimposed on that one vote by the particular electoral officer. tasy. I do not know who presents the biggest fantasy at this stage, a person who tries to bulldoze a scheme through without giving Parliament a chance to consider its merits or a person who proposes a scheme, such as mine, which is in general use in countries like the United States of America. The difference, to get back to the pointMr Kevin Cairns-He really recognises its value. plaud the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns) for his comment. If the Minister says that the proposal is nonsense then, ipso facto, it makes sense. I go along with that comment to a limited degree. Let us get back to the point. is doubt as to whether a limited preferential system could in time through popular demand become a first past the post system, according to many of us that would not be in the best interests of the nation as a whole because we feel that the full preferential system has its merits. On the basis that it has, my scheme aims to superimpose the entire preferential voting pattern of a candidate on to the vote of the elector who votes for that candidate only. There is not much difference other ways because at least every preference pro forma is exercised and has to be exercised under that scheme. This is only one of many interesting alternatives that people of intelligence and probity and people who are imaginative could have produced in a more rational situation. But it is hardly a rational situation when the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Young) points to the impossibility of a Labor vote being properly exercised under the present scheme. I would ask him to look at the percentage results and see whether the people's wishes have not been properly mirrored within this chamber over the years. that they have been accurately mirrored. As regards the Senate, I hasten to point out that my scheme is aimed only at Senate voting. I am completely happy with House of Representatives voting procedures and their administration. But quite patently, it is absurd to ask people to fill in",61,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill

159,Mr Giles,"Of course, the obvious answer isa voting card numbered one to seventy-three. There is not a great deal of support in the community or in other circles for limited preferential voting. Given enoughtime-who knowsI might have been able to convince my own Party that my simplified method might have met the measure of the day and more accurately measured the wishes of the community. This is what the Minister tonight has not enabled this side of the House to do. If this Bill passes this House and is later defeated in the Upper House, it will be entirely the Minister's own fault because he has not had confidence enough with the Parliament as such to develop a scheme and to produce an atmosphere which would have removed the partisanship and the backlash that we have seen from time to time during this debate. I mention that particular scheme because, if I might repeat myself, it is only one example of how an intelligent sub-committee of the Parliament might well have approached the topic. Of course, what will happen is that by next year we will be in Government and we will produce a new electoral scheme. Honourable members opposite laugh. If it does not suit the cheerful galahs on the other side of the House, that is their throughout political circles at university level is, funeral. I hope that if we produce a scheme such as this it is one that gives news of the Opposition party, as it will be then, a chance to toss these issues backwards and forwards within their own Party room. It will needfiveor six hours, whether it be our Bill or whether it be their Bill. This is exactly what has not happened on this occasion. In my view, the quickest way to sicken the people of an infinitely desirable method of preferential voting is to make the process too complex. There is no question about this. sometimes amazes me. Having said that, let us soon as possible having already taken note of look at the by-products of that statement. I do how the forces are drawing themselves up. not see my scheme leaning towards any eventful first past the post system. Nor do I agree altogether with a statement made by my Leader great care to protect a system that is fair and that on 19 September in which he said that already mirrors the wishes of the people. The Governthere are really only 2 systems of voting-ful l ment has tried to bulldoze its ideas through topreferential orfirstpast the post. I suppose that it night. I do not think that the Minister, in spite of is possible to look at the scheme I have put behis great seniority, has been fair to the Parliafore the House as an implied full preferential ment as such.

For instance, I do not think that be a more enlightened approach if he gave one ought to worry very much in relation to proper time for Parties to debate issues in the whether people do want to vote for an individual Party rooms.

Wednesday a.m. sittings of this House conditions of the Electoral Act for the lower have made null and void any proper attempt by House for some time that voters do not have to PartiesI suspect including his own-a t debate vote for the last person whose name is shown on in Party rooms. It is not enough in this case for a voting paper. Quite patently, it would be absurd for the House not to take the same point of view for a full voting card in the Senate. It is quite ridiculous that people who do not want to vote for the Communist team in fact have to do so. I know that in my own State in the last election the Communist Party drew No. 1 position and the Liberal Party drew No. 2 position on the ballot paper. It was strange how many people voted first for the Liberal Party, went right through the card and completely ignored the Communist Party because it happened to be No. 1 on the ballot paper. Fair is fair. If this principle applies to lower House elections I think the same should apply to Senate elections. I point out that the difficulty does not exist in House of Representatives elections; the difficulty quite patently exists in Senate elections. It seems quite absurd that people should be required to number 1 to 73 on a ballot paper in any Senate election at all. for a seat in the House of Representatives? tices are most legion and most well known of course, Queensland. There is still no other State that has produced 2 circles joined by a line and looking like the honourable member for Bowman( Mr Keogh). The dumb-bell mentality is entirely well known in Queensland. Let us face it: These are some of the problems we have to overcome. This is significant again of the partisanship and the gamesmanship of a political arena in which no calm and objective judgment can be made on these issues. I am quite sure the Minister knows very well how he sees the pattern emerging in the Senate.

In my time as Minister the Parhament has not met a.m. on Wednesday. to express some disappointment at one of the remarks of the honourable member for Angas( Mr GUes) who is, I understand, the Opposition's candidate for Speaker if the Liberal Party takes the reins in this House. I wish to comment on a remark made by the honourable member about an elecuon next year. He presupposes an elecuon and I take it he supports the Senate's blocking of Supply which, in fact, means that this House surrenders its powers of government and becomes subservient to the other House. I hope that no person who seeks to occupy the Chair in this House would wish to see that happen. This Bill brings in a number of amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Several members have stated that the present system is fair. An electoral system is fair only if the most incapable person eligible to vote is able to cast a vote with ease, without fear and without having it denied to him by the system in practice. If a party, person or government seeks, by legal means, to deny a disadvantaged section of the community its votingrightsthis can be achieved by placing complications or difficulties in the way of"" voting which will prevent a substantial proportion of the population from casting formal votes. In the last Senate election a deliberate nomination of candidates took place in New South Wales for the purpose of creating informal votes-in your electorate, Mr Speaker, 20 per cent of the votes cast for the Senate were informal-to the advantage of a political party which suffers least from the casting of informal votes. It in fact changed one seat in the Senate. It changed the majority in the Senate. Therefore, it changed the whole position of this Parliament. ing for the Senate? portion of informal votes in Labor seats was nearly double on average the proportion of informal votes in Liberal seats, and the margin between 6 seats and 5 seats in New South Wales was only 4 per cent. in Labor seats? you look at the statistics I will not need to say it too often-is that the order in which the seats rank in accordance with the percentage of Labor votes almost exacdy relates to the order in the number of informal votes cast in the Senate election. Mr StreetI am asking why. Why was it? difficulty of casting a vote for 73 candidates in New South Wales and 46 candidates in Victoria. than non-Labor seats? would suggest, that most Liberal voters have had the benefit of greater education and most likely had other benefits. the honourable member for Corangamite ought not to use those words. I suggest that what he has said is exactly what Sir Henry Bolte said. The honourable member is a person for whom I had some respect before he said that. I think it is a disgusting thing to suggest. WhatI am saying is that there are underprivUeged people in this community who did not have the opportunity to go to a private college as the honourable member did, persons who have not had all the benefits of a big farm to live on and the advantage of plenty oftimeavailable to them, who are not quite capable of casting a vote and who went into the polling booths in the last election scared to death of casting an informal vote. These people are entitled to have their vote the same as your supporters. And you would seek to deny them! Make no mistake about it. You would also seek to deny them the full value of their vote by giving your friends, supposedly disadvantaged mUlionaire farmers, 2 votes to their one. That is what your Party is about to do in Victoria now by expanding the upper House. You are denying the people their right to vote in a democracy. I think it is a laughing matter too-that you would call yourself a democrat! people without education are not entitled to vote. I do not take any notice of the honourable member for Angas.

Just because the honourable member said what he is accusing other members of saying, there is no need for him to wheel on me. honourable member for Corio will address the Chair. pended, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) said that an example of the effect of taking away compulsory preferential voting would be what happened to the Liberal Party in England where that Party gained 25 per cent of the votes and won no seats in the House of Commons. I suggest that that situation has been occurring in Australia for some considerable ume. Certainly it has been happening in Victoria with respect to the Australian Democratic Labor Party. The fact that a preferential voting system operated did not help that Party in any way gain any seats. What it did was take away any disadvantage which may have been suffered by the Liberal Party through votes going to the DLP. In England, had a compulsory preferential voting system applied, possibly the Liberal Party votes would have gone to the Conservatives and the Conservatives may have won additional electorates. But the Liberal Party would never gain greater representation in the House of Commons than it has now. It would not have served the interests of democracy. There are a number of provisions in this Bill tage. I use the obvious example of the 2 parties which will, I believe, assist electors to cast valid which had substantial minority votes in the last votes. That is, after all, the important thing-giv election-the Australian Party and the Demoing electors an opportunity to cast valid votes. I cratic Labor Party. do not, as some members do, sneer at people who have not the capacity to cast a valid vote. I suggest that honourable members go to some of voters would follow a party ticket and cast a their friends in industry and ask them what happreferential vote than it is that persons voting for pens when a storeman, possibly well educated, the Australia Party would indicate a preference. possibly not, is asked to number from 1 to 100. They are compelled at this stage to indicate a Just before the last election I was speaking to preference. In that circumstance I would think people from the Ford Motor Company of that optional preferential voting would work to Australia Ltd who said that the average error in the disadvantage, not to the advantage, of the numbering from 1 to 100 is 6 per cent and 2 per Labor Party. The situation with regard to the cent on the second try. Those same people were Senate under the proposed system would be that numbering the ballot paper for the Senate elecin all but a very small number of cases the tion in New South Wales under a situation of number of votes required to be cast would cover stress. Casting a vote, for some people, is a situthe candidates elected. This situation exists in ation of stress. There are people who actually cast their own to me that the fear of optional preferential voting votes without assistance. There are people who is misguided and is based more on the advantage do not get the benefit of how to vote cards, especially if they want to vote for a rninority party. These people in fact vote under situations of stress and are likely to make mistakes. In the existing situation, if a person voting in New South Wales at the last election had correctly numbered his Senate card from 1 to 71 and had repeated or left out one of the last three numbers-eve n though it might have been for a candidate who had less than 100 votes in the State and would have been the first eliminated; therefore the order of preferences would have made no difference at all to his vote, it would not have been counted-that person's vote was wiped out. Preferential voting is a system under which a person indicates his order of preference, not his party's order of preference as the honourable member for Angas proposes. Even though a person may transcribe a party ticket he indicates his personal order of preference. That is supposedly the basis of the system. There is no person in this HouseI point mainly to those prefessing support for preferential voting-wh o can tell me or anyone else what the 73 candidatesI would include the Chief Electoral Officer in this-fro m New South Wales in the Senate election or the 46 candidates in Victoria stood for. Nobody knew what they all stood for and there was no way, in many cases, that one could find out. Therefore how can one exercise a choice, a preference, in such circumstances? It cannot be done. Optional preferential voting in my opinionI say this quite honestly-woul d work to the disadvantage of the Australian Labor Party, not to its advanI suggest that it is far more likely that DLP Tasmania in that State's normal House of Assembly elections.

This to me isridiculous.As I said, I suppeople to identify and vote for the candidate or port quite a few of the amendments. the parties which they choose is a system which advances the rights of people in a democracy. I finish my speech by repeating the point I patient. But there are many of the amendments commenced with. A system of electing people to that I do not support. For instance, by way of the national ParUament can only be judged by illustration, if a person carried out 99 very good the capacity which it provides for the person deeds and was respected because he did so but least capable of casting a vote to cast, without then on the 100th occasion he decided he was fear, a formal vote.

That is exactly what the members on complicated electoral system is an accident the Government side are trying to say. which this Government's education policies, I hope, will shortly overcome. But the facts are that people are disadvantaged and are placed under stress by electoral laws which require them do not know. But of the 34 major amendments to undertake a too complicated system of voting, there are a mighty lot that I do support. I have especially in Senate elections, and I beUeve that not got time to go through all of them, but I want these amendments will assist greatly in simplifyto mention a few.

187,Mr King,"Mayb e that is the way they think, Ipreferential voting is what the Labor Party calls a democratic vote, all I can say is that it is horribly like democratic socialism. The word 'democratic' is used, but for what purpose I am not too sure. oppose optional preferential voting wherever possible. As I have said, the present system is the fairest one we could have and there is no good reason why we should opt out of it. After all, if the honourable member for Corio is correct, people cannot count up to 4, 5 or 6 as they would be required to do if casting a vote for the House of Representatives. As the honourable member for Angas( Mr Giles) mentioned, this raises the question as to whether those people are really entitled to cast a vote. 4, 5 or 6. That is certainly nothing like the problem that the honourable member for Corio posed. He said that his supporters were uneducated completely. There are a lot of other clauses I would like to deal with so I will leave the matter of optional preferential voting because I believe it has been fairly well covered. The second and third amendments in the Minister's summary are: printing or party affiliations of candidates on ballot papers; registration of political parties for purposes of idenBill for that very purpose. tification and printing of affiliations on ballot papers; Proposed new section 5 8D, set out in clause 21, is rather interesting. When the Minister summarised all the important issues, he did not bother to include this one. But he referred to it later on in his second reading speech. The proposed new section really deals with parties to be recognised officially as parties for the purposes of having their names appear on the ballot paper. It will not take me long to read the relevant portion. Shortland ( Mr Morris) looks at the Bill he will earlier. I support this proposal. Queensland has it find that I am referring to clause 21, proposed in its State elections and, as far as I can gather, new section 58D( 1), paragraph (a) which states: there is very little criticism of that procedure. (a) in the case of an election of a Member of the House of Representatives . . . a party qualifies in respect of an election only if-for a Division in a State to be held at a general election of Members of that House the number of candidates endorsed by the party in respect or elections Tor the Division in the State (including the first-mentioned election) is not less than one-quarter of the whole number of Divisions in that State: Paragraph (b) explains the position with regard to the Senate. Paragraph (c) then refers to the situation with regard to by-elections. The provisions to which I have referred plus the remainder of the proposed new section 58D. form a very loaded section. The honourable member for Shortland shakes his head and does not agree. Twenty-five per cent of the various electorates will have to be contested by a Party before that Party is recognised. I make no apologies with regard to Victoria where the Country Party holds 6 seats out of 34. This really means that to qualify as a political party, for the purposes of having our candidates' political affiliation printed on ballot papers we would have to contest 9 seats. I can guess why the Minister included this amendment. He must understand the situation in Victoria because, as most people realise, the Country Party contests country electorates. In Victoria in particular this is so. The strange thing about this is that not one country electorate there is held by the Labor Party. Therefore, what the Minister wants is to have some Country Party contests with the Liberal Party so that we can then get our numbers up to the required nine in that State. That is why this clause is included. Some months ago the Minister made a statement to the effect that when the redistribution proposals were brought forward members of the Country Party would have a heart attack. He knew what he was talking about. He deliberately framed this Bill and the Electoral Let me turn to some of the other proposals because, after all, I said I would agree with some of them. It is proposed to introduce mobile polling booths at hospitals and similar institutions. I have advocated this for a long time and I certainly support it, so I need say no more about that. It is proposed to close polls at 6 p.m. The Minister and many other Government supporters have been very vocal about trying to speed up the elections. This is one instance where I agree with them. I believe that if the polling booths were closed at 6 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. the decision that we normally wait for until midnight I think the requirement relating to a candiate who changes his name within 12 months prior to nomination is another satisfactory alteration to the Act. I am not sure what is meant by 'an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and for the return of postal votes direct to respective returning officers'.

That is my understanding from my reading of the Bill. What happens in an emergency? It is also proposed to increase the fine for people who do not cast a vote. To my mind the proposal for the return of postal votes is completely impractical. on the same basis as any other voter. They must vote before the polls close. vote must be made before the closing of the poll.

But there are many country electorates where it takes literally days to get a postal vote to a particular constituent and back again. fortune will these people lodge their votes? Therefore, I am afraid that I must strongly oppose this provision. Another provision refers to prohibiting the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in specified circumstances. I cannot see any reason for a postal vote to be made public so I support that proposal. It is also proposed to provide postal voting facihties for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements. I am not sure about this provision. I think the non-provision of such votes could be classified as one of the penalties of serving a sentence. I make no further comment on that proposal. think I am speaking for a joke.

I think that if the deposit were increased by a moderate amount it would be acceptable to a lot more people. bled from $100 to $200 that would be ample. I would certainly favour $150 in preference to $ 100. The candidate has to put up the deposit in cash. The returning officer, as aU members know, returns the deposit by cheque. I recite a rather peculiar instance. On one occasion I collected my cheque and presented it to the nearest bank, which was opposite the polling booth, and the bank refused to cash it. After a lot of talking, I managed to get it cashed. Precluding nomination for election to the Australian ParUament by a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, I think, is a good amendment because it brings those members into line with the many other people who must resign from certain positions they hold if they wish tb contest a Federal election. It is a case of doing away with a form of discrimination, if it could have been classified as such. Prevention of a person from nominating as a candidate for more than one Federal election held on the same day, I think, would be fairly popular. There is no dispute with that. Protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-vote cards is another amendment. There is no doubt about the need for that protection, and I support the amendment. The elimination of the need to state the address of an author in the case of broadcasting or telecasting of political matters is an amendment about which, if my interpretation is right, I would be concerned because there may be certain libel cases. Naturaly, if one wanted to issue a writ one would want to know against whom it should be issued. I see that mytimeis rapidly running out.

This could be very dangerous. I would think that the officers of the Department would want to look very closely at that amendment. The increase in penalties for failure to enrol is another amendment. The way in which this Bill is being put makes it very hard for a lot of people to cast a vote in the event of an emergency. Therefore, I think this provision is a bit severe. I would have liked to have said a lot of things. I see that my Whip is indicating to me very pointedly that the time in which I can make my contribution has just about expired. I will conclude by saying that while I support the bulk of the provisions in the BillI have no alternative but to oppose it in its entirety because of one or two issues which have been included. I certainly support the postponement of the consideration of the Bill so that we on this side of the House can have a thorough look at it and get some indication from the Mimster and officers of the Department as to whether some of the things I have mentioned would be worth looking at and keeping in mind so that those people who find themselves in embarrassing situations will certainly not be penalised in this true democratic system that we have at present. comes before this House is deserving of careful reflected in the final outcome.

The Chief Australian Electoral Criticisms of the proposals in this Bill should be Officer has said that he hopes it will not do so for constructive, not destructive.

The preferential system which we have now gives electors one of the best ways of expressing of the system there would be those who to serve their views. In his second reading speech the their own political interests may require the ElecMinister for Services and Property( Mr Daly) toral Officer to promote the idea that the most criticised the requirement of this system which compels a voter to express a preference for candidates whom he does not know or for whom he has an extreme dislike. This obligation is neither undemocratic nor meaningless as is suggested by the Minister. It is an essential feature of a system which allows such dislikes to be recorded in a manner which effectively vetoes a candidate who is disliked by a majority of voters. The preferential system which we now use gives electors one of the best ways of expressing their views and from the electors point of view it achieves a result which is in accordance with the wishes of the majority. It is argued that full preferential voting is complicated. According to Mr Ley, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer, it is complicated to the point of being ridiculous. The Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) has acknowledged that there is need for the system to be simplified in the case of voting procedures for Senate elections. I believe that this need also exists in the case of voting in House of Representatives elections. The complexity of the present system is seen as causing unnecessary inconvenience to electors resulting in undesirable levels of informal voting. Electors want a simplified system. A large proportion of voters follow a party ticket. They would like a shorthand method of voting. They want a method which will enable shades of opinion to be The system of optional preferential voting that tion. In order to demonstrate the alleged simplicity",68,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
206,Mr Wilson (Sturt) (9.5),Every Bill that,69,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
207,Mr Morris,Lik e the Northern Territory elec,69,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
208,Mr Wilsoni Said First Past The Post Voting,"effective vote is a vote given to only one candidate where subsequent preferences are ignored. Informal voting in House of Representatives elections has been relatively low. In Senate elections the proportion though higher is not only related to the number of candidates but also to the fact that more vacancies have to be filled at Senate elections. Whatever change is made in the voting system, there will still be informal voting. Some informal votes will arise from voting papers deliberately cast as informals. Every effort should be made to reduce the number of informal votes cast by those desirous of recording an effecdve vote. I believe that we should adopt a system which makes it as easy as possible for all voters to make their intentions known, but, in doing so, we should strive for a system that results in the election of those candidates who are both favoured or preferred by most of the electorate and not disapproved of by the majority. A simplified preferential voting system is one which most successfully meets those conditions. It has the desirable effects of a full preferential system insofar as candidates are ranked accord ing to preference, together with the simplicity argued as a strength of the optional preferential system. A simplified preferential system, which I advocate, permits a candidate to register his how-to-vote card so that a voter, by placing a vote beside, say, a Liberal Party candidate, would have his vote counted in accordance with the Liberal Party's how-to-vote card. If he wished to deviate from these recommendations he would be free to do so. Such a system would enable all voters, whether they are supporters of major parties or minor parties, to use a form of shorthand to follow the party ticket. It would also give them a right to indicate their own preference should they so desire. Whether, in examining this system, they should be required to indicate a preference for all candidates or for, say, twice the number of vacancies to be filled is a matter for debate. A form of simplified voting such as this would tend to minimise the impact of the so-called donkey vote, as these unthinking voters, on becoming aware that they need number only one square for an effective vote, would not then blindly number down the card. The procedure needed to permit the registration of how-to-vote cards would not, contrary to an earlier interjection made by the Minister, pose insurmountable difficulties. It is already done in South Australia under a scheme sponsored by a Labor government for the purpose of public display of how-to-vote cards in each polling booth. In addition to aiding the voter, the system would greatly assist electoral officers. In an optional preferential system most, if not all, political parties would undoubtedly find it expedient to issue how-to-vote cards indicating voting preferences beyond their own candidates. In these circumstances the counting of votes would be complicated by the need to check the votes for accuracy and the number of informal votes might not be significantly reduced. Under a simplified preferential system 75 to 80 per cent of voters would use the shorthand method of indicating their preferences where they were in accord with their party's recommendations. These votes would be easy to check and easy to count. Furthermore, in many close contests where preferences are required to be counted the results in many instances could be ascertained more quickly. The number of preferences to be distributed would in a significant number of cases be distributable in accordance with the registered how-to-vote card, and these votes could be separately counted and their prospective destination brought into account in making assessments as to the result of the election. Those preferences alone might be sufficient to give another candi: date an absolute majority. In these instances the result would be available without it being necessary for other preference votes to be individually scrutinised. Insofar as speed of finalising the result is desirable, this method of voting would go a long way towards achieving this goal without either depriving the electors of a vote or impairing their present right to express shades of opinion. This simplified preferential system would be far more effective than optional preferential voting, not only in leading to the speedier finalisation of election results but also in simplifying voting procedures, assisting the convenience of electors and reducing the number of informal votes. Though no system will be perfect we should at least strive to make our system as fair and as equitable as possible. Simplified preferential voting would do this and would at the same time respond to the proper public demand for greater simplicity and convenience for electors. It aims to achieve a result that most closely reflects the wishes of the people. Those having different shades of opinion and shades of thought as well as those with diametrically opposed points of view will be given an equal say in the outcome of elections where this system is used. When we turn to the amendments which are designed to alter the circumstances in which postal votes are to be submitted we find that their effect is to reduce the franchise. These proposals would deprive may Australians of a say in our election. The speedier finalisation of election results is advanced as the reason for these changes. To achieve this by depriving thousands of Australians of a vote is too high a price to pay. With increasing opportunities to travel both for business and pleasure, more and more people are away from home on election day. One can illustrate that by looking at some of the figures for the Federal elections in May last. In some States there were public holidays after the weekend on which the election was held and, as a consequence, there was a significant rise in absentee and postal votes. There will always be those, too, who through illness are unable to get to a polling booth. Any change in the law should be aimed at making it easier, not more difficult, for people to record their votes. There could and would be no electoral malpractices if there were no elections. If, with regard to postal voting, there is a need to amend the law to minimise the opportunity for malpractice, it should be done in a manner which does not effectively disfranchise large numbers of voters. The argument that the law as to postal votes needs to be changed to allow for a speedier finalisation of results is a specious one. After all, the fate of the government is in the balance from the day the Parliament is dissolved, and sometimes in practice for a longer period. If it takes a few days to finalise the result that should not matter if, by doing so, a more accurate reflection of the people's wishes is achieved. There is no intrinsic advantage in completing the count within the shortest possible time after the close of polls. Those directly involved are anxious to know the result, but of course this is as true a week before the election as it is half way through the count on election night. There is no more difficulty for a government in office to administer the affairs of the nation until a count of votes is completed than there is for it to do so during the election campaign itself. If speed in the finalisation of election results involves a reduction in the opportunities of every elector to have his vote taken into account, it should be opposed. There are other ways in which thefinalisationof the count can be accelerated, and I have already explained those. Under the present law a person who is interto reject the lot. We should examine them all and state on the day of an election may vote by reject or amend where desirable the bad and apmeans of a postal vote at an interstate polling prove the good. We should all strive to improve booth. Under the proposed amendments he is to our electoral system, including our method of be deprived of this right. His right to such a vote voting, so that it provides a means of achieving will be exercised only if he can get an application the most accurate reflection of the wUl of the for a vote to his own divisional returning officer people. Consistent with this objective we should by 6 p.m. on the Thursday preceding the elecamend it to ensure its clarity and simpUcity for tion. Then if he gets a vote his vote will be electors, its fairness to all candidates and parties counted only if he returns it not to any divisional returning officer but to bis own divisional returning officer. In each instance the tightening of the time Umits imposed for the lodging of postal votes have the effect of depriving people of their franchise. For years the AustraUan Labor Party has espoused support for the view that all votes should have an equal value, yet in a most hypocritical fashion it proposes a law which is designed to prevent people from having a say in the determination of the government in their country. There are many proposals in the BUl that are deserving of careful consideration, and it is a pity that we are not being given a greater opportunity to study them. Each provision must be examined to see whether it is designed to strengthen our democracy or merely to strengthen the position of the Labor Party in government. Are the provisions designed to help the elector, or is their purpose to aid only the elected? WUl they improve on the present system in ensuring that the ParUament is as true a reflection of the people's wishes as is practically attainable? We have a good electoral system. I agree with the Minister for Services and Property, who, in his second reading speech, said that Australians can be justly proud of their electoral machinery. But any electoral system, even a good one, needs to be reviewed from time to time to see whether it can be improved. Change designed to assist the administrators of the system and those who are or would seek to be elected under it should be made only if the change is in the interests of the electors as a whole. These interests would not be served by any change which would result in the system becoming less sensitive to pubUc opinion. This House should be given the opportunity to examine each of the proposals contained in the BUl. Our approach to this debate should be positive, not negative. Our criticisms of the proposed changes should be constructive, not destructive. It is not a BUl which should, as a consequence of political posturing, be promoted as all good or all bad. In this debate each of the clauses of the BUI is deserving of independent consideration. That there are some bad clauses in the BUl is no reason and its efficiency from the point of view of the Electoral Office staff. According to the Minister the proposals contained in the Bill are designed to allow for speedier finalisation of election results, to improve voting facilities, to introduce some new and changed facilities and to correct some obvious defects in the existing electoral machinery. Alterations made with these objectives in mind may be superficially attractive, but each needs to be examined to ensure that it does not result in impairing the accuracy with which the electoral results respond to the people's wishes. There are 76 clauses in the Bill. Many-indee d over two-thirds-see k to amend the law in accordance with this principle. OthersI have touched on somecould be adapted by minor amendment. There is a limited number of clausesI have also dealt with them-the approval of which would be contrary to the principle I have enunciated and about which the Minister was noticeably silent. Among the amendments which should be approved are the printing of party affiliations on ballot papers, the introduction of mobile polling booths at hospitals, the drawing of the positions of House of Representatives candidates on ballot papers and the preservation of the voting entitlements of Australian citizens. Indeed, the rights proposed by this legislation should go further to include not only public servants but also others who are temporarily posted overseas in similar circumstances. But, as I mentioned earlier, this offer of the right to enrolment should not be given with the one hand and taken away with the other by making the attainment and achievement of a postal vote so difficult that relaamendments. But now that a Labor Government tively few such persons will be able to register a formal vote. The retention on the rolls of the name of an elector who, though temporarily absent, retains a real place of living in the subdivision for which he is enrolled, the protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-vote cards and a number of other amendments commend themselves. This Bill contains many such desirable amendments. I urge honourable members on both sides of the House not to allow cynical attitudes to prevail with the result that political power is used either to amend the law in the interests of the Mr Ley who has been described tonight by the Australian Labor Party, which is now in office, or honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) to prevent its amendment in a way which would who led the Opposition as one of the most promiimprove our electoral system in the interests of nent and reputable public servants.

Where the Opposition got that idea is a mystery to me. One of the statements that has been made is that the Opposition did not have time to consider the proposals on which I have elaborated. On 31 March 1971 the then Minister for the Interior, the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Hunt), introduced into this House a number of measures appertaining to electoral reform. At my suggestion or with my permission he sought recently the advice of the Chief Australian Electoral Officer to ascertain which of those proposals are included in the Bill presently before the House. I will now quote from the notes sent a few days ago to Mr Hunt, the honourable member for Gwydir, by the Chief Electoral Officer. Part of the document states: This paper provides briefing notes on those clauses in the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill 1974 which are substantially the same as the clauses contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Bill 1974. Reference is made by way of citation to the clauses of the present Bill with the corresponding clauses of the 1971 Bill in brackets. Included in this Bill, against which the Opposition, including the then Minister who introduced the previous Bill, will note are 16 amendments introduced by a Country Party Minister. Tonight the Opposition will divide this House and vote against those amendments. In 1971 it was all right to introduce the has introduced them, like a lot of donkeys, the Opposition will line up and vote against proposals which it endorsed and we would have supported at that time. To prove what phoneys the Opposition members are I ask the permission of the House to incorporate a number of the clauses in the present Bill which the Country Party sponsored and which are today put forward by the Government but which the Opposition refuse to support.

210,Mr Daly,"This document was produced byMayI be permitted to incorporate the document? has not had time to consider the Bill. The Opposition is a very lazy lot. Opposition members have not read the Bill and they did not even know their own proposals from those of the Government. Tonight the honourable member for Gwydir will walk into this House and vote against 16 of the proposals which, as the then Minister, he asked the Parliament of Australia to endorse and which we, as the then Opposition, would have endorsed. Does that not prove to the Australian people what a phoney collection the Opposition is and how phoney are the arguments that have been brought down? The Opposition has asked for a non-Party joint committee to consider these matters. During the 23 years that the present Opposition was in government it brought forward only one reform, other than to gerrymander the electorates. The Opposition will vote tonight against that one reform, which in 1971 lapsed on the expiration and dissolution of that Parliament. Now the Opposition asks for a joint committee. That is a phoney way of saying that the Opposition is a lazy lot. None of the Opposition members have read the Bill. They have had months in which to do it. It must be 6 months since I gave the Opposition spokesman on electoral affairs in the Senate all the details of is rigged for the Australian Labor Party. Let us this Bill. It is weeks and months since I announced ail the proposals to the Press and sent a statepreferential voting was introduced for New ment of what was in the Bill to every member of this Parliament.

Tonight they will vote against every proposal. A member of the Country Party, the honourwith its being introduced for the people of this able member for Murray( Mr Lloyd), said that country? Do honourable members opposite say optional preferential voting was first past the that they are second-class citizens? It was the post voting. The honourable member for Sturt honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock) ( Mr Wilson) who has just resumed his seat said who introduced that system for Papua New that it was not. He knows what he is talking Guinea. Today honourable members opposite about. Except for his speech he did not show a say that Australia cannot have it. They say: 'Give bad knowledge of electoral affairs. The Oppoit to those people in New Guinea. Who the hell sition knows it is phoney when it says that first gives a damn about them?'

It is good enough able members opposite. for Canada. I do not subscribe to first past the post voting, but if the Opposition says that it is undemocratic it is saying that the people of all those countries have undemocratic governments. It was not until 1918 that the system was changed in this country, so every government in Australia up to 1918 was undemocratically elected if a first past the post voting system is undemocratic. The Opposition wants a bi-partisan approach to electoral affairs. Why? try Party sitting down with the Liberal Party in a bi-partisan approach on electoral affairs? The Opposition knows as well as I do that at the very mention of electoral affairs to the Leader of the Country Party( Mr Anthony) he nearly has a stroke. Tonight all the stars of the Opposition have sat aside because, behind the scenes, they have decided that they will salve their conscience and not come in and say how they differ on these issues. It matters little to me what the Opposition says about these matters but the people outside Parliament want optional preferential voting. They want fair postal voting. They do not want manipulated voting. People all over Australia, migrants in particular, are seeking electoral reform. Let us take a look at optional preferential voting. The Opposition says that this type of voting have a look at what has happened. Optional Guinea by a Liberal Government. Do honourable members opposite put the people of New Guinea in the category of second-grade citizens who can put up with rigged boundaries and with rigged electorates?

216,Mr Daly,"Yes. Can one imagine the CounRecently in the Northern Territory optional preferential voting was introduced. The Australian Country Party says that optional preferential voting is no good. Of those seats in the Northern Territory, eleven went to preferences. In the end two were won by independent candidates and nine were won by the Australian Country Party. The fact of the matter is that that was the result of optional preferential voting in the Northern Territory. Do honourable members say that the Northern Territory election was rigged for the Labor Party? In the Australian Capital Territory the Labor Party won 4 seats under optional preferential voting. Do honourable members say that that is rigged voting? They know that their arguments are phoney. Why should people anywhere in this country, in this enlightened age, be asked to vote for seventy or eighty candidates? What is wrong with the system where they vote for the number of candidates equal to the number of vacancies? In certain circumstances I go along with the honourable member for Sturt who has just resumed his seat. Some people say that one needs only to vote for one candidate to have a formal vote. Quite frankly, any system is better than the present one which honourable members opposite know is impossible. Members of the Country Party are not very intelligent but a few of them are as intelUgent as the average elector. Idefy any honourable member to justify Voting for 73 candidates and to give his reason why he puts one candidate seventy-second and another candidate as twenty-second. Honourable members know that this is not logical. This is a system which is not followed anywhere else in the world. It only adds to the number of informal votes. Why would not the Country Party want the present system to continue? Any party which can get members in this House with from 17 per cent to 30 per cent of the formal vote ought to support the system. Why should not any party which can return the Queensland Premier with 19 per cent of the vote go along with the system? It is because honourable members opposite are not democrats that they do not want this kind of reform. That is why they are opposing it tonight. Now they want an all-Party joint committee appointed. What a phoney collection honourable members opposite are in relation to this matter. They know as well as I do that these reforms are a long time overdue. Tonight by voting against these proposals honourable members opposite are denying a vote to people working abroad in the government service. They are denying people in many walks of life the right to exercise a franchise. They want to allow theriggedpostal voting system to continue where those who are the most apt or earnest, as the case may be according to their poUtical convictions shall sway the vote irrespective of what the wishes of the people might be. Mr Speaker, the situation is that those opposite have not bothered to study these proposals which have been known to the public for a long time. who sits opposite, until tonight when he led for the Opposition on this issue I had not heard him speak on electoral affairs. Never have I seen a young man so conservative as the honourable member for Benelong( Mr Howard). He wants all the reforms in the world as long as he does not have to vote for them. That is the situation in this ParUament today. I have not the time to go through aU aspects of this subject. I should Uke to refer to registration of political parties. Practically all other countries put the names of political parties on their ballot papers. What is wrong with that democratic proposal? What is wrong with putting the names of the parties on the ballot papers for people to see the poUtical affiliations of those whom they are voting for? What is wrong with drawing for positions on the ballot paper? If honourable members opposite do not support it for this House why do they support it for the Senate? Honourable members opposite know as well as I do that their opposition to these proposals that we have brought down is phoney. The situation is, whether we Uke it or not, that those who sit opposite today are opposed to reforms in the electoral system just because they are not bringing them in. I made no statement that I bulldozed this BUl through the Parliament. I expected it to get more examination in this House than has been given in the cursory speeches that have been presented here tonight. I am amazed at the sUence of members of the Country Party, confident as they are that they have bulldozed in the Caucus room those on that side who ought to stand up for democracy in this country. Why, Mr Speaker, Country Party members opposite are voting against 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. poUing time. Yet in Queensland this has been law since 1915. Now the Country Party says it is undemocratic for the people to vote for the national ParUament between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. In Queensland the people have been voting under those conditions since 1915.1 wonder, if this had been a free vote, how many honourable members opposite would support these proposals.",73,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
217,Mr Killen,That is not true.,74,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
218,Mr Daly,"With due respect to my colleagueThe position is that those who sit opposite are opposed to electoral reform unless it is brought in at the point of the Country Party shotgun. Only by imposing on the people the most undemocratic proposals, be they on voting hours, electoral procedures or postal voting, will electoral changes be implemented by honourable members opposite. The suggestion by the Opposition of a joint committee is just a way of putting the matter aside. Does the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) sincerely believe that the Queensland method of regimenting postal votes is democratic in State and Federal politics in Queensland? Being quite honest, I do not exclude any parties from this; the Queensland system of postal voting is recognised throughout the nation as the crookest system of voting anywhere in the world. The Queensland system of postal voting, Federal and State, is the crookest system because of the manipulation that takes place. The Queensland members of this Parliament who intend to vote against the mobile polling arrangements are voting against the system that is in force in their own State and against the system that is in force in Western Australia. Yet, honourable members on the other side of the House tonight are voting against a reform that gives a person in hospital the right to see the electoral officer put his ballot paper in the ballot box in front of an official of the Government, instead of some Party organiser or some other unofficial person. Everybody knows that today people in homes are preyed upon by the over-zealous type of campaigner. We are seeking in every way today to find some reform that will bring to the people of this country real democracy. Let me recite for the benefit of the people an article that appeared in the 'National Times' on 18 November 1974.1 thought it was a good article, firstly because it was about me, and secondly because it was written by a person who would have a close affinity with that distinguished or undistinguished gathering which I sadly gaze on sitting in possum paddock in this Parliament. This is what the article had to say. Do not forget that this is the 'National Times'. It says: Daly's bill: Let's hope it's not delayedAnd then it goes on to sayMr Daly's new Electoral Bill is a thing or beauty and joyThat has not been said about me for yearseven if it has a brief life and the Liberal-Country Opposition the senators congregate. in the Senate kills it. It gets better as the article goes on. It states further: I am delighted with the Bill, and the principal source of pleasure is the fact that virtually all of the proposed amendments are, as far as I can see, free of obvious partisan advantage. They are designed to aid the voter, to provide a quick result, and to discourage sharp practices. 1 hope that the Opposition views the Bill in this light too, and I will be very interested in its criticisms. Why make such a fuss about minor amendments to the electoral system? Because they are fundamental to the whole business of government in our system. Let me tell honourable members who wrote that article. It was written by none other than Professor Don Aitken. I understand he is a prominent ex-member of the Australian Country Party. I understand he left the Country Party because he woke up to what a lot of dead heads he was wandering around with. There is the argument. It is as non-partisan as can be. Every proposal in this Bill is as non-partisan as can be. How can one please the Country Party tonight? I have adopted 16 of its amendments, 16 basic points of its policy, yet the member who introduced them is going to sit on the Opposition side tonight and vote against me. You cannot please them. They are like the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden). When one does what he tells one to do he still gets cranky. That is the situation of honourable members opposite. Tonight we will pleasantly look at members of the Country Party, and every Opposition member who was here prior to the last election, vote against their own proposals simply because they have been introduced by a Labor Government. becoming a little provocative. out of character for me but I was carried away. TonightI want to mention quickly in passing the points contained in this Bill. Optional preferential voting will give to the people of Australia the opportunity to vote without there being a waste of countless thousands of informal votes. Registration of political parties follows an electoral reform in practically all democratic countries. The introduction of mobile polling booths will bring to people who are sick, aged and infirm the opportunity to cast democratic votes. This provision also will do away with manipulation of the ballot, something experienced by many people. What can be more democratic than drawing for positions on the ballot paper? It applies in every trade union, every cricket club, every Hibernian Society and even in that old doddery place where The Bill also introduces closing of the polls at 6 p.m. Every Queenslander has voted under that c system for more than a generation and what is",74,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
219,Mr Speaker,Order! I think the Minister is,75,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill
220,Mr Daly,"I admit, Mr Speaker, it is a littlewrong with it in this modern age? Why should not people state their change of name if the change has occurred up to 12 months prior to the election? Why should not postal votes be in on the night of the election? I can tell the people of this country that in the last election Labor lost a seat on postal votes because a lot of people voted after 8 o 'clock on the night in question but signed that they had voted before that time. This Bill will prevent that kind of malpractice. If a person wants a postal vote why should he not put it into the ballot box before the close of the poll at 8 p.m. on election night? Why should not postal voting facilities be available to a man on remand at Long Bay Gaol, a man not convicted of anything and who still has all his civil rights but probably cannot raise bail. That man has not forfeited his freedom. He is innocent until proven guilty and consequently should be able to vote, This happens throughout the world. I hope honourable members sitting opposite closed the debate. find at the next election that about 30 people have changed their names to theirs. Then they to indicate that there were other honourable would realise why they should have voted to premembers who would have liked to speak in this vent people voting under their names.

In addition to that, the Bill' closed the debate. relates to failures and contains amendments relating to monetary penalties that go back to 1902. Those things have been brought up to date under this Bill. They, and a dozen and one other things, are reforms of a vital nature to the electoral system. If those things had been carefully studied I doubt whether any honourable member opposite could have objected other than in relation to optional preferential voting about which some people may have differences of opinion. Some honourable members may have differences of opinion on one or two minor issues. Armitage. J.L. About 50 per cent of these propositions are Barnard, K.L. H.

Mr Speaker, there were those who said I was going to bulldoze this Bill through the ParUament tonight but I do not know where they got that idea. I am amazed that those who talked so much, the spokesmen on these issues, hid in the background tonight and would not come forward in this debate. Now they are going to vote blindly against the proposals in this BiU the vast majority of which are their own proposals. I say quite sincerely that the proposals in this BUl were designed in order to give to the people of Australia an updated electoral system. No system is perfect. Every system needs reform from, time to time. Very few honourable members who sit opposite have studied this BUl, least of all, I ; think, the honourable member who led in this debate for them. When they sit down and study the Bill which they will have voted against they! wUl find that they did a disservice to democracy ., by trying to refuse to bring up to date the elec-. toral system of this country. The vast majority of these reforms were instituted and were sought in this Parliament as early as 1971 by the man who heads the Australian electoral system in this country, Mr Ley.

Quite surprisingly, I suppose, we refuse to accept the amendment that has been moved. I suppose that this is a remarkable occasion. It must be the first time upon which neither the speaker who led for the Opposition nor the members of the Opposition read the Bill that is before the Parliament. We gave them 6 months to think over this matter. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Hunt) who introduced sixteen of the amendments that we brought in has had since 31 March 1971 to read the Bill. It is obvious that they have not got around to it yet because they have voted against their own proposal. This includes the Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) who asked the honourable member for Gwydir to move the amendments on his behalf on 31 March 1971. So if they cannot wake up after 2!£ years, what the hell is the use of holding up the Parliament for another 6 months? In these proposals tonight we bring forward measures which we believe are designed to give the people of Australia a more democratic electoral system. We even stretched the limit to see that we included the proposals that were endorsed by the Country Party when in Government. The Country Party did not vote for those proposals tonight when they were brought in from this side of the Parliament. What is all this fantasy about waiting another 6 months? How do we know that honourable members opposite will read the Bill in that time? How do we know that they will know any more than they do tonight? I should have liked to hear the Leader of the Australian Country Party speak not so much on the Bill but on how he stood over the great man whom members of the Liberal Party will walk through the fires of hell to defend. I should have liked to have heard the Leader of the Country Party say how he told members of the Liberal Party to vote for this or else. This is typical of those who sit opposite. There is not an idea amongst them, not one bright idea on anything. All they seek to do is to frustrate and hold up to ridicule the Government of this country irrespective of the measures that are brought down. I think a lot of old people would Uke better voting facilities in hospitals and other places. There are lots of people, intelligent and unintelligent, who would like not to have to vote for 73 candidates or 48 candidates, as the case may be, but only for the 5, 6, 8 or 10 candidates of their choice. I tliink numerous people in the community would like voting to finish at 6 p.m. There are countless hundreds of people overseas who would Uke to know that their voting rights are protected. There are people throughout Australia who would Uke to know that the updatedthat he can speak only to the amendment. ment was very wide. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) said that all these measures should be postponed for 6 months. I am normally a person of few words, but these measures take a lot to cover. Tonight the Opposition rejects the proposals put forward by the spokesman for the Opposition on this issue. It is just an endeavour to frustrate the poUcy of this Government and above all else to defeat the 16 proposals that the Country Party endorsed. We are now asked to postpone for 6 months the one bright idea that honourable members opposite had in 23 years of government. Therefore tonight we on this side of the ParUament cannot support this amendment. We will vote against it. We categorise it for what it is-a n endeavour to hold up the democratic process of this country and a classic example to the people of Australia of members of the Opposition who are too lazy to read a BUl and who voted against their own proposals because they did not know what to do on the issues. If honourable members opposite want a bit of sensible advice I wUl give it to them. I do not often do so for nothing. Let me tell members of the Opposition what they should have done on this measure. They should have voted for the second reading of this BUl and voted for the proposals which they agreed with. I am honest enough to say to honourable members opposite that I think there are certain proposals in respect to the registration of political parties which, by a combined and united course, we could have improved. But the situation is that members of the Opposition were not prepared tonight even to move that a joint committee be appointed. They only said that one ought to be appointed. They did not move for one to be appointed. If the BUl had been considered in Committee they could have brought forward ideas which I would have been prepared to consider in the light of events if I thought they would improve the BUl.

Original question resolved in the amrmative. Bill read a third time. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 October on modon buses or whether it is a contribution which is by Mr Charles Jones: That the Bill be now read a second time. pose of the Appropriation (Urban Public Transport) Bill 1974 was set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport ( Mr ter on the presentation of the second reading Charles Jones). where. The purpose of the Bill is to appropriate funds to be allocated to the States for a variety of urban public transport projects that have been submitted by the States to the Commonwealth for approval. The total sum of money to be allocated is $66.1 lm. It is expected that $27.85m will be allocated in 1974-75 and the remainder during the balance of the program period. In his second reading speech the Minister listed the projects that have been approved from the States. There is a wide variety of projects from each State. I cite, for example, the money made available for bus cleaning equipment in Sydney, additional fuel storage at Sydney Depot, bus NOES workshop equipment at Chullora and Randwick, Nixon, P.J. improvements for 50 buses not contained in an Robinson, Eric original contract-and so it goes on in relation to Robinson, Ian New South Wales. Sinclair, I. McC. There is also an appropriation for train cleanStaley, A. A. ing equipment. Project number 12 is of particular Sullivan, J. W. interest. It refers to electric rail cars. It raises the Viner, R. I. question whether the Government, while it is Wentworth, W. C. sponsoring the provision of $80m for urban passWilson, I. B. C. enger train services, should still be prepared to Tellers: spend what appears to be $3m on 14 electric rail cars of the older type. I ask the Minister. What type of electric rail cars will be obtained? Will they be the traditional type which New South Wales has been buying? Does the Government expect that the urban public transport trains system will be completed and the State will be provided with 14 electric rail cars? Provision is made for hydrofoils for the Manly service, spare parts for Manly hydrofoils, ferries for the Manly service and the like. In Victoria funds are to be apFraser, Malcolm propriated for the Glen Waverley model line Katter, RG route construction, signal box amalgamations Snedden, B. M. throughout the metropolitan area of Melbourne and upgrading communication networks, and also the replacement of Melbourne and MetropoUtan Tramways Board vehicles with 37 trams at a cost of $4.84m and a contribution towards the acquisition of 50 new buses. In Queensland there is provision for a variety of programs including an electrification program and the purchase of 30 new buses. I am not sure whether the amount of $ 1.23m is the total sum for the 30 new being made at this point in time. So each of the States has in its own way secured a variety of projects that have been approved by the Australian Government for an allocation of funds. I must congratulate the Minisspeech. He has been a slow learner but at last he is beginning to learn that when he brings down a second reading speech in this House what we want to see are the facts. I congratulate him on the difference, the marked difference between his first speech on 11 July this year and this speech. I had to chide him somewhat over his speech on 11 July. I quote from my own speech. I said: Instead of being a correct technical document for the benefit of those interested in the principles in the Bill, it is a statement full of contradictions, self-aggrandisement, misleading statements, misrepresentations, inaccuracies and political bias. It is a far cry from the traditional and proper practice expected from such a document. As I say, I do genuinely congratulate the Minister tonight because slow learner though he may be he has at least learnt his lesson. His second reading speech is not so full of political opportunism",79,Pairs

243,Mr Nixon,"He's flying up in the air someand self aggrandisement. It does now set out what the program is all about. The Opposition welcomes this Bill because it is really the continuable. Indeed with innation ruiining the way it is, ation of the program that was started by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government back in 1969 when the Right Honourable John Gorton said in his policy speech that we would undertake studies for upgrading urban transport, and as a result of that, as history shows, the Bureau of Transport Economics made a study of a variety of proposals that were submitted to us to test their viability and whether or not they were worthy of public fund investment. I might say that as a result there was a promise in the 1972 Liberal-Country Party policy speech to continue an urban public transport upgrading program. I am delighted that the Labor Government has so swiftly joined in this program. In my speech on 30 JulyI pointed out that nowhere in Labor Party Policy right up to the election policy of December 1972 was there any mention of upgrading urban transport. Never in the 23 years that we were in Government did the Labor Party once mention the necessity to upgrade urban public transport, and not until that Party had seen the work that we had done did it follow our move. I know that the Prime Minister( Mr allocations for the replacement of trains, trams Whitlam) who was then the Leader of the Opposition was given a copy of the report of the Bureau of Transport Economics and then, like a latter-day saint, he came out with a policy of upgrading public transport. We welcome the measure. We have some coninvitation of the Minister for Transport to see it. I cern about how it is being implemented and the hope I will be able to see it privately, because of problems which it is creating for the States. For commitments I have not been able to see it on the example, I understand that Victoria sought day on which it has been displayed. $33.87m for projects to commence in 1974-75, but under the terms of this Bill that State will redeclared it black. ceive only $21.74m, or a reduction on what was sought of $ 12m. As I understand it, Victoria was refused money for a number of projects. TheI would like to look at it because I understand Australian Government provided funds for that it is too wide for the Victorian rail system. upgrading some rail routes but failed to make funds available for the provision of additional muck-up; it is a mock-up. trains to operate on the routes, even though funds for this purpose were sought by Victoria. The additional rail track between Greensword 'muck-up'. I understand the States are beborough and Eltham was rejected by the Ausginning to believe that it is a bit of a muck-up, as tralian Government on the ground that it was not the Minister put it. For example, I understand possible for it to evaluate the project intimefor the train is too wide for the present rail system in inclusion in the 1974-75 program of assistance. This brings me to a general complaint made understand it the urban passenger train has a by the States. I ask the Minister to see whether single-deck car. Therefore I am not sure whether something be done about the length of time the $18m that the Austrahan Government is taken to evaluate programs submitted by the investing in the urban passenger train system is States because, almost without exception, the wisely invested, when one considers the fact that States are complaining that thetime-tableis such the Government demands such detail even down 16729/74-R-(l03 ) that the financial year is almost over before evaluation takes place and money is made availthere is a fair amount of erosion of the real value of the money being given to the States. The Victorian Government submitted its 1974 train replacement program on the basis that two-thirds of the estimated $ 10m to be expended in 1974-75 would be met by the Australian Government. But the amount actually allocated by the Australian Government for the train replacement program for 1974-75 was only $4.17m, which is $2.5m less than the State anticipated it would receive by way of Australian Government assistance for its train replacement program. Some 93 old trains are yet to be replaced. Victoria wishes to increase its rate of replacement to 15 trains a year. The method of allocating funds for train and other vehicle replacement on a year by year basis used by the Federal Government makes long term ordering of replacement vehicles a risk for the States. Proper planning is hindered and confidence to enter contracts is weakened by the Australian Government's unwillingness to make and buses beyond one year. Is the restriction of an allocation to one year related in any way to the introduction of standard vehicles-plan s which have yet to be proven realistic? I am referring to the urban public transport train. I regret I have not had an opportunity to accept the kind Mr Charles JonesI am pleased you have not Mr Charles Jones-It is a mock-up. It is not a Victoria. New South Wales is moving towards a system using double-deck carriages, but as I",80,Appropriation Urban Public Transport Bill 1974
244,Mr Nixon,"No, I have not declared it black.",81,Appropriation Urban Public Transport Bill 1974
245,Mr Nixon,"The Minister said it. He used theto time tabling from the States in respect of programs that they submit. It seems to meI say that most kindly-that the Minister is being somewhat heavy handed in his approach to the States. The Federal Government requires the States to forward detailed submissions in order to obtain financial assistance for urban pubhc transport. I make the point again that the Federal Government has allocated $18m for a standard train project and has even constructed a modela muck-up, or mock-up, call it what you will-of the standard train without the viability of the project being proven and at atimewhen all the StatesI am speaking specifically of Victoria-hav e a real need to replace trains. In Victoria's case the red trains need to be replaced as quickly as possible, but this is retarded because of lack of funds. The Minister should realise that the failure of the Federal Government to provide Victoria with the funds for the train replacement program has a far reaching effect on that State's railways works program and also on urban transport upgrading plans generally. The present Government has held office for nearly 2 years. One of the promises on which it was elected was a plan worked over by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government, but this Government has stolen it. I do not hold any grudge about that but point it out as a fact of Ufe. Having done this, the Government should improve the mechanics of its handling of the whole matter. The States complain that the receipt of Commonwealth moneys is a most protracted affair and, as I understand it in Victoria's case, no money has been received in respect of the 1973-74 program. The $9.6m promised for projects commenced in 1973-74 if received tomorrow would be reduced through innation to $8.1m, a loss of real purchasing power of $ 1.5m. I think the Minister should realise that when these promises are made by the Australian Government they ought to be honoured as quickly as possible. State authorities are still involved in the collection of extensive details demanded by the Federal Government before the amounts approved by Federal Parliament for 1973-74 wUl be made available. Provision of Commonwealth assistance for public transport is clearly necessary in view of the financial straitjacket in which the States are now placed. At the moment the Australian Government is attempting to make decisions on the basis of the most detaUed operating information, even down to the level of timetabling. I think the Minister will agree that this can only result in inefficiency, frustration, long delays and an impossible diversification of responsibUities. Unless this lengthy and detaUed administrative mess is cleared up quickly only the public wUl suffer. I do not see any reason why the pubUc should wait any longer. New South Wales also has some difficulties with the program because forward planning for raU-car and bus acquisitions has been interrupted to some degree by the AustraUan Government's desire to develop this standard train and a standard bus. Firstly, there is the question of suitabUity of standard vehicles for all cities of Australia. New South Wales rightly points out the differences between the cities, including topography and basic requirements, and suggests different solutions. Basically, what is sought is planning for production continuity to avoid a stop-start situation that could lead to a production dislocation and staff retrenchments. There is a significant time lapse between the initiation of procedures for the letting of a contract and the deUvery of the first car. It is not just a question of getting the money. Considerable gearing-up and organisational work is required to get a program of this nature offthe ground. Having made those points, I ask the Minister to please consider the machinery involved in the evaluation of the projects and the time it seems to be taking for some of the projects to be evaluated. More importantly, would he please consider the means by which money is then made avaUable. If it is correct that Victoria, or indeed any of the States, has not yet received moneys that were made avaUable-<through a BUl introduced to this House on 11 July and passed tlirough the Parliament by the end of July, there is certainly something wrong with the machinery in respect of deaUng with the whole question. The Opposition supports this BUl. As I have said, it is a further flow-out of initiatives that were taken by an earlier Liberal-Country Party government. Debate interrupted. Road Transport-Standing Orders-Socia l Service Benefits-Parliamentar y Allowances: Newspaper article accordance with the order of the House, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr O'KEEFE (Paterson) (10.30)-In the time that is avaUable to me tonight I wish to bring to the notice of the ParUament and the Government a serious problem which exists in the Singleton district in my electorate. I am pleased that the",81,Appropriation Urban Public Transport Bill 1974
246,Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., inMimster for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) is at the table because portion of this matter comes within his administration. It concerns the cartage of coal by road from the Wambo mine and the Buchanan Lemington mine at Warkworth, which is just outside Singleton. This coal is carted through the main street of the town and down the New England Highway to a coal dump at Branxton railway station. Then many of these trucks go beyond that point to Hexham and on to Newcastle. Most of these huge trucks carry 30 tons of coal and more. At present they are doing something like 50 full trips a day through the town. When one includes their return trips, that means 100 trips a day. This is extremely dangerous. John Street, Singleton, is a very busy thoroughfare which carries not only district traffic but through traffic from Sydney on the Putty road. It is dangerous from a traffic point of view to pedestrians, particularly to school children. The use of this road by coal trucks is having a very damaging effect upon the John Street roadway, and deterioration in this area is taking place at a very rapid rate. Coal dust is entering the buildings which front John Street. The business premises have a very difficult coal dust problem not only in their premises but on the goods which they sell and display. This coal is for the export market. Recently the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor) informed this House and the Australian people that the Government had invested $3.7m in the Wambo mine and had made an immediate loan of $700,000. This was done through the Petroleum and Minerals Authority which was set up by this Government. It has given the Australian Government a 40 per cent interest in this mine. The other mine is the Lemington colliery which is conducted by Buchanan Borehole Collieries Pty Ltd. Four thousand acres in the Warkworth area have been taken over on lease by 2 very large niining interests. I will not name them tonight. They intend to start operations as soon as possible. This will double the traffic which already uses the road. The way to overcome this problem is to provide a by-pass road around Singleton, around the Army camp, coming out on to the New England Highway at Whittingham. This will be a fairly expensive job. Only4 miles of road are involved. I suggest that it might be a temporary expedient. This huge development of coal production in the area will probably warrant the construction of a railway line in the years that lie ahead. Coal is a valuable export earner. It will increase very considerably in value in the near future. Only last week the Minister for Transport agreed to meet a deputation from the Singleton Municipal Council and the Patrick Plains Shire Council to look at the proposition concerning the road. Unfortunately, because of the airline strike the deputation was unable to come to Canberra but I know that the Minister is prepared to meet this deputation at a suitable time in the near future. I am suggesting that the Government should provide funds to build this road and also to give further consideration to the establishment of a railway line in the Warkworth area. I know that the Minister for Transport is sympathetic-h e has indicated this in his letter-and I know also that the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor) will come into the picture because of the coal being exported from the area. This is a very hot question in the Singleton district. The 7,500 people who live there are extremely concerned at the dangerous situation which exists and which is increasing day by day. They have asked me as the Federal member for the area to do what I can to help. Therefore I have drawn it to the attenuon of the Government which I trust in its wisdom will see its way clear to provide this road and then, at a future date, to look at the possibiUty of constructing a raUway line from the Warkworth area to link up with the main northern line at Whittingham. Speaker, I rise tonight to draw your personal attention to gross abuses of Standing Orders of the House of Representatives last Thursday evening, which abuses I believe warrant your attenuon and the attention of the House. I wish to outline the facts. Firstly, at about 5.48 p.m. on Thursday 21 NovemberI was correctly called by the Deputy Speaker, Mr Scholes, to speak on the Banking BUl 1974. A member of the Opposition had been the previous speaker so naturally the call came to the Government side of the House. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch) then abused the forms of the House by seeking the call on a point of order which did not exist. Secondly, when the Deputy Speaker properly put him in his place by reasonably pointing out that he could not have the call because he had already spoken in the debate, and anyway the call belonged to the Government side of the House, the Deputy Speaker went on to say: There are certain procedures to be foUowed in this House which even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has to follow. The honourable member for Curtin( Mr Garland), with characteristic arrogance,",82,Adjournment
247,Mr Hurford (Adelaide) (10.37),"Mrproceeded to abuse Standing Orders by rising allegedly on a point of order to hurl abuse at the Deputy Speaker by saying: We do not have to have insults of that kind. That was, I believe, the pot calling the kettle remarks deserved to be named and thrown out of black, if ever I heard it. Thirdly, 10 minutes later the forms of the cause of the understandable leniency of the House were grossly abused once again by the Deputy Speaker. I believe the 5 members Deputy Leader of the Opposition interrupting deserve to be severely reprimanded and made to my speech by rising to take a non-existent point apologise. Let me identify them again: The of order concerning which Minister was looking Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of after the Bill in the House and then proceeding to the Australian Country Party, the honourable attempt to move a motion which he did not have members for Curtin, Cowper and Gippsland. the slightest right to move.

I repeat that it is quite unprecedented. that occasion. I believe it is my duty to draw this Fourthly, when this abuse of Standing Orders disgraceful episode to your attention, Mr was correctly pointed out to him by the Deputy Speaker, and to the attention of the House. This Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is just another episode in a long history of rowdyadded insult to injury by moving a dissent from ism since these people, who think they were born the Chair's ruling on no grounds whatsoever, to rule, were thrown deservedly into opposition. once again grossly abusing Standing Orders. Fifthly, the Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) was also grossly culpable by seconding this spurious dissent motion. The right want to comment a great deal on what has just honourable gentleman failed to take his call to been said by the honourable member for speak to it. In fact, he gave way to the honourAdelaide( Mr Hurford), but never in all my Ufe, able member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) frankly, have I heard such an amount of nonwhom the Deputy Speaker thought wanted to sense as I have just heard come from the honourspeak in the debate on the dissent motion but able gentleman. I would remind him of the exwho indeed wanted to speak in the Banking Bill perience of a previous Speaker in this House debate. Then the Leader of the Country Party who, because of the behaviour of members of the had the hide to abuse Standing Orders still honourable gentleman's Party, had to leave the further by seeking to move yet another dissent chair and adjourn the House until theringingof motion. Hansard pages 3899 to 3902 show quite the bells. A member of the honourable gentleclearly that he had no grounds whatsoever for man's Party was named, and refused to obey the doing this. Sixthly-thi s is my final point-a t this stage, ber to leave the chamber two other members of Mr Speaker, I was still seeking to speak on the the honourable gentleman's Party literally took Banking Bill but was prevented from doing so by up their positions on either side of that member. further non-existent points of order taken by the Because of that action the then Speaker, Sir honourable member for Cowper( Mr Ian RobinWUUam Aston, left the chair and adjourned the son) and the honourable member for Gippsland House until the ringing of the bells.

I want to say something this evening in regard to the question that I asked this afternoon of the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Cameron). I regret that the Minister is not in the House at this moment. I went around to his office to inform him that I was going to raise the matter but unfortunately he is away on official business. I make no criticism of that whatsoever, but it is unfortunate that he is not here. I am a litde disappointed about the answer that the Minister gave to me, although in the end he did say that he would discuss the matter with the Minister for Social Security( Mr cided not to do so. I did feel that he went into Hayden). I admit that the law as far as social security is concerned stands at exactly the same point at this present moment as it was under the previous Government of my poUtical persuasion, but the point that I endeavoured to make this afternoon is that the primary producer at the moment is facing an extremely difficult situation. Because he has property and therefore has a certain amount of finance he is not eligible in the same way as other people to receive social service benefits, yet in many instances he is suffering a loss of income. He has endeavoured to get unemployment relief. He has appUed for employment through the employment offices but employment is not avaUable. Because of the particular circumstances he is not entitled to unemployment relief. I concede that the Minister has done quite a deal in introducing schemes to retrain people who have lost employment in one particular sector. The Government has introduced schemes to provide financial assistance to certain industries to enable them to overcome the financial difficulties that they are presently facing. The point of my question and the fact that I was trying to bring to the attention of the Minister was that I felt that perhaps something could be done along the lines of giving primary producers who are facing this economic circumstance some return; it might be considered compensation for loss of income. The reason why I asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Security, because I know that it also comes into his portfolio, to look into this matter was that I have 3 instances in my area where the primary producer-the man-ma y have to leave the district to go to Sydney to find employment. Of course, this wUl place an additional burden upon the wife and chUdren who are left at home. In these circumstances, and for this reason, I should like the 2 Ministers to look at this matter to see whether something cannot be done to assist these people. I appreciate that many problems are faced in times of flood or bush fire when a farmer-owner is not entitled to receive relief but a share farmer is entitled to receive reUef immediately. It does not matter what assets you may have; if there is no income you cannot eat the dirt on the farm. I was rather disappointed that the Minister for Labor and Immigration went off on a sidetrack and talked about his own experiences and his appreciation of certain problems and difficulties. I would hope that he does have this appreciation. He said that at one stage he had thought of going into another honoured profession but had deanother profession at a later stage, which was perhaps connected with shearing the sheep which were looked after by the profession that he contemplated entering in thefirstplace. But quite seriously, I should like the Minister to look at this matter to see whether in conjunction with the Minister for Social Security something cannot be done to help these people in the particular circumstances and difficulties which they face at the present time. Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect) (10.48)-I should like to take a few minutes of the time of the House to refer to an article which appeared in thefinancialpages of the Sydney 'Sun' of Thursday, 10 October, 1974. It is headed: 'MP's tax perks are the lurk'. It begins: How would you Hke $6,000 a year in expenses-no t accountable to the tax commissioner? We all know that in fact we do not receive $6,000 a year in expenses. The article continues: Toss in a free carWe all know that we do not get a free carfree telephoneWe do not get a free telephone. . . and at least one overseas trip a year first class for nothing. That, too, is not true. Further on, the article states: There are quite a few more refinements on the system.

252,Mr Lucock,"I should say that the honourThe implication is that if we post letters from Parhament House, Canberra, somebody else pays for the stamps. There is reference to a statutory expense allowance of $6,000, which, of course, is not $6,000 but, if l remember correctly, $4,100. This article was written by Ralph Wragg, who is the Financial Editor of the Sydney 'Sun'. It is interesting to note, though not reported in the Sydney 'Sun', that one month later, as reported in other Sydney newspapers, certain things were said in a report into insider trading on the Stock Exchange in Sydney concerning Endurance Mining Corporation NL. The report stated that this case of insider trading was the largest example of such trading ever investigated in Australia. The report tabled in the New South Wales Parliament strongly criticised the role of the Press in promoting Endurance's shares, which rose from a little more than $1 in December 1968to$10.60 in February 1969 and then fell back to about $2 in June 1969. That was all before the Labor Government allegedly depressed the stock market. The report said that 'bullish' articles by the then financial editor of the 'Daily Mirror', Mr Cliff Riggs, on Endurance and the Attunga Mining Corporauon Pty Ltd, which Endurance took over, contributed substantially to the exposure of the stock to the public. It also criticised an article in the 'Sydney Morning Herald'. It went on to refer to the following: The report noted that Mr R. Wragg, Financial Editor of the 'Sun', was allotted shares in Endurance by Clinton and Co., sharebrokers, on December4 1968, which were sold shortly afterwards for a net profit of $2,700. The sum of $2,700 was made by Mr Wragg, the Financial Editor of the 'Sun', out of shares which were pushed by the newspapers, as reported in this case. Clinton and Co., sharebrokers, gave him enough shares to enable him to make $2,700. One would think that was pretty decent of Clinton until one read further on in the report that Andrew Clinton, stockbroker of Sydney, made $502,437.40 out of the same push. Another stockbroker or a number of stockbrokers made $568,000 each. A person called Peter Charles Murray made $402,000. Lawrence Charles O'Neill made $202,000. Leonard Robert Hall, a geologist, and Richard Edward Relph made $549,000. The public was taken downfora total of $5m. Clinton and Co., stockbrokers, and other stockbrokers made $502,000 plus. Wragg prostituted his job for just $2,700. There was no criticism of Wragg in the Sydney have no doubt been threatened by varinewspapers, but Wragg is the same person who ous Speakers and Chairmen for some of your was prepared to tell absolute lies about members minor actions. This is not unknown to any memof this House and about the benefits we get but ber. Therefore, the honourable member for who was not prepared to admit that that was the case even when it was pointed out to him that he was telling untruths. It is typical of the behaviour of the Sydney 'Sun' and the way in which it denigrates mainly the AustraUan Labor Party but ParUament and parUamentarians in general that it employs a person such as Ralph Wragg who has been exposed by the State Government, following an investigation by it, to denigrate parUamentarians in this House. I draw the attention of honourable members to the conduct of this person. I hope that the newspapers, which do so much to denigrate the members of this House, as we heard earUer today from the Treasurer ( Mr Crean), wUl take some note of the fact that if they are to have the privUege of running a newspaper they have to make every attempt possible to make sure that the stories they publish are true stories. It would not have been difficult for Wragg to check the facts. It is a matter of pubUc record what benefits we get for being parUamentarians, what our salaries are and what our allowances are. He obviously did not check. He did not correct the statements that he made. reluctant to rise in my place this evening but I feel that I should Uke to support my colleague, the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) in criticism of the outburst of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Hurford) earlier in this debate. I was rather amazed that the honourable member for Adelaide whom I thought was a pretty cool, calm type of member should personally attack and abuse the leaders of both the Liberal Party and the AustraUan Country Party concerning actions that they had taken previously in this chamber. It is pretty obvious that the honourable member for Adelaide has completely forgotten what the situation was when he, as a member of the Labor Party, was in Opposition. The honourable member for Lynerighdyreminded the House of the disturbances that had taken place from time to time brought about by members of the Labor Party. I had no intention of reminding the Government of such distasteful actions that took place years ago but when the honourable member for Adelaide decides to criticise the members of this side of the House in the Liberal Party and the Country Party, I am sure that these matters should be brought to his notice.

To suggest that we carried on like a rabbleI forget all the expressions that he usedthank the honourable member for Adelaide. honourable member's memory is not very lengthy because I have full recollections of the times when his colleagues were on this side of the House and were equally as noisy. The point I wish to raise in particular is that there are numerthat he would get little kudos by introducing the ous occasions when members of the Opposition are provoked into trying to make some sort of protest against what goes on in the chamber. After all, as the Minister for Services and Property( Mr Daly), as the Mimster in charge of the business of the House, has said frequently: 'You can say what you like. You may have right on your side, but we win because we have the numbers.' How often have we heard the Minister make this statement? That is hardly conducive to getting full co-operation from members of the Opposition parties. Is it any wonder that we show our objection, even by loud interjection, to various members and particularly Ministers when they are making some statements? Mr Speaker, I know that you will not allow me than your right. to talk about debates that are in progress, but some of the statements that were made by the House stands adjourned until 10.30 a.m. tomorMinister for Services and Property tonight in row morning. summing up one of the Bills to my mind were completely ridiculous because we all know that they were false. For instance, I indicated quite categorically where I stood on a certain issue. I indicated that I was supporting 80 per cent or even 90 per cent of the Bill. There were only a couple of matters that I could not support but the Minister then accused me and all the members on this side of the House of opposing the Bill. felt that I could not remain in this chamber tonight without at least making some explanation to those people who may care to read Hansard tomorrow or at some time in the future. I say again to the honourable member for Adelaide subject matter which he did tonight and by abusing the leaders of both the Liberal Party and Country Party on this side of the House. ing to abuse the Standing Orders? Standing Orders at all. What the honourable member is really saying is that the only people in this place who abuse or disregard the Standing Orders are those members on this side of the House. He knows very will that that is incorrect. There arejust as many faults on the Government side.

My Department is also represented on the Hospitals and Allied Service Advisory Council. Commission Houses: Rental (Question No. 470) Mr Kerin asked the Minister for Housing and Construction upon notice: (1) Can he say whether any State Commissioners for Housing implement criteria for the payment of a greater or economic rent for tenants of Commission houses when the income of the household passes a particular point. (2) What is the current stock of public housing in each State. (3) How many houses are being paid off by tenants in each State. (4) How many families or applicants are on the waiting list for public housing in each State at present. Mr Les Johnson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Each State housing authority calculates an economic rental for a dwelling based on amortisation of the capital cost of land and dwelling, with interest, and taking into account other outgoings such as maintenance, municipal rates, insurance, vacancies and defaults, and administration. Economic rents arereviewedperiodically to take account of changing circumstances. In some cases the economic rent for a particular dwelling is charged and, in others, some form of averaging of rents is practised; the degree of averaging and the method adopted varies between States. However, in all States a rental rebate or rent reduction is available to tenants in necessitous circumstances. All States except South Australia administer a formal rental rebate scheme based largely on the formula laid down in the 1943 Housing Agreement which relates the family income of the tenant to the basic wage of the State concerned, the amount of rebate being the difference between the economic rent of the dwelling and the maximum rent payable in accordance with the formula. The South Australian Housing Trust has a system of rent reductions based on a scheme of graduated rent up to the level of economic rent. Rental rebates or reductions are reviewed regularly in all States. (2) The stock of rental dwellings held by each State housing authority at 30 June 1974 was: New South Wales-65,082 Victoria-35,888 Queensland-18,613 South Australia-35,592 Western Australia-22,228 Tasmania-4,88 6 (3) The number of dwellings being purchased from each State housing authority is: New South Wales-28,611 Victoria-28,793 Queensland-10,966 South Australia-7,52 0 Western Australia-14,592 Tasmania-8,09 3 (4) The number of applications outstanding with each State housing authority at 30 June 1974 was: New South Wales-35,673 Victoria-16,290 Queensland-7,86 5 South Australia-15,200 Western Australia-11,81 3 Tasmania-3,22 2 Shipyards (Question No. 533) MrW a l l is asked the Ministerf o r Transport, upon notice: (1) What is the present state of (he order books of all the major shipyards in Australia.

It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of Australian Government expenditure by way of hospital benefits in respect of patients accommodated in religious and charitable hospitals. However, while precise details of payments to individual nursing homes are not readily available in the form required by the Honourable Member, it is possible to make a reasonable estimate of the total of Australian Government benefits paid in respect of patients in nursing homes categorised as religious/charitable for each of the years in question. The estimates shown hereunder have been calculated by applying the percentage of religious/charitable beds in the private nursing home sector (as at the 30 June for each year) to the overall expenditure for the private sector. As such, the estimates do not take account of the following factors: (i) fluctuations in the ratio of religious/charitable beds to private gain beds throughout each year; (ii) differences in bed occupancy rates between religious/charitable and private gain nursing homes; (iii) differences in the percentage of pensioners accommodated in the two categories (for the purpose of estimating the Australian Government additional benefit for pensioners since I January 1973).

Both the Flood Damage Home Survey, conducted by the Queensland Disaster Welfare Committee and the Disaster Intervention Survey carried out by the Social Work Department of the University of Queensland, look into householder response to disaster warning and post disaster time periods. It is expected that all Australian Government welfare orientated departments may be involved in a co-ordinated public education program, in order to ensure timely and efficient evacuation procedures.

Public Service: Librarians (Question No. 1340) Mr Lynch asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) How many persons are employed by the Government as librarians. (2) How many of this number are women. (3) How many female librarians are employed by the Government in senior administrative positions. (4) What percentage of librarians are employed by the Government in senior administrative positions. member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Public Service Board has provided the following table showing the number of full-time staff employed under the Public Service Act as librarians at 31 December 1973: Designation Librarian, Class1 Librarian, Class2 Librarian, Class3 Principal Librarian Total No records showing the number of librarians employed by the Government in authorities outside the Public Service Act are held by the Public Service Board. .(3) and (4) This information is not obtainable from records held in the Board's Office (assuming that 'librarians. .. in senior administrative positions' refers to officers holding able member's questions is as follows: librarian.qualifications but who are not currently occupying positions in the Librarian structure). i To obtain this information, and the information concernproblem settled promptly. In this respect officials of the two ing'the number of librarians employed by the Government Governments recently held discussions in Jakarta. outside the Public Service Act, would require an extensive survey of the records held by all Australian Government departments and authorities. Indirect Taxation (Question No. 1345) Mr Lynch asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Did he say on 14 May 1974 that Labor would not increase indirect taxes in the next Budget. (2) If so, why has the Government increased revenue charges in respect of cigarettes and spirits. (3) If not, has he at any ume sought to correct the remarks in respect of indirect taxation attributed to him in the 'Australian ""on 15 May 1974. member's question is as follows: (1) No. On 14 May 19741 said at my press conference that I could see no reason why direct or indirect taxes needed to be increased in order to pay for any of the Government's continuing commitments. Since then, the Government has announced changes in direct and indirect taxes on 23 July, 17 September and 12 November 1974. The net effect of these measures is to reduce substantially the burden on taxpayers. (2) See answer to(l) (3) No. The suggestion that action could be taken to correct inferences wrongly drawn by newspapers from public statements is impracticable. Government Factories: Unused Capacity (Question No. 1393) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, upon notice: What was the estimated unused capacity in Government factories in 1973. member's question is as follows: It will be appreciated that the term 'unused capacity' can have a varied meaning depending on the definition of 'capacity'. In peacetime, the Department of Manufacturing Industry defines 'capacity' in its factories as the level of operauons required to utilise the available facilities economically on a single shift basis. On that basis, it is estimated that for 1973 the overall 'unused capacity' of the Government factories Men Women Total was in the range of 40% to 50%. . . . . 18 98 116 Indonesian Fishermen in Australian Waters. . . . 18 67 85 (Question No. 1664) . . . . 14 14 28 . . . . 7 5 12 Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: . . . . . 57 184 241 (1) Did he discuss with President Soeharto, during his visit to Indonesia in September 1974, the question of Indonesian fishermen fishing in Australian waters. (2) If so, did he obtain from President Soeharto an agreement to co-operate in policing this practice. (1) Yes. (2) It was the President's wish, as it was mine, to have the Interdepartmental Committees (Question No. 1669) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Are any measures taken to review, on a continuing basis, the operation of interdepartmental committees in order to ensure whether or not matters under study by them are duplicated by other Government inquiries or are necessary in view of the fact that the matter on which the committee is deliberating has already been subjected to an inquiry by another source inside or outside Government; if so, what measures are taken and, who undertakes this review; if not, why not. By their nature, interdepanmental committees will be aware of other inquiries, completed or current, which may canvass matters that the committee is required to consider. Interdepartmental Committees (Question No. 1670) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Mimster, upon notice: (1) Was his refusal to provide a comprehensive list of interdepartmental committees, on which his Depanment was represented, based solely on the grounds that it would be too ume consuming and costly to prepare such a list. (2) If so, is it a fact that, in reply to questions I have placed on the Notice Paper, several Ministers have informed me that they do keep records or lists of interdepanmental committees on which their respective departments are represented.
