It is the farmers who, in my farmers play in soil conservation and in checking area, in the electorate of Wakefield, and in the soil, erosion. The honourable member for electorate of Grey, as has been acknowledgedMcEwen not only implied earlier in the debate dilemma of soil conservation. Indeed, he said that instituted the very water catchment schemes and they need to remember that it is not their land; dams that have minimised soil erosion. While on that it is held by them and is given to them in the subject of water catchment, may I say that it is trust. There is not a farmer I know who regards the irrigation farmers who have been involved in the land as his. Rather, he regards it more as his some of the salinity problems that are so much a heritage and as something he wishes to pass on in part of the salinity dilemmas that are causing soil better condition to succeeding generations.
