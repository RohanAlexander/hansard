255,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir,"Wednesday, 29 November 2006 ----Literacy Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.30 am)-TodayI would like to draw to the attention of the House a remarkable program launched recently in my electorate, an initiative administered jointly by the Smith Family and UnitingCare Burnside and to be generously funded over the next three years by Shell. The program is called ‘Let’s read-helping your child with early learning’ and involves the distribution of free materials to parents, including instructional DVDs and recommended reading lists, to assist parents in helping their kids with literacy before they start school. The program is the second in a series of three programs. ‘Helping your child with primary school’ was launched early this year and a third one, ‘Helping your child with high school’ is still to come. I was pleased to be invited to launch the program because there is no better way to ensure that all doors are open for a child than to make sure that they get the parental support they need to get those early literacy skills early in life, and there is no faster or more efficient way to leave a child behind than to let them reach school age without basic reading skills-and children are being left behind. While children in middle-class families, for example, may get up to 1,500 hours of one-on-one reading before they reach school, children from disadvantaged families may receive as few as 25 hours of one-on-one reading with their parent before they reach school. In my community too we have special difficulties with parents and grandparents whose command of English is not so good and refugee parents who are learning English at the same time as their children but whose children will grow through those early years faster than their parents can gain the skills they need to read with them in their new language. When a child is not given the basics at an early age, that child will pay for that-and so will all of us-for the rest of their lives in wasted potential, higher risk of poverty, greater dependence on government and a loss of quality of life that comes with opportunity and access to the world that education and a love of knowledge gives us. Children’s lives do not wait for adults to get it right, and today we see the most community minded and caring people in our community working to give parents the best chance of getting it right for their children at the most crucial time in those very early years. UnitingCare Burnside and the Smith Family have launched a wonderful program, giving parents the tools to help them teach their children and giving them the knowledge of how to do it. Parents will be able to give their children the best possible start in life. The parents of more than 1,400 preschool children are expected to benefit from this program in my electorate alone. I commend UnitingCare Burnside and the Smith Family for launching this vital program for the children in my electorate and I also commend Shell Australia for generously funding the program over the next three years.

256,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,"Electorate Meetings ings-I suppose that is what you would call them-to advise my electorate on my activities and also to seek a two-way exchange of views and to have a general discussion. We hold them as regular morning, afternoon and evening federal forums around the electorate. In these days of modern communication where one is able to use email, television or radio amongst various other means of communication, it is still important to eyeball people face to face and to sit down and talk with them and have that very important exchange of views. The meetings have provided residents with an opportunity to raise issues for discussion or concern and enabled me to report on my activities. Over the years it is interesting to note how the attendance at the meetings tends to wax and wane. Prior to the introduction of the goods and services tax in 2000 we had very large meetings. When elections are close the meetings are large. When there is not a high level of concern about issues or when the electorate is relaxed and comfortable, meeting attendance is not quite as high as it otherwise is. But we also get many people who ring us following this opportunity. We have the general public discussion and then, if any constituent comes along and has a problem of a more personal nature and would like to discuss that problem with me or a member of my staff, we facilitate that. My electorate is not as big as some others-it is under a thousand square kilometres-but we did have nine public meetings over the last week. They were held at the Kawana Surf Club at Buddina, the Pelican Waters Bowls Club at Golden Beach, the Caloundra Indoor Bowling Club, the Maleny Community Centre, the Kawana Waters Christian Church, the Mooloolaba Uniting Church, the CWA Hall at Buderim, the sales office at Sippy Downs and at my office at the Dolphin Centre, 118 Aerodrome Road, Maroochydore. We are going to have meetings in the new parts of the electorate which, compliments of the Electoral Commission, have been returned to Fisher. We are going to have meetings at Wamuran, Woodford and Kilcoy in the near future. So these meetings are held both in the existing electorate and in the new electorate. I want to congratulate all of those residents who came along. I very much enjoyed talking with them. I took on board the points that they made. Residents of course at times praised government policy and on other occasions wanted some changes in it, but I think this twoway discussion between elected representatives and the community is always very important. I make this commitment to continue these forums in the future.

These four members have been re-elected, as I guess was expected, but what might not have been expected was the vote that was returned to Labor in the west of Melbourne. There has been a view that the Labor vote would decline in the west; there has been an effort by non-Labor spokespeople and parties to suggest that there would be a decline. However, the vote has held up extraordinarily well. In the case of the member for Keilor, his vote increased. MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Statements By Members

258,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (9.36 Am),"I rise to acknowledge the third succesWhat was interesting to note was that in the seat of Kororoit the Liberal vote was only two per cent higher than Family First’s. I guess that means that the Liberals have a lot to do in relation to claiming any ground in the west of Melbourne, but it does say that people did vote for Family First in significant numbers. They matched the Greens in the west of Melbourne, which I think is also important to note; in fact, in most booths they outstripped the Greens, which is significant. It was interesting that they actually almost beat the Liberal vote-they were only two per cent shy of that. That is something we will have to keep an eye on. I would also like to indicate to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I recently sent out a survey to 4,000 young people, between the ages of 18 and 24, in my electorate seeking some of their views on all sorts of matters. I was happy to see a return of those surveys from more than 500 young people, 100 of whom are willing to catch up and meet with me to discuss local concerns in areas including education, transport issues and health matters. I will be conducting the first meeting of the Gorton Youth Forum on 13 December and I look forward to meeting these young people. Many of the responses were comprehensive, in that they not only ticked the boxes and indicated their concerns but wrote at length about some of their major concerns. I look forward to meeting them. I am happy to say I have already met Matthew Lang, Felicity Cronin and Donna Fenech, three young local people who were able to attend the opening of my office when the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, was present. That was a good start to what I am sure will be a fantastic, successful and important youth forum.

In the parliament today I speak on citizenship because on Saturday, 11 November, Remembrance Day, at three o’clock I had the great privilege of presiding over a citizenship ceremony where we welcomed into the Australian family some 60 new Australians, who took the oath or the pledge of allegiance to our country to become citizens. I want to take the opportunity to thank all those involved, who made the ceremony very successful and very enjoyable. Initially I want to thank my MC, Ms Camilla Cowley, who is a great advocate for refugees. I also want to thank the schools that were involved-young Australians who witnessed people from many different countries becoming citizens of our country. I want to thank Helen Twaddle and Gabriel Mukuan, school captains of Indooroopilly State High School. The ceremony was conducted at the Peter Doherty lecture theatre at Indooroopilly State High School. I thank Ms Lois Collins, the Principal of Indooroopilly State High School, for making us so welcome there. Also in particular I want to thank the young students of the Toowong State School band, who beautifully performed Freedom’s March, a very moving piece of music that really did inspire many of the Australians who were there to support their friends and their neighbours who became citizens.

This country is a very vibrant community; it is a very strong community. We are home to one of the most multilingual workforces in our part of the world, where citizens from over 200 countries, about three million of Australia’s population of 20 million, speak a language other than English at home. But of course we encourage all new Australians to make English their premier language. (Time expired) Cranbourne Information and Support Service provide much-needed assistance to the residents in my electorate. The first organisation is the Cranbourne Information and Support Service. This fantastic service covers the area from Hampton Park to Cranbourne. It has a catchment area of roughly 100,000 people. It provides emergency relief funding and also financial counselling to people in need, although the financial counselling for people in need of that service is massively underfunded. There is a financial counsellor at the Cranbourne Information and Support Service working four days a week to service 100,000 people, and there are waiting periods of about four to six weeks for an appointment. People seeking emergency relief and financial counselling, interestingly, are not just coming from what normally is categorised as the underprivileged but are people who have mortgages. People who are seeking emergency relief are basically coming in due to multiple debts due to mortgages, credit cards, utilities and phone credit cards. They are noticing and experiencing now a massive spike of people coming in between November and January, as people seek help for the cost of education. They have created a new program through fundraising for those particular families, called ‘back to school expenses’. They are finding that education is one of the biggest imposts on a family outside of the mortgage and the rent. People are struggling to pay for books, school shoes, fees, formal and informal fees, elective subjects, swimming lessons, camps and calculators. Seventy per cent of people who are coming into the Cranbourne Information and Support Service have never sought help before and they are struggling with the costs. We are seeing more and more people coming in for emergency relief who have mortgages. tial services such as gas and electricity. These good, working families who have come to Cranbourne and taken out a mortgage are struggling with the cost of living. In my electorate we distributed a survey that had a massive response, particularly from the people of Cranbourne-and these are good, average Australians that are struggling with the cost of living and receiving no help from the government. You would think that in an area that covers 225,000 people the government would provide several financial counsellors-my seat has the highest rate of mortgages in Australia but the Commonwealth has funded only one financial counsellor.

(Time expired) Water $700,000 worth of water-saving initiatives in my electorate last week. This brings to 54 the total number of projects, and almost $2 million has come into the electorate in rounds 1 and 2. I commend the communities in the Riverina who are helping to ensure a sustainable and waterwise future. The projects will promote waterwise use and increase community awareness about water efficiency, conservation, water recycling and water health. It is expected that nationally community water project grants will save many thousands of megalitres of water per year and that community groups will donate 560,000 volunteer hours to implement their projects. I was fortunate in this round to have grants made to Coolamon Sport and Recreation Club; TAFE New South Wales; Riverina Institute; Marrar Australian Football Club; Narrandera High School; Griffith Public School; Griffith City Council; Gundagai Pastoral and Agriculture Society; Yanco Agricultural High School; Colleambally Aged Persons Accommodation Association; Leeton Whitton United Australian Football Club; the Diocese of Wagga Wagga as Trustee for St Joseph’s Narrandera; St Mary’s Primary School Hay; Hay Public School; Leeton Golf Club Ltd; Murrumbidgee Shire Council; Narrandera Landcare Inc.; and Ariah Park Mirrool Football Club, which did such a terrific job. I went out to Ariah Park Mirrool Football Club to see how wisely they had spent the last grant money they received. They have built a fabulous dam and they have collected all the run-off from great stockpiles of wheat and grain. Unfortunately, there are no great stockpiles of wheat and grain there now, but there certainly will be again in the future. This grant was used to collect all the rainwater-when we get it, and we will get it-off the massive sheds and milling areas. That is being used for the entire process in Marrar. Marrar has been a fabulous asset for us. They have been able to recycle water for their entire community, and I am very proud of their performance. I am proud of all of my electorate for getting involved in our community waterwise grants and providing to communities not only water-saving efficiencies but education on the fact that, as a community, we need to use our water in the wisest way. The government is assisting through this grants project. Television Sports Broadcasting Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (9.49 am)-While Australian viewers are enjoying watching the Ashes test cricket series on free-to-air television, and particularly the great result at the Gabba, English fans will not be so fortunate. Audiences in the UK are having to pay to watch their team and will only be able to see a delayed highlights package the following night on free-to-air on the BBC. In Australia we can thank a former Labor government for this situation, as back in 1992 they introduced anti-siphoning laws designed specifically to prevent certain sporting events from being siphoned off to pay TV. The current anti-siphoning list encompasses 10 sports, including the popular ones-football, cricket, tennis, golf-plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. It is a list of major sporting events that the Australian parliament has determined must be available for all Australians to see free of charge. MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Statements By Members
263,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (9.45 Am),"I rise to say how pleased I was to announce almostThe Howard government is proposing to introduce a use-it-or-lose-it rule for sports on this list to, as they say, ensure that broadcasters are showing the events they acquire and that listed sports are not being hoarded-and neither should they be. On the surface this seems a reasonable enough proposition, provided of course the criteria operate fairly and consideration is given to the impact on viewers if an event is taken off the list. As I understand it, there will be quite an amount of ministerial discretion about what stays and what comes off. A use-it-or-lose-it scheme should not result in less free sport being available to viewers, so any scheme would need to consider the impact of delisting events on the viewing population. It should also look at the rights broadcasters acquire and whether unused events are available to or purchased by pay TV. The use-it-or-lose-it mechanism should not result in free coverage of sporting events being replaced by pay coverage, for this would have a very serious impact particularly on low-income households, many of whom I represent in the electorate of Throsby. Considering that the cheapest package on pay TV is around the $600 a year mark and the average, I am told, is about $1,000 a year, this would make the cost very prohibitive and deny many people access to freely available free-to-air sports coverage. Australian sports fans-and we are a great sporting nation-take it for granted that they will always be able to see their favourite sporting events on free-to-air TV. They ought to be alerted to the possibility of this new use-it-or-lose-it rule taking some of those well-covered sports off free-to-air TV and siphoning them off to pay TV. It is up to the Howard government to make sure that this does not happen. (Time expired) Victorian State Election Heritage) (9.52 am)-In the wake of the Victorian state election, I want to reaffirm my support for the principles of protecting the Mornington Peninsula. The election result was very clear. Some of the biggest swings in the state of Victoria occurred in the Mornington Peninsula in the seats of Nepean and Mornington, both of which, it appears, will see a swing of up to about 10 per cent towards the Liberal Party. Firstly, that is a testament to the sitting member for Nepean, Martin Dixon, and to the incoming member for Mornington, David Morris. Secondly, it is a recognition that there is an issue of profound importance which covers both of those seats, and that is the notion of protecting the peninsula. In particular, that vote harnessed the concern that both of these members raised. Mornington Peninsula residents are seeking guarantees that the peninsula will be protected and preserved, not just for the next decade and for the next generation but for the coming century. In order to do that, they seek two guarantees: firstly, that the principle of 70 per cent rural with a capped 30 per cent urban boundary will remain in place; and, secondly, that this will be done by way of a particular planning policy designated for the peninsula. There should be a specific peninsula planning policy. Nowhere in Victoria has there been such an emphatic vote, far in excess of state-wide swings, on a regional basis. The notion of recycling and cleaning up the water from Gunnamatta outfall was another defining issue. Those two issues-a separate planning policy for the Mornington Peninsula, coupled with an urgent and immediate need to end the dumping of ocean outfall at Gunnamatta-combined to represent the issues which Mornington Peninsula residents voted on. On the other side of the peninsula we have seen a change in the character of the seat of Hastings, going from a Labor-held seat to a Liberal-held seat.

There is an alternative site north of Hastings, which is already an industrial area. But south of Hastings-I agree with the mayor-the Crib Point area should not become a site for new industrial development. (Time expired) Brisbane Airport new parallel runway at Brisbane Airport. This was first put forward to the people of Brisbane’s south side and north side back in 1997 when the Brisbane Airport master plan was released. Since they first put forward this proposal for a new parallel runway, on four separate occasions I have been in court either with the federal government or with the Brisbane Airport Corporation, through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and then the Federal Court, in an attempt to stop this runway proceeding. In fact, the substantive matter that I put to the Brisbane Airport Corporation is that they should not proceed with the construction of that runway until they had conducted a proper cost-benefit analysis of all alternative runway options. That has never been done. However, as for the last leg of that court process before the Federal Court, the record shows that the federal government and the Brisbane Airport Corporation defeated me. As a result, costs of $32,000 were awarded against me, which I was required to meet personally. Again, I place on record my thanks to Brisbane’s southside community for raising most of those funds on my behalf. When it comes to what has happened since then, the Brisbane Airport Corporation, having obtained approval by the federal government through the transport minister of the Brisbane Airport master plan, have gone to the final stage of the development approval process-and that is through its major development plan and simultaneously through its environmental impact assessment. These two documents have been released to the community for final comment in recent weeks. I am in the process of contacting all members and residents of Brisbane’s southside community to encourage them to have a direct input into the final determination of this by the federal government. I have stated repeatedly on the public record that I do not believe that I can now stop this thing from proceeding, because I have been defeated in the courts on this question. Once the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services approves this major development plan and the EIS, the last regulatory approval will be in place for the Brisbane Airport Corporation to proceed with construction of this new runway. The key challenge therefore for me, as the representative of the people in Brisbane’s southside community, is developing an effective noise management plan for this new proposed runway. It will have a significant effect on the residents in my community. It will have an effect on schools and people’s houses. It will have an effect on people’s quality of life. I am deeply concerned about that and I have stated my concern in this chamber on many occasions over the last seven or eight years. The challenge is to manage the impact of this, and therefore my request to the federal government will be to work with me and other representatives to MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Statements By Members

Wakefield Electorate: Clare Medical Centre an innovative model of medical care which I had the pleasure of opening in Clare last week. The Clare Medical Centre is a $2.2 million development in terms of infrastructure and, whilst I am pleased that the Australian government was able to contribute just under $200,000 to that, through the Rural Private Access Program and the Spencer Gulf Rural Health School, it is a sign of the commitment by Dr James McLennan and his team that they were prepared to raise and underwrite the capital to build this facility. Whilst the facility is good-it provides a model for rural health care that I think should be taken note of around the country-it is really worth telling this parliament about because the proposal provides sustainability, not only for the medical workforce but also for the community. To take the community’s perspective, without a viable medical workforce it is hard to attract young people to come and work in a community in a regional town and it is impossible to keep a hospital going. In country areas the local GPs are also the doctors who provide the emergency and procedural services at the hospital, and they look after things like childbirth. But there is not a focus there to attract visiting specialists, so you tend to get a drift away from the town. Importantly, this model also means that there is sustainability for the doctors not only in Clare but also in surrounding towns. Many small towns have a population large enough to need more than one doctor but not large enough to sustain two doctors. That means a solo doctor working in one of those towns has no opportunity for professional development or leave, and it is increasingly difficult to get a locum to relieve them. The Clare Medical Centre has now managed to provide both an outreach service in terms of a subagency and an outreach service that is cooperating and working with the solo practices in surrounding regional towns such that those doctors know that they will have consistent and quality relief on a regular basis, which makes both their lifestyle and their own ability to access professional development sustainable. That means that the community in that town is sustainable. I commend the model that James and his team have put together as well as the work that he and Steve Holmes-another doctor in Clare, who is the South Australian President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia-have done at a national level in advocating for regional communities and regional health care and the changes that we need to implement from a federal government perspective to make sure that we have a sustainable and suitable rural medical workforce into the future. order 193, the time for members’ statements has concluded.

Transmitter Licence Fees Bill 2006 and the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Collection of Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees) Bill 2006. This legislation follows the government’s decision announced earlier this year to auction currently unallocated broadcasting spectrum to provide new digital television services. This is the spectrum that was set aside in 2000 as part of the government’s disastrous datacasting experiment. As members will recall, the then minister, Senator Alston, attempted to create a new category of television service. In that event, the limitations on the types of programs that could be shown by datacasting licences were so restrictive that the auction failed. The failure of the government to use scarce broadcasting spectrum to allow the creation of attractive new services is one of the main reasons why its digital TV policy has been a spectacular failure. This time around, the government has announced that the spare spectrum will be divided into two parts, known as channel A and channel B. ChannelA will be reserved for in-home digital TV services and, depending on the technology used, it could provide up to eight television services. However, the holder of this licence will not be able to offer commercial broadcasting services. ChannelA services will be limited to narrowcasting, datacasting or community television. This is an important feature of the regime and it is a point that I will return to later. ChannelB will be subject to a less restrictive regime. There is a widespread view in the industry that channel B is most likely to be allocated to a licensee who will use the spectrum to provide mobile television services. It is the intention of the government to auction the spectrum for channel A and channel B early next year. The bills before the House today are part of a number of steps that must be taken to allow the spectrum to be sold. These include planning the spectrum, designing the auction process and further clarifying the nature of the regulatory regime that will apply. The legislation before the House today relates only to proposed channel A. These bills facilitate the collection of licence fees from the holder of the new channel A datacasting licence. The Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees Bill 2006 imposes an annual licence fee on the holder of a channel A licence based on the percentage of revenue received by the licensee. The bill provides that licence fees are to be levied on a sliding scale similar to that which applies to commercial free-to-air broadcasters. Fees range from half a per cent to nine per cent of the licensee’s revenue. The maximum rate of nine per cent will not apply until the licensee’s revenue exceeds $75 million. The second bill in this package, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Collection of Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees) Bill 2006, provides payment machinery and recordkeeping obligations to support the datacasting bill. MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Distinguished Visitors
268,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (10.02 Am),"I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the DatacastingAsI mentioned earlier, the government has indicated its intention to conduct the auction for the channel A licence early next year. The offer documents for the auction will need to specify the obligations of licensees. It is important that prospective bidders are informed as soon as possible about the nature of the regulatory obligations attaching to these licences. Labor will support the passage of these bills through the parliament to impose a licence fee. The broadcasting spectrum is a scarce public resource. As a general principle, it is appropriate that the holder of a licence to provide services on this spectrum be required to pay an annual licence fee to the Commonwealth for the privilege of being able to offer these services. This principle has long been recognised in relation to radio and television services. Notwithstanding the fact that the opposition will support this bill, we would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to make some broader comments about the proposed channel A service and digital television policy in general. According to the government, the new channel A licence will have two significant policy impacts. Firstly, it has been argued that the new services will provide media diversity and will offset the effect of increased concentration and ownership as the inevitable consequences of the government’s new media laws. This claim is nothing but an attempt to deceive the Australian people about the impact of the new media ownership laws. The restrictions on the new channel A licence mean that the services that will be likely to be broadcast will be limited to narrow types of services. There could be religious channels, a home shopping channel, a traffic report channel or a government services information channel. ChannelA will not be a new commercial television service. It is nonsense to argue that these channel A services will offset the loss of diversity of news and opinion that would come about if a major metropolitan newspaper like the Age or the Sydney Morning Herald merged with a TV station like 7 or 9. The government have also argued that channel A will be a significant driver of the take-up of digital television. This claim is open to considerable debate and I am sure we are going to hear from the government about what they think on this issue. As I stated earlier in the debate on the digital television bill passed last month, the government restricted the channel A services to programs which fit the description of narrowcasting, datacasting or community television. These of course are all niche services. There is considerable scepticism in the media industry about whether there is a viable business model for channel A given that the licensee will be only able to show a limited range of programs. Perhaps that is something the member for Hinkler can address in his remarkswhether this will provide the sorts of services that he is looking forward to in regional Queensland or that might be provided to regional Australia. News Ltd and Fairfax have indicated that they are not interested in bidding for this spectrum because they do not think that it is sustainable commercially. I think that says a lot about what the government is actually trying to do in this bill and what it has done in terms of its cross-media ownership laws. It is interesting to note that in the explanatory memorandum to the datacasting bill the government declined to make any estimate of the amount of money that will be raised from the annual licence fee imposed by the legislation. This may be an indicator that even the government is aware that it is auctioning something that is unlikely to generate a significant revenue MAIN COMMITTEE stream. It is very unlikely that channel A will make a significant contribution to driving the take-up of digital television. The rollout of infrastructure to broadcast in digital has made excellent progress in the country-85 per cent of the Australian population can access all of their local free-to-air services in digital. However, in Australia and overseas it has been shown repeatedly that additional attractive digital content is the key to convincing consumers to invest in digital television. It is that element that has been missing from the government’s digital policy for the last seven years. The recent digital television legislation makes only a minimal attempt to address this deficiency. As most people would know, even if they have got digital television at home, it is almost a matter of saying: ‘Why would you have it? Why would you bother? Why would you spend the extra dollars required?’ It is quite expensive. The content that is likely to be shown on channel A will not appeal to a mass audience. It is clear that the rules regarding channel A were not designed with the interests of consumers in mind. Back in 2000 the government set a target to switch off analog broadcasting by the end of 2008, which is now approaching very quickly. Of course, it has been clear for some time that there is no way this target will be achieved. Last week the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, released what she called her ‘digital action plan’ to drive take-up so analog broadcasting can be switched off by 2012. Unfortunately the digital action plan is further evidence that the interests of consumers are a very low priority in the government’s media policy. In the digital television legislation rammed through the parliament in October, Senator Coonan put in place a regime which limits consumer choice and reduces incentives for consumers to invest in digital technology. For example, commercial broadcasters can only run a second digital channel or multichannel in high definition until 2009-all a little bit too complex. At present HD equipment, high-definition equipment, is in only around seven per cent of households, which I think is a very poor outcome and an indictment of this government’s policies. It is typically three times as expensive as standard definition equipment. This restriction may suit the interests of some media companies, but it is very hard to see how it is in the interests of any consumers at all. The market for high-definition broadcast is so small that it must be doubtful whether it will be commercially viable for any broadcasters to launch a high-definition multichannel. Senator Coonan’s legislation also severely restricts the ability of free-to-air broadcasters to show major sport on their digital multichannel service. Under the government’s laws, if for example there is a clash between the 7 pm news and a netball test between Australia and New Zealand, the ABC is not allowed to show the match live on ABC2. You would have to wonder how the government could possibly argue that this restriction is in the public interest. Again, perhaps that is something that the member for Hinkler can address in his remarks and tell us how that would be in the interests of his constituents, of regional and rural Queensland and of other regional parts of Australia. How will it encourage consumers to take up digital TV? This is the question that needs to be asked. This government is not serious about putting in place a media policy that puts the interests of consumers first. There is much work to be done in getting Australia to the point of digital switch-over. As the minister admitted last week, more analog equipment is still outselling digital equipment. So, while 41 per cent of households have access to digital television, 26 per cent of houseMAIN COMMITTEE holds have two or more sets. One set-top box or digital TV per household will not be enough to allow switch-over to proceed. Research commissioned by the Australian Communications and Media Authority indicated that only 17 per cent of televisions in Australia have been converted to digital. Again, that is a very poor outcome and a very poor indictment of the government’s policy in this area. The task of achieving digital switch-over is a huge policy challenge for this country. Australia and the UK are both due to complete switch-over to digital by 2012, some many years after the government had originally indicated would be the date. However, the UK is far more advanced than Australia along the path to digital transition. 72.5 per cent of households have access to digital TV in the UK and it is estimated that 40 per cent of TVs have been converted-a much better outcome. In Australia there is still a widespread lack of awareness in the community about digital TV. Fifty-seven per cent of people do not know whether digital television is available in their area. Thirty per cent of people are not aware that analog broadcasting will be switched off at all. Measures announced in the digital action plan, such as improved labelling of analog equipment, increased consumer education on the benefits of digital TV and industry coordination, are absolutely essential and Labor encourages the government to progress these matters as quickly as possible. The announced measures, however, do not make up for poor government policy that limits the appeal of digital television to consumers. The digital action plan announced by the government contains no additional money to allow the ABC and SBS to create new attractive digital content which would encourage consumers to take up digital. Labor believes that the national broadcasters have a key role to play in building a digital Australia. Through ABC2 and the SBS world news channel, the national broadcasters have shown that they are keen to embrace the potential of digital television. They need government to maybe go that one step further with them to make that happen. If public broadcasters are to exploit the full potential of digital television then additional funding will be required. It is the old case of the government needing to put its money where its mouth is. Currently ABC2, the ABC’s digital-only channel, runs on around $2 million a year. If you put that into the context of costs of programming and content, $2 million is literally a drop in the ocean. As a consequence the service largely consists of time-shifted material from the main channel and children’s programming. Exciting new content is needed to drive digital uptake. Given where we are currently at in digital uptake, perhaps we need to go that one step further-swing the pendulum a little bit too far in order to make amends and bring people on board, to drive them to seriously look at digital uptake. Otherwise, I am afraid that even by 2012 we are not really going to get the sorts of outcomes that the government is hoping for. The ABC and SBS both made bids in their triennial funding submission for the resources to make this content happen. The ABC asked for funding to broadcast an extra 200 hours of digital-only content for the ABC2 and ABC broadband platforms. Two hundred extra hours is not a lot. They also sought to develop interactive television enhancements to differentiate digital from analog television. SBS sought funding for two new digital-only channels. These proposals were completely rejected by the government which, if the government seriously wants to make this happen, should not be the case. In the UK, extra channels and interactive services offered by the BBC have been a key driver of digital take-up. MAIN COMMITTEE In the lead-up to next year’s budget I urge the government to reconsider providing extra funding to the national broadcasters as a way of increasing the appeal of digital television to ordinary consumers. The announcement by the minister last week that a firm date will be set for digital switch-over is welcomed, but there is no point setting a date unless it is backed by credible policies as well as dollars. Senator Coonan’s digital action plan comes seven years after the former minister, Richard Alston, released his digital broadcasting industry action agenda. Regrettably, the digital television regime that the government has legislated means that Senator Coonan’s plan is likely to be only a moderate improvement on that of her predecessor. So while the government has spent years dithering on digital policy, other developed countries have rapidly moved into the digital age. People listening to this might draw a comparison to broadband to the home to show where this government has left this country in terms of moving into the 21st century properly. The take-up of digital television in Australia lags well behind countries like the UK and the US where governments have invested heavily in the transition. Achieving digital switch-over offers sizeable benefits for the Australian economy as well as for consumers. It is not just about giving consumers a better viewing experience. The reason why governments around the world have made achieving digital switch-over a policy priority is that it offers a large efficiency benefit known as the digital dividend. As I have said in the House previously, there is strong public interest in freeing up the spectrum currently used for analog broadcasting so that it can be deployed for additional TV channels or wireless broadband services. More efficient use of spectrum could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Australia. In addition to this efficiency dividend, achieving switch-over would end costly simulcasting where broadcasters are forced to transmit in both analog and digital, which is obviously inefficient. The government has conceded that every year it costs around $75 million to meet the analog broadcasting costs of the ABC and SBS, which assists regional broadcasters. Digital switch-over would also allow these funds to be redirected to programming. I am sure that this would be welcomed by all viewers. I conclude my remarks today by restating that the opposition will support this legislation so that prospective bidders in the auction of channel A can have a measure of certainty about the costs involved if they want to acquire the licence. Labor has very grave doubts about whether channel A will have a significant impact on the take-up of digital TV. This government needs to seriously rethink its approach; it needs to design a policy that serves the interests of the community and serves the national interest and the economy. I commend the bills to the House. and the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Collection of Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees) Bill 2006 are another step forward in the allocation of channels through unused spectrums to enhance digital services. I welcome the opposition’s support of this legislation, but the previous speaker, the member for Oxley, was far too harsh in his assessment of what has been happening. By way of preface, Australia, in adopting various forms of broadcast and telecommunications, has always taken the cautious approach. We were not one of the first countries out there with black-and-white television but, when we did get it, we had the best standard and it was MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Broadcasting Services Amendment Collection Of Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees Bill 2006
269,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.18 Am),"The Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees Bill 2006readily taken up. The same applied to colour television. I am confident the same will apply to digital television. I remember David Hill, when he was the Managing Director of the ABC, giving a public lecture in Bundaberg. I was not in parliament at the time. He described Australians as electronic junkies. He pointed out the rapid take-up of black-and-white and colour television. He also talked about things like VHS machines, fax machines, mobile phones and the like and how readily we have embraced those things. For a country as wide and diverse as this, there is GSM coverage somewhere in the order of 96 per cent and CDMA coverage of about 98 per cent of people in their homes in this country. That is not to say that we cover the whole of the nation. You do not put 25 transmitters in Sturt Stony Desert, for example. But it has been an orderly and measured approach. It is true that the turn-off date has been put back to the year 2012, but the government’s original plan was to turn it off in 2010. IfI recall correctly, it was the Democrats which had that amended back to 2008, and that was probably too ambitious a target. But there have been a lot of movements over recent times, not the least of which is the fall in the price of set-top boxes. I have seen them as cheap as $49. I do not know how good they would be, but you can certainly get quite acceptable models-the member for Herbert is an expert in these mattersin the range of $50 to $100. There may be opportunities further down the track, with respect to those last few people who perhaps cannot afford set-top boxes, where the government will consider some form of subsidising those so that all people can participate in the digital agenda. I for one would certainly support that, and I know that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts is not averse to it, although I think her view is that that would be premature at this stage. The other thing we have to recognise is that all the free-to-air channels have seven megahertz of analog spectrum. That applies to the ABC, SBS and the three major commercial channels, and in most country areas-not all-their commercial affiliates also have seven megahertz. When we do turn off analog, a lot of spectrum will be freed up, and certainly the government and no doubt the people who wish to use the spectrum can be more expansive and creative. What we are doing now is putting a toe in the water of expanding digital television in two forms. One is in channel A, as the member for Oxley quite rightly said-a datacasting channel that includes datacasting, narrowcasting and probably community television. No-one is saying that that is the be-all and end-all of digital television-absolutely not. What we are saying is that it adds another dimension to digital television. It will, for example, have text and film, and the sorts of things that we will see will be another tool in the home’s total communications package that will allow people to get a better appreciation of the services that are available under this method. As things like broadband expand across Australia still other opportunities in the digital field will emerge. Talking about channel A and channel B, they hold great opportunities for specialisation and specialties for Australian audiences. They also allow smaller niche proprietors and media proprietors into the market. Aside from data services and general texting, there would be information like the Stock Exchange, weather information and government services. There will also be a narrowcasting section where you can look at programming on things like religion, rural matters, lifestyle and shopping. The only restriction there will be that it must not be look-alike television. I felt the member for Oxley was straying into that field by saying MAIN COMMITTEE this channel A should be allowed some form of de facto recognition so that it could get into that field. Once you do that you then muddy the waters. I think it will be a matter of the government taking the brakes off slowly and, in so doing, enhancing the services that are available on channel A. The two bills essentially extend the same licence fee obligations that the free-to-air commercial television stations have to whoever is the successful holder of the channel A licence. In other words, these licensees are required to pay an annual fee based on the gross revenue of each entity. The new entity will be no different. The government is amending the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and creating a framework for the payment and record-keeping obligations of people who are going to participate in this channel A regime. I would like to take the opportunity to expand on the potential I envisage channel A might hold. Australia is one of the most culturally diverse nations on earth. We are a multicultural and a multifaith country, with the majority of our population living outside the metropolitan centres. These facts would indicate that there is a broad scope for attracting audiences that have a particular interest in specialised subjects, whether that be religion; business, through financial reports, Stock Exchange reports et cetera; rural content, through market prices and all those sorts of things; and government facilitation services. Interestingly, in the trial that is going on in Sydney at present, the New South Wales government is trialling those government facilitation services as part of a potential channel A type experience. Although this matter has not been decided yet, I would favour seeing Channel 31, certainly in country areas, on this spectrum. I think that would allow the Channel 31 agenda to move outside the capital cities using this as the conduit. If you wanted to establish Channel 31s in most existing television markets it would be an extraordinarily expensive operation, probably beyond the capacity of most places, except perhaps Newcastle and Canberra. All the other areas I think would find it very difficult. I am one who would favour the use of community television through this medium, but, as I said, the matter has not been decided yet. I think it would really add to the scope and the reach of Channel 31. The other thing we need to recognise is that if, as is being proposed now, some of the free to airs under the ‘lose it or use it’ provisions are going to make football games available to Channel 31, it would be untenable to have football on Channel 31 in the metropolitan areas but not available to people in country areas so that you could watch two games. I for one cannot understand why we cannot watch two football games on a Saturday or Sunday on, say, two separate channels, whether you do that by expanding the scope of multichannelling or whether you do it this way, through a channel 31. Why can’t we see, for example, the game of the day in high definition on a major channel and then, on a subsidiary channel-be that a multicast channel or a channel 31, which in this instance would probably be a narrowcast channel-watch the game of state interest? If, for example, the Broncos are playing the Cowboys, it may not be the game of the day, but you can imagine that most Queenslanders would want to watch that. Or, if two Sydney clubs are playing and it is not the game of the day, you could imagine that a lot of Sydney people would still want to watch that game, be it NRL or AFL. I think that this is a good step forward. It is certainly new territory. There will need to be some experimentation, and I am sure that government will not be mean fisted in allowing whoever gets the licence to make a success of it. MAIN COMMITTEE There are some, too, that would like to see a competitive service to the ABC in rural areas, perhaps somewhat different from the major ABC channel-not necessarily a carbon copy of it-where you could have stock reports and interviews and things about rural matters, such as the use of chemicals, varieties of cropping, methods of harvesting, methods of marketing and all that sort of stuff. The ABC does an excellent job, and I do not diminish that for a minute, but this could be yet another service and it might allow industries in rural areas on a commercial basis to be able to support a narrowcast within a channel A format. So it is another step forward. I do not know what the member for Oxley meant about the ABC, but the genre restrictions on the ABC and SBS are about to be lifted, which will allow them a lot more scope both in their major ABC channel and in ABC2. So this is a good bill and another step forward in digital transmission, and I commend the bills to the House. Ms LEY (Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.33 am)-I thank the members for Oxley and Hinkler for their contributions on the Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees Bill 2006 and the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Collection of Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees) Bill 2006. I do, however, note that the member for Oxley made various disparaging comments during this debate about the government’s media reforms generally. This is the same rhetoric that we have been hearing from the opposition on these issues for some time now. It is very difficult to take them seriously when all we are hearing is opposition for opposition’s sake and no policies to offer in return. It is the government that has done the hard work to achieve media reform that will deliver benefits to consumers and allow Australia’s media industry to adapt to and make the full switch to digital and continue to deliver quality services to consumers into the future, including the new digital services that are the subject of this legislation. By contrast, the member for Hinkler outlined, I believe very well, the benefits and the flexibility, particularly the flexibility of the new digital age in a country that, as he said, is diverse both in rural and regional areas and in culture and ethnicity. I thank him for that. IfI can use my own electorate of Farrer as an example, digital multichannelling will, I hope, allow the citizens of Albury, which is in New South Wales, to receive a New South Wales news service. At the moment the only one that we are able to receive on television is a Victorian news service. If they had a vote, most people would actually prefer the Victorian service. I do not know why. Nevertheless, digital multichannelling will give the people who want to see a New South Wales news service an opportunity to do just that, so that is one single advantage for my own area. These bills are part of the implementation of the government’s media reform policies in relation to the allocation of datacasting transmitter licences for the two unallocated television channels. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2006, passed by parliament on 18 October 2006, provides for the allocation of one set of licences: channel A datacasting transmitter licences for fixed, in-home, free-to-air digital services and the other, channel B datacasting transmitter licences, for a potentially wider range of digital services. These bills will require the channel A licence holder to be subject to a revenue based annual licence fee in addition to the up-front payment resulting from a price based allocation system. The Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees Bill 2006 provides for the annual licence fee to be determined according to formulae based on the formula used to calculate commercial television broadcasting licence fees. MAIN COMMITTEE The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Collection of Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees) Bill 2006 amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to provide payment machinery and record-keeping obligations to support the administration of datacasting transmitter licence fees. This will ensure that channel A services are subject to licence fees consistent with the fees levied on commercial television broadcasting services and that the compliance obligations in relation to datacasting transmitter licence fees will be similar to those currently imposed on commercial television broadcasting licences under part 14A of the Broadcasting Services Act. Passage of these bills will enable the Australian Communications and Media Authority to set licence conditions for the channel A allocation process, which the government expects to be completed for both unassigned channels as soon as practicable in 2007. Once again, I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 October, on motion by Mr Billson: That this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. (AUDIT INSPECTION) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 October, on motion by Mr Pearce: That this bill be now read a second time. Commission Amendment (Audit Inspection) Bill 2006 is intended to improve the cooperation between ASIC and the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for the purpose of audit inspections. The bill will also create a legislative framework so that ASIC can enter into similar arrangements as that with the PCAOB with other non-Australian audit oversight bodies. Labor understands that ASIC, with written consent of the minister, may enter into an agreement or arrangement with a foreign audit regulator to assist the foreign regulator to ascertain whether Australian auditors have complied with audit requirements in that foreign country. We note that any such arrangement will have to be published in the government Gazette. To carry out the proposed arrangement with the PCAOB, ASIC’s audit inspection role and its information-gathering powers will be increased. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Broadcasting Services Amendment Collection Of Datacasting Transmitter Licence Fees Bill 2006
270,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.38 Am),"The Australian Securities and InvestmentsIn recent years, both the US and Australia have experienced a number of corporate collapses such as Enron and HIH in their respective jurisdictions, which have resulted in regulatory responses to both financial reporting and corporate governance. In the US the SarbanesOxley Act, as it was enacted in 2002, established the PCAOB to increase the regulation of company audits. This act was far more prescriptive than the more principles based response in Australia which was enacted through the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program 9. Labor members who participated in the parliamentary joint committee inquiry on CLERP 9 looked particularly at whether reforms to Australia’s financial and reporting regime would promote transparency and accountability, which were objectives stated in its explanatory memorandum. Labor has been a proponent of initiatives to improve transparency in the audit regime. There is a strong recognition from almost all stakeholders that transparency in reporting and decision making is vital. Domestic and foreign investors in Australian companies also need to know that our audit process is reliable when making investment decisions. Major accounting and audit bodies, whose reputations depend on the quality of their work, also benefit from a good audit regime. The requirements in the US are substantially the same as in Australia. For companies and auditor firms that are subject to both regulatory regimes, there is duplication and significant associated cost. This creates unnecessary economic inefficiencies. Where government can reduce either inefficiency or cost without eroding the principles of disclosure, it of course should. This bill presents such an opportunity. The opposition supports this bill as it will make the reporting obligations of our largest operations more efficient and will reduce the overall cost of compliance for Australian companies and their subsidiaries subject to dual regimes. In turn, this will facilitate access to US investment capital for Australian business. At present there are 24 Australian companies registered to raise capital in the US and 36 audit firms registered with the PCAOB to audit these companies. In practice, though, there are five large accounting firms which perform most of the work for these companies. These 24 companies are significant contributors to the Australian economy. The opposition welcomes the streamlining of reporting requirements for Australian companies operating in both US and Australian jurisdictions. The costs associated with the changes to the audit regime will be borne by ASIC and will be folded into its functions of monitoring and compliance; $6.3 million will be dedicated over three years in the 2005-06 budget. This measure is, after all, simply one part of a holistic approach to improving the quality of our audit regime and the ability of investors and other stakeholders to rely on the regime. Other reforms which were reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services include the introduction of the international reporting standards, auditor rotation, restricting the provision of non-audit services and declarations to indicate audit independence. The opposition notes that ASIC, the Australian Bankers Association, the Group of 100 and the Australian Shareholders Association have all indicated they broadly support the proposal for greater cooperation between the US and Australia’s audit regimes. In the US there is recognition that many companies which are subject to their audit inspection requirements are operators in global markets and so they develop the capacity within their system to enable the PCAOB to rely on non-US oversight systems. The PCAOB has already entered into similar arrangements with Canada and the UK so that joint audit inspecMAIN COMMITTEE tions can be conducted with local regulators, which streamlines the audit process. The which they engage. In its consideration of the CLERP 9 reforms, Labor strongly supported the key role of ASIC in improving Australia’s audit regime, as it is a statutory body which is independent of the audit profession. These arrangements were a major determinant for the The proposal which will allow mutual recognition between Australia and US audit regulators is a positive step and emphasises the credibility of our domestic regime. This is essential for Australian companies that are active participants in the global business market through cross-border holdings and other financial transactions. The mutual provision by the US for our audit system may also have the effect of encouraging a stronger relationship on other corporate governance issues. In addition to the main amendments discussed, there is also a technical amendment in schedule 2 of the bill. Labor understands that this amendment clarifies the period in which the immunity from criminal liability under section 1455(5) of the Corporations Act for contravention of the previous auditing standard applies. This change will mean that the current immunity applies to financial reports for the period ending on or before 29 June 2007 but not reports on or after 30 June 2007. This means that reporting periods starting after 1 July 2006 will be covered by the criminal provisions for breach of the auditing standards in line with the original intent. Clarification of this immunity will facilitate a smooth transition to the operation of this bill. In closing, the opposition believes that reliable auditing is fundamental for good corporate governance in this country and elsewhere. This bill is supported by the opposition as part of the ongoing initiatives to improve standards of financial reporting. government would like to thank the member for Hunter for his support of this bill and for his contribution to the debate today. The bill will provide a legislative framework to empower the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, or ASIC, to enter into cooperative audit agreements or arrangements with foreign regulatory bodies. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment (Audit Inspection) Bill 2006 will also enhance ASIC’s current audit inspection powers. The framework in the bill will enable ASIC to enter into an audit arrangement with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, to facilitate the two bodies conducting joint audit inspections of Australian auditors that are registered with PCAOB. There is a clear recognition by the parliament that with the globalisation of capital markets and the cross-border activities of companies and audit firms it is in the public interest to foster closer cooperation between Australian regulators and their overseas counterparts. While PCAOB is the only overseas regulator with whom ASIC at this stage proposes to enter into a cooperative arrangement, the framework within the bill will allow ASIC to enter into arrangements with other foreign regulators in the future with the consent of the minister. The proposed joint inspection processes between ASIC and PCAOB will provide significant cost savings for audit firms in that the firms will only have to accommodate one joint inspection rather than two separate inspections by ASIC and PCAOB. MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Australian Securities And Investments Commission Amendment
271,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (10.45 am)-TheASIC’s enhanced audit inspection powers will serve two purposes. They will facilitate the proposed joint audit inspection arrangement between ASIC and PCAOB. The enhanced inspection powers are also designed to reduce compliance costs and clarify uncertainty about the scope of ASIC’s existing powers to review audit firms which the financial reporting council identified in its 2004-05 audit independent report. The bill also contains an amendment to address a technical issue relating to a transitional provision applicable to auditing standards in the Corporations Act 2001. The life of the auditing standards made by professional bodies was extended by regulation to 29 June 2007. The technical amendment will extend the current immunity against criminal liability under subsection 1455(5) of the Corporations Act to cover all financial reports for periods ending on or before 29 June 2007 that are audited using auditing standards made by the professional bodies. As the drafting of those auditing standards is not as precise as it would be for an instrument intended to have the force of law, it is appropriate that criminal liability should not apply where an auditor fails to comply with the auditing standards. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Report of the Inquiry into Certain Australian Companies in Relation to the UN Oil-forFood Programme That the House take note of the following document: Report of the Inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN Oil-for-food Programme, November 2006. things: that this government was guilty of gross negligence on an important matter of national security; that this government subsequently engaged in a gross attempt at cover-up once its negligence became known; and, on top of that, this scandal resulted in a great cost to the Australian community and, in particular, to our hard working wheat farmers. The government’s defence in relation to this scandal is a defence which rests on, in turn, three propositions: we were ignorant, we were incompetent and we were negligent. They are the three elements of the government’s defence-a defence of ignorance, a defence of incompetence and a defence of negligence. The reason they chose that defence was that if you were to argue that the government knew what the AWB was doing then at that point, at the admission of that, they became complicit in one way or another in potential criminality on the part of AWB operations in relation to Saddam Hussein’s regime. So the government chose instead a defence resting on ignorance, incompetence and negligence. How does this defence stack up against the record which has emerged, the factual material which was presented during the course of the Cole inquiry-noting that the commissioner was not asked to make determinations in any respect in relation to the incompetence or negligence of ministers in discharging their obligations under Australian administrative law, most particularly in respect of the foreign minister and his obligations under the Customs RegulaMAIN COMMITTEE",191,Pcaob S Positive Consideration Of Australia S Audit Regime

273,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (10.49 Am),"This wheat for weapons scandal demonstrates threetions to give effect to Australia’s international obligations to enforce UN sanctions against Iraq? We have documented a total of 25 warnings prior to the Iraq war which this government received by one means or another. There were a further 10 warnings which the government received after the Iraq war and before this tawdry scandal, the largest corruption scandal in Australia’s history which saw $300 million filter through to the enemy, was finally brought to a halt. Warning No. 1 was in 1998. The Australian intelligence community held intelligence indicating that Alia Corporation, based in Jordan, was part owned by the Iraqi government and was involved in circumventing UN sanctions on behalf of the Iraqi government. This intelligence was distributed to DFAT, DOD and PM&C. Warning No. 2, in September 1999. Australia’s senior trade commissioner in Amman was advised by the Iraqi Ministry of Trade that AWB Ltd was an exception to the usual Iraqi practice of not buying exports from non-favoured nations. Warning No. 3, in November 1999. The Australian Embassy in Amman learned that AWB had been sending laboratory equipment to Iraq without UN approval. A series of internal DFAT emails revealed that DFAT believed that AWB’s actions were in breach of sanctions. One email says, ‘I believe this action to be in breach of UN sanctions.’ Another says: ‘AWB may have been doing this for some time but there is no benefit in launching a witch-hunt at this stage.’ Warning No. 4, in December 1999. Shell approached Austrade in Amman and expressed interest in taking any oil paid to the AWB for wheat at a premium. Shell were interested in an arrangement by which Shell would pay for AWB wheat shipments to Iraq. DFAT notes: ‘What is being considered here might breach UN sanctions.’ Warning No. 5, December 1999. On 21 December 1999 the Canadian permanent mission to the UN asked the UN Office of the Iraq Program about a proposed contract between the Iraqi Grain Board and the Canadian Wheat Board. Iraq was asking the Canadian Wheat Board to deposit $700,000 into a Jordanian bank account to cover transportation costs in Iraq. The Canadians told the UN, in December 1999, they understood that the Australian Wheat Board had already entered into this kind of arrangement. Warning No. 6, in the first quarter of 2000. For the first quarter of 2000 the Australian intelligence community had intelligence indicating that Alia received fees in Jordan for inland transport within Iraq of goods purchased under the oil for food program. It received these fees as an agent for the Iraqi government. The fees, less a small commission, were paid into accounts accessible by Iraq in violation of sanctions. The amounts involved were substantial. This intelligence was distributed to DFAT, the Department of Defence, the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and PM&C. Warning No. 7, in 13 January 2000. The UN raised concerns with the Australian permanent mission to the UN in New York. On 13 January the mission reported the meeting by cable, explaining that another country had alleged that AWB had entered into an arrangement with Iraq where it would pay $14 per metric tonne to a Jordanian bank account to a company owned by a son of Saddam Hussein. The UN asked if Australia would make some discrete high-level inquiries to ensure that the AWB was not in breach of sanctions. UN official Felicity Johnston said that she told our mission that the payments were for inland transportation. MAIN COMMITTEE DFAT Canberra responded saying, ‘We think it is unlikely that AWB would be involved in a breach of UN sanctions.’ The cable was sent without first contacting AWB. Warning No. 8, on 10 March 2000. On 10 March 2000, our UN mission reports that, ‘Until we are able to provide a formal reassurance of this there will remain a question mark over the matter from the point of view of both the Office of the Iraq Program and the third country in question.’ We now know that third country to be Canada. Warning No. 9, on 11 March 2000. Austrade’s representative in Washington reports that there are continuing concerns that the AWB had agreed to ‘irregular payment’ terms with the Iraqi Grains Board and that Austrade was ‘concerned that AWB do not understand the seriousness nor the urgency of the matter. It may be necessary to advise the minister of the situation’. This cable is copied to the Managing Director of Austrade and the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Warning No. 10, in March 2000. The Austrade representative in Washington met with AWB Chairman Trevor Flugge and AWB’s New York representative, Tim Snowball, to discuss the Canadian complaint. According to Snowball, Austrade indicated that there was ‘a big problem around the trucking fee and some exposure’. Warning No. 11, on 22 March 2000. On 22 March 2000, DFAT Canberra reports by cable that AWB will provide the UN with a copy of its standard terms and conditions with Iraq. The cable, which mentions allegations of irregularities by AWB, is copied to the Prime Minister and the ministers for foreign affairs, defence and trade. Warning No. 12, on 13 September 2000. On 15 September 2000, Mr Davidson Kelly from Tigris emails Charles Stott at the AWB saying: For your information, Tigris is an Aussie registered company and enjoys the support of our friends at DFAT who, as I told you, are interested in the outcome of discussions to recover the Obligation. It was good to see you, Mark Vaile and Bob Bowker in Melbourne yesterday. Mr Vaile has denied that he met Mr Davidson Kelly in Melbourne on 14 September 2000 as he was in Sydney. However, his spokesman later admitted that he was in Melbourne at a function for the launch of BHP’s sponsored report on trade and the Middle East on 13 September 2000 and may have met with Mr Davidson Kelly and Mr Stott. Warning No. 13, in October-November 2000. On 20 October 2000, AWB Chairman Trevor Flugge wrote to trade minister Mark Vaile regarding AWB’s recent visit to Baghdad. AWB then had discussions with DFAT about its proposal to engage Jordanian trucking companies and then wrote to DFAT on 30 October 2000 seeking DFAT’s approval for this arrangement. On2 November DFAT replies to AWB giving it the green light to proceed on this process, saying that it-that is, DFAT-‘can see no reason from an international legal perspective why you should not proceed. That is, this would not contravene the current sanctions regime on Iraq. International Legal Division has been consulted in the preparation of this response’. Warning No. 14, in November 2000. By November 2000 the Australian intelligence community held intelligence indicating that Iraq’s transport charges for humanitarian goods under the oil for food program had been substantially increased. Alia was one of the means by which fees were paid to Iraq. The Australian intelligence community also had information that such fees would probably have been used for procurement purposes outside Iraq. This inforMAIN COMMITTEE mation was forwarded to DFAT and Defence. Some of this information was sent to IGIS and PM&C. Warning No. 15, in March 2001. By March 2001 the Australian intelligence community held intelligence of endeavours by Iraq to breach sanctions by, amongst other methods, collecting commission on contracts for humanitarian goods imported into Iraq under the oil for food program. This included information that Iraq violated sanctions by charging a commission of at least 10 per cent on imported humanitarian goods under the oil for food program and that the 10 per cent was rigidly enforced. This information was sent to DFAT, Defence and IGIS. One report was forwarded to PM&C. Warning No. 16, on 7 March 2001. The New York Times carried a front-page article which outlined in accurate detail Saddam Hussein’s misuse of the oil for food program. The article reported Saddam’s use of bogus additional charges like inland transportation on commodity contracts, including wheat. It also reported concerns that Saddam was using the money earned through the scheme to buy weapons. The sources for the article included diplomats and United Nations officials. Warning No. 17, on 8 March 2001. The US Acting Permanent Representative, Ambassador Cunningham, told the UN Security Council: We have evidence that kickbacks have been requested. We don’t have any good evidence that they’ve been paid but one assumes this is happening. It has been going on for some time. We don’t have any means of assessing as I said yesterday, what the degree is, because obviously the companies that are doing this and violating the law are not going to come forward and admit they are doing it. Wasn’t he right? Warning No. 18, on 9 March 2001. The Australian Permanent Mission to the UN in New York sent a cable to Canberra which reported that, according to UN officials, Iraq had begun demanding kickbacks and illegal commissions on contracts for humanitarian supplies. During a debate in the Security Council the UK had called on Iraq to ‘stop manipulating the program and stop blackmailing companies by demanding surcharges’. Norway had said that ‘everybody knows about the kickbacks’. The cable was sent to the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the trade minister. In a supplementary statement to the Cole inquiry, Mr Downer said that the cable had been opened by his chief of staff and forwarded to his Adelaide office but that he could not recall reading it. According to this cable access log, 71 DFAT employees read this cable, some of them on multiple occasions. Warning No. 19, in April 2001. On 10 April, the Australian Permanent Mission to the UN in New York sent a cable to Canberra which refers to: ... anecdotal and in some cases hard evidence of Iraqi purchasers and agents demanding fees and commissions in association with the export of oil and the import of humanitarian supplies ... The cable goes on to say that the mission had been approached by Iraqi officials in UN corridors who had complained that the sanctions committee could ‘complicate the matter’. The UN mission noted in its cable: Iraq’s interest in keeping port fees outside the oil-for-food program appears self-evident from the Iraqi delegation to us ... MAIN COMMITTEE The cable was sent to offices of the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the trade minister, the agriculture minister and a range of government departments including ONA, DIO, the Attorney-General’s Department and the Treasury. Warning No. 20, in August 2001. Michael Wallbanks, from the British shipping giant P&O Nedlloyd, said that when his office was advised about the 10 per cent ‘after-sales tax’ levied by Iraq in 2001 he contacted the US and British navies, as well as the British embassy in Dubai. He said that the impost was common knowledge among anyone in the shipping industry who had dealings with Iraq. Warning No. 21, in September 2001. The Australian intelligence community held intelligence indicating that inland transport fees for humanitarian goods, including fees paid through Alia, were proposed to be increased substantially by Iraq. This increase was on top of the 10 per cent commission already paid and the fees were payable in advance of delivery. The proposed increase in transport fees was to apply to all humanitarian goods delivered under the oil for food program through the port of Umm Qasr. This information was distributed to DFAT, the Department of Defence and IGIS. Warning No. 22, in May 2002. The US General Accounting Office presented its report Weapons of Mass Destruction: UN Confronts Significant Challenges in Implementing Sanctions against Iraq to the Hon. Tom Harkin of the US Senate. The report sets out in detail Saddam’s misuse of the oil for food program, including the imposition of a 10 per cent levy on commodity contracts. Warning No. 23, in August 2002. It was reported that at this time the agriculture minister, Mr Truss, was warned by prominent Victorian grain merchant Mr Ray Brooks that AWB was paying bribes to Saddam Hussein’s regime, at an occasion at the Mallee machinery field day in north-west Victoria. But according to this report he was told by Mr Truss to ‘stop peddling stories like that around’. According to Mr Brooks, Mr Truss said: ‘Ray, don’t give me that bull. The Wheat Board is run by farmers of great integrity and honesty. They wouldn’t do that sort of thing.’ Warning No. 24, on 21 August 2002. The Weekly Times reported that the dispute between the AWB and the Iraqi Grains Board was resolved through payments for inland transport. The article said: An industry source said Iraqi negotiators extracted a $7 million saving out of AWB Ltd as part of the deal. The source said it involved the AWB subsidising transport of the grain from the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr to further inland and supplying grain testing equipment. Warning No. 25, in December 2002. By December 2002 the Australian intelligence community held intelligence that Iraq was enforcing the 10 per cent commission on imports under the oil for food program. One means by which it was to be continued to be paid was by payment into accounts in Jordan. This intelligence was distributed to the office of the foreign minister, the office of the Minister for Trade and the Prime Minister’s office, apart from the usual AIC and DFAT regulations. It was also distributed to the Australian Federal Police. These were the 25 warnings which the Australian government received prior to the Iraq war about what the AWB was up to in Iraq, yet this government’s defence was that it knew nothing. It was ignorant! It had no information at its disposal! It was therefore, on any reasonable man’s conclusion, incompetent and negligent. MAIN COMMITTEE We are left with this question, and it goes to the heart of public administration in this country: how is it that we spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on our intelligence community and a diplomatic network to receive information of this calibre and quality into Canberra and nobody-I repeat: nobody-across the entire system of government here was capable of drawing upon these 25 warnings to at least proceed with a robust investigation of what was going on? That is the outstanding question here. It is a failure of public administration, at worse, of which this government is grossly culpable and negligent. tion by Mr Terence Cole’s report on his inquiry into certain Australia companies in relation to the UN oil for food program. Let me quote that raving leftie the economics editor of the Financial Review Alan Mitchell, who said today: Howard’s vindication is primarily Terence Cole’s judgement that the government had no “actual knowledge” that AWB was hiding payments to the Iraqi regime by providing misleading information about its business arrangements. But that is just one part of the broader judgement that the public must make. “It is immaterial that the commonwealth may have had the means or ability to find out that the information was misleading, or that it ought reasonably to have known that the information was misleading,” Cole explains. Immaterial to Cole with his narrow terms of reference, but not immaterial to the public. I commend Mr Cole for his dedication in unearthing the truth about the corrupt conduct of AWB officials. He has done the Australian people a great service, but he could have done Australia an even greater service if he had been allowed to examine and report on every aspect of the AWB scandal. This scandal does not begin and end with the conduct of the AWB and its officials. The AWB did not act in a vacuum; the AWB is not just another private company. As the holder of a legal monopoly on the overseas sales of Australian wheat, the AWB was, in effect, an arm of the Australian government, even after it was privatised. The conduct of the AWB, which Mr Cole thoroughly investigated, was only half of the story. The other half of the story was the legal and political environment in which the AWB operated and that was the responsibility of this government. AWB officials bribed people in Iraq. There is a devastating indictment in Mr Mitchell’s column today of the number of times Mr Cole cites Australian intelligence advising DFAT officials, and that all of them end with DFAT officials saying that ‘they do not recall having read, recalled or sought access to this intelligence that was provided to them’-all the way through to 2005. In the Australian, I notice Mr Paul Kelly says that Cole judges that DFAT officials did not deliberately turn a blind eye to this bribing of the regime in Iraq. I contrast their insouciance with Colonel Mike Kelly, the deputy head of the Coalition Provisional Authority and a leading legal officer in the Australian Army, who after being just a few weeks in Iraq was able to work out what the AWB was up to-that is, that it had bribed the regime and was continuing to make these illegal payments. It is an amazing contrast. The Prime Minister makes much of the fact that he told Mr Cole that he could ask for the terms of reference to be extended if he wanted, but that is a red herring. What the Prime Minister said was that Mr Cole could make the request if he believed that ministers or officials were engaged in criminal conduct. Criminal conduct is a very high bar to set. I do not know whether ministers or officials have engaged in criminal conduct. Quite possibly they have not, MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Documents
274,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (11.04 Am),"Yesterday the government claimed vindicabut that is not the real question. The real question is whether ministers bear responsibility for the alleged criminal conduct of AWB officials named in Mr Cole’s report. The real issue was responsibility-political and administrative responsibility. The real questions were: first, did the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the foreign minister, through their omission or negligence, create a climate in which Wheat Board officials came to believe that their criminal conduct had the approval of the government; and second, did those ministers do enough, or in fact do anything, to discover what the Wheat Board was up to and take steps to prevent it once they were warned about it? Those are the real questions, but Mr Cole was not able to give us a direct answer because the Prime Minister deliberately wrote the terms of reference in such a way as to prevent him from doing so. The Prime Minister has once again been very clever, perhaps too clever for his own good. In order to cover up the negligence, incompetence and complacency of the foreign minister and Deputy Prime Minister, he has made himself an accomplice to their misdeeds. He stands politically convicted of this scandal, just as they do, because even though Mr Cole has been prevented from making a direct finding on the conduct of the ministers, his report has allowed the Australian people to draw their own conclusions and to make their own report on the government’s behaviour. Although Mr Cole was not allowed to make direct findings about the conduct of ministers, it is not hard to read between the lines of some of his comments. Of DFAT, for instance, he says: The critical fact that emerges is that DFATthe minister’s departmentdid very little in relation to the allegations or other information it received that either specifically related to AWB, or related generally to Iraq’s manipulation of the Programmethat is, the oil for food program. There are two issues here. The first is the level of ministerial oversight of what DFAT was or was not doing in relation to monitoring AWB’s behaviour. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the then Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister, were jointly responsible for that. Despite the fact that they received more than 30 warnings, as outlined by the member for Griffith, that Saddam Hussein was corrupting this program and specifically that he was demanding bribes from wheat exporters, we are expected to believe that they never saw any of these warnings, that no-one in their staff did and that it never occurred to them to ask or to find out whether the AWB, which after all was one of the largest wheat-marketing companies in the world, was in some way involved. It is hard to tell whether these two ministers have been knaves or fools, but perhaps we will find out when, as threatened, Mr Flugge calls the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a defence witness if he is charged with a criminal offence. In a criminal trial, under the scrutiny no doubt of the best QC money can buy, the minister will not be able to do his Arthur Daley impersonation, ducking and diving, as the government’s automatic majority allows him to do in the House. But that is not all. In this case there was a particular agenda at work with relation to the AWB. For decades the old Australian Wheat Board acted in effect as the marketing arm of the Country Party. Even after it was privatised it was stuffed with National Party mates with backgrounds in the wheat industry: ‘The National Party on tour’, as the opposition leader MAIN COMMITTEE called it yesterday. The prize exhibit here is Mr Flugge, who in 1987 stood for the National Party for the seat of O’Connor. The member for O’Connor is thus something of an expert on Mr Flugge. Let me quote him yesterday: The dogs have been barking about corruption for years. A number of people-who were not Liberalswere constantly out in the market place saying it was the way you did business in the Middle East. If our side of politics is guilty of anything, it’s of trusting a mob of agri-politicians-all of which have close connections to the National Party. I do not often agree with the honourable member for O’Connor, but here he clearly knows what he is talking about. The key to this scandal is the long-established cosy relationship between National Party ministers and the leadership of the wheat industry who have been protected ever since World WarI by the so-called single desk, a monopoly arrangement that like all monopolies is a breeding ground for corruption. I refer Liberal members opposite to every conservative economist from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman, who talk about the evils of monopoly, if they do not believe me. The spectacle of a Thatcherite government propping up a corrupt marketing monopoly is truly amazing. What has happened to economic rationalism? The AWB scandal will damage Australia’s economic interests for years to come, particularly now that protectionist inclined Democrats are back in control of the US congress. I expect a devastating problem for Australia from Senator Harkin, who now controls the new Democrat dominated agriculture committee in the US Senate. As the Australian argued yesterday: For a small country such as Australia with a heavy reliance on commodity exports, the benefits of honest world trade are self-evident. If Australia’s pleas are now met with increased scepticism on Capitol Hill, it will be because AWB was happy to pay bribes to Saddam and the Government did nothing to stop it. The belief that bribery and corruption are acceptable ways of doing business, at least in the Middle East, is not confined to the National Party, however. This belief has been given a veneer of respectability by statements of certain academics and former diplomats, the people who form a too influential Arabist lobby within the Australian academic and diplomatic network. One of these is Dr Andrew Vincent, Director of the Centre for Middle East and North African Studies at Macquarie University, who on ABC radio in February opposed even having cent said: ... the bottom line is that in some parts of the world international trade is done with kickbacks, with considerations, with bribes, with whatever you want to call them. And if you don’t pay those kinds of considerations you won’t have a market. Then we have Mr Bruce Haigh, the former Australian ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who wrote on his website-and he has been constantly writing in the Financial Review-that the Cole commission: ... has given trade competitors a blunt instrument with which to hit Australia over the head as well as injuring the AWB, which in the past secured wheat deals of $4 billion annually. With views like this prevalent amongst Australian diplomats and in universities where Australian diplomats and DFAT officials learn about the Middle East, it is no wonder the current MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Documents

276,"Minister For Trade, Mr Truss","perhaps not the brightest bulb in the government’s chandelier-thinks that the AWB payments to the Saddam Hussein regime were no worse than some sort of commission payment that you make to a real estate agent when you buy a house. It is no wonder that Commissioner Cole singled out a leading Middle East DFAT official, Bob Bowker, referring to his failure to investigate intelligence relating to general rorts of the oil for food program. It will be very illuminating, as the member for Griffith recounted, if the interesting things to say about the meeting that took place at the Point Restaurant in Albert Park between himself, the trade minister and Mr Bowker. I am sure the government does not want what went on at that meeting, in my electorate, to come out at that trial. I think honourable members recognise that I know something about the Middle East, even if they do not always agree with me about it. One of the things that has angered me most about this whole affair is the complete indifference that seems to have been displayed by the AWB, by DFAT and by this government about the political context of AWB’s behaviour in relation to Iraq and particularly about the ultimate use to which Saddam Hussein put the $224 million he got from the AWB. Saddam in the 1990s was a desperate man. Having lost both the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War, his regime was on the ropes, cut off by UN sanctions from oil revenues and arms imports. This was the precise juncture at which the AWB came to his rescue. As one of the leading participants in the rorting of the UN oil for food program, the AWB’s $224 million was one factor-and, in my opinion, a major factor-that allowed Saddam to recoup some of his losses and re-equip his forces. Saddam may not have had nuclear weapons, but the French and Russians will sell you a lot of conventional military hardware for $224 million. It was that reequipping that emboldened Saddam to defy the UN over inspections of his suspected weapons stocks and programs, and of course it was Saddam’s defiance that led to the US led invasion in 2003 and to the current imbroglio in Iraq. Saddam also had a program of making payments to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers, paid out of the same Rafidain Bank in Jordan into which the AWB made its payments to the bogus trucking company Alia, which was in fact controlled, owned and operated by the Ba’athist regime then in control of Iraq. I cannot prove that AWB money went to the families of the suicide bombers who have killed hundreds of innocent people since 2000, but neither can anyone prove that it did not. It was in the same bank, and it was probably transferred from one account to the other. This is where the geniuses, the 12 evil men from the AWB, had their worse effect-not that they would care. The AWB has a lot to answer for, and so do those ministers whose incompetence and complacency let the AWB get away with its corrupt actions for so long. The Financial Review has an editorial on Mr Howard’s double standards in today’s paper. It begins by quoting that immortal television series Yes, Minister: ‘Decent chaps don’t check up on decent chaps to see that they’re behaving like decent chaps.’ That Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer have managed, in their defence of the government’s conduct in the AWB oil-for-food scandal, to make this quotation from Yes Minister seem relevant in 2006 is a tribute to their creative powers of spin. I conclude by saying that this is a saga that is not over yet. The government think they have got off. They think, with this five-volume, narrowly focused report, that charges against these people will be delayed beyond the next election.

An aggrieved Mr Flugge is yet to sing but, when he does at his prospective trial, I am sure a lot more will come out on the incompetence and involvement of this government in this incredible scandal where an Australian monopoly benefited one of the most evil regimes in the world and stole the public money of the people of Iraq, put in a UN account. This was all done, as the member for Griffith has repeatedly pointed out, despite 35 warnings to this government. It is a record of shame which this government think they will survive because of the narrow terms of reference of this report. However, it is a record of shame that they will not survive because, in the long term, the Australian people will make a judgement about this. As I pointed out, this is not over yet. The criminal trials of these people will see much more evidence adduced. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (11.19 am)-The findings of the Inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN Oil-For-Food Programme, chaired by the Hon. Terence Cole and otherwise known as the Cole inquiry, were finally tabled in parliament this week. This report has been much anticipated, certainly by this side of the House, and has certainly been the subject of intense media and public interest and speculation. The Cole inquiry’s mandate was to investigate allegations first made in the Volcker report that the Australian Wheat Board had knowingly breached United Nations sanctions against Iraq under the United Nations oil for food program by paying financial kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s regime over the course of five years. The report now confirms that allegations of deliberate violations of the UN oil for food program are true and that the AWB is guilty of the most serious forms of corruption. As such, Australia now stands out as the biggest single contributor to kickbacks paid to Saddam’s regime. This is a reputation that has damaged our country’s reputation and standing in the eyes of the international community. In 1995 the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 986, which established Iraq’s oil for food program. Under the provisions set out in the oil for food program Iraq was allowed to trade its oil for basic humanitarian goods, such as food, in order, as we all know, to alleviate the widespread suffering that years of UN sanctions against Iraq had created for the country’s civilian population. We all remember the many images of children dying in hospitals because there was no money for medication-children dying in poverty. The people of Iraq have suffered horrendously over a long period of time and, unfortunately, continue to suffer. From 1996 onwards, AWB began selling Australian wheat to the Iraqi Grains Board under the oil for food program. As the Cole report notes, by 1999 approximately 10 per cent of Australia’s annual wheat exports were being sold to Iraq-obviously this is significant for the Australian wheat industry. In June 1999 the Iraqi Grains Board introduced a new condition of tender in its contracts with the AWB, which required, as we have now learned, AWB to pay an additional fee of some $US12 for every metric tonne of Australian wheat delivered to Iraq. This additional fee was described as a ‘discharge and land transport fee’, although AWB was never under any obligation to arrange for the discharge and transport of Australian wheat exported to Iraq. In essence, this fee was the kickback that AWB was expected to pay to the Iraqi government if it wanted to continue exporting wheat to Iraq. We now know that executives of AWB were well aware that this additional fee was paid as a kickback to Saddam’s regime and that it therefore breached UN resolution 661, which prohibited any funds being made available to the government of Iraq. In short, AWB entered into MAIN COMMITTEE a series of short-term and long-term contracts with the Iraqi Grains Board in late 1999, the terms and conditions of which included this new $US12 discharge and transport fee. It drew the necessary funds for that additional fee from a United Nations escrow fund by concealing their true purpose and it then paid these funds to the government of Iraq via the Jordanian company Alia, which received these kickbacks on behalf of the Iraqi state company for water transport. Throughout all of this the AWB made no arrangements for either the discharge or transport of Australian wheat in Iraq once it arrived in the port of Umm Qasr. Over the course of 2,000-plus pages, the Cole inquiry report goes into extensive detail over AWB’s duplicity in breaching UN sanctions against Saddam Hussein’s regime. However, as detailed as it is, the report handed down by the Cole inquiry provides us with only half the picture. The fault lies not with the inquiry itself but with the inquiry’s limited terms of reference, which purposely restricted the scope and reach of the inquiry and its investigations. It is important to note that the Cole inquiry’s terms of reference were set by the Prime Minister and, as such, it was the Prime Minister himself who exercised full control of the parameters of this investigation. The terms of reference were conveniently limited to investigating criminal breaches of the law only. What the Cole inquiry was not empowered to do was to investigate either government negligence or ministerial responsibility regarding the AWB scandal. Over the course of five years, AWB signed 41 contracts with Iraq that contained kickback payments to Saddam Hussein’s regime in breach of UN sanctions and each one was approved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer. Let me make this clear: the foreign minister of Australia approved the 41 contracts AWB made with Iraq that stand at the very heart of this scandal. What is more, it was the foreign minister who was also charged with the ministerial responsibility to ensure that no Australian company breached the UN sanctions against Iraq pursuant to the Customs prohibited exports regulations. Let me reiterate the point that the responsibility for ensuring that no Australian company breach UN sanctions against Iraq fell squarely on the shoulders of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. At the same time, it was the same minister who approved AWB’s kickback contract with Iraq. To all of us-except, it seems, the members of the government-the circumstances surrounding the AWB scandal signal a clear breach of ministerial responsibility on the part of Mr Downer and are a resounding example of sheer incompetence and negligence on the part of his department. The foreign minister’s response, however, to allegations that he failed in his ministerial duties under both Australian and international law has been nothing short of absurd. In a nutshell, the minister’s only line of defence has been a pathetic attempt to portray himself as an innocent victim of deceit on the part of the AWB and its executives. His excuses continue to both insult the intelligence of the men and women of Australia and show complete contempt for the notion of ministerial responsibility, which I might say remains seminal to our Westminster system of government and Australia’s democratic rule of law. I do not need to remind the government that it is currently pursuing the option of introducing a formal citizenship test into Australian law that will require new migrants to pledge their respect for democracy and the rule of law in Australia, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs lists as one of the defining values of Australians. What hypocrisy it therefore is when this government asks new migrants to reMAIN COMMITTEE spect Australian democracy when members of its own senior cabinet are unwilling to do the same but instead continue to show complete contempt when it comes to upholding the integrity of Australia’s democratic institutions and the foundations of transparency and accountability that they are built on. The foreign minister would resoundingly fail the very citizenship test being proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Notwithstanding the Cole inquiry’s limited terms of reference, we still, however, get glimpses of DFAT’s gross negligence throughout the report. In volume 4 of the report we read: The critical fact that emerges is that DFAT did very little in relation to the allegations or other information it received that either specifically related to AWB, or related generally to Iraq’s manipulation of the Programme. The truth is that, at different times over the five years that AWB was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s regime, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the then Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister between them received some 35 warnings that raised serious concerns over the conduct of AWB. The truth is that neither the Prime Minister nor the foreign minister nor the then Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister made the slightest attempt to act on these warnings or to investigate the allegations being made about AWB and Iraq’s manipulation of the oil for food program. What we have here is nothing less than an example of gross negligence right across three government departments and an unflagging case of a clear breach of ministerial responsibility on the part of the foreign minister, who took absolutely no action to investigate allegations of impropriety on the part of AWB-yet he was charged with ensuring that no Australian company breached the UN sanctions against Iraq. We also know that two officials from the government’s own trade body, Austrade, met with the 51 per cent owners of Alia, the al-Khawam family, and we know that just before the outbreak of the Iraq war AusAID took over an AWB wheat contract that included some 50,000 tonnes of wheat shipped to Iraq on board the Pearl of Fujairah. The Minister for Trade at the time, Mr Vaile, had a hand in convincing AusAID to take over the AWB wheat contract. The government’s protestations of innocence in the face of AWB’s web of deceit is not the only excuse we have heard. We have also heard the excuse that the foreign minister does not read his memos, which begs the question of just exactly what the foreign minister does. Then, how can we forget the chorus of: ‘I don’t know; I can’t recall; I can’t remember’-that chorus that we heard from the trade minister when he was called to give testimony before the Cole commission. What all this spells is a web of negligence, incompetence and deceit on the part of the government that easily matches AWB’s own web of deception. What we have before us is a scandal that the Howard government is doing its very best to sweep under the carpet, but it is a scandal that will not go away. The AWB’s wheat for weapons scandal has done enormous damage to Australia’s international reputation. It is one more example of the enormous damage that the Howard government has done to Australia’s international reputation over its 10 years in office. The Howard government’s appalling treatment of refugees, whom it used as a political football, singled out Australia as a looming international pariah on human rights. The Howard government’s refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol has isolated Australia on the international stage when it MAIN COMMITTEE comes to climate change and the environment. The Prime Minister’s support for the war in Iraq-an illegal war based on deceit and one for which the people of Iraq continue to pay the highest price-has singled out Australia as an aggressor nation with scant regard for the international norms and laws pertaining to war. And now we have the AWB scandal, one which has damaged Australia’s international trade reputation and undermines the broad perception of Australia as a country free of corruption. The AWB scandal completely undermines Australia’s moral authority and credibility when it comes to our country’s role in helping our Pacific neighbours with the vexed issues of corruption in our region and corruption in their own levels of government. It has cost Australian wheat farmers somewhere in the vicinity of $500 million in lost contracts so far, and for AWB shareholders it has seen the price of AWB shares cut in half. The government’s continued attempt to duck and weave its way out of acknowledging its own negligence and its own share of responsibility for the AWB scandal has only deepened the cynicism ordinary Australians feel about those who are elected to represent them in this place. The government now claims that the report handed down by the Cole inquiry somehow exonerates it from any responsibility for the wheat for weapons scandal, but it does nothing of the sort. Rather, the Cole inquiry shields the government from any criticism, and the Australian public, I am absolutely certain, will see through this shield. The question of what the government knew about the AWB scandal remains unanswered. We on this side of the House will continue to pursue the Howard government for honest answers rather than glib PR and spin, and I can assure you that we look forward to Mr Flugge’s testimony because I am certain, as my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports indicated before me, that Mr Flugge’s testimony will open up a whole new world into the practices, attitudes and perceptions of the Howard government. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (11.32 am)-I rise this morning to speak on the motion to take note of the report of the Cole inquiry into the UN oil for food scandal, which has occurred as a result of the current government’s negligence. I would first like to quote from the censure motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, which basically outlines Labor’s concerns about this issue: That this House censure the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for: (1) its negligence in failing to act on the 35 warnings it received over a five year period thereby allowing this $300 million wheat for weapons scandal to occur; (2) for its attempted cover-up of this scandal through its attempts to shut down a US Senate inquiry into AWB in 2004; its reluctance to cooperate with the Volcker Inquiry; and its failure to provide the Cole Inquiry with powers to determine whether or not Ministers did their job in enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq; (3) for the cost that has been borne by Australia’s hard working wheat farmers because of this Government’s negligence-farmers who have now seen half a billion dollars of their Iraqi wheat market lost; (4) for allowing $300 million to be funnelled from AWB to Saddam Hussein’s regime which the Iraqi dictator used to buy guns, bombs and bullets for later use against Australian and coalition troops; and MAIN COMMITTEE (5) for the damage inflicted on Australia’s international reputation because this Government’s negligence turned Australia into the world’s single biggest violator of UN sanctions against Iraq. This is a scandal of enormous proportion and has led to the current government seriously damaging Australia’s reputation internationally. It is fair to say that much has been said and will be said about this shameful period of Australian history-a period which I fear will be looked back on in years and decades to come with shock and disbelief. Due to the complexity of this issue I would like to briefly summarise the events. In 1990, following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq. This meant that no funds were to be provided to the government of Iraq or to persons within Iraq. It also prevented nations from trading with Iraq, except for the provision of medical or humanitarian supplies. To prevent civilians from suffering hardship or starvation, the UN Security Council established the oil for food program, which allowed Iraq to sell oil under UN approved contracts. The proceeds from these sales were to go into a UN controlled account, and Iraq was permitted to buy humanitarian goods and foodstuffs. Through this program Iraq began to buy significant quantities of wheat from the Australian Wheat Board, the AWB, in 1996. By 1999 AWB was selling to Iraq about 10 per cent of Australia’s annual wheat exports. The problem is that the AWB began paying kickbacks or additional moneys directly to a third party, which was providing funds to the Iraq government-that is, to the Saddam Hussein regime. This was illegal, and the AWB knew it. The AWB continued paying these fees and hiding these payments from about 1999. So under this government $300 million was funnelled from AWB to Saddam Hussein, who used those funds to buy those guns and those bombs and those bullets which were later used against Australian and coalition troops. This is also being done, I might add, through a period of time when there was the debate in this country as to whether or not we should enter what was the so-called coalition of the willing and go into combat in Iraq. It disturbs me very deeply to think that while we were having that debate in this country, a very divided debate where there were very strong opinions against our entry into this war, and while the government was making its decision-I believe much earlier than it announced-to go to Iraq, this very action is occurring. As has been said in many debates in the parliamentand now, thankfully, many commentators in this country are also talking about this whole event in very open ways-while this was all happening warnings were being given around the world. At the UN, all over the place, people were talking about the potential problem we had on our hands with the AWB paying this money to a trucking company that owned no trucks. The whole thing is so ridiculous, just so out of reality, that if it was not so serious it could be the plot for a Monty Python movie. Yet it seems to me, to the commentators and to everybody who looks at this-even to Cole to some extent-that there were warnings abounding around the place. The deeply disturbing thing for me is that no-one in the government-the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, their departments, their officers-seemed to think that it was an important enough thing to do something about. This is extraordinary. At the same time that this is all happening, at the same time that $300 million is flowing into that ghastly regime, I as a member of this parliament, sitting in the parliament as a very proud member of this parliament, copped abuse being hurled at me constantly from the other side of the parliament. Whenever we got up and said, ‘We disagree with our engagement in MAIN COMMITTEE the war in Iraq,’ I and my colleagues on this side of parliament were all accused of being fans of Saddam Hussein. I remember those interjections very well. I remember every one of them. I took offence at them then and I take extraordinary offence at them now-now that we know what was going on while members of this government were hurling that sort of abuse across the chamber. Whenever we got up and said, ‘We disagree with the engagement in Iraq,’ at the same time $300 million was flowing through to that very regime-and I was being accused, because of my objection, of being a ‘fan’ of Saddam Hussein; that we did not want to see him removed. The immorality of this is gobsmacking-that is the only word I can apply to it. It disturbs me greatly. Now what we have got is a government holding up this five-volume defence-and I am not in any way accusing Commissioner Cole of anything here-that they made certain they would get by the terms of reference presented to Commissioner Cole, as their means of escaping their responsibility. As far as Westminster systems go, as far as honesty in government goes, as far as the responsibility of individual ministers goes, I despair as to where we now sit in this country in terms of responsible government-a government with morals and a morality we should be proud of, that we used to be proud of. This country had an amazingly fantastic international reputation once; I am not sure about it now. It is all thanks to the people ruling this country at the moment who seem to think they can just do what they want. The government is really quick to say that it knew nothing about the kickbacks. That is very hard to believe. In fact, I think it is impossible to believe. But if you do believe it then you can only conclude that the government is extremely incompetent. The government received 35 warnings about these kickbacks and it chose to ignore all of them-35 warnings. I cannot believe that people in this government knew nothing of this occurrence. The Cole inquiry report is 2,065 pages long-as I said, it is five volumes. The government says it did not do anything wrong and the Cole inquiry supports that, according to the terms of reference it had. But clearly that means that the government did not in fact do anything right. It was warned 35 times that the AWB was paying kickbacks, but it did nothing. It did not look into the matter at all. I do not think it is possible for any government to be more arrogant, incompetent or lazy in relation to such an important matter. Our Australian troops, for whom we hold extraordinary pride, are over there representing us as best they can with the training they have had. We wish them well, every single one of them. Simon Crean, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, had the strength to stand up and say, when he was farewelling those troops with our Prime Minister in that first dispatch of troops to Iraq: ‘We wish every single one of you well. We truly, though, don’t believe you should be going’-and we still believe that. It has saddened me even more this week when I heard, following the tabling of the report in the parliament, that there were a few celebratory little parties emerging around the corridors of this parliament. I could give the benefit of the doubt and imagine that it may be because we are heading into the Christmas period, but it is a little hard for me to convince myself that there was not a little bit of relief partying going on as well-‘Thank goodness we have got out of the Cole question; we’ve got that behind us. That is a thing we can move off our agenda.’ I find that pretty sad. I know that a number of constituents in my electorate find this whole thing really quite deplorable and they have told me that. The Australian people deserve nothing more than for the MAIN COMMITTEE Prime Minister of this country to come clean on exactly what has really been going on here. I talk about people having the knowledge. We have heard previous speakers refer to the fact that maybe there was an attitude around. Some people have supposedly reported conversations they have overheard where a suggestion might have been given that the AWB could have been doing something incorrectly and the response was: ‘Oh no, hang on, the AWB are a pretty responsible mob, they are a pretty good bunch of blokes, they wouldn’t do that.’ The whole philosophy of this government begs many questions, and the question for me is: if it is good enough for this government to make a decision that the AWB are good blokes, that they would never do anything wrong, why, at the same time, do we have people on welfare or with disability who have to prove that they are innocent to this government when they attempt to receive assistance payments? There is definitely an imbalance here. If this government thinks you are a pretty good bloke, a decent sort of fellow, you can do anything. But if you happen to be a welfare recipient in this country then you have a whole different set of tests to go through-and that philosophy and morality of the government we have running this country at the moment worries me. I feel incredibly strongly that I need to put on record my total and absolutely heartfelt objection to this whole dirty episode. It is not good enough to hold up five volumes of a book as a firewall between you, the government, and the people. What is good enough is honesty and morality. But I am afraid it may be some time-in fact, it will be until there is a change of government-before we see any of those decencies come back into the Australian democratic system. this particular report and associate myself with the member for Canberra and other members on this side who have raised serious concerns about the way in which the government has chosen to respond to what is of course a very serious assault upon the Australian Wheat Board, its actions and behaviour. Indeed, that is clearly outlined in five volumes of reports by Commissioner Cole. What we do know, however, is that since the report has been tabled the government have chosen to pretend that somehow they have no role to play and have had no role to play in regulating the way in which AWB operates and have sought to suggest that they should be accused of no wrongdoing because there has been no wrongdoing on the part of the government or a particular minister. The Labor Party fundamentally disagrees with that proposition. There is no doubt in the mind of, firstly, Commissioner Cole-who is of course limited by the terms of reference but who even with respect to those terms of reference concluded-that there was gross misconduct on behalf of people representing the Australian Wheat Board. Indeed, there was a failure-a fundamental, systemic failure of government-to consider the complaints that were being made by all sorts of people and parties with respect to the behaviour of the AWB. There is no doubt that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade at the time failed to have regard to the multitude of complaints that were made over a long period of time about the unlawful behaviour of the AWB. I guess it should not surprise us on this side and indeed this nation. If a government is willing to engage in an unlawful war, why should I be surprised that it does not concern itself about the unlawful behaviour of the Australian Wheat Board? The fact is that this government chose, through its own negligence, to fund two sides of an unlawful war. I think it should MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Documents
278,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (11.44 Am),"I rise to contribute to the debate ontherefore be condemned by the parliament and condemned by this nation that the government would allow the AWB to continue its actions in a manner that has brought this country into disrepute. Labor warned the government that it was not in the interests of this nation or indeed in the interests of the world that we follow the Bush administration into Iraq. We said it was not going to assist Iraqis; it was not going to assist the citizens-the men, women and children-of Iraq; it was not going to in any way do anything other than place our troops in harm’s way. It was not an assault upon terrorism. In fact, it was going to increase the likelihood of terrorism both in that region and at home. I think those things have been shown to be true. As the supporters of the war start to drift away and start to join those that were originally in opposition to the war, we have to therefore take note, and soberly take note, of the conclusions of the Cole report. In that report, Commissioner Cole clearly points out the list of complaints that were made, which makes a mockery of the answers of the government that they could not and did not know that there were serious bribes going on to fund the Saddam regime. I know my colleague the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, did attempt in his contribution to articulate the multitude of warnings, but because there were so many he was only able to reach 25 warnings that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was notified of. I would like to continue where the shadow foreign affairs minister left off by adding a further 10 warnings that were made to the government or should have been known by the government. On 19 May 2003, the foreign minister met with senior BHP Billiton figures in London to discuss BHP’s bid for the Halfayah oilfield in Iraq. BHP told Mr Downer that BHP executives had been working on oil for food projects in order to maintain relationships with Iraq and: ... in September 2000 BHP transferred rights in Halfayah to a Joint Venture led by Tigris Petroleum, headed by BHP executives who were responsible maintaining relationships with Iraq by working on oil for food related projects until a normal political situation could be established in Iraq. BHP said they and Tigris had already briefed the PMO, DFAT, Defence and AFFA about their interests in the Halfayah oilfield. On3 June of the same year, US Wheat Associates wrote to the US Secretary Of State, Colin Powell, about concerns that some of the money paid under AWB contracts ‘may have gone into accounts of Saddam Hussein’s family’. On6 June 2003, the then Minister for Trade rejected the US allegations out of hand, describing them as ludicrous and insulting, and instructed the embassy in Washington to convey his views to Secretary Powell. On 10 June of the same year, an Australian representative on the CPA, Michael Long, received a memorandum of instruction from the CPA. This memorandum asked ministry advisers to, among other things: Identify which contracts have a kickback or surcharge. We need to know what percentage kickback or “after sales service fee” was involved under the “Extra Fees” category. Your ministry is likely aware of this charge so please work with them to identify and indicate on the matrix. Long forwarded the memorandum of instruction to DFAT, who forwarded it to the AWB on 13 June. MAIN COMMITTEE On 23 June 2003, the Australian representation in Baghdad sent a cable to Canberra outlining the new Coalition Provisional Authority’s reprioritisation of contracts in the immediate postwar period. It stated: Every contract since phase 9 included a kickback to the regime from between 10 and nineteen per cent. The CPA was advising ministries to tell companies with contracts that the “after sales service fee”, which was usually to be deposited in offshore banks, would be remitted to them. This cable listed for action Dr Calvert, DFAT, Mr Smith, secretary of Defence, and General Cosgrove, Chief of Defence Force. For information it listed the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence, ASIO, DIO and ONA. On the warning between June 2003 and January 2004, the AIC held intelligence that the former Saddam regime had four suppliers and that the OFFP was to pay Iraq the 10 per cent commission. These reports were distributed to DFAT, the Department of Defence, the Treasury and the department of industry. In an interview with SBS’s Dateline on 8 February 2006, Senator Bill Heffernan said that AWB had been coming into his office for the past 2½ years and that: I kept saying to them we hear that you blokes are on the take as it were or giving kickbacks. On 12 September 2003, the US Department of Defense published a report into the misuse of oil for food which found that AWB’s contract was potentially overpriced to the tune of $US14.8 million. In October 2003, Treasury officials working on secondment to the Iraqi ministry of finance as part of the Coalition Provisional Authority forwarded to Canberra a report that found that Saddam’s regime required that 10 per cent of the face value of contracts they submitted under the oil for food program be paid directly to the regime. In the same month in 2003, on 22 October, US Senator Tom Daschle, the Democrat senator from South Dakota, wrote to US President Bush asking him to investigate claims that Australian wheat was sold to Iraq at inflated prices and that money was then given secretly to Saddam Hussein’s family to maintain trade. He urged Bush to discuss the matter with the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, during his visit to Australia. The Australian Embassy in Washington wrote to Senator Daschle describing the allegations he raised in his letter to the President as reprehensible. In the same month in the same year, on 23 October, the embassy in Washington sent a cable reporting a discussion with Senator Daschle’s staff about the Democrat letter to President Bush. A contact told the embassy that they had been advised by State that: ... its scrutiny of OFF contracts revealed that 10% had been added to the price of every OFF contract. There are another 10 warnings that were provided to departments of this government, indeed to the minister’s office, that were ignored by this government. It is a sad indictment that the government has not even had the good grace to accept that it has fundamentally failed the Australian people, it has fundamentally failed to regulate AWB’s behaviour. There has been no acceptance of ministerial responsibility, whether it be by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or by the Minister for Trade. I think the fact that the government has failed to do so shows that this is an out-of-touch government, a government that thinks it can get away with anything, that holds the Australian people in such contempt that it does not believe people must be accountable for their actions or, in this case, their inactions. MAIN COMMITTEE It seems to me that everybody knew that the AWB were providing kickbacks to the Saddam regime except Minister Downer and Minister Vaile, if we are to believe the government. That clearly could not be the case. That clearly is not true, and we argue therefore that these ministers must go. They must resign. They must follow the principles of ministerial accountability. This government has to take some responsibility for the failures of the AWB, the crimes that have been committed in the name of this country, otherwise we will be condemned around the world for deliberately turning a blind eye to this corrupt practice-which, in the end, aided and abetted an enemy of this country, a dictator who ultimately was being funded and therefore armed to potentially kill and maim our Australian defence forces. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Waranga Channel to Lake Eppalock Pipeline through the National Water Commission, Coliban Water’s application for funding under the water grants program to construct a pipeline connecting the Waranga channel to Lake Eppalock near Bendigo. Funding this project would represent a wise and strategic investment in water infrastructure, improvement in water management as well as good practice in the stewardship of Australia’s scarce water resources. This undertaking, along with a suite of initiatives outlined in Coliban Water’s 2005 water plan, will provide an underground water project that will improve Australia’s efficiency and environmental outcomes in line with the objectives and intent of the National Water Initiative fund. The Coliban Water Authority has also had a plan under consideration for the past few months to access groundwater from the vast aquifers located under the Castlemaine, Kyneton and Elmore districts. A study of the DNRE map of Victorian underground water areas indicates a vast mass containing huge volumes of good-quality water. My office is currently undertaking research into obtaining an accurate indication of just how much water is available from these underground sources. As I said, the preliminary studies show potentially huge quantities of water may be available. As I said, Coliban Water has been investigating the feasibility of accessing groundwater to secure the water supply for the Castlemaine and Kyneton districts as well as investigating using groundwater from the Elmore district to supplement Bendigo’s water needs. This presents an opportunity to consider going a step further and providing the infrastructure to enable groundwater from these sources to be pumped directly into the entire Coliban water system, which, I believe, in conjunction with the Waranga to Eppalock pipeline, would virtually drought proof the centre of the Victorian region completely for decades. Service water from the normal catchment areas of the Coliban and Goulburn-Murray systems by the Eppalock pipeline will secure our water requirements, but only if we get appropriate inflows into these catchment areas in the future. If the drought conditions worsen, utilising the available groundwater would become essential. We need to immediately consider providing the infrastructure to access this source of water.

280,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.57 Am),"I rise to urge the federal government to support,Once the infrastructure is in place we can then use available groundwater, if and when required. This would provide adequate insurance to ensure the region has access to the quantities of fresh water so essential for our well-being and survival. When the drought conditions pass, the region’s catchment returns to somewhere near normal and we get a surplus of surface water, we should have the capacity to put water back into these groundwater reserves for future use. In other words we would be establishing a water bank, accessing the groundwater from these aquifers in severe drought conditions and then replacing it with our surface water when the conditions return to normal. This is not rocket science, but it should drought proof the region for our future generations. After all, isn’t that our obligation and responsibility? The Waranga channel to Lake Eppalock pipeline proposal meets a number of the eligibility criteria outlined in the Water Smart Australia funding guidelines. The project would be the major component of a strategy to address an imminent water crisis that has major implications for regional Victoria. It would therefore produce a substantial water resource management outcome in rural, regional and urban areas. It would have a high degree of certainty in delivering outcomes that are repeatable, lead to sustained changes in water management practice and produce significant environmental, economic and social benefits. It would be more appropriate to name the Waranga to Eppalock pipeline ‘Bendigo’s lifeline’. That is how critical this project is. While regional Victoria’s water catchment areas continue to decline as a result of the prolonged drought, this pipeline may well be the lifeblood of the city of Bendigo. Bendigo is the fastest-growing region in central Victoria, with an annual growth rate of 1.8 per cent. Townships along the Melbourne to Bendigo corridor, including Kyneton and Castlemaine, have also experienced substantial growth in recent years, and significant future growth is planned and anticipated. The drought conditions over the past few years, along with increased demand due to growth, has placed the water supply system under extreme stress. Despite some of the harshest water restrictions in Australia, our water reserves are currently far below normal capacity. Lake Eppalock, which provides 80 per cent of Bendigo’s water supply, is currently at around three per cent of capacity. A prolonged water shortage will have a major and adverse impact on the growth of the regional economy. Several well-established business and community leaders have in recent months publicly expressed concern that the lack of additional water and capacity is already adversely impacting on decisions to establish or grow businesses and business enterprises and attract the necessary skilled and professional staff vital to Bendigo fulfilling its role as a major regional centre-including in areas such as health, education, aged care and banking. An adequate water supply is also critical for the region’s significant agriculture and viticulture industries. The proposed Waranga to Eppalock pipeline project will enable water sharing between the Junee water catchments and provide for greater flexibility and interconnectivity within the Coliban water catchment area. In meeting these objectives of the Water Smart Australia program, the project would provide significant economic and environmental benefits, including providing the potential to access water for additional flows, with benefits for the capacity and ultimately(Time expired) Ryan Electorate: Education vast policy areas as health and roads and infrastructure, but they also include education.

281,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (12.02 Pm),"The important issues in Ryan electorate cover suchvery pleased to speak in the parliament today and to advise all the mums, dads and students in the Ryan electorate who have a very strong interest in the quality of their education system and in the funding of their schools that the Ryan electorate has received over $1.8 million worth of funding for the 16 schools in Ryan that have been eligible for funding under the federal government’s Investing in Our Schools program. I am very delighted to commend all the wonderful initiatives the parents and friends groups of the schools in Ryan have come up with, because they certainly have come up with some wonderful projects where this money can go to improve facilities, to provide additional equipment to the students at the various schools and simply to make the experience of learning in the schools of the Ryan electorate all that much more significant and beneficial. Under the Investing in Our Schools program, the federal government is providing over $1 billion worth of funding over the 2005-08 years to fund both government and nongovernment schools in the area of capital projects that have been specifically identified and prioritised by the local school communities themselves. So these projects are not projects coming from the top of bureaucracy; they are coming from the very heart and soul of the school-the parents themselves quite often, I have been told from the schools that I have visited, with great consultation and great discussions coming from the school body, the students themselves. Of this $1 billion, $700 million has gone to government schools and $300 million has gone to non-government schools. Of course, this is on top of the Howard government’s $1.7 billion that has already been allocated for school capital works in that same time frame of 2005-08. I am sure that the Ryan constituents very keen on following government policy and on following school programs and school initiatives would be very interested to know-in particular, the schools and parents themselves would be interested to know-that there were over 8,300 applications received in the two rounds of 2005. There has been an enormous amount of interest and enthusiasm for this very commendable education policy program that has been formulated by the Howard government. I want to mention quickly the schools in my electorate that I am very proud to represent here: Hilder Road State School in the Gap; Ironside State School in St Lucia; Chapel Hill State School; Indooroopilly State School; Indooroopilly State High School; Jamboree Heights State School and Jindalee State School, both in the ‘centenary’ suburbs of the Ryan electorate; Kenmore State High School; Moggill State School; Payne Road State School, also in the Gap; Pullenvale State School, a wonderful school in a beautiful part of the Ryan electorate; and the Rainworth State School, where I had the great opportunity to meet students. The Rainworth State School was given $45,000 out of a project cost of $50,000 to cover musical instruments and resources. They are a talented group of young people who, with the extra funding for musical instruments, certainly exhibited their great talent in welcoming me with their performance. Both the Gap State High School and the Gap State School also received funding to the tune of $78,000 and $124,000 respectively for the completion of shade structures and library music facilities. The Upper Brookfield State School received funds as well. AgainI thank in the parliament all the parents for the hard work that has been put into this program. Of course, writing up the application grants is no mean feat and they deserve my full support and they will continue to get that. As the sitting federal member for RyanI look forward to representing the parents of Ryan in the year ahead. MAIN COMMITTEE Children with Special Needs Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (12.07 pm)-It is hard for parents who have a child with special needs or a disability to find child care for that child and it is indeed a difficult thing for carers to take on a child with special needs. It amazes me that this government is making it harder for parents to find care for children with special needs and harder for carers who take on a child with special needs. On1 July 2006 the inclusion support subsidy was introduced, replacing the special needs subsidy scheme and the disabled supplementary services payment. Draft guidelines have been drawn up by the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and full implementation will occur by January 2007. What this new inclusion support subsidy means is that family day carers will only receive subsidies to look after a child with a disability if they give up another childcare place. That means if they are able to have five children in their care and they decide to have a child with special needs and receive a subsidy for that child, they will only be able to care for four children. What that means, in effect, is a drop in income for a large number of family day care providers who take on a child with special needs. It is phenomenally difficult now to find child care for a child with special needs. To ask family day carers to take a drop in their already small income to care for such children means that it will be even more difficult to find family day carers able and willing to take such children. That means that parents of children with special needs will find it harder still to find child care for their children. Under the old system, if a carer looked after a child with a disability they received a subsidy to help with the extra training and resources they needed to look after that child effectively, but they were not automatically required to reduce the number of children in their care. Where a carer made an assessment that they did need to reduce the number of children in their care because of the seriousness of the disability or the needs of the child, they received a subsidy to compensate for the loss of income of having to give up another place in their care. This means that family day carers, who provide care for over 3,000 children with additional needs and who care for 40 per cent of all children with disabilities who use formal child care, will under the new system actually have to, in many cases, give up income to continue to look after children already in their care who have special needs, or to take other children with special needs into their care. Labor does not believe that family day carers or any child carer who is doing the very difficult and demanding work of child care, and in addition to that taking on a child with special needs, for whom it is difficult to find child care in the first instance, should expect to lose income when they make this decision. It is simply not fair. I have been contacted by a number of family day carers who described their situations, including Nancey from Clearview in South Australia. She talks about a number of children in her care, including one boy who has a difficult family situation, is often suspended from school and has few friends. Nancey writes: ‘He is not easy to care for and will lose his week because she has a recognised developmental delay. She is in the care of a woman who has three children in her care as well as her own child. She will not receive the subsidy unless she drops one of those children from her care. Which child should she ask to leave her care? MAIN COMMITTEE Julie, a nurse, can deal with children with tracheotomies. She has learnt Auslan to deal with the deaf children in her care. For four years she studied Auslan so that she can care for children more effectively. She will lose $750 a fortnight in income because of this change. She has made it her specialty to care for children with extreme extra needs and she is expected to take a $750 a fortnight pay cut because she wants to care for children with disabilities. It is unjust and it is unfair-it is unfair for kids, for parents and for carers. Fisher Electorate: Unity College wonderful new cooperative ecumenical school, Unity College at Caloundra, which was opened recently by His Grace the Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, John Bathersby, and the moderator of the Uniting Church. It is a joint Catholic-Uniting Church school. The buildings are owned by the Catholic system but there is a cooperative arrangement with the Uniting Church, and I think this is a very positive initiative. The Australian government has given close to $4 million towards the establishment of Unity College, which was used for capital works. The money comes from the Australian government’s capital grants program for schools. The funds will go towards the construction of 16 general learning centres, learning support areas, two computer laboratories, pupil amenities, pedestrian travel, a physical education covered area and music, science, home economics and art rooms. The project also includes conversion works to provide an administration area and library as well as external services, site works and new furniture. The funding forms part of a $6.5 million project to further develop the school. I went to Unity College and I met Rudi Goosem, the principal, and I have to say that I am particularly pleased with the approach that Mr Goosem brings to Unity College and the vision he has for the future. I would like to commend the Roman Catholic and Uniting Church communities at Caloundra for working together in this cooperative way to make sure that a wonderful new school that will provide for both primary and secondary education is established within the electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast. I often think the Australian government does not get adequate recognition for the money that it spends on schools and schoolchildren. We must always remember, of course, that Australia’s schoolchildren are the future of this nation, and the funding to Unity College confirms the government’s continued commitment to a strong and effective school system, maximising the opportunities for young Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you would be well aware that the Australian government will provide an estimated $33 billion in direct funding to schools and school students over the period 2005 to 2008. A key element of this funding package is some $2.7 billion for school capital works and infrastructure projects over the next four years. Just for the record, I would like to point out that Unity College commenced operation in January this year with 135 students. It is part of an increasingly regular form of setting up a school insofar as it is a prep to year 12 school. As I said, it is owned and operated by Brisbane Catholic Education in partnership with the Uniting Church parish of Caloundra. The enrolment has grown to 161 students, with 30 staff, catering to preschool to year 4 and year 8. Each year, as time goes on, new classes will come on line and Unity College will meet a very real need for additional education in one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. The Sunshine MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Adjournment
282,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (12.12 Pm),"I am pleased to rise in the chamber today to applaud aCoast, we anticipate, will approximately double in population over the next 10 to 15 years. One of the challenges we have as a community is to ensure that infrastructure keeps up with our rapidly growing population. The fact that the Australian government have given $4 million for new buildings at Unity College is an indication that the government are determined to assist Sunshine Coast school children, as indeed we do with respect to schools in other parts of the state and Australia. I also should record that the Australian government contributed $41,920 under the Investing in Our Schools program to cover the entire cost for the installation of a shed for the storage of playground maintenance equipment and the purchase of a ride-on mower, whippersnipper and other maintenance equipment. This is a wonderful program which picks up needs in school communities, in particular with government schools which state governments have failed to adequately fund. The Australian government’s Investing in Our Schools program is enormously popular with both government and non-government schools, because we have been able to carry out essential maintenance and improvements which are required and would not otherwise be able to be afforded by the school community. I commend Unity College and wish it every success in the future. Battle of Fromelles Fromelles, which I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you are well aware of. It is a battle which took place over 16 hours in the evening of 19 July 1916 on the Western Front and which saw Australia’s worse ever battle casualties: 2,000 dead and 5,500 casualties in total. This year was the 90th anniversary of this battle. I had the honour of attending the 89th anniversary of the battle last year at Fromelles and met with a number of the locals who still commemorate that battle and the activities of the Australian forces at that time. They treat it with a good deal of respect, and it was certainly a great honour to be there, particularly to catch up with Martial Delebarre, who I am sure the Deputy Speaker met when he was over there. He works for the War Graves in that area and has played a great role there. That has been acknowledged with the award of an Order of Australia for the work that he has done with respect to commemorating the activities of the Australians on the Western Front. The matter which particularly concerns me, apart from the continued grieving of the families of those lost, is the fate of 170 young men whose bodies were never found and whom we know were buried by the German army in days and nights following the battle. These men were killed within the German lines which they captured temporarily that night or behind those lines prior to the successful German counterattack. Their names are known as they were recorded by the Germans and this information was passed on to the Red Cross at the time. The mystery has always been: where were they buried? The dedicated detective work by Mr Lambis Englezos of Melbourne, among others equally persistent, led to the belief that many of these young Australians were buried just beside the village of Fromelles in northern France, in a farmer’s field beside Pheasant Wood, along with some of their British comrades, 326 of whom were also buried by the German army at the same time. It should be noted that there were possibly other burial sites too-the sap trenches dug that night by the Australians and possibly another site nearby known as Manlaque Farm. Since the thesis on Pheasant Wood was proposed to the government the response has been typically reticent and on occasions combative, the single theme being denial. The governMAIN COMMITTEE",214,Dsups Payment Her Own Daughter Who Is Five Years Old Also Uses Family Day Care Once A
283,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (12.17 Pm),"I wish to make a few brief comments on the Battle ofment’s reluctance to act appears to be predicated on three arguments: firstly, that there were no mass graves at Pheasant Wood; secondly, that even if it did occur, it is highly unlikely that such large burials would not have been discovered and bodies disinterred; and thirdly, in any case, the French would not like us fossicking around looking for bodies. It is now clear from recent documents provided through the German embassy, namely German regimental records of what they did on the days following the battle, that mass graves were in fact dug beside Pheasant Wood. The details of the process are remarkable, including the identification processes, the order of burial and the detail of the German units and their commanders who undertook the task. This is an amazing revelation and in itself requires the government to now get active and finally investigate this information properly. The government’s assertion that it is unlikely that recoveries were not undertaken after the war is also conjecture. The fact remains that no evidence of any such record has been foundand those records are renowned for their scrupulous detail. As for the government of France, it is impossible to imagine that with some simple diplomacy the French would not do everything possible to assist an immediate investigation of the site at Pheasant Wood. This is especially true given the close ties we enjoy with France when it comes to our common and shared history on the Western Front. We on this side have never sought to politicise this matter, but it seems that the attitude of denial from some parts of the bureaucracy and the delay over the last two years have been completely unwarranted. The expert panel appointed to consider the evidence, for example, has not met for 18 months, though we understand it will now meet on 15 December. I would also mention that a House of Lords committee looking into this same matter is to meet on 12 December, so it may well be that the British take the initiative before us. On behalf of all those families who still wonder where their relatives and loved ones are buried, we urge the minister to get cracking, contact the French government immediately and investigate Pheasant Wood as a top priority. I do not know what will be found, but there is now more than enough evidence to act on this. The Battle of Fromelles is extremely important to our military history and heritage. This government should act now to protect this heritage and to reveal the final fate of those brave young men who sacrificed so much for their country, rather than offering the same old tired excuses that nothing can or should be done. When I visited there last year, I actually walked that area with Martial Delebarre where it is alleged those burials took place. I oversaw parts of the battlefield. I certainly urge members, if they are travelling in that part of France, to go down and have a look. There are some quite impressive memorials. It is one of those battlefields that we do not hear as much about. More should be known. There is an excellent little museum there with some quite amazing stuff that does not get shown publicly as much as it should because of issues of funding, but it is certainly a place that I would encourage all Australians to visit to see a very important part of what was our history in World War I. Kurnell Peninsula Desalination Plant government is trying to sneak its shelved desalination plant back onto its agenda. New South Wales planning minister, Frank Sartor, announced two weeks ago that he approved the development application for the plant to be built on the Kurnell Peninsula. This belies Mr Sartor’s MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Dsups Payment Her Own Daughter Who Is Five Years Old Also Uses Family Day Care Once A
284,Mr Baird (Cook) (12.22 Pm),"Recent events have shown that the New South Walesprevious cancellation of the program. Mr Sartor now says that the plant is not necessarily going to be built. If the state government is not necessarily going to build the desalination plant, as they say, why would they be approving a development application for it to be built? Why would they have spent $100 million? In addition, they have now built a pilot plant on the site to road-test the technology, yet they are not necessarily going to build the plant! This smacks of policy by stealth. The Kurnell Peninsula is of major historical and environmental significance to the people of the Sutherland shire, Sydney and indeed around Australia. It is of course the birthplace of modern Australia. It was the landing place of Captain Cook in 1770 and of Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet 18 years later-all now being taught in Australian schools as a result of our fine policies. It is also the site of the first encounter between Indigenous and European peoples and cultures and the site of first resistance by the traditional owners and the original inhabitants of New South Wales. Kurnell is also of great environmental worth and recognised in international accords-it is protected in part by the Ramsar treaty as well as the Japan-Australia migratory birds and the China-Australia migratory birds agreements. It is a disgrace that the state government is so intent on putting this plant on such a historically and environmentally important site. They seem to have no regard for the history or the unique ecosystems of the area. Neither do they seem to care about the local residents of Kurnell. The plant will create even more traffic and noise problems for local residents. You would think that they had suffered enough with the sand mining and the factories continuing to be built around them. The proposed desalination plant would have a very negative impact on the environment, particularly on local marine life. The plant will pump 750 million litres of hot concentrated brine into Botany Bay every day. Let us not forget that Cape Solander at Botany Bay is considered to be the whale super highway. Only last year 1,608 migrating humpback whales were recorded passing through this area in the 68 days of the whale migration. This is a record since whale counting began 10 years ago and 200 up from last year. What kind of effect will 750 million litres per day of brine have on these whales? What about the thousands of people from the Sutherland shire and from around Sydney who have flocked to various viewing sites along the coast to watch these whales as they move past Botany Bay? The plant would also be a heavy air polluter, depending on CO2 emissions to produce their desalinated water. Sydney Water is of course committed to reducing greenhouse emissions from the plant by 50 per cent but exactly how they intend to do so has remained unannounced. Just how much air pollution is yet to be determined. The New South Wales government has not even undertaken an accurate environmental impact assessment because it does not need to because of the nature of the project. Details like the size of the plant, the final distribution routes and detail design are not yet available. Until distribution routes are released, how are we even supposed to know exactly how different communities around Sydney will be affected? On top of all this, the plant is a total waste of money. The state government wants to spend $2 billion on a plant that would service the water needs of just 350,000 people and would promote the single use of water rather than education, recycling and re-use. The state government has already spent $120 million to complete the planning and infrastructure for the proposed plant and a further undisclosed amount for the land. It is a significant amount of MAIN COMMITTEE money that could have been used far more effectively providing incentives for water tanks or for any number of recycling projects. Desalination technology is also massively energy intensive. Just running the plant would represent two per cent of Sydney’s daily power consumption. This is by the state government’s own estimates. At a time when we are concerned about global warming, this is a move in the opposite direction. The Iemma government seems content to continue with its policies of environmental vandalism for the Sutherland shire. I question whether the state government has fully explored all the water recycling options available. The government seems to dismiss the question of recycling without proper consideration. Has the government looked at the use of grey water or water from creeks and canals? Has it considered incentives for homes? Has it considered water tanks or recycling from stormwater channels? There are many other options that would be less expensive, less energy intensive and a better environmental solution than desalination technology. The state government should put the brakes on this proposal immediately. It is environmentally unfriendly, inefficient and unpopular. Prospect Electorate: Australian Technical Colleges Training came to Western Sydney to make an announcement. He announced the new Western Sydney Australian technical college. If ever there was a last-minute announcement cobbled together for spin, this was it. Of course, it is not the first time the minister has announced a new ATC for Western Sydney. He has done this before. He announced a joint venture with the Catholic Education Office for an ATC to be based in Blacktown. To much fanfare and with the support of the member for Greenway, he announced a great new Australian technical college at Blacktown. The problem is that it did not happen. Because of this government’s incompetence, the negotiations with the Catholic Education Office have broken down and the ATC is not happening. What we have seen is the situation where an Australian technical college, which was to have 320 students next year under the Catholic Education Office proposal, will now have 25. This is this government’s contribution to the skills crisis in western Sydney: 25 students. This government will say, ‘Well, you know, the state governments underfund TAFE and we’re making the biggest contribution we can.’ It is worth having a look at just what the state government does do in Western Sydney when it comes to apprenticeships. I was quite surprised when I checked with the South Western Sydney Institute of TAFE to see that there were 75,000 students enrolled last year in the various TAFE colleges in south-western Sydney. That is 75,000 compared to the 25 that this government is going to put through next year. In the Western Sydney Institute of TAFE, I think there are 85,000. As for apprenticeships, there are 7,700 in south-western Sydney and 3,400 in Western Sydney. The government announced this new college to great fanfare. Interestingly, they made the announcement at Blacktown in the seat of Greenway. I thought: they have made the announcement at Blacktown; that must be where the college will be located. In fact, it will not. It will be at Rouse Hill-a long way from Blacktown-at the Rouse Hill Anglican College. I congratulate the college. They have obviously worked hard and put together a proposal. It is great for them and I have no problem with them, and I am sure the 25 places at that college will be useful for the people of Rouse Hill. But I question their allocation, not only on behalf MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Dsups Payment Her Own Daughter Who Is Five Years Old Also Uses Family Day Care Once A
285,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (12.27 Pm),"Last week the Minister for Vocational Education andof the people of Blacktown but on behalf of the people of Fairfield, the people of Wetherill Park and the people of Campbelltown and Liverpool. I must say I was surprised. The member for Macarthur and the parliamentary secretary issued a press release after this announcement and said: ‘This announcement shows that Chris Bowen and Roger Price have been talking nonsense and this is great news for south-western Sydney.’ Rouse Hill is 50 kilometres from Campbelltown. That is how far somebody from Pat Farmer’s electorate needs to travel to get to this new Australian technical college. The first announcement was made last year and, when the Australian technical college bill went through parliament this year, the member for Lindsay said: They have chosen the Blacktown area to establish their campus. It is a fairly central location. I figure that you could have at least two or three other technical colleges in Western Sydney. The trouble, of course, is that it is not at Blacktown; it is now at Rouse Hill, further out of reach for the many thousands of young people in Western Sydney trying to get apprenticeships. This government talks about the skills crisis, but its contribution has been spin and fluff. When the minister made the original announcement, he said: The only thing standing in the way of the community benefiting fully from this initiative is the New South Wales Government. In fact, the only thing standing in the way was his incompetence in not being able to deliver a college in Western Sydney as promised. I want to say this: the Catholic Education Office did a lot of work on this proposal and won the bid. Not only did they do a lot of work and invest a lot of staff hours but they invested a lot of money. I do not think they have been treated well by this government. I think their proposal was a good one and I think the people of Western Sydney will be very disappointedand I note the Blacktown Advocate expressed great disappointment during the week. I and this side of the House have said before: the best thing that we could do for the skills crisis is to invest more money through TAFE. (Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Government Programs that have happened in the Gilmore electorate. I notice the member for Cunningham sitting opposite and I know she will not be very pleased about the MRI licence that has come to the Shoalhaven. Ms Bird interjectingabout 30 people a day, and I would say almost 20 of those would come from Wollongong; therefore your numbers will probably be reduced because of the MRI licence being available for the Shoalhaven. I cannot begin to tell you the joy that it has brought to a lot of people in the area, particularly now that they do not have to travel to Wollongong. As you know, the trains are very slow, even when they leave on time, so that is one of the benefits we have had from the MRI licence. We have also had a number of water grants being delivered to our area in Gilmore. In particular, the schools, the golf courses and some of the nursing homes have benefited greatly from the water grants, thereby eliminating the waste of thousands and thousands of litres of water in the electorate of Gilmore, so I am very pleased to see that happen.

287,Mrs Gash,"Thank you. Nonetheless, thanks to the MRI licence we now are taking onWe have received almost $2.3 million in the electorate of Gilmore through the Investing in Our Schools package. Most of our schools have now participated; there are only a few left to go. I am very pleased to see that happen. Again, I cannot begin to tell you how pleased the schools, the parents and the P&Cs in particular, who put these submissions together, have been about this. Also, we have a pilot program running in conjunction with the seat of Cowper to relocate our unemployed to areas with employment opportunities, particularly in Western Australia. I know that in the electorate of Cowper the first group left about six weeks ago, and I am really happy to announce that as of next week at least 20 of our local people from the Shoalhaven area in the Gilmore electorate will be relocating with the government’s blessing to Western Australia. At the moment they are being trained in Coffs Harbour, and again it is a project that is being very well received by the community in the electorate of Gilmore. It is a project that I certainly encourage any other member of the House to apply for if they have very high unemployment in their electorates. I also want to say that our medical school at the Shoalhaven campus of the Wollongong university will be opening its doors in January 2007. That is, again, an initiative of this government. Some $10 million has gone into this project in conjunction with the Wollongong university. It is a first for our area. Mature age people can train to become doctors so that we in the country areas will have doctors of quality who can stay and practise in the areas where they trained. Again, it is a very good initiative and I am very much looking forward to opening those doors in the near future, in January. The small equipment grants for the electorate of Gilmore, some $73,000, have been handed out. That is a very worthwhile project. For smaller community groups, the Australian government has now recognised the work that volunteers do. It is extremely important that we do recognise our volunteers from areas that you would least expect, be they from Meals on Wheels, Rotary clubs, Lions clubs or other community groups that participate by supplying volunteers. I do not think the nation realises how much we do rely on volunteers. Normally it is not something that the Australian government have been able to recognise. It is work that they have done and, again, I am very pleased to see this happen. Overall, the electorate of Gilmore has been very blessed with grants from the Australian government. I cannot begin to say how important they have been and how much and how well they have been received in our community. Veterans’ Affairs day regarding some other issues with respect to the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio, particularly with respect to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs annual report, which revealed some worrying and disturbing statistics about the time taken to process veterans’ claims, particularly those relating to injury claims. For example, the time taken to process a primary compensation claim under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act is reported as 106 days while the target is 75 days-a 40 per cent increase over target time. The mean time taken to process primary injury claims under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act has ballooned from 122 days in 2004-05 to 181 days in 2005-06-a 48 per cent increase since 2004-05. The mean time taken to process primary injury claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act has blown out from 90 MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Dsups Payment Her Own Daughter Who Is Five Years Old Also Uses Family Day Care Once A
288,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (12.36 Pm),"by leave-I would like to make a few comments todays to 146 days-up some 62 per cent since 2004-05. The time taken to process new impairment claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act has dramatically ballooned from 26 days to 130 days-up some 400 per cent since 2004-05, admittedly on small numbers, but it is nonetheless a worrying trend. These issues were raised with the department at Senate estimates the other week. The fact is (a) they were confirmed and (b) what became clear from the answers from the head of the department is that we have actually seen a cutback in resources being dedicated to these parts of the department. That is clearly having an impact on the services provided to veterans and the time taken to consider their claims. Resourcing provided in this area is part of an overall government policy, which, as I understand it, relates to a formula. The number of claims globally are dropping down, and that leads to a cut in the resources made available to DVA to be able to do their jobs. The problem with that is that, if you cut those resources and the result is a situation where you increase massively the time taken for processing of claims, you actually, I think, undermine the fairness and equity of the system. Many of the people involved in these claims are in a very damaged state. They are frail and they need our support and assistance. We have already had a range of claims and concerns raised about the way that government handles claims processing in terms of investigations. There have been allegations about the use of companies that effectively act as private investigators to address claims and consider the details of claims made by veterans. There have been legitimate concerns raised about aspects of that which need to be properly investigated. Certainly what we can say is this: the sorts of figures that are coming out of the annual report of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs regarding the time taken to process veterans’ claims are absolutely unacceptable. This has a real impact on the well-being, frankly, of many of the veterans involved because when it takes longer for those things to be considered we can have no doubt that the concerns and the anxiety brought to bear for people who often have been through some quite terrible circumstances will be quite serious. Therefore, the department and the government have to address this issue. Having blow-outs of as much as 40 per cent in the target times, or 62 per cent over the last couple of years-blow-outs of time from 90 days to 146 or from 26 days to 130-is just not acceptable. Veterans and those who are covered by DVA have given much to our country. They have served in circumstances that have often been quite horrific. They have dealt with tough jobs. They have done it with courage; they have done it with professionalism. When they are down and out, as many of the people that DVA deal with are, we have to do better. We cannot allow a situation where claims such as these take as long as it is now taking for them to be considered. The government has to get on top of this. If there is a situation where resourcing has been cut back as a result of some bureaucratic formula for the provision of resourcing in the department, that formula has to be reconsidered. We have to have a situation where enough resources go in to ensuring that these claims are dealt with in a reasonable period of time. There is absolutely no doubt about that. (Time expired) Water Heritage) (12.42 pm)-I rise today to highlight the work of water groups, schools and other organisations in saving water within the electorate of Flinders. In particular, I want to do this MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Dsups Payment Her Own Daughter Who Is Five Years Old Also Uses Family Day Care Once A
289,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andthrough examining the steps taken under the recently announced community water grants. All up, 13 projects were significant recipients of community water grants within the electorate of Flinders in the list announced only this week, and nine of those projects are in primary and secondary schools. It will lead to a total saving of nine million litres of water per annum, which is our area doing its part to save water for Victoria and for Australia as a whole, and it comes about through a total federal contribution of just over $800,000. So, firstly, the principle here is very clear: that it is individual schools, bowling clubs and community groups all working together to do their bit during a period of drought in Victoria to save water. Secondly, they are doing this in a way which is going to help educate and lead to savings in the home by individuals who are involved with this because they are more conscious and aware of the water savings. Thirdly, they are doing this with the assistance of the Commonwealth. All of that is an extremely important base for these savings. I want to identify the particular groups and recognise the work they are doing. As I mentioned, there are nine schools that have been successful. Penbank Primary School in Moorooduc will be saving 204,000 litres a year through harvesting rainwater and applying that to their bathrooms. The Woodleigh School in Baxter will be saving 177,000 litres a year by installing constant flow control valves, timed bubblers, dual flush toilets and waterless urinals. Somerville Primary School will be saving 433,000 litres a year through a combination of upgrading and installing dual flush toilets and flow devices and also collecting and harvesting water. A similar practice at Red Hill Consolidated Primary will save 150,000 litres a year. The Somers School Camp will save 2,100,000 litres per year, and I think that that is extremely important. House.

Western Port Secondary ColEx-Gratia Payments (Question No. 3568) Mr Danby asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 24 May 2006: (1) When will the Government determine its policy on ex-gratia payments to the F111 maintenance workers from the No. 482 Maintenance, and Nos1 and 6 Squadrons so that the personnel can be compensated for the injuries and illnesses they have incurred as a result of working on the F111 Deseal/Reseal Program and when will payments be made. (2) Will all personnel from the No. 482 Maintenance, and Nos1 and 6 Squadrons receive ex-gratia payments or compensation from any other source for their injuries and illnesses. (3) Does the Government intend to include personnel who were not directly engaged on the F111 Deseal/Reseal Program but who have worked in the F111 Deseal/Reseal Program work area in the eligibility criteria for ex-gratia payments if they develop related injuries and illnesses at a later date. (4) In determining the sums of the ex-gratia payments, does the Government intend to take into consideration (a) the legal expenses claimants have incurred in pursuing their claims, (b) the value of the superannuation a claimant is entitled to receive, and (c) the expected future cost of (i) ongoing medical care and (ii) modifications to vehicles and residences to accommodate disabilities. (5) Does the Government intend to offer ongoing payments based on each claimant’s salary; if so, what arrangements will apply to the reversion of these payments to a spouse/partner and dependent children on the death of the claimant. (6) Does the Government intend to offer the servicemen of No. 482 Maintenance, and Nos1 and 6 Squadrons a choice between a lump sum and ongoing payments. (7) Does the Government intend to include a confidentiality clause in the settlements for each claimant; if so, will it continue to apply if the government of the day does not honour the terms of agreement signed off by the Minister. (8) Were funds allocated in the 2006-2007 budget for compensation to the members of No. 482 Maintenance, and Nos1 and 6 Squadrons; if so, what sum; if not, why not. (9) What sum has been allocated (a) in total and (b) on average for each claim to defend claims made by members of No. 482 Maintenance, and Nos1 and 6 Squadrons. (10) When does he expect when the issues for No. 482 Maintenance, and Nos1 and 6 Squadrons to be finally resolved. (1) to (10) Please refer to House of Representatives Question on Notice 3736. Ex-Gratia Payments (Question No. 3736) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 20 June 2006: (1) When will the Departments of Veterans’ Affairs and Defence create a new ex-gratia payment system to recognise the F111 maintenance workers from Nos 482 Maintenance, 1 and 6 Squadrons so they can become eligible for workers compensation. (2) When will the personnel from the Nos 482 Maintenance, 1 and 6 Squadrons receive an ex-gratia payment or workers compensation settlement.",222,Dsups Payment Her Own Daughter Who Is Five Years Old Also Uses Family Day Care Once A
292,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Will all personnel from the Nos 482 Maintenance, 1 and 6 Squadrons receive the ex-gratia payment or any compensation for their injuries and illnesses. (4) Will currently healthy personnel not directly involved with the F111 Deseal Reseal program be eligible for the ex-gratia payment or workers compensation scheme in future years, if it can be proved that their illnesses or injuries are as a result of working in the F111 Deseal Reseal work area. (5) When determining the amount of any ex-gratia payment, will the Departments of Veterans’ Affairs and Defence (a) consider the legal costs incurred by claimants in pursuing their cases, (b) consider the amount of superannuation to which the claimant is entitled, (c) include an additional provision for ongoing medical care for existing illnesses and/or injury for the term of a claimant’s natural life, and payment for any necessary lifestyle adjustments made by claimants to accommodate their illnesses, such as modifications to residences or vehicles. (6) In formulating a compensation settlement for the serviceman of Nos 482 Maintenance, 1 and 6 Squadrons (a) will the Government offer the option of a lump sum or ongoing payment based on the serviceman’s existing wage; if so, will the rights and terms of an ongoing payment be transferred to a claimant’s spouse upon the claimants death, irrespective of cause and (b) if the settlement for each claimant includes a confidentiality clause, will provision be made for the confidentiality to be broken, if and when the Government of the day does not honour the terms of agreement approved by the current Minister. (7) Why did the 2006 Budget make no provision for compensation to members of Nos 482 Maintenance, 1 and 6 Squadrons. (8) Why does his Department’s budget provide approximately $1 million per claim for defence of each claim made by members of Nos 482 Maintenance, 1 and 6 Squadrons. (9) When will the compensation issues for Nos 482 Maintenance, 1 and 6 Squadrons be finalised. (1) The definition of a Deseal/Reseal participant has been agreed to by the Government and there is no intention of amending it. No consideration is being given to the creation of an additional scheme for ex-gratia payment to include workers who undertook activities outside the formal Deseal/Reseal programs. These workers currently have coverage for workers compensation. Compensation claims are determined not only on the basis of the claimed link to Deseal/Reseal work, but also based on the person’s general service work history. For instance, if a person claims that the Deseal/Reseal environment caused their condition then their claim can be considered in two ways: the first is under the specific Deseal/Reseal provisions under subsection 7(2) of the Safety, Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1988 (SRCA); and the second is based on their general work history under the SRCA and/or Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA). From September 2001, when the Deseal/Reseal Compensation Team was established, any claims which could be accepted based on a link between the claimant’s general service and their claimed condition under either the SRCA and/or the VEA have already been accepted. (2) and (3) Generally, personnel from Squadrons 482, 1 and 6 do not satisfy the definition of a F-111 Deseal/Reseal participant. Therefore, they will not be entitled to an ex-gratia lump sum payment (as distinct from compensation). However, some personnel from these squadrons who were assigned to the core Deseal/Reseal programs have applied meet the eligibility criteria and have received the ex-gratia lump sum payment.",223,Questions In Writing
293,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:All military personnel are entitled to claim compensation benefits under the VEA, and the SRCA. Eligibility for these benefits is independent of the F-111 Deseal/Reseal Lump Sum scheme. These benefits are associated with a specific injury or illness arising from employment. Claims for compensation are processed as they are received and are determined on their merits and must show a causal connection between a diagnosed injury or illness and employment. (4) If illness or diseases develop, claims for compensation can be lodged at any time in the future under either the SRCA or the VEA or both, as an individual’s service allows. (5) (a) No; (b) No; and (c) No. (6) (a) No; and (b) No. There is no confidentiality clause. (7) Because members of these Squadrons do not fall within the definition of people eligible for exgratia payments and therefore could not receive payments. (8) This is a factually incorrect statement and there is no basis for the false and misleading premise of the question. No provision was made for the defence of specific categories of claims. (9) 149 persons have been identified as 482, 1 or 6 Squadron members who have submitted compensation claims under the SRCA. 82 have already been processed and had some conditions determined or the claim completely finalised. The balance of these claims have had no determinations made on their conditions at this stage. Future claims will be processed in the usual manner as they are received. Veterans: Entitlements (Question Nos 3805 and 3806) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 8 August 2006: Is he aware of concerns within the veteran community that the indexation system used to determine the rate of the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (TPI) pension has resulted in a reduction of $80 per fortnight for TPI pension recipients over the past six years; if so, what is the Government doing to address this apparent inequity for Australia’s TPI veterans. I am aware that there have been concerns about the indexation of the T&PI pension, particularly that from March 1998 it should have been indexed with reference to Male Total average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE). Over recent years the Government has carefully considered both the adequacy of the T&PI pension and its means of indexation to ensure that it is fulfilling its intended purpose and supports those veterans most in need. While the Australian Government’s support available to T&PI veterans and their partners has more or less maintained relativity with average wages for the past 20 years, in response to the Clarke Report the Government changed its means of indexation. The T&PI pension is indexed twice yearly and is made up of two components – the General Rate and the Above General Rate disability pension. Since 20 March 2004, the Above General Rate component has been indexed with reference to both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and (MTAWE), in the same way as the maximum basic rate of service pension. This ensures that the Above General Rate component, which is only received by our most severely impaired veterans, is aligned with both CPI and",224,Questions In Writing
294,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The General Rate component of the T&PI pension, paid as compensation for pain and suffering, continues to be indexed in line with increases in the CPI to ensure that its value is not eroded by inflation. This indexation method is consistent with the indexation arrangements for most workers compensation payments. Another measure introduced as part of the Government’s response to the Clarke Report is the introduction of the Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA). The new allowance, introduced in September 2004, effectively exempts my Department’s disability pension from the income test at Centrelink. Following the introduction of DFISA, all T&PI veterans and their partners are now treated equitably, regardless of whether they receive their income support payments from my Department or Centrelink. This means that veterans and their partners in similar circumstances receive the same amount of Government assistance irrespective of whether they receive their income support under social security law or Veterans’ Affairs legislation. The Government continues to monitor the situation and examine views raised by the ex-service community to ensure that the current level of T&PI pension and its indexation arrangements are satisfactory. Veterans: Entitlements (Question No. 3813) Mr Georganas asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 8 August 2006: (1) What methods and departmental systems used to maintain accurate records of Department of Veterans’ Affairs pension recipients’ income, assets and eligibility for any benefit have been discontinued since 1996. (2) In respect of discontinued systems referred to in part (1), (a) what were the reasons for discontinuation, (b) what were the annual cost savings of discontinuation and (c) what has been the value of any increase in departmental expenditure on investigations of overpayments and repayment of benefits for each year since discontinuation. (1) None. (2) (a), (b), and (c) Not applicable. Veterans: Entitlements (Question No. 3815) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 8 August 2006: (1) What funding, if any, is provided by the Commonwealth Department of Veterans’ Affairs to the Victorian branch of the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (TPI) Disabled Soldiers Association of Victoria Inc. (2) In respect of the funding referred to in part (1), (a) for what purpose is it provided and (b) what conditions does the Commonwealth place on the distribution of funds to members of the TPI Disabled Soldiers Association of Victoria Inc. (3) Is the TPI Disabled Soldiers Association of Victoria Inc able to extend the provision of those services provided as a result of funding from the Commonwealth Department of Veterans’ Affairs to non-members of the Association or non-TPI pension recipients; if not, why not. (1) There has been no funding provided during the last financial year. TPI Disabled Soldiers Association of Victoria Inc may be eligible for funding under the following DVA grants programs: Saluting Their Service commemorations grants;",225,Mtawe Questions In Writing
295,Mr Billson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,226,Questions In Writing
296,Mr Billson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Building Excellence in Support and Training (BEST); and Veteran& Community (V&C) Grants. (2) (a) The Saluting Their Service commemorations program provides grants for projects that are directly commemorative of Australia’s servicemen and women involved in war, conflict and peacekeeping operations. It is designed to leave a lasting legacy of ongoing commemoration and understanding by the Australian community. BEST provides support and resources to ex-service organisation practitioners for pensions and welfare work to assist veterans, past and present members of the Australian Defence Forces and their dependants. A major objective of the program is to ensure high quality claims and appeals assistance by ex-service organisation practitioners that in turn will assist the Department of Veterans’ Affairs with timely and appropriate processing. V&C Grants aim to maintain and improve the independence and quality of life of members of the veteran community by providing funding for projects that support activities and services that sustain and/or enhance their health and well-being. (b) While individuals may apply for STS grants funding, they are not eligible to apply for BEST or V&C Grants funding. Organisations such as the TPI Disabled Soldiers Association of Victoria Inc are eligible to apply for grants funding under all three programs. Grants funding provided to an organisation is not for distribution to individual members of that organisation, the conditions for expenditure of grant funding is contained in a grant agreement. (3) The services provided through BEST funding are available to non-members of the Association and non-TPI pension recipients. Services that may be available through a project funded by a Veteran& Community Grant are generally to benefit the entire veteran community and can also benefit the wider community. Airport Security (Question No. 3818) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 8 August 2006: (1) Further to his reply to part (2) of question No. 1320 (Hansard, 7 February 2006, page 125), did he or any member of his staff take any action between 11 May 2005 and 1 June 2005 to confirm that CCTV cameras had been found to be out of focus or pointing to the wall in the baggage make-up area of Sydney International Airport; if so, on what date and what was the nature of such action; if not, why not. (2) On what date was he first advised that CCTV cameras had been found to be out of focus or pointing to the wall in the baggage make-up area of Sydney International Airport. (3) Who provided the advice referred to in part (2) and what was the nature of the advice. (4) On what date did he take action in relation to the advice referred to in part (2) and what are the full details of that action. (1) I do not have any specific knowledge of action concerning CCTV cameras at Sydney Airport between 11 May 2005 and 1 June 2005 taken by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services, or a member of his staff. (2) (3) and (4) I am not aware of the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services being informed about this matter.",226,Questions In Writing
297,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Airport Security (Question No. 3821) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 8 August 2006: (1) Since 2004, has Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) reported to him any (a) security incident or (b) unlawful interference with aviation at (i) Sydney International Airport or (ii) Sydney Domestic Airport; if so, how many and what are the details; if not, why not. (2) Have any security incidents or unlawful interference with aviation at (a) Sydney International Airport or (b) Sydney Domestic Airport been reported to him since 2004 by an agency other than SACL; if so, how many incidents have been reported and what are the details; if not, why not. (1) and (2) The Department of Transport and Regional Services, Office of Transport Security Operations Centre receives aviation security reports. These reports range in seriousness from information only reports through to those of a more serious nature. Specific details of the nature of the incidents are of a security sensitive nature and are not public information as they may be used to analyse Sydney Airport’s security procedures and measures.

(7) What assurances has he sought from the US Government regarding the conditions in which Mr Hicks is being detained; most particularly whether he has been subject to solitary confinement or any form of torture; and what response he has received. (8) What attempts have been made by Australian consular officials to ascertain (a) the health of Mr Hicks and (b) the conditions in which he is being held. (1) The Australian Government’s view is that any trial of Mr Hicks should happen as quickly as possible. I have re-iterated this in conversations with US Attorney-General Gonzales.",228,Questions In Writing
301,Mr Billson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,229,Questions In Writing
302,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) There is no set date for Mr Hicks’ trial at this stage. Mr Hicks has not yet been formally charged under the new Act. A US Defense department spokesperson is reported as saying said that trials are not expected until 2007. (3) The length of detention of an accused in custody prior to trial differs in individual cases. The Government has always maintained that Mr Hicks’ case should be resolved as quickly as possible and that Mr Hicks should face trial to answer the allegations against him. I reiterated my concerns in relation to the length of time this has taken in discussions with Attorney-General Gonzales in September 2006. However, it is the right of respective parties to test decisions in the courts and this is what has been happening in the US over the last couple of years. (4) See above answer to Question (2). The United States Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on 29 September 2006; the Act was signed into law by President Bush on 17 October 2006. The Act provides an alternative method for trying detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. The Act authorises the President to establish military commissions, establishes the jurisdiction of the commissions over ‘unlawful enemy combatants’, and sets out procedures for the treatment, prosecution and conviction of suspected terrorists. Additionally, regulations detailing military commission procedures are to be formulated within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. (5) The Act incorporates a number of fundamental due process safeguards for defendants, including a right to be present throughout the trial with limited exceptions, a right to see all the evidence against an accused, a right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, a presumption of innocence and an extensive appeals process up to the Supreme Court. Whether or not the Act complies with the Geneva Convention and other legal principles will ultimately be a matter for the United States government and the courts. (6) I have held several discussions with US Attorney-General Gonzales, in which I have emphasised the Australian Government’s desire to see Mr Hicks’ case dealt with expeditiously. I also reiterated the Government’s expectation that additional safeguards negotiated previously to apply to Mr Hicks’ case will apply to any new military commission trial of Mr Hicks. A number of issues which were the focus of those safeguards have been taken up in the new legislation. The additional safeguards previously negotiated included: Based upon the specific facts of his case, the United States has assured Australia that it will not seek the death penalty in Mr Hicks’ case. Australia and the United States agreed to work towards putting arrangements in place to transfer Mr Hicks to Australia, if convicted, to serve any penal sentence in Australia in accordance with Australian and United States laws. Conversations between Mr Hicks and his lawyers will not be monitored by the United States. Subject to any necessary security restrictions, Mr Hicks’ trial will be open, the media will be present and Australian officials may observe the proceedings. The Australian Government may make submissions to any review panel which would review Mr Hicks’ military commission trial. Should Mr Hicks choose to retain an Australian lawyer with appropriate security clearances as a consultant to his legal team, that person may have direct face-to-face communications with their client. Mr Hicks may talk to his family via telephone and two family members are permitted to attend his trial. Attorney-General Gonzales has given an undertaking that the assurances previously negotiated will be honoured. With respect to rules of evidence and rights of appeal, see (5) above. (7) At the Australian Government’s request, there have been two investigations into allegations of mistreatment of Mr Hicks, neither of which revealed any evidence of abuse. A United States Department of Defense investigation concluded in August 2004 that there was no evidence to support the allegations. The most recent report by the United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was provided to the Australian Government in July 2005. NCIS found no information that substantiated or corroborated the allegations of abuse. Mr Hicks is not held in solitary confinement. Conditions for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are equivalent to a maximum security facility in the US and his conditions are similar to those who are in custody awaiting trial for terrorism offences in Australia. Earlier this year, Mr Hicks, together with a number of other detainees, was transferred to a newly completed facility in Guantanamo Bay. Mr Hicks is being held in the general block area of this facility in a single occupancy cell. Cells in the general block area have windows providing natural light. Mr Hicks continues to have access to an exercise facility in a group area. He is able to communicate with the other detainees during exercise periods and between cells. (8) Australian officials have visited Mr Hicks at Guantanamo Bay on 17 occasions. On each occasion, Mr Hicks’ welfare has been assessed. No evidence of abuse or maltreatment has been found by Australian officials. The last consular visit was made to Mr Hicks on 27 September 2006. The Consul-General advised that Mr Hicks looked well but that Mr Hicks chose not to speak to the Consul. We are aware that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) met with Mr Hicks recently at Guantanamo Bay. We have not been advised of the content of the discussions between Mr Hicks and the ICRC. The ICRC would normally take up prisoner concerns with the camp authorities. The Australian Government will continue to monitor Mr Hicks’ welfare closely, and fulfil our consular responsibilities to Mr Hicks as an Australian citizen. With regard to the conditions in which Mr Hicks is being held, see (7) above. Mr David Hicks (Question No. 3963) (1) What advice has the Government received that the ongoing detention of Australian David Hicks in Guantanamo Bay is legal and from what source was this advice obtained. (2) What advice has the Government received in respect of claims such as that made by Major Michael Mori on the Enough Rope program on 14 August 2006, who said, in relation to David Hicks: ”I believe he’s been mistreated and physically assaulted, and, through my investigation, I’ve confirmed it”. (3) Have the claims referred to in part (2) been investigated; if so, has the Government made any representations to the United States Administration about the treatment of David Hicks. (4) Is David Hicks still in solitary confinement, as claimed by Major Mori; if so, (a) why and (b) when will he be released from solitary confinement. (5) Has the Government made any representations to the United States Administration about the length of time David Hicks will spend in solitary confinement; if so, what has been the outcome of those representations; if not, why not. (6) In respect of the Prime Minister’s statement that David Hicks has “committed more serious offences than most”; what are those offences. (7) What advice had the Government previously received confirming that the American military tribunal process was legal under international law.",229,Questions In Writing
303,Mr Mcmullan Asked The Attorney,"General, in writing, on 16 August 2006:(8) In respect of his statement of 29 July 2006, that he was hopeful that a new trial for David Hicks would be set up by the end of the year, (a) what did he mean by “a new trial” and (b) if nothing has been done by the end of the year, what action will he take. (1) Consistent with long standing practice, the Government will not disclose legal advice it has received on the legality of the detention of Mr Hicks. (2) At the request of the Australian Government, there have been two investigations into allegations of physical abuse. A US Department of Defense investigation concluded in August 2004 that there was no evidence to support allegations made by Mr Hicks. The most recent report by the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was provided to the government on 15 July 2005. The NCIS report was extensive and addressed all allegations of physical abuse that had been raised by Mr Hicks. The NCIS concluded there was no evidence to substantiate abuse allegations. Australian officials have met with Mr Hicks on 17 occasions at Guantanamo Bay and have seen no evidence of abuse. (3) Refer to (2) above. (4) Reports that Mr Hicks is being held in solitary confinement are incorrect. Mr Hicks is currently being held in a single occupancy cell in the general block area of a newly completed facility in Guantanamo Bay. Cells in the general block area have windows providing natural light. Mr Hicks continues to have access to exercise in group areas and he is able to communicate with other detainees during exercise periods and between cells. (5) Refer to (4) above. (6) The Prime Minister stated that “the information we have been given…is that [David Hicks] has, amongst those that are held at Guantanamo Bay, committed more serious offences than most”. Under the previous military commission system, Mr Hicks was charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes, attempted murder by an unprivileged belligerent, and aiding the enemy. These charges relate to Mr Hicks’ alleged involvement with al-Qa’ida and activities in Afghanistan. Mr Hicks has not yet been formally charged under the new Military Commissions Act signed into law by President Bush on 17 October 2006. (7) Consistent with long standing practice, the Government will not disclose legal advice it has received on the legality of the American military tribunal process under international law. (8) (a) The statement in relation to a ‘new trial’ related to the Government’s expectation that, subsequent to the Supreme Court’s decision in Hamdanv Rumsfeld, the United States Administration would work towards putting in place a new system of trying detainees which complies with the court’s decision. (b) There is no set date for Mr Hicks’ trial at this stage. A US Defense department spokesperson is reported as saying that trials are not expected until 2007. The Australian Government’s view is that any trial of Mr Hicks should happen as quickly as possible. I have re-iterated this in conversations with US Attorney-General Gonzales. Organ Harvesting (Question No. 3974) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 4 September 2006: (1) Has he seen the document titled Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China by Mr David Matas and former Canadian Cabinet Minister, Mr David Kilgour. (2) What information does he have regarding allegations made in the report that China is engaged in the systematic murder of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners for the purpose of harvesting kidneys, livers, corneas and other organs, for profit.",231,Questions In Writing
304,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) What steps has he taken to ascertain the truth of the allegations referred to in Part 2. (4) Has he raised the issue of alleged organ harvesting with the Chinese Minister for Health; if so, (a) when and in what circumstances and (b) what was the response of the Chinese Minister; if not, will he do so. (5) Will he take steps to have the allegations referred to in Part2 investigated by the appropriate international bodies, such as the World Health Organisation. (1) No. However, I am aware of the main allegations that it makes. (2) I have no specific information regarding the allegations. (3) and (4) Australian Government officials raised these reported allegations with Chinese Government officials as part of the Australia-China Human Rights dialogue in July 2006. This included a suggestion to China that they investigate the allegations. Therefore, I will not be discussing the matter with the Chinese Minister for Health. (5) No, given the matter has been raised directly with the Chinese Government. Designated Districts of Workforce Shortage (Question No. 3995) Ms Kate Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 4 September 2006: (1) Has the department received requests from the Australian medical community to produce State-wide, or nation-wide, maps of designated districts of workforce shortage. (2) Does he support the view of the South Australian Division of General Practice that the production of such maps would be extremely beneficial to overseas trained doctors considering options for settlement, as well as to the broader Australian medical community. (3) How many overseas trained doctors have been granted section 19AB exemptions to work in surgeries situated in inner metropolitan areas across Australia. (4) What estimation has he made of the effectiveness of the current system for determining whether a surgery falls within a district of workforce shortage. (5) How many South Australian surgeries have closed over the past 12 months. (6) Of the surgeries identified in part (5), (a) how many were based in inner metropolitan areas and (b) had any lodged applications for section 19AB exemptions with his department prior to closure. (7) Will he confirm the accuracy of advice given to one of my constituents by a senior officer within his department to the effect that since 1977, there has been a general policy that overseas trained doctors would not be granted an exemption under section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973 in inner metropolitan areas. (8) Does section 19AB of the Act, which requires that the Minister must determine, in writing, the guidelines that apply to the granting of exemptions for overseas trained doctors; if so how does informal Government policy of the kind accord with this section. (1) The Department has received requests from the Australian medical community to produce statewide, or nation-wide, maps of designated districts of workforce shortage. For the reasons stated in (2) these maps are not currently available. Overseas trained doctors and practices are able to enquire on the Department’s website (searchable database) as to whether a locality is a district of workforce shortage. Search criteria include state/territory and town, suburb or business centre. (2) Although a ‘visual’ indication of designated districts of workforce shortage, such as maps, could be helpful in determining options for settlement, as well as to the broader Australian medical commu-",232,Questions In Writing

306,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:nity, the statistics that underlie the determination of districts of workforce shortage are updated quarterly, which would necessitate regularly updating such maps. This would reduce their usefulness and currency. (3) The only overseas trained general practitioners, granted section 19AB exemptions to work in inner metropolitan areas, are those who have successfully demonstrated that exceptional individual circumstances exist, or those working in after hours clinics. Almost all inner metropolitan section 19AB exemptions relate to overseas trained doctors who are specialists. The current number of these specialists across Australia is 877. (4) The current system for determining whether a surgery falls within a district of workforce shortage is effective as it is based on doctor and population statistics that are objective and quantifiable. These are derived from robust data collections and are applied on a nationally consistent basis. The validity of statistics utilised to determine districts of workforce shortage is further enhanced through their updating, on a quarterly basis, ensuring that any fluctuations in population access to doctors is detected. This increases the scope for surgeries to accurately assess whether they are eligible to employ overseas trained doctors in the first instance. In terms of outcomes, the section 19AB exemption measure has been effective, as demonstrated by the fact that over the period 1995-96 to 2004-05, rural general practitioners have increased by over 20 per cent in full-time workload equivalent terms, compared with an increase for urban general practitioners of 2.8 per cent over the same period. (5) and (6) (a) and (b). Over the financial year 2005-06, 9 inner metropolitan general practices in South Australia closed (note: figure based on Practice Incentive Payment (PIP) accredited practices which comprise the majority of practices). None of these practices applied for a section 19AB exemption. (7) This is correct insofar that section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act), introduced on 1 January 1997 enables the Government to restrict employment of overseas trained doctors to private practice in rural, remote and outer metropolitan districts of workforce shortage. As noted above, if exceptional circumstances exist, discretion may be exercised to allow overseas trained general practitioners to work in inner metropolitan areas. (8) The assertion that “informal policy” considerations are part of the deliberations for section 19AB exemptions is incorrect. The legislation and the guidelines do however, provide scope for a discretionary element in the determination of these matters. The primary consideration on which section 19AB exemption decisions are based is that applicants must work in a district of workforce shortage. The section 19AB guidelines do however, allow additional factors to be considered in reaching a section 19AB decision. Crosby/Textor Contracts (Question No. 4043) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 4 September. 2006: (1) What contracts, if any, were granted to Crosby/Textor by the Minister, or by any departments or agencies in the Minister’s portfolio, in (a) 2004-05 and (b) 2005-06.

310,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) (a) (b) (i), (ii) Details of the estimated expenditure (as appropriate) and the location of funding for the identified postcodes for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 are provided at Attachment A. (b) (iii) The purpose of Australian Government General Recurrent Grants is to enable schools to offer students education directed towards the achievement of the Australian Government’s priorities for schooling. The purpose of the Capital Grants Programme is to provide supplementary funding to enable educational outcomes through support of the provision of school facilities. Capital Grants Programme funding is supplementary to funds provided by State and Territory school authorities and is used to provide and improve capital infrastructure. The purpose of the Flagpole Funding Initiative is to support schools to meet the condition of funding that every school have a functioning flagpole and fly the Australian flag as part of their civics and citizenship education. The Investing in Our Schools Programme is delivering much needed school infrastructure to State and non-government schools. The Australian Government is providing $1 billion for smaller scale projects that are additional to existing capital works programmes. The Values Education Good Practice Schools Programme is providing funding to clusters of schools to explore ways of improving their approaches to values education and to identify ways of putting into practice the National Framework for Values Education in Australian Schools. Initiatives funded under the Australian School Innovation in Science, Technology and Mathematics Project will bring schools together with industry, science organisations, universities and others. The Success for Boys Project is a grants programme for schools to take up professional learning modules in boys’ education. Funding under the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness (ASSPA) programme supported ASSPA Committees of the parents of Indigenous preschool and school students, representatives of the Indigenous community and representatives of the school. Indigenous education The two current programmes under which Indigenous education funding is provided to schools in the listed postcode areas are Supplementary Recurrent Assistance (SRA) and the Whole of Schools Intervention Strategy (WoSI). SRA provides per capita funding based on eligible Indigenous enrolments to education systems rather than to individual schools, except for independent schools. The Whole of School Intervention (WoSI) Strategy comprises two elements: Parent School Partnership Initiatives (PSPI) and Homework Centres (HWC). The Parent School Partnerships Initiative (PSPI) focuses on the implementation of creative approaches to improving the educational outcomes of Indigenous school students.

(2) What is the participation rate in the Tutorial Voucher Initiative program in (a) the federal electorate of Prospect, (b) New South Wales and (c) Australia? Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) The Australian Government does not have the data for eligible students at the electorate level. (b) See answer (1a) above. (c) The Department does not hold identified data on the improvement in reading achievement of individual students. The evaluation of the pilot Initiative shows that over 80% of responding parents felt their child had improved in reading and enjoying reading and 85% felt their child had increased their confidence in reading, while 69% of responding tutors felt most or all of the students they tutored had improved in reading. (d) See answer (1a) above. (2) (a) See answer (1a) above. (b) In NSW, 4,050 eligible students registered for tuition under the pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative. (c) The pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative assisted around 6,200 students nationally during 2005. Eating Disorders (Question No. 4340) Ms Burke asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 13 September 2006: (1) Does the Government contribute to specific eating disorder awareness, prevention and treatment programs; if so, (a) what sum is contributed and (b) what are the details of the programs. (2) Does the Government contribute to specific obesity awareness, prevention and treatment programs; if so, (a) what sum is contributed and (b) what are the details of the programs. (3) What sum has the current Government provided towards research into eating disorders. (4) Is he aware of the Worldwide Charter for Action on Eating Disorders; if so, is Australia a signatory to the Charter; if not (a) why not and (b) will Australia become a signatory to the Charter; if not, why not; if so, when. (5) In respect of treatment for eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders, (a) what options are available to Australians and (b) to what extent is the treatment covered by Medicare. (6) In respect of treatment for Australians in the early stages of an eating disorder, who do not meet the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, (a) what options are available and (b) to what extent is the treatment covered by Medicare. (7) What sum has the current Government contributed towards programs that educate and train medical professionals to recognise and treat eating disorders. (8) What advice has he received on the availability and efficacy of the various types of treatment available to Australians suffering from an eating disorder. (9) Is he aware of media reports that the incidence of eating disorders in Australia is increasing, particularly among school-aged children; if so, (a) what is his response and (b) what action is he taking to curb the trend. (10) What sum has the current Government contributed towards programs that promote a healthy body image in school-aged children and university students, and what are the details of these programs. (11) Is the Government considering the development of a national code of conduct on body image to ensure that the media, fashion industry and advertisers portray a more diverse and healthy range of men and women; if so, how will the code of conduct be developed; if not, why not. (1) (a) and (b) The Commonwealth Government supports a range of initiatives that aim to promote the social and emotional well-being of young people, prevent the development of mental health problems, including eating disorders, and to intervene early at the first sign of problems. Commonwealth Government initiatives include: The MindMatters mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention initiative for secondary schools. ($3.2 million p.a.). The KidsMatter mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention initiative for primary schools. ($1.5 million p.a.). The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Mental Health New Early Intervention Services for Parents, Children and Young People initiative. ($28.1 million over five years) The 2005-2006 promoting Better Mental Health Youth Mental Health Initiative ($69 million to June 2009)",236,Questions In Writing
311,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Additionally, the Commonwealth Government provided funding of $268,000 to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) to develop national clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for a range of conditions, including anorexia nervosa. (2) (a) and (b) The Department of Health and Ageing develops national guidelines, consumer information and targeted campaigns to raise the awareness of the need for good nutrition and physical activity. This includes physical activity recommendations, nutrition information including the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and the Australian Dietary Guidelines and information for health professionals including clinical guidelines. The Commonwealth Government has provided $165.6 million since 2003-04 for obesity awareness, prevention and treatment programs including: Building a Healthy Active Australia Healthy Weight Website Lifestyle Scripts The Australian Better Health Initiative In February 2006, COAG provided $39.8 million over five years through the Australian Better Health Initiative for: a program of rolling national social marketing campaigns to increase the awareness of risk factors related to nutrition, physical activity and healthy weight ($19.8 million); school and community grants to support local responses to combat overweight and obesity, with an emphasis on promoting healthy eating and good nutrition ($12 million); the Healthy Active Ambassador Program, where well-known people will promote healthy living messages to Australians, particularly young people ($2 million); the development of a national food classification system for school canteen guidelines and a national training resource for canteen managers ($2 million); Walk to Work and Walk to School national awareness, including media and public relations activities ($3.2 million); and evaluation and dissemination of best practice programs, including a national network to share best practice information on local programs which support healthy living and active lifestyle ($800,000). (3) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the government’s main health and medical research funding body, provides research support through a variety of mechanisms, including support for individual research projects, broad programs of research and people support schemes. During the period 2000 to 2006, the Commonwealth Government, through the NHMRC, awarded $2.25 million for research investigating eating disorders. (4) (a) and (b) Individuals and organisations are invited to sign the charter. A number of individuals and organisations from Australian have signed the charter. Governments do not appear to be signatories to the charter. (5) (a) The Department of Health and Ageing worked with the RANZCP to develop a series of CPGs for the management of mental disorders, including anorexia nervosa. The CPGs are systematically developed statements to assist practitioners in making decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. Their main purpose is to improve health outcomes for patients by improving the practice of clinicians. The guidelines are available from the RANZCP website (www.ranzcp.org). Treatment options for people with eating disorders include services from private psychiatrists, general practitioners (GPs), clinical psychologists and other allied mental health professionals. State and territory governments also provide complementary services for people with eating disorders through hospitals and state/territory mental health services. (b) In addition to the Medicare Benefits Schedule items that currently cover psychiatrist and GP services, the 2006-07 Budget contained a $538 million new initiative called Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The Better Access initiative will increase community access to mental health professionals and team-based mental health care, with GPs encouraged to work more closely and collaboratively with psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and other allied mental health professionals. A new GP Mental Health consultation item will be available for GPs to provide continuing management of patients with mental disorders, including eating disorders. New items will also be available for up to 12 individual and/or 12 group allied mental health services per calendar year to patients with an assessed mental disorder, including an eating disorder, who are referred by: a medical practitioner managing the patient under a GP Mental Health Care Plan or under a psychiatrist assessment and management plan; or a psychiatrist or paediatrician. Allied mental health services under this initiative include psychological assessment and therapy services provided by eligible clinical psychologists, and focussed psychological strategies provided by eligible psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists. (6) (a) and (b) Clinical advice suggests that patients in early stages of an eating disorder would meet the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder and be eligible for treatment services outlined in the response to (5) above. (7) The Commonwealth Government provides approximately $16,000 per year per medical student to universities to educate our future doctors. This is around $80,000 per student for a five-year course. In addition, governments contribute considerable sums by way of capital contributions to establish medical schools and to operate our postgraduate and vocational training system. The Commonwealth Government supported the development of the CPGs for the RANZCP. The CPGs provide medical professionals with evidence-based information on anorexia nervosa. The Commonwealth Government provides funding to RANZCP to assist in the structural reform of training. This is part of the “Increasing and Supporting the Mental Health Workforce” measure under the COAG Mental Health package. It is expected that the CPGs will be reviewed as part of this process. The Commonwealth Government has provided approximately $9.5 million in funding for the Support Scheme for Rural Specialist (SSRS) Program since 2002-03. In 2003, a workshop on eating disorders was provided to rural paediatricians. In 2004, a session on obesity was provided to paediatricians and advanced trainees. The Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative includes funding for mental health education and training for appropriate assessment, diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders by primary and specialist mental health care providers. CPGs developed by RANZCP for the management of anorexia nervosa outline the most appropriate, evidence based treatment for this disorder. (8) The Department of Health and Ageing worked with the RANZCP to develop a series of CPGs for the management of mental disorders, including anorexia nervosa. The CPGs are systematically developed statements to assist practitioners in making decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. Their main purpose is to improve health outcomes for patients by improving the practice of clinicians. The guidelines are available from the RANZCP website (www.ranzcp.org). (9) Yes. The incidence of eating disorders does appear to be increasing, however, it is uncertain if this is due to an increase in the number of people developing the disorders or because improved recognition has led to more cases being diagnosed. The term, ‘eating disorders’, is also being more widely used to not only describe conditions like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa but other behaviours such as compulsive eating, obesity and dieting behaviours. Therefore, it is difficult to gain an accurate picture of the number of people who have eating disorders. (a) and (b) Refer to responses to questions (1) – (3), (5) and (7). (10) Refer to responses to questions (1) – (2). (11) No, the Commonwealth Government is not considering the development of a national code of conduct on body image, however the Commonwealth Government’s Mindframe National Media Initiative, addresses the portrayal of mental illness in the media more broadly. The Mindframe resource provides practical advice and information to support the work of media professionals. The resource is designed to inform responsible and appropriate reporting of suicide and mental illness in order to reduce harm and copycat behaviour, and reduce the stigma experienced by people who experience a mental illness. The Mindframe website provides facts on eating disorders, and the broad concepts of Mindframe on reporting and portraying suicide and mental illness sensibly, accurately and responsibly, and avoiding stigmatising stereotypes, should be used by media as a guide when dealing with these issues. The Mindframe website is www.mindframe-media.info. Another of the Mindframe projects run by SANE Australian, StigmaWatch, was established to enhance the community’s ability to take action against media reporting that stigmatises mental illness. You can find the SANE StigmaWatch program at www.sane.org. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (Question No. 4344) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 13 September 2006. (1) Has she seen the program titled “Greenhouse Mafia”, which aired on the Four Corners program on 13 February 2006; if not, why not. (2) Is she aware that Dr Graeme Pearman, former CSIRO Climate Director, was the recipient of a UN Environmental Program Global award in 1989, awarded an Order of Australia in 1999 and awarded a Federation Medal in 2003. (3) Is she aware of Dr Pearman’s allegations, reported on the Four Corners program on 13 February 2006, that he was advised he “couldn’t say anything that indicated that I disagreed with current government policy”; if not, why not. (4) Can she confirm that the CSIRO is a portfolio agency which reports to her. (5) Has she spoken to managers at the CSIRO regarding what scientists can, cannot, should or should not say in the course of their duties. (6) Has she conducted an investigation into her office to determine whether a member of her staff has spoken to managers at the CSIRO regarding what scientists can, cannot, should or should not say in the course of their duties. If not, why not; if so, what are the details of that investigation. (7) Has she conducted an investigation into the Department of Education, Science and Training to determine whether any officer has spoken to managers at the CSIRO regarding what scientists can, cannot, should or should not say in the course of their duties; if not, why not; if so, what are the details of the investigation. (8) Can she confirm that the CSIRO charter contains provisions that enshrine the independence of CSIRO scientists from all departments and the Government. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) No. I was performing Ministerial duties. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Yes. (5) No. (6) No. As a statutory authority, CSIRO is responsible for determining its own policies in relation to matters such as public comment. (7) No. See answer to question (6). (8) CSIRO does not have a charter. It does however have a Public Comment Policy which acts as a guide for scientists. Consultancy Services (Question No. 4701) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 9 October 2006: (1) What sum did the Australian Taxation Office spend on consultancies in the financial year (a) 200203 (b) 2003-04 (c) 2004-05 and (d) 2005-06 (2) What is the estimated sum that the Australian Taxation Office will spend on consultancies in the financial 2006-07. (1) The Australian Taxation Office reports the costs on consultancy services in its annual reports. (2) The Australian Taxation Office expects to spend approximately $22 million on consultancy services inclusive of GST in 2006-07. Fuel Consumption (Question No. 4705) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, in writing, on 9 October 2006: (1) How reliable are the fuel consumption figures provided by car manufacturers. (2) Is he aware of a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 September 2006 titled “Rubbery Figures”, which states that the real fuel consumption of cars is higher than the figure shown on windscreen labels under Australian Design Rule 81/01 because the highway component of the test cycle is given disproportionate weighting by car manufacturers when calculating average fuel consumption. (3) Do car manufacturers obtain separate city and highway figures during testing of fuel consumption. (4) Are the figures referred to in Part (3) supplied to the Federal Government.",247,Questions In Writing
312,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Is he aware that since 1999 the European Union has mandated the display of city, highway and combined average fuel consumption figures; if so, will he require car manufacturers to make this data publicly available in Australia. (1) Fuel consumption figures on the label represent results from controlled tests conducted by manufacturers to demonstrate a vehicle model’s compliance with the Australian Design Rules (ADRs). All vehicles are tested using standardised, carefully controlled conditions in specialised vehicle emission laboratories which are audited by the Australian Government. No laboratory test can simulate all possible combinations of conditions experienced on the road. The objective in providing the data is to enable consumers to compare vehicles on a common basis, not to predict actual fuel consumption. ‘Real world’ fuel consumption may vary from the results provided on the fuel consumption label. (2) Although the terms are commonly used, the fuel consumption test does not contain a city and highway component. The test is split into an ‘urban’ cycle (which represents conditions found in stop-start traffic) and an ‘extra-urban’ cycle (which involves the vehicle accelerating to higher speeds, but not remaining at a constant speed typical of highway driving). The weighting of the urban and extra urban figures is determined by the test procedures within United National Economic Commission for Europe Regulations incorporated within ADR 81/01, not by the manufacturers. (3) See answer (2), also, although not currently required by ADR 81/01, it is likely that most manufacturers record separate urban and extra-urban figures during testing for fuel consumption. (4) No. (5) I understand that this is not correct. The EC Directive 1994/94/EC regarding consumer information on fuel consumption, including vehicle labelling, only requires the combined fuel consumption and carbon dioxide figures to be displayed. This Directive took effect from 2001 with some states only putting it into law in late 2004. Labels in some member states of the European Union do provide the urban and extra-urban figures, but this is voluntary. At this stage, there are no plans to require car manufacturers to make urban and extra urban data publicly available in Australia. ADR 81/01 is being reviewed, commencing later this year, and this issue will be considered in the review. Tumut Plant: Grants (Question No. 4727) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, in writing, on 10 October 2006: Further to my response to question No. 4103 (5 October, 2006) concerning a grant from the Strategic Investment Coordination process to Visy for the establishment of its Tumut pulp and paper mill, (a) what were the conditions in the grant deeds and (b) what audit has been undertaken to ensure these conditions were met. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: In addition to the usual clauses of an Australian Government contract, payments to Visy were conditional on the company achieving specific performance milestones. These milestones related to progress by Visy in building, commissioning and operating the pulp and paper mill and set requirements for investment by the company in the project, production tonnage levels and employment levels. The company was required also to report progress on a regular basis. Officers of my Department monitored the progress of this project as part of normal contract management to ensure that it met the conditions. Additionally, regular discussions were held with Visy’s operational staff and Departmental officers visited the project site.",251,Questions In Writing
313,Mr Lloyd,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Environmental Non-Government Organisations: Taxation Concessions (Question No. 4729) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 10 October 2006: (1) How many environmental non-government organisations receive taxation concessions and/or deductibility status by virtue of being deemed a charity and which organisations are they. (2) Have any environmental non-government organisations, which have applied to be deemed a charity, been refused, within the past three years. (3) What was the actual, or estimated, cost in forgone revenue resulting from the charitable status of environmental non-government organisations for the financial year (a) 2003-04, (b) 2004-05 and (c) 2005-06. (4) What auditing has been carried out to ensure that environmental non-government organisations remain eligible for charitable status. (5) Which environmental non-government organisations were audited for the financial year (a) 200304, (b) 2004-05 and (c) 2005-06, and what were the results of each audit. rial responsibilities.The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Environmental organisations that meet the requirements of a charity can be endorsed to receive taxation concessions. Environmental organisations that operate a public fund listed on the Register of Environmental Organisations are entitled to deductible gift status for the public fund. Some organisations are entitled to both tax concession status and deductible gift status for a fund that it operates. The Commissioner of Taxation advised that the following numbers of environmental nongovernment organisations receive taxation concessions and/or deductibility status: 269 organisations have taxation concession status but not deductibility status. 250 organisations have deductibility status but not taxation concession status. 110 organisations have both taxation concession status and deductibility status. It has long been the practice of the Commissioner not to provide information relating to specific taxpayers or organisations. However, where the name or ABN of an organisation is known, the Australian business register (ABR) may be searched in order to see which concessions that organisation is endorsed for, and the dates the concessions apply from. The ABR website is www.abr.gov.au. The public funds listed on the Register of Environmental Organisations are available on the Department of Heritage and Environment website, at www.deh.gov.au. (2) A total of twelve non-government environmental organisations which applied for endorsement for Tax Concession Charity status were refused endorsement in the past three financial years. (3) The ministerial statement, Investing for a Sustainable Australia, (Budget 2003-04) estimated the cost resulting from the tax deductibility of registered environmental organisations as $14 million for the 2003-04 financial year. The Environment Budget Overview (Budget 2005-06) estimated the cost resulting from the tax deductibility of registered environmental organisations as $22 million for both the 2004-05 and 200506 financial years. (4) From the 2005 financial year until 31 October 2006, 315 internal reviews and 14 client risk reviews of environmental organisations were carried out to ensure that endorsed environmental organisations remain eligible for charitable status",252,Questions In Writing
