13,Mr Hughes,"We have been here atakes the stand that the Government, haying a majority, will stifle discussion, and force everything through, as it has done in the past, well and good; hut I object to this interference with the rights of members. I have no desire to hold up business. HadI wished to do that, the Prime Minister would not have got the Sugar Agreement last night. It was brought on after 11 o'clock. did not dare to vote against it. it, and we on this side have no wish to hold up business, but we have rightsi which ought not to be curtailed, and therefore I shall vote against this motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. I would remind honourable members generally that we possess certain privileges. few, but while the Speaker is in the chair we have privileges, and I appeal to members opposite not to whittle them away, particularly so early in the session. the Standing Orders that has been moved applies only to the War Gratuity Bill. matter.

In order that honourable members may understand the scheme of this Bill relating to the payment of a war gratuity to thesoldiers and sailors of Australia who fought in the great war and the policy of the Government respecting the soldier,, it is perhaps as well that I should set out very shortly the circumstances that ledup to the adoption by the Government of this proposal. On my return to Australia the Returned Soldiers and Sailors' : Imperial League and the soldiers generally brought under my attention a number of grievances, and suggested certain suspension of reforms. As I have always found it better to deal with organized rather than disorganized bodies, I met the executive of the league and discussed at length the question raised. We dealt with the problems of repatriation, including vocational training and the general rehabilitation of the soldier in civilian life. Eventually, in September, of last year, the question of a gratuity. was mooted. About that time it was reported that how can the Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand, and South Africa had made, or were making, arrangements to pay a gratuity. Speaking generally, no part of the Empire, in fact, no part of the world, has treated its soldiers better than has the Commonwealth. It is admitted on all sides that the Australian soldiers were the best clad, the best fed, the best paid of all theAllied Armies, and that our hospital and medical arrangements lost nothing by comparison with those of other countries. And if other countries were paying a gratuity, it appeared clear to the Government that Australia must also do so. But our financial circumstances",19,Supplybill N O 4 1919 20

28,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minbeing question of a gratuity was mentioned, I pointed out that, although' I was very desirous of meeting the wishes of the soldiers, if we were to give a gratuity on the lines indicated, and which would not be less generous than the gratuity given by New Zealand, the financial position of the Commonwealth would be untenable. over for a little while u n t i l I was able to obtain from Canada, New Zealand, and SouthA f r i c a some figures, setting out the particulars of their schemes. sequently these were discussed with the representatives of the league, and it was generally admitted by them that, in the eircumstances in which Australia found itself, it would be impossible to pay a cash gratuity. I am very glad to be able to testify that these men, who were the representatives of the greater portion of the returned men who had done so much for Australia and for liberty, were most anxious not to embarrass the country for which they had fought. unanimously of the opinion that the financial position of the Commonwealth was such that it could not pay a cash gratuity. This is an eloquent tribute to the common sense and patriotism of our glorious soldiers, showing clearly that their patriotism was not an ephemeral thing, expending itself on the field of battle, but an enduring passion which manifested itself no less in the ordinary duties of citizenship in times of peace than on the field of battle in time of war. The position being accepted that the Commonwealth could not pay a cash gratuity, the Government proceeded to consider what was possible in the circumstances in which Australia found itself. members what that position is. It is one to give us considerable concern, although it is no cause for alarm. We all have, I hope, unbounded confidence in the future of our country. war and the grievous burdens war has imposed upon us cannot r u in it if we are true to ourselves: if Australia fails to hold its own it can only be through apathy and lack of courage and common sense oh the part of its citizens. The real danger to Australia is not so much from the enemy without the gates, nor, indeed,, from the enemy within, so far as danger can come from any section [28]2 already straitened, when the of the community, but from the failure of the whole body politic to meet the situation with courage and wisdom.. If Australia fails to assert herself, and reap the f u l l fruit s of victory, it will be the faul t of all her citizens. A f t e r mature consideration, a scheme was put before the soldiers' executive, approved by them and subsequently made The matter then stood public by me, in the following terms, as published in the Brisbane Courier of 4th November last:SubPayment to be at the flat rate of Is. 6d. a day from the date of embarkation to the official signing of Peace at Versailles, on 21st June, 1919. Payment at this rate to all members of fighting forces, naval and military, of the Australian Imperial Force (and to Imperial Reservists ), or the dependants of deceased soldiers and sailors who left Australia, doctors and nurses included. Payment at the rate of Is. a day from the date of enlistment to discharge for all members of the Australian Imperial Force who did not leave Australia; payment to be in the form of non-negotiable bonds bearing interest at 54 per cent. Bonds to be received as cash equivalent for all purposes under They were the Bepatriation Department, including land settlement, war service homes, businesses, purchases of furniture, &c. Bonds to be cashed by the Treasury in cases of hardship, of special urgency, on the marriage of a soldier, or on the re-marriage of a soldier's widow. Bonds not covered under the above heads to be redeemed as follows:-The Treasury to take up at least Â£500,000 per annum in May, 1021, the whole of Australia's share of indemnity payable by Germany to the Allies, which may be estimated at anything between Â£7,000,000 and Â£15,000,000, to be ear-marked for the redemption of gratuity bonds. If the indemnity ac' tually received on or before May, 1921, does not reach Â£10,000,000, the Government to make good bhe deficiency up to Â£10,000,000. The Government is to redeem the balance of the outstanding bonds after May, .1921, in not more than three equal annual instalments. The Government undertakes that if, after May, 1921, the financial and general outlook in the local I need not remind honourable or foreign market warrants raising the outstanding balance, or any part thereof, by loan, it will do so. That was the statement made on 3rd The consequences of November last, and the Returned Sailors andSoldiers' League, after discussion, supported and accepted the proposal. As the result of subsequent discussions the matter was advanced a further, stage, particulars of which were published in the press. I quote from the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 22nd November:The Prime Minister announced last night that arrangements have been completed with the banks to find the sum of Â£6,000,000 for the payment of the war gratuity in cash to the following classes:(1) Soldiers' widows. (2) Widowed mothers of unmarried deceased soldiers. {3) Other mothers of deceased soldiers who were dependent upon deceased soldiers. (4) Totally incapacitated and blind soldiers. (5) Soldiers who have married since discharge, or are about to marry. (0) Necessitous cases not included in the foregoing. Later still, arrangements were made w it h a large number of employers throughout Australia to cash the bonds of their employees. further wealth and the States of New South ""Wales, Queensland, and Victoria agreed to cash the bonds of their employees. That was, in broad outline, the scheme approved by the soldiers' executive, announced by me before the elections, and later submitted to the electors as the settled We pledged ourselves that the War Gratuity measure to be introduced this session. TheB ill I submit to the House embodies the soldiers and the electors. TheB ill itself and its introduction as the first measure submitted to Parliament this session fulfils the promise made by the Government to the soldiers and to the electors generally. I propose now to say a word or two by way of general explanation of the measure. First, it is incomparably the most liberal gratuity scheme adopted by any part of the Empire, and it is also the most democratic scheme. It makes no distinction of rank, but treats all alike, as is, I think, proper in a democratic country like Australia, with its democratic army. Much of the success of the Australian army lay in the fact that its organizat i on was essentially democratic. man did literally carry in his knapsack a marshal's baton. The overwhelming m a j o r it y of the battalion officers of the A . I . F . were men who had risen from the ranks. The scheme ' in this B ill rests upon this basis, and the scheme is not only democratic but equitable and liberal. We propose to pay the gratuity at the same rate to all men from the date of embarkation to the 28th June, 1919, the Mr Hughes. . ; date of the signature of the Peace Treaty at Versailles. In New Zealand the soldiers are paid from the date of embarkation to the date of death, or. discharge, or disembarkation, whichever came first. I feel assured that honourable members w ill admit that ours is much the fairer and better scheme. Let me give some illustrations to show how our scheme w ill apply in comparison w it h others. Take the case of a man enlisted in August, 1914, and hit at the Gallipoli landing, or w it h in three months of the landing, and returned to Australia unfit for further service. Under the New Zealand scheme he would be paid to the date As the result of of his discharge. Under our 3cheme he negotiations,' the Commonwi l l be paid to the 2Sth June, 1919. And very properly so, because, after all, what more could a man do than he did. He placed himself in the very forefront of the ranks of death; stricken and severely wounded he returned to Australia. He had done all that was possible for man to do. In return he is entitled to all that policy of the Government. his country can do for him. Another man, more fortunate, /continued at the Bill should be the first Frontt ill the end without being killed or disabled. He, too, deserves all that we cau give him, but his sacrifice was nothe scheme approved by greater than that of the man struck down on the first day. The dependants of the man who was killed at the landing w ill be paid to the 28th June. The soldier had made the supreme sacrifice, and his dependants are entitled to as much consideration as is the man who fought u n t i l the date of tlie Armistice. As I have said, the rate of gratuity under this B ill is Is. 6d. a day from date of embarkation to 28th June, 1919, and Is. a day for those enlisted before the l l t h November, 1918, from the day they reported for duty in camp to their discharge, or for a period of six months, whichever is the shorter period. The >next of k in of a soldier who left Australia in November, 1914, and was killed in A p r i l , 1915, at the landing, Every would receive-in B r it a in Â£5, in Canada about Â£22, in New Zealand Â£11 5s. Od., and in Australia Â£120. A man who left these shores' in November, 1914, was wounded at Gallipoli, returned to Australia, and was discharged in November, 1916, would receive-in B r it a in Â£ 1 1 , in Canada five months' pay, equal to about Â£40, in New Zealand approximately Â£50, and in Australia Â£120. The rate of payment in Canada is six months' That is to say, they did not propose to pay and allowances for three years' serincrease the Is. 6d. a day proposed by the vice, five months' pay for two years' Government, but they would pay cash on service, four months' pay for one the nail! year's service, and three months' pay they said, was proposed only for the for any service less than one year.

The article in question is headed, ""Gratuities in Cash,"" ""Peep at Labour's Platform, "" "" Some of the Good Things Enunciated.""

That doubtless was the idea. Unfortunately things did not happen precisely in that way. World says"" A communication forwarded to the Returned Soldiers and Sailors' Imperial League by Mr Carey, secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labour party, states that Labour's policy for soldiers, sailors, the nurses, and war workers includes the following:The gratuity to returned soldiers and widows to be paid in cash. Housing to be free for life of totally disabled soldiers, widows, dependents, and children of deceased soldiers. The registration and fulfilment of all inducements .and promises to soldiers, either prior or subsequent to enlistment, including the making up of the difference between military and civil pay, the payment of insurance premiums, insurances against death, the keeping open of employment where such promises were made, and any other promise to soldiers to obtain-enlistments. The establishment in civil life of all returned soldiers where financial assistance is essential to provide the amount necessary to enable the family to be supported without payment of interest or the repayment of capital. Permission has also been, asked of the League to allow representatives of the Labour party to address members on the above programme. No reply has yet been received."" -No reply has yet been Mr Hughes. I say that that is a tribute to the "" Ask, and ye Returned Soldiers' League's common sense. They simply ignored this dazzling, but unsubstantial vision, and went calmly on their way supporting the Government proposal. I may now safely leave this matter. Every honourable member recalls the general elections and the circumstances which surrounded them. Every effort was made to stampede the soldiers, to get them to forget that they had been fighting for their country, that they had saved it , and that it was their business to cherish that which Here is an extract they had fought and bled for, and saved.

As to men who died on service, the gratuity w ill be paid to their dependants for the whole period of their service, from the date of embarkation to the 28th June, 1919, without regard to any of the disqualifications which apply to those who have survived. From the gratuity paid to Imperial reservists will be deducted the amount of gratuity paid by the British authorities, so that they ehall not receive a greater payment than is made to members of the Australian Imperial Force. Clause6 sets out the conditions which prohibit the payment of the gratuity to certain persons, including those who have been absent without leave, and have not, prior to the commencement of the Act, surrendered' or been apprehended; those who are proved to the satisfaction of the prescribed authority to have suffered from of the wounds intentionally self-inflicted; those Naval and Imperial Forces, who are serving, or have served, a senreservists, and the dependants tence of penal servitude, imprisonment, or detention, at the expiration, of which is payable into the two they have been, or are to be, discharged Imfrom the Forces w it h ignominy, or for reservists, who left Australia misconduct, and those who, by reason of a sentence of penal servitude, imprisonof the Australian ment, or detention, imposed while on tbe Forces. In subvoyage or in a training camp or depot, were unable to join their units in thefield. Several other classes of persons, who are excluded from the benefits of this Broadly, a member of the measure are described in other sub-paragraphs of the clause. These conditions1 have been agreed to by the Returned to draw the Soldiers and Sailors' Imperial League, Those whoso but, notwithstanding anything in the' was forfeited for any offence clause, the prescribed authority can, if it ; thinks the case warrants it , award the days on any one occasion, gratuity for the whole period or any part such forfeiture, enthereof. Under these circumstances honourable members w ill admit that thesoldier is 'treated f a i r l y . The proviso at of pay the end of clause 6 is most importanttwenty-eight It reads as follows:Provided that where the prescribed authobut, under subrity is satisfied that a person absent without leave, who has not, prior to the commencement of this Act, surrendered or been apprehended, twenty-eight has neglected or failed to provide adequately for his dependants, payment may be made tosome or all of those dependants of such sum (not exceeding in'amount the sum' which Notwithstanding this promight btit for this section have been paid authority""-to to, or in respect of the service of, that person) as the prescribed authority thinks fit. in such This is a very wise and humane provision. The sins of the soldier are not to fal l upon his unfortunate dependants. And, as I ' have already said, notwithstanding anything in the clause, the prescribed authority may, if it thinks fit, award to the soldier himself the whole or such part of the gratuity as it deems, in all the circumstances of the case, he deserves ClauseS deals with a most important matter, to which the widest publicity must be given. The war gratuity is not a right, but is deemed to be a free g if t by the Government "" in recognition of honourable services during the war,"" and "" may in any case be withheld or deferred or subjected to terms and conditions as the prescribed authority, having regard to the interests or deserts of the claimant, thinks just and proper."" Where the prescribed authority is satisfied that any person who is eligible for the payment of the war gratuity has neglected or failed to provide adequately for his dependants, it may direct that payment of the whole or part of the gratuity be made to or for the benefit of some or all of those dependants. I think thathonorable members w ill say this is a very just, and, in some cases, w i ll prove a very necessary provision. It must be made perfectly clear that it is not open to the soldier to leave to the Commonwealth the care of his dependants while he squanders or misuses the gratuity. The soldier owes a duty to his dependants just as the country owes a duty to him, and we propose to safeguard the interests of dependants just as we propose to safeguard the soldier. Clause9 contains a provision relating to the gratuity of a deceased soldier, whether he has died before or after the passing of the Act, and stipulates that it shall not form part of the estate' of the deceased, and shall not be claimable by theexecutor or administrator of the estate, but may be paid to such one or more of the following persons, and in such proportions as the regulations prescribe, or the prescribed authority approves, namelyA n y person who(a) is beneficially entitled under the will of the deceased to any part of his estate; or (6) is or would be if the deceased had died in the first place have been entitled to a share in the distribution of his intestate estate: and who is cither the widow or a. child, parent, step parent, foster parent, or dependant of the deceased. 'This provision applies if a soldier dies in debt or intestate. In the first case his estate cannot be seized by the creditors to the extent of leaving the widow and dependants unprovided for. In the second case it is divided as prescribed in the clause. There is a proviso that, in special cases, the prescribed authority may approve of payment to persons other than those mentioned in the sub-clause to which I have just drawn attention. Clause 11 authorizes the issue of Treasury bills and empowers the Treasurer to borrow such moneys as are necessary for carrying out or giving effect to the Act. Under clause 12 the Consolidated Revenue Fund is to the necessary extent appropriated for the purposes of the Act. I come now to the medium in which the gratuity is to be paid. As I have said, the gratuity is to be paid in non-negotiable bonds redeemable ' within not more than three years of issue, except in special cases. The cases in which the Treasury w ill itself cash the bonds were decided upon after consultation with the executive of the league, and are set out in clause 13. I have already stated what these are, but in order to make the matter perfectly clear, I w ill read the provision in the B ill dealing with them again. It is provided in clause 13 that payment shall be made in cash if desired by the persons entitled to the gratuity in the case of (a) the widow of a member of the Forces; (6) the widowed mother of an unmarried deceased member of the Forces; (c) the mother of a deceased member of the Forces, if she was, prior to his death, a dependant of his; (Â«"") a member of the Forces, who is found by the prescribed authority to be blind or totally and permanently incapacitated; (e) a member of the Forces who has married since the date of hi3 discharge; or if ) a person who is found by the prescribed authority to he in necessitous circumstances. In addition to these cases in which the bonds w ill be cashed by the Treasury, the .Repatriation Department w ill , as provided in clause 14, accept Treasury bonds at their face value, plus interest accrued to date, in repayment of any moneys due by the person to whom they were issued for all purposes of repatriation, and the War Service Homes Act. As I stated many times during the elections, and prior thereto, soldiers can use these bonds for all repatriation purposes-the purchase of land, furniture, houses, and so forth. All the other arrangements that have been made with banks, private employers, the States, and the Commonwealth, to cash the bonds of their .employees are outside this measure. The Commonwealth, however, holds itself responsible, and guaranposal will be used to prevent men from tees that the bonds will be cashed as stated. Under clause 15 it is provided that the gratuity bonds are not alienable or negotiheart. able. They cannot pass from hand to hand "" whether by way or in consequence of sale, assignment, charge, execution, inextent to make, money out of the soldier. solvency, or otherwise howsoever."" It is very necessary that I should explain and emphasize what this clause means, since its effects are very far-reaching. It has come to my knowledge, and I suppose to the knowledge of many other honourable members, that some unscrupulous persons in this community are advancing money to soldiers at exorbitant rates of interest in such case would not be worth the paper on the security of their bonds. Many of these young men, who are unversed in the ways of the world, aTe permitting themselves to be exploited by harpies and Shylocks. I wish to say to every soldier in Australia, as well as to those who have lent money to soldiers, something which I hope they will take to heart. I want to 3ay to the soldier that any arrangement he has made with any person is null and void. I advise him to keep his bonds, and to take no notice whatever of any arrangement he has made. The men who loaned them money were warned before that the bonds were not negotiable. I venture to say that hot in any one case out of a hundred is the amount lent comparable to the face value of the bond. lent has not been equal to 50 per cent, of the face value of the bond. for my advice to the soldiers. As to the people who have loaned money to them in this way, some have acted in perfectly good faith. I would be the last to say that every man who has advanced money to a soldier has done so with the intention of defrauding or seeking to take advantage of him. Some of them have advanced the full face value of the bonds. Such cases, however, are few and far between. seeking to take advantage of our soldiersand to all who may be inclined to follow a like course, that the powers of the Commonwealth, whatever they may beand in this case the powers of the Parliament are plenary-wil l be exhausted in order to protect the soldier and to punish them.

It would be illegal, and I am not sure that both parties to such a transaction could not ' be prosecuted. Honourable members may depend upon it that it will not be my fault if the soldier is exploited. The blame will rest entirely with himself. If he likes to seek the protection of this Government, he will get it. Every lawyer knows that a contract can only be made between equals. Some of these soldiers are mere boys, inexperienced in the ways of the world. We are their guardians. We are also the guardians of the taxpayers' money, and we do not propose to allow the taxpayers' money to line the pockets of harpies and sharpers. Those are very hard words, but I could use harder if I chose. Clause 17 provides that any person who obtains a war gratuity by false pretences, or by making a false statement, shall be guilty of an offence, and liable to a penalty of Â£100, or imprisonment for one year. Olause 18 empowers the Governor General to make regulations not inconsistent with the Act, to give effect to its intentions. I want now to say a word or two in reference to the ""prescribed authority.""

I certainly would not say that there is so much excellence in this House that it utterly exhausts the possibilities of the whole community. We shall look about with an unbiased eye to get two good men, and I have no doubt we shall find them. I think the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr best, would have cost a good deal more. Tudor), who was a colleague of mine for many years, at least knows this of me, that I cannot be accused of thinking too highly of officials.

The Bill embodies in the letter and in the. spirit those pledges made to the electors, and upon which the majority of members of this Parliament were elected. pledges we made in the way we made them. Incidentally, the introduction of this measure at this time puts to confusion the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page), who last night, in this House, offered to bet large sums of money-in fact, anything, which, I suppose, means nothiug-that the Government had not the Gratuity Bill ready. It puts to confusion also, although that will not abash them, those gentlemen who said that the Government's pledges in regard to the gratuity were worthless, and that we did not intend to proceed with the measure. We have introduced this measure as promised, and the blame for not having it introduced sooner does not rest upon our shoulders. We invite honourable members to press on with the measure, for the soldiers are very anxious to receive this gratuity. Whatever else honourable members may doubt, they need not doubt that, and if the debates are unduly prolonged we may yet live to see a scene not dissimilar from the coup d'etat of the first Napoleon, when a file of grenadiers marched into the legislative chamber and preserved order in a fashion which at any rate had the effect of expediting business. We, I think, are all desirous of doing justice to these men and showing in some substantial way that we honour them. We are dealing with great sums of money, but we have to remember that the people were thoroughly informed of what this gratuity would cost, and they had before them two proposals; one, the scheme which I have had the honour to outline to-day, and another which, at the This House may therefore be said to represent public opinion, which is strongly in favour of paying a war gratuity on the lines laid down in this Bill. It is impossible to entertain any proposal to increase the rate or the amount of the gratuity. The proposal has not been The Government will hurriedly put forward, but is the result of mature consideration and very long and detailed deliberation. The men themselves are heartily in favour of it, and the Soldiers' League, on the 7th November last, officially issued a public statement under the name of Captain Dyett. its president, approving of this scheme, approving of the payment by bonds, and declining to entertain the question of a cash gratuity. ThisI t gives effect to the gratuity will tax the resources of the Commonwealth to the uttermost; and, in saying that, I am thinking, not only of = commitments for this purpose, but for others also which will have to be made in accordance with the policy of the Government.

Cash is to be paid in all circumstances where it' is actually needed, and interest at the rate of 5 i per cent, is to be paid upon 'bonds where cash is not required. gratuity is to be free of income tax. The bonds are to be negotiable in all cases of emergency, and redeemable in all circumstances of necessity. The scheme has been approved by the soldiers' executive, -by the banks, the business community, and by the electors in a clear and unmistakable majority. I am sure that this measure will meet with the approval of the majority in this House, and I invite honourable members to direct themselves to close consideration of its details.

I entirely agree with the honourable member that all men must be treated alike.

If the firm has not received equal treatment, whatever they have suffered w ill be made up to them. For the information of the Committee, and, through them, of the public generally, let me touch briefly on some points of the sugar question. Honourable members understand well that a consequence, not of the agreement that was ratified last night, but of the high price of sugar outside Australia, is that the price of sugar inside Australia must increase. proach this great subject in something better than a petty parochial spirit, and to cease from belabouring a Government and a Parliament that are endeavouring to do their best in a matter that is beset? with difficulties, and, if it must indulge in criticism, to let that criticism be constructive. To say that a consequence of what the House agreed to last night is an immediate increase in the price of 'sugar in Australia is to grossly misrepresent the facts. Had not the House sanctioned the sugar agreement, the price of sugar would have increased immediately and to a much greater extent than it will now. increase. What the House did last night was to man agree to the purchase of from 150,000 to 180,000 tons of^sugar at Â£ 3 0 6s. 8d. a ton. Had we not done that, we should have had to purchase sugar at the world's He had not; he price, which, at the very best, is something like Â£ 6 0 a ton. livery. did last night was to safeguard the in terests of the consumer, and to prevent him from paying from I d . to 3d. per l b. more for sugar than he now will have to pay. But one of the consequences of the increase in the price of sugar, and the disturbed state of the sugar market, is that manufacturers and consumers of sugar have rushed to get as much sugar as they could at the lower rate. That is only human nature. And in many cases the community will be at a disadvantage unless the Government take certain action, and has the support of the manufacturers. By way of illustration, I might remind honourable members that last night the honourable member for Franklin( Mr. McWilliams) mentioned the well-known fact that in a 2-lb. t in of jam there is as tlie price of sugar is increased the value of jam is increased, at any rate, in the estimation of the seller, and this remark applies also to confectionery, condensed milk, and, in a lesser degree, to sweet biscuits. But the Government w ill , so far as lies in its power, prevent the public from being exploited by manufacturers who have used sugar costing only Â£ 2 7 7s. 6d. a ton selling their commodities at prices which wo'uld cover tlie use of sugar at a much higher rate. This is a difficult matter to deal with, because while I ask the. press to apone manufacturer may have a, stock of 1,000 gross tins of some commodity, another may have a stock of only 100 dozen. And without the co-operation of the manufacturers and the merchants we cannot hope to succeed entirely. We intend to insist, however, that the price of commodities of which sugar forms a large part shall not be increased so long as the sugar used in their manufacture has been purchased at the old price. I do not think that any honourable merchant or manufacturer can take exception to tliat. E am able to say that some of the biggest jam manufacturers in the country are prepared to loyally co-operate with the Government in this matter, and I appeal to manufacturers generally to do so, at",31,Budget 1919 20

What the House the same time inviting the public to look after their own interests by insisting on getting jam and other commodities made largely of sugar at the prices which were being charged yesterday, u n t i l sumcient time has elapsed to make it reasonably probable that the sugar contained in them has been purchased at the higher price. community men who are, to speak politely, only reasonably honest. Amongst them are those who have been hoarding sugar and have not hesitated to make deliberately false returns to our officials. Naturally, this falsifying of returns has not been detected in. every case, but tlie Customs Department has ascertained that some men have been guilty of the mean and contemptible act of robbing the Commonwealth and seeking to exploit their fellow citizens. The investigations of tlie Department are still continuing, but I think it well that the public should be taken into our confidence, and told exactly what the present position of affairs is. A very large firm of jam-makers in South Melbourne is among those who f a l l into the category of persons who are only reasonably honest. this company's premises revealed a stack of about three hundred 140-lb. bags of sugar concealed behind a stack of empty cases. The manager of the factory was examined before the Chief Prices Commissioner,who came to the conclusion that this sugar was deliberately concealed. The company's return to the census disclosed' 15 tons of sugar in stock on 31st January. The quantity on the premises at the time of the search on the 8 th MaTch was 32 tons. The concealed sugar had every appearance of having been stored for months, and the factory manager would not deny that it had been there for some considerable time. A search on premises at Brunswick revealed 1,470 lbs^ of white sugar and 27 sacks, each about 170 lbs. of brown sugar in a-storeroom in the back of the shop, and 2,940 lbs. of white sugar in an upstairs room of the house adjoining the shop. On visiting the premises first, the officer was informed there was no white sugar in the place. No census return had been supplied. I pass from Victoria, because no State has a monopoly of such men. There is a large firm of manufacturing confectioners in Sydney, who manufacture a certain kind of confectionery which honourable members who know me well know I was in the habit of patronizing for some years. On visiting this factory, the officer was shown a stack of about 28 tons of sugar, and was informed that there was no more sugar on the premises, hut on the second story of the building about 700 Unfortunately, there are in the or 800 bags of sugar, approximately 45 to 50 tons, were discovered behind a large quantity of cases. The sugar was completely hidden, and it was only after several tiers of cases were removed that the discovery was made. In this case the secretary of the company directed his employee not to answer questions put to h i m by the officer of the Department.

'Unfortunately there are limits to the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to profiteering in the ordinary sense of the word, but there is no doubt whatever as to our powers in regard to this matter.

These cases have occurred among people who hold the sugar for retail or manufacture, and I shall not hesitate, if necessary, to give the names of these firms in order that they may be punished by the law and at the same time earn the contempt of their fellow-citizens. If it were a great private monopoly carrying out this scheme of sugar distribution there might be in the tortuous meandering of their minds some excuse for their actions, but in this case the offenders are trying to take down their fellow-citizens, who are engaged in a great co-operative scheme for the benefit of the community generally. to take the consumer down to the extent of 3d. or 4d. per lb. for sugar in the near future, and I can hardly find words to express my opinion of them. I began well and moderately by saying that they are ""reasonably honest.""

I hope that they will be dealt with. up, but there are difficulties, as the honourable'member will reasonably understand. difficulties, but I would rather trust the Customs Department to trace out wrongdoers than any other Department, because they have had considerable experience in this direction. The Prime Minister has shown us that on some of the premises raided there was as much as 70 tons of sugar stored, yet honest traders were prevented from obtaining more than a bag at a time. When the Prime Minister made his statement on the sugar question on Wednesday, he said there was an abundance of sugar, but I can assure him that there are some people who could not get supplies. During the election campaign grocers came to see me, and pointed out that it was absolutely impossible for them to obtain sugar. I arranged a deputation of them to Colonel Oldershaw, and put the position before him. WhatI said the other night was absolutely correct. When the housewife went to purchase 12 lbs. of sugar, her ordinary weekly order, she was cut down to 8 lbs., 6 lbs., or even 2 lbs., in some cases. She would be given 1 lb. of brown sugar and 1 lb. of white. time when that was absolutely unavoidable.

Some manufacturers of jam and confectionery use an enormous quantity of sugar every day, but I believe in compulsory honesty, and we should see that no hoarding up of supplies is taking place.

I hope the Minister will follow up this question of the hoarding of sugar. In justice to those who have made fair returns, the Department should see that every one does so., I have, by way of interjection, complained of the faulty distribution of sugar. When standing on a country railway station, I have seen four or five bags of sugar addressed to a private individual, while a storekeeper within a stone's throw of that station could not obtain an ounce. That suggests that influence can be brought to bear in some quartersI am not referring specially to governmental quarters-to obtain supplies. a firm of grocers, which has six or eight different shops in the metropolis of Melbourne, told me to-day that he was quite out of sugar, and that the other branches were in much the same position. Country storekeepers are hard hit under a system adopted by a big firm of grocers in Melbourne that advertises that a bag of white sugar will be included in a Â£5 order for groceries. An order is sent by a resident of a country district, and the sugar duly arrives, although the local storekeeper is unable to obtain a bag for distribution among his own customers. I should like the Minister so to arrange the method of distribution that practically all business people, as well as private householders, will have a fair deal. for Trade and Customs) [3.42] I desire to refer briefly to the question of the distribution of sugar, since there seems to be a general idea that the Government have made themselves responsible for that work. We have never done so. [29] that the Government have no control? trolled the distribution of sugar, except that we have said to the Colonial SugarRefining Company whenever it became necessary to do so, "" You must limit the delivery of sugar to all firms to the quantity they received last year."" When, white sugar was very scarce, we also said to the company, "" Y o u must deliver white sugar in certain directions, and make up the balance with brown sugar."" That course was adopted to save the f r u it crop in many districts, and notwithstanding the criticism levelled at my own head, and at the Government generally, I think it was right. tralia the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has Tigidly carried out that instruction. Colonial Sugar Refining Company has adhered to both the spirit and the letter of our instructions. fruit has consequently been saved. am convinced that many a fruit-grower A branch manager of would have lost his crop. We have had to take the odium attaching to the in struction, but believe that we did the right thing. At the present moment in Victoria, there is an acute shortage. During the engineers' strike, it was impossible for a certain period to bring down our sugar from Queensland in accordance with the arrangements we had made in advance. We have to make arrangements in advance for shifting the sugar from the various refineries, and so distributing. it as to meet the demands in all the States. As we have a. fairly good 'idea what the demand will be, we know pretty well where to make our deliveries from time to time. The seamen's strike, however, upset those arrangements. A ship that wass chartered to bring some foreign sugar to Melbourne did not arrive within the time anticipated, and, in consequence, there is, at present, as I have said, an acute shortage in this State. We are endeavouring to overcome it, and I believe we shall do so next week, and we shall then be able to resume deliveries of sugar in",34,Budget 1919 20

That will depend on circumstances over which I have no control. before we meet next Wednesday? ask the question is that the Prime Minister made a statement during the election campaign that no alteration in the price would be made during the current year. any declaration by the Prime Minister to that effect, but I did see a declaration made by him towards, the end of the campaign that there would be no alteration in the price of sugar within three months of that date, the 8th December. Of course, more than three months have elapsed since he made that statement, and the rise may occur at any timeI cannot say exactly when. When we lay down a general rule that in no circumstances is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to increase deliveries of sugar over the amount of last year's deliveries, exceptions must, of course, be made. For instance, if a man started business during the current year, and had received some supplies, it would be a cruel thing to declare that his supplies must be cut off. There are other cases in which, in order to save large quantities of fruit in the orchards, we have allowed sufficient sugar to be delivered. cumstances must be dealt with on their merits, but, generally speaking, the rule that people should receive sugar to the extent of last year's deliveries, and no more, has been absolutely adhered to. The one other class of exceptions are the customers of the Millaquin refinery, which has customers in Queensland and elsewhere. Owing to the failure of the sugar crop in and around Bundaberg the Millaquin company was able to refine only about 5,000 toqs, as against 25,000 last year. We endeavoured to make up the company's deficiency, and would have kept the refinery going had not the strike IS there to be intervened. But owing to the strike the supplies were cut off, and they could not meet the orders of .their customers. A good deal of f r i c t i o n arose on that account. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, of course, had no record of the supplies given to the Millaquin company's custoI am sorry that I mers in the preceding year, and, although we endeavoured to meet the requirements of those customers as f a r as possible, we had to make sure that applicants were not falsely representing themselves to be W ill there be an increase customers of the Millaquin. company in order to get a double supply. I do not think so. I wish to make it perfectly clear to the Committee that the GovernI ment have never undertaken the distribution of sugar or interfered w i th the normal channels of distribution. We have allowed those to continue as they were before the Government took control I have not read of the sugar supplies. That is to say, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, on the order of a merchant or retailer, distributes direct from the refinery, and the Government has never accepted any direct responsibility in that regard. regret that I was not in the Chamber when the Prime Minister spoke on the question of the hoarding of sugar. It does seem surprising that, when investigation showed that certain persons were hoarding sugar in anticipation of an increase in price, no punishments were in flicted. Housewives throughout Australia have been anxious to make jam in order to counteract, at any rate to some little extent, the increased cost of living, but they experienced great difficulty in obtaining sugar. It is idle for Ministers to say that -there was no shortage. There was a shortage, so f a r as the public were All these special circoncerned, and it was the duty of the Minister, or those responsible for the distribution, to discover the reason, and if persons were found to be hoarding they should have been punished.
