While awaiting ratification of that tariff schedule, the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) toured Europe in an endeavour to complete treaties on the basis of the new intermediate tariff. His success was not notable, but that lack of success was an indication, not, I would say, of shortcomings on the part of the Minister, but of the economic state of affairs in Europe. It was an indication of the intensity of economic nationalism as practised in the continental countries of Europe. Now we have this further tariff schedule, which introduces a licensing system, not for the purpose of protecting secondary industries, but for the purpose of diverting trade from certain channels into other channels, which will be beneficial to the Australian nation as a whole. Before and since the Ottawa agreement, Australia has experienced the effects of a system of licensing against its exports to foreign countries. In that respect, therefore, the decision made by the Government in this case was not without a precedent. forced by economic circumstances to adopt the practice of other countries. In the financial year preceding the ifinancial year in which this system was introduced in Australia, we had an adverse balance of payments of £7,500,000, and were obliged to take some action to stimulate the exports of the Commonwealth, and to preserve our own industries, parWe should realize that it ticularly our export industries. In the face of this adverse balance of payments, we had to take some means of checking the drift. Eor instance, we reiterated our demands on the United Kingdomour requests, I should, perhaps, say, but they have virtually been demands-that it should continue to give us an expanding share of its market. The response of the United Kingdom was very ready Last year a and satisfactory, and there accordingly falls upon us an obligation to do something in return-a n obligation at least to do as much for British products in the Australian market as we have requested Great Britain to do for Australian proThat schedule, ducts in the British market. The obligation we have incurred to preserve within reasonable limits a share of the Australian market for British exports is virtually the essence of these tariff proposals. I have prepared two tables, one setting out the quantities of our exports to the United Kingdom market, and the progressive manner in which those quantities have increased in percentage from 19'29 30 to the latest year J for which I have complete figures, 1934-35, and the second showing the value in Australian, currency of our exports to the United Kingdom from 1929-30 to 1935-36. They are as follows:Percentage ot Products exported. total exports taken by Great Bri tain In insn-Sli.

Pig-lead Win© Flour Cheese TallowI have a further table to which I shall refer later, which deals with exports and imports. The first table shows the amazing extent to which we depend on the British market. It is almost the sole market for the major exports from Australia. Britain, for instance, takes 35 per cent, of our exports of wool, 61 per eent. of our wheat exports, 93 per cent, of our butter, 87 per cent, of bur beef and veal, 9B per cent, of our mutton and lamb, and so on through the whole regimen. Great Britain has been able to do so much for us only by penalizing, to a substantial extent, the consumers of the United Kingdom. I shall enlarge upon that point later. To what extent hare we reciprocated? In the year in which the Ottawa agreement was ratified, of Australia's total imports from the United Kingdom, 23 per cent, in value was represented by textiles; but notwithstanding the manner in which Great Britain has preserved a market in the United Kingdom for our surplus production, we have, in three years, allowed our Percentage import trade in textiles to drift to foreign Increase. countries to such an extent that, of Great Britain's total exports to us, now only 13 per cent. per cent, is represented by textiles.

While this favorable situation has been developing, Australia has allowed her imports of textiles to drift from British to foreign sources, while in 1932 our imports of cottons and artificial silk goods from the United Kingdom totalled 175,000,000 square yards, by 1935 the figures had declined to 125,000,000 square yards. . Within the same period our imports of such goods from foreign countries, chiefly Japan, increased from 53,000,000 square yards in 1932, to 158,500,000 square yards in 1935, thus there was a falling off of 50,000,000 square yards in such imports from the United Kingdom, and an increase of 105,000,000 square yards from foreign countries in the . three-year circumstances it is necessary for us to consider whether it is practicable for Great Britain to continue to preserve for us the valuable markets which we now enjoy in the United Kingdom. If we allow our trade in our principal imports from the United Kingdom to drift into the hands of foreign countries, it becomes a question whether Great Britain should continue to place its consumers under a disadvantage in order that our exports may have entry into the United Kingdom. It is also necessary that we contemplate the standards of living and the wage rates that obtain in foreign countries. The conditions in Japan, which is the country from which we were increasing our imports of textiles, are clearly described in a report on cotton cloths issued by the Tariff Commission of the United States of America on the 15th April, 1936. This report states thatAbout 85 per cent, of the operatives in the entire industry arc females, and most of these are between fourteen and eighteen years of age. The report also points out that the operatives in the Japanese factories are lodged by the companies. In this connection it statesSuch lodging is free. The cost to the m ill above tlie wages paid, is estimated to average about 25 per cent, of the actual money wages. . . . Most of the mills now operate two nine-hour shifts, with a half-hour rest period. A t factories where only one shift is worked, a day's working period may be ten hours or more, but females, also juvenile male workers under fifteen years of age, cannot be employed for more than eleven hours per day with one hour of rest; these workers are granted four f u l l rest days per month. The Government of Japan has itself published a statement dealing with the wages of the operatives, which shows that female weavers have suffered a very severe reduction of wages in the last four or five years. In 192S the average wage of female weavers was 1.01 yen a day. This has now fallen to .67 yen. The Australian equivalent of .67 yen is less than Is. To this must be added the estimated cost of boarding the operatives, which is 25 per cent, of the wages paid. It will be 3een, therefore, that 85 per cent, of the employees in the textile industries of Japan receive an average wage of only Is. 3d. a day, and that they may be called upon to work eleven hours Mr MoEwen. period. In these each day, with four rest days each month. The wages of unskilled recruits in the Japanese factories begin at the Australian equivalent of 7£d. a day. How can it be expected that the British textile industry can compete with the Japanese industry in such circumstances, especially in view of the depreciation of the Japanese currency? The Commonwealth Government has no right whatever to criticize the monetary or industrial policy of Japan, or offer advice as to the internal conditions that should rule in that country. I have directed attention to these figures because I think it necessary to do so, but I offer no criticism of them. I assert, however, that unless adequate tariff protection is provided, the conditions in Japan must necessarily dictate the conditions in the mills of the United Kingdom, the products of which compete with the products of the Japanese mills. It behoves us, therefore, while not criticizing the conditions in Japan, to determine whether we are prepared to permit exports from that country unrestricted entry into Australia to the serious detriment of the goods manufactured in the United Kingdom. I am not willing to countenance any procedure which will virtually impose such conditions upon the workers of the United Kingdom. I believe that the overwhelming majority of the people of Australia would support such an attitude. It is necessary for us, therefore, in considering this subject, to ask to what extent the conditions prevailing in Japan, for example, may dictate the conditions that must prevail in the textile factories of the British Empire. It is also necessary for us to attempt to visualize the possibility of the application of such conditions to other industries There is no reason .to expect that a foreign counitry which observed these conditions in the textile industry, would not be prepared to apply a similar industrial technique to other industries. Therefore, if we take no action in this connection, that is tantamount to saying that we are not prepared to do anything to prevent the entire destruction of the industrial conditions that have been established throughout the British Empire. Opposition mepibers interjecting, hear one who is defending the maintenance of fair labour conditions and just industrial awards so criticized and heckled by those who are the so-called representatives of labour. I wish to continue on the lines that I laid down when I rose to speak. I have ho intention of permitting my remarks to drift into a criticism of the policy of any other party in this chamber. I might point out, I think quite properly, that when the Government took this action to indicate its preparedness to arrest the flow of foreign textiles, it deferred the punitive duties for a period of six months in. order to afford adequate time for negotiation. That faot, and subsequent events, proved that the Government was willing to regard these duties more as a basis for bargaining than as its final word. We understand that it has offered to Japan some reduction of the rate of duty set out in the schedule. It has further offered a quota; and considering the volume of imports of Japanese textiles in the year in which the agreement with the United Kingdom was made at Ottawa, that quota would appear to be a very liberal one, representing as it does more than double the volume of our imports of textiles from all foreign, countries in that year. We have been rather dilatory in taking action to preserve this market, to at least a fair extent, for the principal export from Great Britain. Let us examine what the United Kingdom has done for the dominions under the Ottawa agreement, as well as before it was made. During the last decade, Great Britain has reversed a policy that had stood for a century, with a view to promoting the interests of the British dominions-the policy of a. free breakfast table. Eree trade was not the policy of any particular government or party in the United Kingdom., but was definitely the policy of the nation. Not in its own interests, but at the request of and in the interests of the dominions, Great Britain imposed a list of duties and restrictive quotas against imports of foodstuffs ffrom foreign countries, and these, while benefitting Australia tremendously, have necessarily prejudiced very considerably the British consumer. The following table shows the duties imposed by Great Britain against foreign foodstuffs:Duties Against Foreign Foodstuffs. Wheat 2s. a quarter of 480 lb. Butter 15s. per cwt.

Sugar (Australian) NOTE -There is no duty on frozen and chilled meats, bacon or ham, but by the Ottawa agreements importations of foreign frozen mutton, lamb and beef were reduced to 65 per cent, of 1931-32 importations, whilst under the United Kingdom-Argentine agreement importations of chilled beef from that country have been leduccd by 10 per cent, of the 1931-32 importations. Importations of foreign bacon are regulated on the basis of tlie capacity of the United Kingdom and dominion producers to supply the Dnited Kingdom market. If the British Government, at our request, is prepared to prejudice the British consumer by imposing duties and restrictive quotas on foodstuffs from foreign sources, surely we should be prepared to reciprocate to at least a reasonable extent 1 No more than that is involved in the tariff schedule that we are now considering. During the",17,Tariff Proposals 1935 36

Consequently, while I ment of butter to the United Kingdom for the purpose of testing out that market. our most important industries. If Japan should apply to the dairying industry the industrial technique that I have shown is applied to the textile industry, it would have no difficulty in underselling us in that particular commodity. Should that transpire, I am quite sure that we would very promptly demand that Great Britain should do at least as much for our protection as we propose to do for .the protection of British textiles. I should like to make a passing reference to the licensing system as it affects particularly America. Here we have a country which has been notoriously reluctant to afford any facilities for the entry of our principal exports to its markets, with the result that for many years we have had a very serious and persistent adverse trade balance with it. It has been suggested by the Opposition that we should not discriminate nations. mean that, rather than have introduced a licensing system, we should have so raised our general tariff as to block out imports from the United States of America of those goods which have caused our very serious adverse trade balance with that country. point out, however, that if that procedure were followed it would not be possible to prohibit imports 'from the United States of America without at the same time prohibiting imports of competitive commodities from countries which trade with us in a reasonable manner. For example, it would not be possible under the general tariff to prohibit imports of toys from the United States of America without at the same time raising a similar barrier against Japanese toys. E think it will be accepted as a reasonable policy that there should be discrimination as between nations according to whether they are good or bad customers and are prepared to reciprocate with us. I can see no other way than by the application of a licensing, .system in which our imports from bad customer countries may be controlled and the flow diverted to realize the difficulties of administering such a system dangers; and while I emphasize the necessity for exercising extreme care in its administration, at the same time. I can j see no alternative to it if we desire to control the source of our imports and favour those nations which are good customers as against those which are bad customers or are not customers at all. This tariff schedule embodies an entirely new principle in relation to the Australian tobacco industry, a principle which I believe to be entirely rightthat if importers of foreign tobacco are the United States of to enjoy the benefits of a reasonable import duty, it shall be obligatory on them to blend with those imports a certain proportion of Australian leaf. That will react very favourably on the Australian tobacco industry. But I would point out to the Government that the percentages of Australian leaf which must be blended have been fixed at too low a figure. The as between percentage to be blended with imported I take that statement to cigarette tobacco if that tobacco is to escape the penalty rate of duty, is only 2£ per cent. The Government must consider at an early date the advisability of increasing the percentage in regard to both cigarette and pipe tobacco. I would I take it that, in its application to the motor industry, the licensing system has a dual purpose. First, it is a step to help to correct our adverse trade balance; and secondly it has a very definite relation to our defence needs. I ' think all honourable members will agree that it is right that consideration should be given to the manufacture of either the complete unit or the greater proportion of our needs in connection with motor cars and internal combustion engines, provided that such production can be undertaken on an economic basis. Then, too, if it be demonstrated that our defence requirements demand the establishment of an industry for the manufacture of internal combustion engines, I believe that every right-thinking Australian would be prepared to place in a secondary position the question whether such manufacture is entirely economic or not.

60,Mr Mcewen,"And, I agree, thethink it ia right that the Government ahould refer this matter to the Tariff Board. But we are not sure whether certain aspects of the new duties have been referred to that tribunal. TheM in ister directing negotiations for trade treaties, in his speech and in reply to questions, has intimated that the board has had referred to it the question: "" H o w best can the manufacture of internal combustion engines or motor cars be undertaken in Australia "" ? It has not been made clear that reference to the T a r i ff Board for a report has been made as to the merits of the change of method of levying import duties from ad valorem rates to specific rates. It has been pointed out to me by certain importers that a change of duty from an ad valorem basis to a specific rate basis has had the effect of more than doubling the rates of duty on motor ohassis which are our principal imports from Canada. Sir so. MrM c EWEN Minister indicates that if it should happen that the rate of duty has been virtually doubled such a change would not meet with his approval? Sir pleased to show the honourable member the increases on particular cars. MrM c EWEN have that information. I trust that the Minister did not take this step without f u l l investigation as to the manner in which this change of duty would operate, and I hope that if there is any doubt as to the incidence of this change that particular aspect also w ill be referred to the Tariff Board for report. siderably already. that that is significant. I emphasize that this schedule. should be viewed by any Australian, not as representing an isolated policy but as one step further in a sequence of steps to encourage and assist the export of Australian primary products. principle of Empire trade reciprocity. I submit that one cannot view the developments which have taken place in our relationship w i th Japanf r o m the aspect as to whether or not we chose, by the steps we took, to become involved in the dispute which has resulted. The real matter for our consideration is that we were confronted with two unpleasant alternatives: first, that of losing the Ottawa Agreement, or prejudicing its renewal, aud, secondly, the preservation of the Ottawa Agreement even at the cost of our becoming involved in a dispute w i th Japan. We have to consider, not whether the second alternative is displeasing, but rather whether it was not the less unpleasant of these two alternatives. In matters of Government planning it is unavoidable that somebody should be hurt. Every nation to-day is_ practising, in accordance with its views, a method of national planning, and the acid test as to whether that planning is right or wrong is not whether it involves penalizing some individuals, or sections, of the community, but whether it is in the interests of the nation as a whole. That is the test the advantages and disadvantages in the I take it that the balance; and in my opinion the principle involved is calculated to advance the in terests of Australia as a whole. If this new principle may have prejudiced certain individuals, and certain interests, in our community, the obligation devolves upon the Government of compensating them for the disabilities which f a l l upon them as the result of national policy. ThatI shall be pleased to is only equity; and if the cost of such compensation proves to be unbearably heavy then that fact condemns the Government's whole plan and shows that it cannot stand the acid test as to whether it w ill further the well-being of the nation as a whole. I conclude by urging that this new policy should not be pursued in the future without careful scrutiny being kept as to its reaction upon important industries and sections of the community involved. The Government should make it quite clear, before this debate is concluded, that should the pursuance of this policy very seriously prejudice, for instance, the wool industry, it w ill compensate that industry, or alternatively, reverse its policy. Actuallyi t implements the In respect of-the dispute with JapanI reiterate my belief that the basis of duties in the relevant schedule is a basis fixed for purposes of negotiation.",21,Table Of Australian Exports To United Kingdom Of Some Important Commodities

62,Mr Moewen,"Yes, and I suggestSir have so far been inconclusive. I suggest that should it be proved impossible to reach finality with negotiations before the point, I warn the Government with regard House rises, the Government should then alter the tariff rates set out in this schedule from a basis for negotiation to a basis of actuality, perhaps adopting a combination of duty and quota control, which will enable us to regulate the importation of Japanese textiles i u the manner we desire. In .the event of such a development as I have indicated we should"" not have upon our statute-book a rate of duty against a foreign country which does not indicate the actual wishes of the Government. It should be a stated rate of duty which actually represents the wishes and desires of the Government, and gives the Government power to control the imports from that or any other country in such a manner as will meet the interests of the Australian nation as a whole. Mr E. J. HARBISON (Wentworth) [3.44] I have listened with interest to the statement made by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry -Gullett), to his remarks on the Government's trade diversion policy, when he touched lightly on our relationship with Japan and directed the attention of the House to the fact that, arising out of this trade diversion policy, it is proposed to produce in Australia a complete motor car, and to the case he made iu justification for the action taken by the Government in this direction. Like the Minister, I am a protectionist, and I am in complete accord with the general principle embodied in the Government's trade diversion policy, which aims at the diversion of trade to Australia from bad to good-customer countries, and also, if we can afford to pay the price, to Australian industries themselves. First of all let me say that I have no committee in that respect. He pointed intention of touching unduly upon the out the value of the Empire market to dispute with Japan, because I recognize Australia. I agree entirely with his rethat the Minister is placed in a very delimarks in that direction. The United cate position at the moment. AllI shall Kingdom market is of definite value to say in that respect at this juncture is Australia. The honourable member also that I wish him the best of luck in those touched upon Ottawa.

I to continue to preserve just as strong a feel sure that if the proposed Empire far, because I feel we may buy trade with Japan too dearly so far as the prestige of Australia generally is concerned. On that to its general trade relationships. It seems to me that at the moment we have adopted the attitude of the Irishman at the Donegal fair, who, wherever he saw a head, wanted to hit it. We have not only cut across our trade relations with the Empire aud our sister dominions, but we may, if we are not careful, also cut right across the British market of which we are so jealous, and which we value so highly. I have lively recollections of a debate which took place in this House regarding the Government's action concerning New Zealand in respect of the citrus embargo, and also the effect of steps taken by the Government in respect of Canada, another of our sister dominions. I have already expressed my opinion in respect of the trade dispute with Japan, but it is significant that at this juncture another head has appeared in the-Government's trading sphere, and we have cracked that; we have acted similarly in respect of another country which is regarded as one of the powers in the Pacific, a country to whicli we would look for aid in time of national danger. I mean that we have cut completely across the United States of America in this matter. Furthermore, if we 'continue our policy for the manufacture of complete motor cars in Australia we can cut right across the market of the United Kingdom. that in respect of all Australian industries in their period of establishment.

65,Able Member For Echuca ( Mr Mcewen),"defence scheme is related to the Government's present trade policy, the Ottawa agreement will not be dragged into this debate. It is incumbent on me, however, on behalf of the people of Australia, to point out to the Government that it is embarking on an experiment that may have far-reaching results. I shall quote figures in support of my contention in that respect. I would say that we have invoked Ottawa against Japan. We have pointed out that our effort in respect of Japan is to safeguard the Australian market for the British cotton goods manufacturing industry, and yet we have not taken similar action with regard to Canada and the United States of America in respect of motor cars. We do not intend to reserve the Australian market for British motor cars. The step has been taken to preserve it for our own manufactured article, thus giving the British manufacturers of motor cars a solid kick. In effect, we are excluding Japan in the interests of Manchester manufacturers and also excluding manufacturers of motor cars in the United States of America and Canada, not in the interests of the British motor car manufacturer, but because we wish to establish the motor car manufacturing industry in Australia. But we have not given sufficient thought to the economies of such a proposal. We do not possess an effective engineering background to enable us to apply our energies successfully in this direction. I u support of my contention I point out that last night the Minister said that we must have markets for our primary products, and that this action has been taken build arterial roads instead of railways, against the United States of America because that country cannot give us markets for such products. I quote his own words to him, and point out that we have a ready market in the United Kingdom, and that if we wish to preserve it AVC should take such measures as are necessary to give to the United Kingdom a fair share of the Australian market as provided for in the Ottawa agreement. The Minister, said that he could not conbut I propose to show that it is impossible ceive how an honourable member could support the Government's trade diversion policy, and not support a proposal for the manufacture of complete cars in Australia. I supported a trade diversion policy, believing that it Avould benefit the primary producers, and through them the manufacturers and the community generally, but I certainly did not understand by trade diversion that action might be taken to cut across one of our best markets, and even to close altogether such a valuable market as that mentioned by the honourable member for Echuca. Let us examine this proposal to manufacture cars in Australia, and try to get it in its proper perspective. We should understand, to begin with, that the development of Australia depends very largely upon the provision and maintenance of cheap transport, and it goes without saying that motor transport is cheaper than any other available in the world to-day. tralia, under present conditions. Mr E. J. HARRISON -In New South Wales, at the present time, motor transport is able to freight general cargo to the wharfs and dockyards for .68d., .as against an average of .88d. charged by the railways for farm products such as wheat. Even then the railways are able to get down to that figure only by charging, as much as 3d. on other commodities to make up the leeway. When we remember the reliance placed by primary producers on motor transport for carrying their produce from the farms along the subsidiary roads to the railway stations, or to the main highways, we are forced to the conclusion that motor transport is destined to play an increasingly important part in the development of Australia; that we must and that if we impose irksome restrictions upon motor transport, or make it impossible for the primary producers to buy motor vehicles except at prohibitive prices, we shall so retard development that Australia will be thrown back, in effect, to the pre-motor era. posed to do anything of the kind. Mr E. J. HARRISON I hope not, to manufacture motor cars in Australia, and sell them at a reasonable price. That is the whole point of my argument, and I stand or fall by it. The honourable member for Echuca related this proposal to",23,Heney Gullett Hear Hear Face In That Matter As He Has Presented So

67,Sir Henry Gullett,"It is not prothe question of defence, as also did the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr able to go into production on a big scale Street). I maintain that if we embark upon a national policy which has the effect of retarding development, or of confining it to those areas at present served by railways, there will not be much need to worry about defence because Australia will hardly be Avorth defending. As I have pointed out, it is essential that we should have cheap motor transport and low freight rates, but Australia, with its population of approximately 7,000,000, has a limited consumptive capacity. ""We have practically reached saturation point now in regard to the purchase of motor vehicles, and if the price were considerably increased the number of motor vehicles in use Avould decline. Another point is that Australia has no engineering background against which to build up a motor manufacturing industry. start the better. Mr E. J. HARRISON"" I agree with the honourable member up to a point, but remind him of'the old proverb that one must crawl before one Avalks. In this matter of the manufacture of. motor cars, it is desirable that we should first learn to crawl. Even in European countries, where the engineering trade is much more advanced and Avidely diffused than in Australia, experience has shoAvn that the manufacture of motor vehicles in small lots is not economic, and has led to increased costs and loss of profits. Sir Italy and Erance? ' Mr E. J. HARRISON I shall give some illustrations, and the Minister may investigate them. It should be remembered that Italy has a population of over 40,000,000, while just over its borders are have to purchase all the accessories which other thickly-populated countries, all of which furnish a potential market for its products. Australia, on the other hand, must sell all it produces within its own borders. Those European countries, including Italy, which have made a feature of the manufacture of motor vehicles, enjoyed at the outset the advantage of having in operation subsidiary engineering industries Avhich could be called upon for the manufacture of all those necessary accessories which go to the making of the complete oar. Those specialized industries were already in existence, and were as soon as the demand arose. Eor the most part, such industries do not exist in Australia, so that we should still have to import many of the accessories essential to the equipment of the complete car. [Quorum formed.} In these'matters, Ave must be guided by the experience of other countries. Recently, Germany embarked upon a policy of manufacturing all its OAvn motor cars, and among other firms engaged in the production of cars is the Eord Motor Car Company, which has erected a factory at a cost of 8,000,000 dollars, designed to produce 16,000 units a year. One would expect that, in a country like Germany, and in a factory operated by the Eord Motor Company, all accessories and requisites for the equipment of motor cars would be manufactured on the premises, but that is not so. The fact is that this company purchases from outside a great many car accessories. All the chassis frames and wheels, and all the castings and forgings are bought outside the factory. Let us examine the effect which this has had on the price of the completed Aehicles. r [Quorum formed.} It is a great pity when a discussion which has relation to the establishment of the motor industry in Australia, which may employ many thousands of the people whom members of the Labour party claim to represent, that those honourable members deliberately leaAe the House and refuse to r take part in the discussion leaving only the time of the committee by constantly calling for quorums. We find that under the conditions which obtain in Australia, we should go to make up the complete motor carelectrical equipment, steering columns, clutches, stampings, castings, &c -as they do in the United States of America and Canada, from independent manufacturers. The same conditions would operate in Australia, as to-day operate in Germany. The Ford VS sedan which costs approximately £355 in Australia, costs in Germany £594 in Australian currency or 5,800 marks. It seems to me that that is a fair comparison to draw if we lay down a plant in a similar manner",24,Heney Gullett Hear Hear Face In That Matter As He Has Presented So
68,Mr Holloway,"Then the sooner AveTariff to the plant which was laid down in Germany for the manufacture and assembly of Ford cars. We should look with horror if, because of the establishment of the motor industry in Australia, we were forced to pay a price comparable to the price charged in Germany as the result of the establishment in that country of the motor car industry. Moreover, in Germany, there is a definite choice of varieties and designs, and there is greater competition than there could ever be in Australia with, as shown by the Minister, the industry in the hands of two or three firms. To place an industry like this in the hands of two or three manufacturers would cut out all competition and create a monopoly. I wonder what tlie honourable member for Riverina( Mr aware of other opinions than those Nock) would be able to say to those whom he represents, if all the tractors and transdepartment. port vehicles which convey wheat and the like to the railway sidings cost ever so much more than they do now. Perhaps he would say that it was fair game to expect the taxpayer in the cities to contribute an increased bounty on production to offset the increased costs of production. At any rate, he would have something to answer for if the institution of the motor car industry in this country led, as it undoubtedly would lead, to increased production costs for the man on the land. Sir ridiculous. Mr E. J. HARRISON -The Minister no doubt will reply later. I hope he does. member knows that I shall have no opportunity to reply. Mr E. J. HARRISON -The Eord Company is engaged in the production of motor vehicles in Canada. . I take the Eord Company as an example because, I look on it as one of the most progressive companies engaged in the manufacture of motor vehicles and in engineering generally in the worldI t is not a pocket industry, it has access to finance to a remarkable extent and it engages in production on lines of the greatest efficiency. The Ford Company in Canada is producing 400 units a day under a protective duty of 17£ per [SO] [25 NOVEMBER, 1936.] Proposals 1935-36. 2281 cent., against foreign countries, even against the American manufacturers across the river, who are producing 8,000 units a day. Yet, the Canadian company has shown no profits over the last six years. I have already cited the cost to the motor users in consequence of the establishment of the Ford factory in Germany. The Canadian activities of this company also prove my contention that the Minister must give this matter greater thought before he does something that may react to the detriment of the Australian nation generally. If this question is wrapped up in the matter of defence, I have little to say, but even so, the Minister should be made which he has received, possibly from his source of the honourable member's opinion? Mr E. J. HARRISON -It is an official source. the committee the exact nature of the source ? Mr E. J. HARRISON -A HI need say, is that my source of information is official. I am pointing out to the Minister that the fact that even an industry of such immense capacity as the it economic to manufacture its own chassis frames, should give him cause for thought. It purchases its requirements from specialists, so that it will get the advantage of mass production. I put it to the committee that the many millions of frames produced by the manufacturers overseas are able to find a market, and that the quantity of the output is so great that costs of production are less than they would be if the output were smaller. In Australia, however, the cost of manufacturing chassis frame 11 would be exorbitant. Eveni f orders tyathe frames were placed overseas tney would amount to a few thousand only, compared with the millions of frames that are produced and sold in the United States of America, and accordingly, the price would again be high.

On a former occasion I have shown that deliveries have been six or seven months overdue. When an industry reaches such a stage as that, it presents a f a i r example of what tariff enactments can do to produce monopolies in industries which are not economic. I support my statement by saying that one firm, namely, Richards, in the year ended the 30th June, 1936, showed a net profit of approximately 74 per cent, over the total paid-up capital. is a f a i r example of a monopoly exploiting the public.

We have Has the honourable member for Melbourne not the engineering background requisite for this work, nor have Ave the skilled artisans necessary for it. We shall have to go through a period of trial and error with regard to both workmen and plant before Ave can expect to produce satisfactory motor chassis, engines, and accessories. We cannot expect to be able to embark upon this huge enterprise almost overnight. We must face the prospect of a period of trial and error over a number of years. Until Ave get through this required to pay heavily for all they buy. The Minister says that, as we can now produce 80 per cent, of the finished motor vehicle, Ave should be able to produce the full 100 per cent., but I suggest to him that to establish a factory in Australia to produce even 10,000 units would require a capital expenditure of more than £4,000,000 on plant. Eveni f such a plant Avere established I seriously question whether we should be able to produce a car at the cost suggested by the Minister. If such huge manufacturing concerns as the Eord Motor Company still find it necessary to purchase substantial supplies of accessories from outside consider producing the complete motor Excluding all car in Australia at a price which our people will be able to pay for it. In my opinion any method that we can adopt to manufacture motor cars in Australia will involve such heavy costs for subsidiary requirements, the re-assembling parts obtained from various sources, and freights and other charges, that the ultimate cost to the purchaser of the finished article must inevitably be exorbitant.

HARRISON the fact that even if we established the motor car manufacturing industry in Australia, we should still be required to purchase certain parts abroad, and, further, that it would not be possible for us to produce required accessories on a commercial basis, I submit that the whole proposition requires review. The motor car manufacturers of the United States of America regard the sale of replacements as an important element in their business. Australia could not possibly contemplate the manufacture of replacements and spare parts on a commercial basis. This is a further difficulty which, undoubtedly, must be faced frankly. The Minister has stated that, because 4,780 complete internal combustion engines, 80 per cent, of which are petrol engines of small horse-power, are being manufactured in Australia, it would be possible for us to undertake the manufacture of 74,000. units of high power. The honourable gentleman must realize, however, that the manufacture of diesel engines and small pumping engines is on an entirely different footing from that of motor car engines. The diesel engines of the type being made in Australia are not extensively used throughout the world, and so are not made by mass-production methods. sideration. Some interesting information was published in the United States of Americai n May, 1936, on the problem of manufacturing costs. sired information regarding mass-production facilities. He has revealed that, in his discussions with Mr WalterP . I offer no objection. Chrysler, he asked how much more it I rise to a point of would cost that producer to build a car selling at 600 dollars in a local wellequipped machine shop instead of in a mass-production plant. Mr Chrysler estimated that the price would be about six times that of a car produced by mass production. Let us look at the possible effect on the purchaser. W ill he be treated fairly? I s he regarded as of any account when prices are being determined? These are factors that must be taken into consideration. To say that we can produce as cheaply as we can purchase overseas, is nonsense. Prior to the latest alterations of duties, a car selling at £125 overseas was sold in Australia In view of for £350. Let us consider the price which the purchaser is paying for the privilege of having bodies built in Australia. On the basis of 74,000 units-the figures for 1935-the difference, comparing local production with importation duty free, is £16,000,000. I am not advocating duty free imports, and am merely emphasizing the need for calling a halt to the imposition of added costs which, in the case of the motor body-building industry, represent the figure I have given. Those who have investigated the matter estimate that cars produced in Australia would cost approximately £100 more than the present selling price. people manufacturing now? MrE . J . HARRISON In Europe, Canada, and many other countries. If this £100 be added to the selling price of cars in Australia, on the basis of 74.000 units the additional cost to the Australian people would be approximately £23,000,000.

The general experience in all industries is that increases of prices kill the market value. In this regard, I shall quote from an authoritative circular a copy of which has been sent to all honourable members. It proves that sales of cars in Australia have decreased as the result of the recent increase of duty, and gives a fair indication of what is likely to happen in the future. It saysA serious recession in trade started at the end of the second quarter of 1936, and the third quarter of 1930 ended with a drop in sales of 2,613. I wonder if honourable members realize the effect upon the industry generally, particularly in connection with the supply of accessories such as bumper bars, batteries, tyres, leather, and glass? One of the big manufacturers has supplied the Minister with information which shows that nearly 1,000 hands have lost their employment. gentleman cannot "" laugh off "" a fact of that sort. Such figures speak volumes in regard to the effect of high prices on the consumptive capacity of the Australian market. referred to the fact that 20 per cent, of a car represents imports. That is a loose statement which challenges contradiction. Really, 80 per cent, of the selling price of a car is retained in Australia-a n entirely different matter. That includes customs duties and profits. I have supported the trade diversion policy of the Government because I believed that trade would be diverted to better customer countries, thereby preserving markets that we are most desirous of retaining for the benefit of our export industries; but in this venture I can only see the forging of a weapon in the sacrificial fires of the Australian people, to be used against us by Empire countries when we seek the renewal of our trade agreements with them. I qualify that by saying that, if the Minister will assure us that the action of the Government is dictated by considerations of reaction in the nature of the withdrawal of concessions at the next Imperial conference, much of the criticism that has been levelled against it will be withdrawn.

Prior to the war, the diffifind evidence of worse conditions in culty which now confronts Great Britain and Australia by reason of the serious Japanese competition confronted the British people, the cause then being the serious competition from Germany. In those days, as an industrial officer, I sought information dealindustry. ing with social and industrial activities all over the world. When Germany led the world in industrial competition, and flooded the world with it3 goods, the social conditions of its people were in every way the highest in the world. Mr with secondary industry in all counTate, the Director of Education in Victoria, was sent abroad to investigate tin, education systems of every country. I was a member of the Victorian Council of Education, and thus had complete knowledge of what was being done. Other members with whom I was associated went abroad to examine the industrial conditions of Germany-wages , hours, social services, insurance against accident, welfare schemes, and such like. do not think that any one will contradict me when I say that the wages, housing, health, dental, medical, and educational services of the German people ranked in the first place among the nations of the world at that time. Yet Germany was able to lead the world in industrial competition. It will be remembered that every country was being easily beaten in competition by German industrialists. It could not be said then, and it cannot be said now, that those goods were produced by cheap labour. BecauseI know this, and because it has been part of my life's work to study such matters, I am not prepared to believe that the success which has attended Japan's economic competition is based upon cheap labour. I am sure that that is an absolute fallacy. than that. In fact, the social and industrial conditions of the city workers of Japan, both male and female, have improved during the last twenty years at a more rapid rate than have those of any other country. way to go. shall qualify my statements as I proceed, but we need not go back many decades to Great Britain. I know of conditions operating in Australia to-day which are very little worse than the honourable member for Echuca suggests are operating at the present time in. Japan. our boot factories, clothing factories, and Tope and cordage factories, &c. It has been my duty to be associated tries of the world. I regularly correspond with trade unions in Japan, and I know something about the conditions under which employees work there. Cheap labour is not the trouble. I am desirous of seeing that the workers of Australia are in a position to compete with Japanese goods, while safeguarding their conditions against the onslaughts of the keenest industrial conditions in any I country. I am not putting these views before honourable members because I am pro-Japanese or anti-Australian; I do not think that any honourable member would suggest that; but I assert that it is not right to say that Japanese textiles can be imported into Australia so cheaply compared with the price of British textiles, because of the cheap labour available in Japan. Indeed, I suggest that, if the wages portion of the cost of production of textiles in both Japan and Great Britain were carefully investigated, it would be found that it plays a very little part in the total cost of production. Bigger items than the cost of labour influence the selling price of the goods of either country. The honourable member for Wentworth said that Australia had no engineering background: A thing is The matter goes much deeper not necessarily good because it is old. If that were so, Great Britain, which was regarded as the workshop of the world some 50 years ago, and had a monopoly of ship-building and all engineering operations, would still retain its former position in those trades.",31,Henry Gullett Tha T German Empire Defence And That There Will Be No

Only a few years ago Great Britain feared no one in competition. It was truly the workshop of the world; but, since then, it has drifted. Other countries have arisen to compete with it in secondary industry. The truth is that persons, nations or groups who are the last to enter an industry are the most efficient, because they should have at their disposal the experience of the past, the latest machines, and the most efficient modern and scientific methods. They have been able to disregard out-ofdate methods, and therefore they should be the best equipped to meet competition. It is for this reason that younger countries can now beat older countries in industry, and that Japan is fully equipped to meet the competition of Britain, the United States of America, or any other country. In Japan one will not find a machine ten years old, or a factory built 50 years ago, ment and the people of Australia, if a or manufacturers remodelling factories in a vain endeavour to make them up to date with a view to avoiding the cost of modern equipment; One will not find in Japan a conglomeration of wheels and pulleys re-erected in an endeavour to make plants up to date so that the scrapping of old plant and the purchase of modern machinery may be avoided. The real reason why Great Britain cannot compete with Japan to-day is because Great Britain is still carrying on with plant With which it beat its competitors throughout the world 50 years ago, but which, being obsolete, no longer enables it to do so. altogether correct. that my statement is 100 per cent, correct, but, generally speaking, Great Britain has not progressed as rapidly as countries which have entered the manufacturing field in recent years. It is always difficult to get a manufacturer to scrap his existing plant with a view to putting in a modern plant. Sometimes he cannot do so because of the amount of capital sunk in the old plant. A newer nation is not confronted with that difficulty. It starts off scratch, and thus secures an immense start on manufacturers in other countries who have been engaged in an industry for the last 50 or 100 years. That is the main reason why Japan can more than hold its own against Great Britain to-day. In making these statements, I am not anti-British. The fact is that the British manufacturer has been so accustomed to handling a big turnover with his almost obsolete plant,.that he expects to be able to continue doing so. Mr E. J. HARRISON -The honourable member does not want to 'be considered un-British, but when he makes statements of that kind he runs such a risk. down to the root of the matter; the honourable member touched only the branches. There are reasons other than eheap labour for the low cost of production in secondary industries in a new country like Japan. It would pay the Governdelegation of men and women were sent to Japan Or any other modern industrialized country, to see how production is carried on in advanced countries. It would pay the Tariff Board and the Minister to facilitate such a visit by honourable members. We could then see conditions as they actually exist in those countries and could then map out a progressive plan for our own 'benefit. It may be said that an Australian delegation has already visited Japan, but that delegation did not investigate factory operations or engineering workshops. Reverting to the contention of the honourable member for Wentworth, that we is not have no engineering background, I recall that I have been through many engineering workshops in European countries, I have watched Frenchmen tearing submarines to pieces; I have seen transport workers on their job in Marseilles and other ports; I have observed factory workers in Great Britain and dairy-farmers in Switzerland.

99,Mr Holloway,"I desire to getraw material-the labour employedexceeded the raw material we have in Australia. I do not believe in boasting about my country, but I am as certain as I am standing here that Australian workmen, given suitable opportunity, are just as efficient as, or at any rate can make themselves equal to, artisans in any other country. about that. I discussed this matter with Mr Innes, who supervised the building of the Sydney harbour bridge, and when I asked him if he were satisfied with the pace, technique and efficiency of the men who carried out that work, he replied that he had never had men under him on a responsible work who so quickly fitted themselves for jobs which they had never done 'before, as did the men who built that take up an obstinate, ironclad attitude on bridge. In view of these facts, no honourable member is justified in saying that we have no engineering background, nor are we justified in holding premature post mortems on proposals of this kind. I contend that we should build motor car engines in Australia. I remember when it was contended that we could not build aeroplanes in this country, and that we would therefore have to depend upon those produced in the United States of America. I recall one occasion, on which I approached the Minister for Defence and persuaded him to engage Australian workmen in the construction of planes, now old-fashioned, 'but still in use at Essendon. There is no doubt that Australian workmen can build motor and aeroplane engines and ships. I also recall an occasion when a firm in Melbourne was persuaded to build sets of cogs for racing motor cars. These parts had to be perfect, and had to pass severe speed in this industry, but were fleecing tests by the Studebaker people. They were made by Australian workmen and proved most efficient. Furthermore, they were sold, at a price 10 per cent, below the cost of the same articles from America. Forthwith, the American manufacturers cut their prices by another 10 per cent., and put this firm off ""the market. The late Mr Pratten was the Minister for Trade and Customs at that time, and I remember discussing this matter with him as a member of a deputation. We can do these things if we get a chance. My only difference with the Minister directing negotiations for* trade treaties, is that he has chopped off the imports from America too suddenly. This action should have been taken according to a long-range plan. The important point -and I think all honourable members are agreed on it-is that Australia should stand on its feet as a producer in the great iron and metal industries. Years ago, in I have no doubt the course of a debate on the Government's defence policy, I contended that this was a basic principle of any effective defence scheme for Australia. I cannot understand how any honourable member could oppose this policy; it is a real Australian policy. I .believe that the honourable member for Wentworth will agree with me in that respect. I do not hold the view that the Government would this subject. Should there continue in the immediate'future to be a demand for American cars -British cars, generally speaking, are unsuitable for Australian roads-hee d should be paid to it, for no doubt when we commence the production of motor cars in Australia, we shall still be behind American manufacturers, but the point I want to make is that we should immediately commence building our own engines and chassis as we have already commenced building motor bodies. The honourable member for Wentworth contended that we could not construct motor engines economically in Australia. We may not be able to do so for the first year or two, but if we are going to do it at all, we must make a start at some time. In endeavouring to prove his point in this respect, the honourable member showed how manufacturers of motor bodies in Australia have been successful Australian purchasers by making two or three times a legitimate profit.. In some of our largest showrooms, experts have examined motor bodies made by Buskins which were not nearly so good as the bodies turned out by this firm and others to-day, and those experts have said that those bodies, keeping in rnind the price ranges, were equal to comparable bodies manufactured in the United States of America. cost ? tralian-built bodies cost a little more, but",33,Henry Gullett Tha T German Empire Defence And That There Will Be No
100,Mr Gregory,But what about the,34,Henry Gullett Tha T German Empire Defence And That There Will Be No
101,Mr Holloway,"Of course, Austhe real reason for that fact was given this afternoon by the honourable member for out that exorbitant profits were being made by the monopolistic motor body-building firms in this country. If the only fault we can find with these bodies is that they cost a little extra, surely the honourable member has sufficient confidence in members of his own party or in the statesmanship of all honourable members combined, to find ways and means to protect the public against exploitation of that kind. Surely we are not going to abandon the idea of manufacturing motor cars in Australia ""because we fear the possibility of such -exploitation. That argument is lop-sided. The Government surely can meet that -difficulty if it wishes to do so. The important thing at the moment is to lay down the necessary plants and to commence making cars in Australia. The most delicate aspect of this debate is our association with Japan. I hope, and I am certain, that the Minister will eventually arrive at an arrangement with that country mutually beneficial to the Japanese and ourselves. I believe that everybody wishes to see these negotiations succeed. people. I have had the pleasure of interviewing Japanese experts who were seni along to the Melbourne Trades Hall by the Chamber of Manufactures to secure from myself and other trade union officials particulars as to industrial agreeproprietors of business colleges, and will ments, rules or organization in industry, welfare schemes and the like, with the object of initiating those schemes in factories in Tokyo, Osaka and other big cities of Japan.

This cannot be denied; I wish it in any other part of the world, they would be found, mentally and physically, ""Wentworth, when he pointed to be superior. beat the Australians? equal to them, at any rate. It is true that Japanese workers receive a very small wage, but they get all the food they require, and all the air and floor space in the factories which the experts determine. In addition, hot and cold water is laid on, and they receive free medical and dental attention. Mr E. J. HABBISON -Does not the honourable member know that these amenities are provided in many of the big factories in Australia? in some factories, but before this session closes I propose to bring before the House facts which will show that, in Victoria, girls and boys are working in factories for ten hours a day, under conditions which violate the requirements of the Shops and Factories Act in regard to ventilation, space and protection against fire. Moreover, in some of those factories, three or four times as many juveniles are employed in proportion to I have met many Japanese adults as is permitted by the regulations.

Japan is able to compete successfully against B r it a in for other reasons than that of cheap labour; that is an unimportant factor.

Their factories and plant are modern and efficient, to the last degree, which those of GreatB r it a in and Australia, frequently are not. Sir British spirit runs right through the speeches of members of the Opposition. of me. Because of these conditions which prevail in Great Britain, and which tend to increase the price of British products, Australian manufacturers who use those products in their own factories must, in turn, put up the price of their own products. Another point is that some British firms import goods from Japan, and then sell them to Australia as their own manufacture, thus getting the benefit of the British preferential duty. This sort of thing was done extensively before the war, only at that time the British firms obtained supplies from Germany. Goods manufactured in Essen, and elsewhere in Germany, were brought to B i rmingham, repacked and sold to Australia as British goods. When the war broke out, and we could no longer get goods of that kind from GreatB r it a in , we learned that they had, all along, been made in Germany. A t the present time, laces, velveteens, & c , are being imported from Japan into Great Britain, and reshipped to Australia as British goods so as to get the benefit of the preferential tariff rates. That is not right.

It is a fact that Japanese goods, which can no longer be imported from Japan, are still coming to Australia fro m Groat Britain. Japanese speech. tention to make it so. As I have said, I desire, first, protection for Australian industry, and then preference to British industry, but I am not in favour ofmaking our people pay from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, more for the goods which we must import, merely in order to provide greater profits for the British exporters. Let us manufacture the commodities in our own land and thus avoid the necessity for granting preferences toother countries. When the Government introduced thisschedule in May last, it came as a bombshell to me, and to many other honourable members also.

The Government did not submit any of these proposals to the Tariff Board, nor did it discuss them w i th its own supporters in this House. I have been, in the past, and am still, favorable to the principle of reciprocal trade, and the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) has also expressed himself very definitely on the same question.. A few years ago, he made a declaration of policy which is diametrically opposed to the policy for which he is now accepting responsibility. A t that time. I agreed with h i m ; I disagree with him now. That cannot be charged against me as an offence. I cannot be expected to change my mind every time the Minister changes' his. He saidOur tariff policy has been such as to invite retaliation from, those countries whicli buy our wool. We have received a plain, and, I think, a proper ultimatum from Belgium. When this statement was quoted against him the other day, he said that times had changed, but a principle of this kind neither time nor circumstances can change. In another statement he saidThere is a danger of carrying to extreme lengths this action against the United States of America or any other country. There is only one attitude to adopt, and that is to consider the balance of trade with all countries. it were possible T. should subscribe to that to-day. made that statement, I was able to say, ""Hear, hear!"", but I cannot applaud his present policy. If the Government felt that, as part of our national policy, it should embark upon a scheme of trade diversion, it should have submitted its proposals to this Parliament. Minister should realize that the individual members of this Parliament also have responsibilities to the people, and that they should have been taken into the Government's confidence before this sweeping change was made. Sir HENRYGULLETT T h is matter was discussed in this chamber on a motion for the adjournment which was moved by the honourable member for Flinders( MrF a i r b a i r n ). should look up what he said on that occasion. I have already done so. Sir HENRYGULLETT I said then that we were going to take this step, and we have taken it . The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Nock) -Order! The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) has the call. ment has taken the b it in its teeth, and has taken this step without having taken honourable members into its confidence, one is justified in expressing, regardless of consequences, the opinion that at least the Minister has been inconsistent. In all the months that have passed since the policy was introduced, I have held my tongue, notwithstanding the fact that the policy cuts right across my political principles. This Government isjan Australian Government, and, consequently, a British Government, and I felt that, even if it had made a blunder, I had to stand behind it and keep silent; but I do hope that, even yet, the mistake which it has made w i ll be capable of rectification. As a matter of fact, I feel that it can be rectified, and I should have had more to say if the negotiations with Japan had been completed. The Government can thank its lucky star that the price of wool not only has been maintained but also has improved. Sir HENRYGULLETT T h a t was foreseen. I declare that the Minister can take no credit whatever for the maintenance of the price of wool. When this policy was embarked upon, there was no surplus r wool in the world. The demand for wool to-day is due not only to that fact, but. also to the fact that the League of The Nations has completely failed in its efforts to achieve world disarmament, and the nations of the world have indiscriminately started to re-arm. Many of them have been compelled to re-uniform their armed forces, and wool is an essential ingredient of military uniforms. Germany, for instance, is seeking by every means possible, to obtain supplies of wool.

It must be remembered that a huge proportion of the wool formerly bought by Japan from Australia was used in Japan, and that only a small proportion of it came back to Australia or the world's markets in the shape of manufactured articles to be sold in competition with Australian or British manufacturers. The Government must have realized, when it embarked on this policy, that it was highly desirable in the interests of the greatest of all Australian industriesI refer of course to the wool industry-that Japan should continue to purchase its requirements of wool from this country, and not be forced into the use of artificial fibres instance, they should realize that or other materials in the manufacture of clothing.

I think that that matter should have been submitted to the Tariff Board in May last. Before the people are encouraged to hope that the motor industry can be established in this country, they should first be advised by the Tariff Board as to whether it is possible economically to do so. opposed to the Australian manufacture' of motor cars! manufacturing anything in Australia if its manufacture will be of benefit to the community and if its cost will be within the ability of the community to pay. Honourable members should look dispassionately at certain facts. For the price of a Ford motor car is £104 in the United States of America, £225. in England, and £355 in Australia. Therefore, the Australian price of a Ford car is more than three times the American price. Moreover, the price of petrol in this country is three times as great as in the United 'States of America. The bodies of these cars are built in this country; yet the Australian public is called upon to pay three times as much for them as the American public is called upon to pay. With that fact in view I ask honourable members to estimate what additional cost will be entailed if the complete cars are made in Australia. Honourable members must realize that it will 'be impossible at least for a generation, to engage in the economic production of motor vehicles in this country, where transport is an important factor in production.' member says the same things about all new Australian enterprises. what I am about to show is what will happen; and I ask honourable members to cut a nick in the post and to mark my words so that they will know whether or not my contentions are borne out.

133,Mr Prowse,"Whethe r I have saiddone so. Tlie Government will lose tariff revenue on every car that is built in Australia. In addition it will have to provide a bounty of £30 on each engine. It has been estimated, however, that a bounty of £90 a unit will be necessary and, therefore, the public will have to supply the deficiency and will have to pay more for their motor cars than they are at present paying. There is no other conincrease of tariff has resulted in a declusion that can be reached. Eveni f the Australian people are given a choice of only two types of cars-on e high-powered and the other low-powered-ther e cannot be the same amount of mass production as in countries which have a much greater market. Therefore, before committing ourselves to the inevitable trouble which accompanies the setting up of new vested interests in a country, we should give deep consideration to every aspect of the situation through the Tariff Board. The Government has had the example of what happened when the Scullin Government introduced its policy of embargoes. I do not intend to reflect upon what that Government did, but the Minister opposed its policy which, the Government claimed, would increase employment. against it. ber for Capricornia ( Mr Forde), on every occasion when he tabled a tariff schedule, promised Parliament that as the result of his action employment figures would rise-h y 1,500 in one industry, by 500 in another, and so on. Far from increasing employment, however, the Scullin Government's policy resulted in increased unemployment. It resulted in other nations closing their doors to our products by means of retaliatory tariffs. A further result was that the Scullin Government lost £20,000,000 a year of customs revenue, and to make up the deficit it had to impose the obnoxious sales tax and primage duties and to increase the income tax by 20 per cent. At this juncture when the population of Australia is small in comparison with that of other countries in which the commercial manufacture of motor vehicles is thriving, to embark upon the establishment of an Australian motor vehicle industry must be disadvantageous to Australia-and to Australian workmen. ' The Minister is repeating the prophecies of the honourable member for Capricornia when he was Minister for Trade and Customs. He declares that employment in Australia will be increased by the establishment of the motor industry, but I think that his forecasts willhave the same fate as those of the honourable member for Capricornia. Every crease of employment in this country, and the action that has been taken up to the present by this Government is surprising, in view of its laudable action in reducing the duties imposed by the Scullin Government and so putting it in .a position to make a substantial reduction of the sales tax, to take 30 per cent, off the income tax, and to obtain greater revenues from reduced customs duties. Its ]3olicy also reduced unemployment. The public has undoubtedly benefited by reason of the administration of this Government. As I supported the Ministry at that time, I should not now be denied the right to criticize it seeing that it has reversed its policy. versed its policy? of the Government will undoubtedly dislocate our state of normality, and allow the profiteers a free hand. ment had not done what it did at the time it did it, Australia would have defaulted.

If he does so, he w ill see that he contemplated regulation by the financial exigencies of the situation as well as by the tariff policy which his Government adopted. Unfortunately, the right honourable gentleman took the wrong turning. statement, I was combating the argument that the financial exigencies would meet the circumstances of the case. My contention was that before they could do so the country would default. that a government w it h an exclusive and high protectionist policy was succeeded by a government with a different tariff policy. I do not suppose that the right honourable member for Y a r ra would deny that Australia at the time to which I am referring had the highest protective duties in the world. The Scullin Government determined to operate a policy of exclusion. In effect, it said, "" We w ill make for ourselves everything that we need, and this w ill result in additional employment for our people "" . That idea was clearly enunciated in the speeches delivered by the honourable member for Capricornia, who was then Ministerf o r Trade and Customs. There certainly was a depression at the time, but it was caused by reason of the decreased value of our export commodities. Had the values of our export commodities been maintained, Australia would have experienced no depression. Actually the depression was caused by a f a l l of about £100.000,000 a year in our national i ncome clue to the heavy decline in the price of primary products. there was that much less money available for expenditure by the people on the products of our secondary industries. The farmers were unable to continue buying our manufactured goods because they and other producers were receiving an aggregate income of £100,000,000 less than formerly.

Confidence was to some extent restored. The improvement was not caused by the in creased price of our export commodities, although that helped to some extent. The main cause of the improvement was the reversal of the tariff policy of the Government. In consequence of the improved conditions generally, the Government was able to reduce taxation. The secondary industries were required 'by force of circumstances to scratch gravel a little, and the prices of manufactured goods fell. The primary producers then found themselves able to buy a little more freely than formerly. Imports also began to come into Australia, and the customs revenue lif ted with the result that the Government had money to spend on works of one kind and another. It was also able to reduce the sales tax, the primage duty, and certain direct taxes. The partial restoration of salary reductions also had a good effect. This was all due to the variation of the tariff policy. reasons for it . served great credit for what was done during that period. I stood by it and helped to make the new policy effective.

157,Mr Prowse,"Douglas fir timberis used, of course, on most government jobs. In the circumstances, the price of it should be kept at the lowest possible figure. I regret that in consequence of the change of government policy this timber is now brought into Australia sawn, whereas formerly it was brought here in logs. I hope that further consideration will be given to the Tariff Board's report on this subject. I represent probably the most important hardwood timber constituency in the Commonwealth, and I have no hesitation in saying that the adoption of the board's report would not be disadvantageous to eur hardwood industry. grown in commercial quantities in Australia only in Queensland, and a royalty is demanded in that State on all sales. Therefore. Australia wants soft woods and other countries want hardwoods. Why can we not exhibit a natural reciprocal spirit in this matter, such as was recommended in other days by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties? Reciprocation would be of distinct advantage to both countries. I hope that the Government will not adhere to the idea of disregarding the report of the Tariff Board. ing last night to the speech of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett), one experienced difficulty in reconciling the different attitudes of the Government. The honourable member for ""Forrest( Mr favorable balance with the United States Prowse) has directed attention to variations of the attitude of the Minister over a certain period. Last night the honourable gentleman adopted two different attitudes on this one issue; while he spoke of America. For the year 1934-35, the of trade diversion, he religiously refrained from dealing with the Japanese position. reason. man endeavoured to sustain his argument by pointing to the effect which our trade position with the United States of America has on our balance of trade generally. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has shown, the Government has been rather carefree in its handling of this matter ever since it has been in power. Persistent reductions of duties have accentuated the unfavorable condition of our trade balance. In 1932,-33 the total value of our imports was £44,000,000. The value increased to £56,000,000 in 1933-34, and then rose to tlie phenomenal figure of £83,000,000 in 1935-36. The Leader of the Opposition also pointed out that, after allowing this drift, although the Government is not prepared to protect the Australian cement industry against British competition, it is now endeavouring to provide a market for the Manchester textile interests, to the detriment of the Australian industry. The Minister Softwood is directing negotiations for trade treaties saidThe Government was subscribing to tiie absolute necessity of maintaining a sufficient margin in the value of our exports over the value of our imports to place the meeting of our overseas obligations beyond question. Whatever justification there was for such action in the case of the United States of America, there was none for the action taken against Japan. During the last five years Australia imported from the United States of America goods to the value of £48,000,000, and exported to that country goods to the value of £11,000,000, a difference of £37,000,000. During the same period, the imports of goods from Japan were valued at £19,000,000, and the value of our exports to Japan was £57,700,000, a difference of £38,700,000. Therefore, the favorable balance with Japan counteracted the unof America. The Government must also be aware that this year there has been an improvement of the trade position between Australia and the United States value of our imports from that country was £11,000,000, and the value of our exports to that country was £2,200,000, an unfavorable balance of £S,S00,0OO. For the year 1935-36 the figures were respectively £13,900,000 and £7,465,000, leaving an unfavorable balance of £6,400,000. It will thus be seen that the United States of America has become a better customer of Australia to the extent of about £2,400,000. Comparing 1936 with 1935, the imports increased by 27 per cent, whereas the exports to America increased by 236 per cent.

Although the United States of America may not purchase direct from Australia a great deal of its requirements of wool, it obtains a substantial quantity of our product from Great Britain in both the raw and the manufactured state. Last year, its imports of this commodity were 198,000,000 lb., and I understand that they are likely to be even larger this United States of America 28.3 per cent, year. Even if that were not Australian wool, the purchase of it must have had the effect of increasing the price paid for room for substantial improvement of the what we jiroduced. No person in business would offend his second best customer; yet the Government has done so. It has been stated that the object was to increase our sales of primary products to Great Britain; but the Government has produced no figures to show that our exports to that market have since materially increased. Eor the years 1934 to 1936, the United Kingdom had an adverse trade balance with the United States of America of £190,000,000, and has taken no action to deal with it. The Government has made an arrangement with Belgium in regard to barley, and claims that this will be of considerable advantage to Australia. I point out, however, that compared with other nations Belgium is a small buyer of Australian ducts. of barley into the United dom from the United States of America totalled 3,000,000 cwt., which represented 17.3 per cent, of its total imports of that commodity, while only 723,000 cwt., or 3.7 per cent, of the total, Avas imported from Australia. If Great Britain expects from Australia further favours by way of trade concessions, it should be prepared to buy more from Australia and less from America, particularly in view of its adverse balance of £190,000,000 with the Mr Clark. America has placed United States tof America. Australia having prohibited certain imports from the United States of America, Great Britain should be prepared to act similarly. The imports of apples into the United Kingdom from the United States of America in 1935-36 represented 33 per cent, of the total, whereas only 22.3 per cent, was imported from Australia. The same thing applies to pears and other fruits; 39.7 per cent, of Great Britain's total imports has offended another cusof pears was procured from the United States of America, and only 17.6 per cent, from Australia. The dried fruits industry is of vital concern to Australia because it provides a good deal of employment and is expanding to an appreciable extent. It cannot be said that raisins are a seasonable commodity; they can be exported and imported at any period of the year. Great Britain imports from the of its total requirements, while from Australia it imports only 25.8 per cent. I quote these figures to prove that there is trading position between Australia and Great Britain. On the 11th March last, the Leader of the Opposition moved a motion of censure on the Government for its failure to take action to safeguard the overseas trade balance. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and other Government speakers, after treating the House to a long dissertation on the actual figures, argued that the position did not call for any sudden or drastic action by either the Government or the Parliament. Two months later the Government took action which not only seriously affected our trade balance generally, but also resulted in the loss of one of our best customers. I prosuggest that this action was not taken In 1935-36, the imports with the object of improving our trade Kingbalance, because we now find ourselves in a worse position than previously. Last night the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties said 1 We have therefore excluded from the diversion policy in the first place, all good customer countries, and in the second place tliose countries which presented little or no opportunity for the diversion of trade we had iu view. I find it difficult to understand what the Minister meant by "" excluding all good customer countries "". His remarks were intended to apply to the United States of America, as well as to Japan, and while the United States of America is one of our fast improving customer countries we have a favorable balance with Japan. tude in this respect, I submit, is contra.dictory. The Minister also saidIf we wish to increase our exports to those countries . . . we must . . . be prepared to give them a reasonable measure of our custom in return. There can be no doubt that, prior to the present dispute, our trade balance with Japan was favorable, and that Japan was one of our best customers. The Government, therefore, should not have offended that country. The Government's policy has seriously affected the wool industry. As I have pointed out in previous speeches in this House, I know, as the result of inquiries I have made in the electorate I represent, that those engaged in this industry very much resent this policy. As late as lastweek, the graziers at Coonamble, one of the big wool-growing centres in New South ""Wales, held a meeting at which the secretary of the Wool growers Association, Mr J. W. Allen, saidThere is every reason to believe that considerably higher prices would have been secured if there had been competition from Japan, so that wool-growers believe that they have been called upon to bear considerable loss on account of the policy which has been put forward by the Government. I have no doubt that normally Mr Allen would be a supporter of this Government and, I suppose, he still is. Yet he has stated that the wool-growers, as a whole, are very dissatisfied with the Government's policy. The meeting at Coonamble carried the following resolution:That this meeting deplores the present dislocation of trade with Japan, consequent loss to wool-growers and the position of uncertainty, and urges the Federal Government to do all in its power without loss of prestige, to rr-.U'iT r.:"":rr.'.)le trade relations with the Japanese Government. Six months have elapsed since the Government first began to exclude Japanese goods from our market, yet nothing definite has resulted from the negotiations which have been carried on throughout that period. This session of Parliament is nearing its close, and the probability is that nothing effective w ill be done to bring about a settlement for a considerable time to come, with the result that further serious losses w ill be inflicted on the wool-growers of this country. The The Government's attiwool industry has already sustained serious losses, and I venture to say that, not only the producers, but also all those engaged, directly and indirectly, in the industry, have suffered to the extent of hundreds ' of thousands of pounds. No matter what the Government may do in the ftit.ure, it cannot make good the loss which these people have already sustained. Another important factor to be considered in our dispute with Japan, is the progress of the staple fibre industry in that country. Production of staple fibre in Japan was increasing so slowly prior to this dispute that in the early months of this year it was estimated at only 35 tons a day, with no prospect of production being increased at an abnormal rate. But the action taken by this Government, has given such an impetus to the development of that industry, that w it h in ten days of the Commonwealth's announcement of its policy, Japanese plants were extended, and it is now estimated that, by the end of 1936, they will be producing 177 tons of staple fibre a day. E a r ly in July, General Terauchi, the Japanese Ministerf o r War, informed the Japanese Cabinet Council that the army would commence the manufacture of synthetic woollen cloth for uniforms. He also advocated that, besides soldiers' uniforms, uniforms for railwaymen and students, and clothing for women and children, should be made from mixed staple fibre cloth. He is reported to have said that by an extensive use of substitute goods, Japan could teach Australia a lasting lesson. He advised the Cabinet to compel, by legislation, the use of the new fabric, as has been done in Germany, where the material used in Nazi uniforms must be two-thirds staple fibre, in women's clothes 20 per cent., in men's suits 10 per cent., and in children's clothes 5 per cent. The staple fibre industry in Japan now threatens to become a serious menace to the Australian wool industry, and if that position should develop, this Government will be largely to blame. In the past, the Japanese people were large users of cotton goods in preference to woollen goods, and it is only in recent years that they have bebetween the Commonwealth and the come users of wool in great quantities. In United .States of America was heavily view of that fact, it will be quite easy for them to revert to the use of cotton and staple fibre cloth. Eor the reasons which I have given there can be no doubt that the Commonwealth Government has adopted an unwise policy towards Japan. I trust that before the House rises for the Christmas recess a satisfactory agreethings precisely as they were. I chalment will be concluded, and that Japan will again become a big purchaser of Australian wool. Sitting suspended from G.1S to S p.m. Government's trade diversion policy, any[8.0] -During the early months of this Government could have taken with respect year, the Labour party launched an to our trade position with Japan and the attack upon the Government, alleging United States of America. that it had not taken adequate measures to safeguard the credit balances of the Commonwealth abroad, and one Curtin) did go as far as to state to the of the points of the attack was House his fiscal credo by saying the trade balance between the Comthat the Government should first monwealth and the United States of all take every necessary measure of America.

161,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie) Thing To Suggest What Other Action The,"monwealth Government failed to act. Any preference by way of customs duties or otherwise is no more than a hollow sham unless it be, in fact, effecthat there shall be no discrimination at tive, and it is solely because the preference offered to Great Britain prior to the 22nd May had become ineffective that the Government took what action it thought necessary to render effective a policy which the Government has always adopted, and which, I believe, the Opposition itself has always embraced. We now come to the third part of the credo of the Leader of the Opposition, namely, that in trade and fiscal matters all foreign nations shall be treated on a basis of absolute equality by the Commonwealth. [Quorum formed.] To that I reply that one of the tests of the adequacy of any policy to-day, whether it be in regard to trade, finance, defence or anything else, is that it should be readily adaptable to continually changing conditions in a world where those conditions never remain the same for two consecutive days. If events of recent years have taught us anything it is that there can be no cut-and-dried formula to govern the attitude of any government towards another government; that it is impossible to formulate a policy that can remain constant in respect of trade, of commerce or of defence. The international picture to-day can only be likened to a jig-saw puzzle in which, not only the picture itself is continually altering in character, but also the parts that make up the puzzle are continually changing their shape. That being so, it is futile for any one to suggest that it is possible, even if it were desirable, for us to treat all nations on an exactly equal basis, or in an exactly similar way. It is essential that we should be prepared at all times to adjust our policy in accordance with the contingencies of the moment. Therefore, I must disagree with the Leader of the Opposition on the point he took. ber considered the consequences of this policy of continuous discrimination between various foreign countries ? Mr JO HN LAWSON -Whethe r we discriminate or not must be determined entirely by conditions as they arise. There are occasions when, admittedly, -we should not discriminate, but we can lay down no hard-and-fast rule. To say all is to assume that we shall always be treated in exactly the same way by all nations, and it is not possible to assume that to-day. We cannot undertake not to discriminate unless we feel certain that all nations will adopt towards us a uniformly fair and reasonable attitude. For instance, a nation which imposes 17^d. per lb. duty on Australian wool as does the United States of America, can hardly expect to receive the same treatment from Australia as do countries like France or Germany, in which the duty on Australian wool is negligible or non-existent. On this question as to whether or not it is desirable to divert a certain part of our trade with Japan to Great. Britain, I should like to place before honourable members for their consideration my view as to how we should approach the. matter. We have always assumed-whethe r rightly or not may be open to argumentthat Britain should make some provision, not only for its own defence, but also for the defence of Australia and the other dominions, and Great Britain has always done as we expected. In addition, we have always demanded that Australian goods should be allowed to enter Great Britain without let or hindrance, and without the imposition of any restrictions, quotas or duties of any kind whatsoever, and Great Britain has, so far, always conceded that claim. We have always enjoyed an absolutely open market in Great Britain for any goods that we choose to send there, but we have never conceded a similar privilege to it. We have made further demands; we have demanded that, not only shall Great Britain allow us to export goods without let or hindrance, but also that it shall restrict the importation of foreign goods, and impose, duties, restrictions and quotas upon such of them as are competitive with dominion goods, in order to provide for the products of the dominions a continuously expanding market. Great Britain has always done this, although I admit, not always without argument. In addition, it supplies the safest",45,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great

I understand that our exports to Great Britain worth about £63,000,000. that Great Britain shall provide for a continuous expansion of our trade with it. We have demanded that the inroads that might be made as the result of it on British primary and notwithstanding doubtedly have made on the beef industry in Great Britain, which have necessitated the payment by the British ment of bounties totalling many of pounds. tion of foreign imports of meat, and Britain has complied with our demand.

I think the trade-diversion policy has been fully justified by its results, and that the calamity-howlers who suggested at the outset that it would bring about stagnation and collapse of wool prices, have been shown to be wholly incorrect. I regret very much the attitude adopted, first by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison), and then by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), when they criticized the Government's endeavours to establish the motor car industry in this country. I do not profess to be an engineer, nor do I claim to have any specialized technical knowledge of this subject, but I do say that I am prepared on the record of the Minister directing negotiations for tri.de treaties to accept his word that he has been properly advised as to the practicability and desirability of establishing this industry in this country. The attitude of the honourable member for Wentworth disclosed that he obviously held a brief. Mr E. J. HARRISON I think I can recall the. honourable member himself criticizing the policy of trade diversion. Mi-. JOHN LAWSON -Unlik e the Britain has any given opinion. I am one of those who believe sincerely that consistency might easily be the bugbear of small minds. BecauseI had a given opinion about a subject when I was five years of age, or yesterday for that matter, is no reason why I should hold the same opinion on the same subject to-day. I consider myself fortunate, that unlike the honourable member for Wentworth, I am capable of changing my opinions. I say concerning the speeches made by the honourable members for Wentworth and Forrest that, as far as I am aware, no importing interests have ever favoured the establishment of a manufacturing industry for the goods with which they deal. For that reason there must of necessity be an immense amount of The opposition, inspired opposition, an opposition that is very powerful no doubt because of its being originated by strong financial bodies overseas whose business is that of exporting motor cars to Australia. I remind the honourable member for Wentworth when he speaks about an engineering background that twenty years ago there was no such thing as a textile background in Japan, whereas to-day Japan is the largest exporter of textiles in the world. Of the world's export of textiles 40 per cent, comes from Japan. I put that forward in answer to any suggestion that we have not in this country the engineering background necessary for the establishment of the motor car industry. To hear some people like the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Forrest speaking on this question of manufactures, one would be led to think that it was not possible to manufacture even a wheel-barrow in this country. I have no doubt that if * those honourable members had been in charge of the destinies of Australia during the last twenty years, there would be absolutely no manufacturing industries in this country to-day.

It is justified by the fact that we have in this country natural resources that we should exploit. From the defence view-point alone, this venture is justified. I should like to see the programme widened so that not only would the motor industry be established in the Commonwealth, but also an industry which would provide the fuel needed to drive the cars produced. However, that subject is not at present before the committee. I again congratulate the Government upon this policy which it has so boldly conceived and, so far, so ably pursued. listened to the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) speaking on the proposals now wondering with increasing amazement how the honourable gentleman oould reconcile his first argument that the Government's new trade diversion policy was intended to offset our adverse trade balance with second argument that it was also to meet the situation created by our Japan. gentleman based his support of this policy on the contention that it would enable Australia to meet effectively the unfavourable trading position in which it finds itself in relation 'to the United States of America. The honourable gentleman also said something about the changed economic conditions of the world. It was, however, quite impossible TO reconcile his statements with the conflicting trade conditions that face us in respect of the United States of America and Japan. My view is that the Government's trade diversion policy is the direct result of the good salesmanship of certain gentlemen who came to Australia as the representatives of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. The Commonwealth Government would have had logical grounds for submitting these proposals had the 'Government of the United Kingdom requested action along these lines; but that is not recently travelled extensively abroad and came back empty-handed from both Europe and Great Britain. The trade agreements with Czechoslovakia and Belgium, submitted to us last week, are not worth the paper they are written on for they will confer no advantages on our people. It is extraordinary to me that expert salesmen from Manchester should be able to influence this Government to discontinue buying textiles from Japan, although Great Britain continues to purchase large quantities of Japanese textiles. Actually, the ambassadors from Manchester said to the Government, ""You adopt this trade diversion policy and then we shall be able to buy all the textiles we want from Japan"". Immediately they realized that their representations had been accepted by the Government, the Australian price of British textiles was increased by 15 per cent. Had a Labour' government been in office at before us, I found myself the time this occurred honourable gentlemen opposite would have made themselves hoarse crying ""Corruption, corruption, corruption!

The Minister cannot deny that the price of British textiles in Australia increased 15 per cent, immediately this policy was announced. denying it. the statement as a joke. as a joke when the people have an opportunity to express their opinion upon the result of the representations of these business go-getters from Manchester.

Honourable gentlemen opposite always hide behind the flag, and often the Union Jack that they use for the purpose is made in Japan. I direct the attention of honourable members to the following letter which the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) wrote quite recently to the Government of Japan:To our neighbours across the PacificI send greetings from tlie people of Australia, and express the hope that the goodwill at present existing between our two nations may long continue along avenues of mutual benefit and mutual friendship. The Pacific Ocean which divides us also links us with a common bond, for oceans are vehicles of commerce and without commerce nations cannot survive. Yet the Minister directing negotiations goes on to sayfor trade treaties is now decrying Japan and talking disparagingly about its cheap tralia and Japan may be Brought even closer labour conditions. The letter proceedsThe very name of the Pacific is an omen of goodwill, for "" pacilic "" means peaceful. Australia has watched w it h admiration the rise of Japan to the front rank of world powers, and we hail with hope the possibilities for extension of our trade to your ports. world-wide depression has emphasized the need for the development of greater international trade and it is geographically natural that Japan and Australia should look to one another for the exchange of their products. Obviously the Minister for Commerce did not submit this letter to the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties The ink was hardly dry on that letter before it was dispatched to Japan. The before the Minister directing negotiations right honourable gentleman went on to for trade treaties surrendered to the say.During the World War our two nations were brought together in an atmosphere of intense liament the trade diversion policy now friendliness, both determined to protect the before us.

In 1934, Australia sent to Japan a goodwill mission headed by Sir John Latham, to give tangible expression to pur appreciation of Japanese friendship and Japanese trade. Last year the visit was returned by Katsuji Debuchi, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, and we assured him of our desire to co-operate in keeping peace in the Pacific and developing commerce across its waters. If the Government's present trade policy implies development, I must confess that I cannot understand English. The letter We are hopeful that by this 'means Austogether.

On field. War preparations saved the wool market. But for those preparations in Germany, Italy, Great Britain and Eran ce, the outlook for the wool producers of this country would have been a sorry one. Yet ministerial members take full credit for the prices that have been received. Had Japan come into the wool market in Australia, the prices would have been still higher. No one can gainsay that. When rayon was first placed on the market, every one ridiculed it and said that no one would purchase it ; that it was suitable only for neck ties. To-day, the majority of women's dress materials .are made of it. In Japan, the mill machinery has been altered to enable a fibre material to be produced, so that the people of that country will not have to depend on the wool that comes off the sheep's back in Australia. Those who applaud the trade diversion policy of the Government should realize the influence which that policy has had on this latest development. To meet the exigencies of the economic situation, Japan was compelled to produce another material to take the place of wool, and the competition of that material is vitally affecting and will affect to a still greater extent the wool industry of this country. When the full effects are felt, members of the Country party will be the first to squeal, and will claim that the wool industry has been ruined by this competition. A law has been passed in Japan compelling the production of materials from fibre. Those who are supposed to look after the wool interests of this country do the greatest possible disservice to the wool-growers when they applaud the diversion of Japanese trade by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties. Up, to a decade ago, wool was a necessary commodity in nearly every cold country of the world. Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Scotland, England, Ireland-al l had to buy wool. Had the previous rate of progression been maintained, the sales of wool in the last decade would have soared to an abnormal height. But other products came on to the market and to some extent displaced wool for clothing purposes. When I was a boy in Scotland, everybody wore wool in the winter months. A complete change of clothing was made from that which my last visit to ScotlandI could not believe my eyes when I . saw the transformation that had taken place in the short time that had elapsed; and I was informed that still greater changes were occurring. Japanese goods are being bought by the workers of Great Britain. There has been a change even in Australia. At one time it was the habit of every person to wear woollen underclothing. I do not suppose that to-day 5 per cent, of the people of this country wear it. Yet members of the Country party argue that everything is as it was in our fathers' day, and that there will be no change. They applaud the wilful disservice which the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties has done to this country by the diversion of Japanese trade. Were it a question of benefiting Australian manufacturers, I should close the door to Japan or any other country. I am in agreement with the proposal of the Minister for the manufacture of motor cars in Australia That is a step in the right direction, and it is a long one. Whether the purpose be the correction of ah adverse trade balance, or the promotion of the defence of this country, it is to be commended. I have read very carefully two or three times the speech of the honourable gentleman on this particular matter, and cannot find a flaw in it. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) believ.es. that nothing good can be produced by the",50,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great
174,Mr Garden,"Perhaps so. I regretpeople of Australia. I agree with the analysis of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson). The manufacturing industries of Japan have been developed within a decade. No one can convince me that the Japanese had any background in this matter; they had been merely tillers of the soil, and had never seen a machine. They were taken straight into industry, shown machines of the latest type, and taught how to wovk them. My friend, the honourable member for Wentworth, argues that Australians have more intelligence than the Japanese, yet at the same time says that they are more backward. member will admit that wages have had a big influence on the success achieved by Japan industrially? wages paid in Japan have an effect on its trade. But I am referring now to the manufacture of motor cars. Wages do not influence the capacity of the people of Japan to learn the technique of an industry. They have shown themselves capable of going into an industry without any knowledge of its technique, and of becoming competent operators within three months. Within a period of three or four years they have become highly skilled specialists in the manufacture of machine tools, which is the most difficult of all engineering operaI should not hesitate to adopt the role of tions. We have craftsmen who possess the necessary qualifications. We can produce the machines required,, and we have the raw material that we need for the manufacture of motor cars. Some persons may say that the output will be iimited to two styles, and that to-day there are 87 different makes in Australia. Those who wish to purchase outside the two makes that are manufactured locally, must pay for the privilege. If a man wants a Rolls Royce and can afford to purchase it, he can send to England for it. far more than two makes manufactured in Australia. moderately priced car were produced, those who were not satisfied would have to be prepared to pay extra for what they required. A second-grade truck would be good enough for this country. The Bedford and Chevrolet trucks, which now have the largest sales, are not first grade products. It is strange that so many persons should cry stinking fish in regard to Australian manufactures. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has referred to Mr Innes. During the period of my association with the bridge workers of Sydney, Mr Innes made the statement, which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Sydney Telegraph, and all other capitalist newspapers, that the most competent workmen whom he had ever had under his control were those whom he had employed in Australia. When he secured a contract for the construction of a bridge in South America, he invited Australian skilled artisans to accept employment on it, and seven or eight men left Australia with him. When I first came from Scotland it took me two or three years to adapt myself to Australian conditions. The Australian workman has natural ability and initiative, and these qualities enable him to adapt himself readily to the conditions in any industry. He is also more virile, and follows instructions more intelligently than do the workers of other countries. I am pleased, therefore, that the opportunity is to be afforded to the workers of Australia to show their aptitude for the manufacture of motor cars. If the Minister needed criticizing, a critic. about the manufacture of motor cars in Australia for twelve months. ence at the Trades Hall has shown me that it takes five or six years to start even a small industry. If the Minister accomplishes that objective within the space of two years in an industry of this magnitude, he will have the congratulations of the workers of this country. I do not criticize this aspect of the Government's policy, but I repeat that its action in diverting trade from Japan at the present time is detrimental to the real interests of the people of this country. vernment's trade diversion policy has been divided into three main phases; it seeks",51,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great

181,Mr Nairn (Perth) [9.0],"The Got:o achieve three different objectives by three different means. By restricting imports from America, it is intended to rectify, to some extent, our unfavorable trade balance with that country. The imposition of duties against Japan is intended to protect British textile and rayon products on the Australian market, and also, to some extent, to protect Australian industries. The third phase of this policy-the manufacture of motor chassis in this country-is purely a protective venture, the object of which is to establish a local industry which may become of great value in connection with our defence policy. I wholeheartedly support the Government . in restricting' imports America. For the ten-year period preceding the depression, American goods entered Australia at a prodigious rate and our adverse trade balance with that country, over that period, exceeded £250,000,000. In the period since federation, Australia's adverse trade balance with the United States of America approximates the total amount of our overseas debt. Eor two generations, the United States of America has been in the forefront of protection nations; its policy has been to exclude foreign goods as much as possible, and to sell all the goods it possibly can wherever it can. The Great War enabled the United States of America to increase European indebtedness to it. Australia has been borrowing from England and selling its goods on the British market, using a portion of the credit thereby created for the purchase of American goods. There has been, therefore, a constant drain of moneys, or credits, from England to the United States via Australia. A policy to rectify this position has long been overdue, and if something had hot been done in this direction sooner or later, and Australia's purchases from the United States of America had continued at anything like the rate prevailing in the past, this country would have become bankrupt, and the position of the British Empire financially would have been rendered very difficult. It is all very well for an erudite gentleman like Professor Giblin to advocate the ideal of free trade, but we have to look facts in the face. Eree trade, as such, does not exist in the world Mr Nairn. to-day. Nations with whom we arcforced to trade have adopted a policy of protection, and if we are to live and prosper, we must accept the policy dictated. Dy the times. It is useless, therefore, totalk of spheres of freedom of trade. rather a novel method of meeting that position. adopted may call for criticism to some extent, but it is impossible to imagine that we can live in a country where tradeis free to all outsiders. Professor Giblin is inclined to blame Great Britaini n this respect. He says that Britain is a bad customer because, apparently, it refrom quires payment of interest on moneys we have borrowed from it. That is rather the logic of the defaulter who does not wish to, or cannot, pay back loans, and ultimately adopts a malicious attitude towards the lender. There are other means by which we can further curtail American trade with Australia. It has been pointed out that the United States of America is not being given full credit for all of the Australian goods it buys, that a good deal of Australian wool, for instance, is purchased by that country in England. On the other hand, that omission is probably compensated for by the large quantity of petrol which is now being sent into Australia by American companies. That petrol is produced, not in the United States of America, but in Borneo and Sumatra, and that trade is not credited directly to the United Statesof America in its balance with Australia,, but the fact remains that the proceeds of it go to Americans and help to swell the disparity which exists against us in our trade with that country. I do not believe that the United States of America has any grievance against Australia in this matter. The policy of that country is simply to look after itself; it is not concerned about our policy. Americans do not complain if we choose to adopt protective measures so long as we do not do anything unfair as a competitor. It is clear that they are not prepared tonegotiate with us at the present time. In any case, under the Government's proposal the estimated margin of £7,500,000 in favour of the United States of America will remain. Thus it has no",52,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great

183,Mr Nairn,"The method we havereason to complain, and, I suggest, there is very little likelihood that it -will adopt this House realize what is likely to be reprisals against us. Our relationship with Japan is totally different. We have decided to divert certain of our trade hitherto of great value to that country. I propose to follow the example of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) by bearing in mind that these negotiations are still continuing and, therefore, it would not be wise for me, as a private member, to express any opinion in respect of the merits of the dispute. I commend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) and other honourable members opposite for resisting the temptation, which must have been great, to jump into this controversy during its early stages. I feel that their decision in that respect was dictated by the interests of the country; they deserve full commendation for it. Now that the matter has como before this House at last, however, and they have been forced into the controversy, I am astonished to hear the reasons put forward by honourable members opposite in opposition to the Government's policy. The burden of their plea is that, by excluding Japanese goods, we are treating Japan unfairly. Honourable members opposite, from the leader down, have condemned the prohibition on Japanese goods. One of the points made by the Leader of the Opposition was that this policy would tend to increase the cost of living in this country through bringing about a rise of prices of clothing. I always understood that the importation of goods produced in cheaplabour countries was anathema to members of the Labour party. The present Labour party, however, is apparently only a shadow of that party as we formerly knew it. [Quorum formed.] Last year many honourable members on this side of the chamber repeatedly urged the Government to take certain steps to rectify our trade balance with America and, as a counterblast to those efforts, honourable members opposite frequently asked what steps the Government had taken to stop the flow of cheap Japanese goods into Australia. To-day the position is changed entirely; honourable members opposite advocate the importation of cheap Japanese goods.. I wonder whether the representatives of the Labour party in the position in Australia in the future if Japan is permitted to continue its policy of penetration into not only the textile industry, but also all our other industries, depressing costs, wages, values, and general conditions under which our people work. That prospect has been visualized by the Government, and its present policy is not merely an effort to protect British products on the Australian market, but is rather-and I think this is the more important aspecta policy to stop this Japanese penetration. It has realized that that development must be stopped at some time or other. As a nation the Japanese are a very -fine people, and they have been good friends with Australia. We have no right to dictate to them as to how they should carry on their business, but, unfortunately, their standards are totally different from ours. It has been pointed out that wages paid to girls in the textile industry in that country amount to from Is. to Is. 3d. a day. Surely goods produced by labour of this kind cannot be permitted to compete unrestricted on our markets; that is, if we have any desire at all to maintain our present standards. I should like to support the Government in respect of the third phase of its trade diversion policy, but I am in doubt on that point. The manufacture of internal combustion engines in Australia has been recommended as an important clement in relation to our'defence policy, but, until it can be shown that such engines can be manufactured economically in this country, I do not think that we should enter upon such a venture merely because it offers some prospective benefit in relation to defence. that ever be demonstrated if we do not try it? says that we should try it regardless, apparently, of whether or not such a scheme is likely to fail. I say that we should fully investigate such a venture before we enter upon it. That is my complaint in respect of this phase of the Government's trade diversion policy.

It was a mistake to rush headlong into this policy, which is the biggest attempt to protect a new industry in Australia that has been made in many years. It is still not too late for the Government at least to retrace its steps to the extent of having the T a r if f Board make a f u l l inquiry. I assume from the remarks of the Minister himself that the Government has no commitments in this respect to any company. The Minister said that the policy has been referred to the Tariff Board, but the inquiry w ill be on only a limited scale, as the board has been invited to assist the Minister only in the carrying out of a policy on which he has already decided. It would have been saner to have made the inquiry before embarking on this plan. I agree, however, w i th the efforts of the Government to improve the trade of Australia with other countries. I propose, as the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) did, to divide my remarks on this matter into two parts, but I do not propose to follow h i m by discussing first, trade diversion, and, secondly, the proposal to establish an Australian motor manufacturing industry. The honourable member for Perth( MrN a i r n ) , who has forward by the Minister we shall arise just resumed his seat, spoke at length about the proposed establishment of this industry in this country, and I propose to continue on the same lines by quoting some of the Minister's own words in relation to the building of motor chassis and engines in Australia when he said that this proposal should be kept separate from and independent of the general scheme of trade diversion. The Minister saidT therefore cannot conceive of any honourable member who favours or who advocates the diversion policy in principle not subscribing wholeheartedly to the Government's proposal to bring about as soon as possible the local manufacture of motor car engines and chassis. I emphasize that, after appealing for separate consideration of the two aspects of the new protection policy, the Minister made the weird statement that if honourable members favoured the general policy of trade diversion he could not understand how they could f a i l to subscribe I declare, therefore, wholeheartedly to a proposal for tbe manufacture of motor cars. The Minister continuedThis proposed new industry is one which I submit every member of this House may vote for with confidence and with pride. I can assure the Minister that I am not one who intends to vote for it . On the contrary, I intend to vote wholeheartedly against it with even more pride and more confidence than that w it h which the honourable gentleman could possibly advocate it. The Minister continuedEstablished here on a basis sufficiently strong to prove economic, it will correct the trade balance to the extent of 'some millions sterling annually. These are broad. general statements.

It is to prevent this absurdity happening that I raise my voice in this committee to-night. The Minister further went on to sayI t will add substantially to the stature of Australia as an industrial nation. Indeed, with truth it might be said that a country has not reached its industrial manhood whicli is not a fabricator on a sound scale of that incalculable force in national affairs-the internal combustion engine.

But it has not made a success of the motor industry, and if the Minister really means it when he says that a country has not reached industrial manhood until it has established a motor industry, -his remark must apply to Japan. To say the least of it, the Minister's remarks are indeed contradictory; in fact, I could, within reason, use a much stronger term than that. He has set out nine reasons which have actuated the Government in deciding on this policy. I propose to deal with only two of. them. One was the declaration thatThe more difficult part of the car is already local buyers by the mass production of being manufactured in Australia. That statement was replied to by the honourable member for Perth when he said, that neither the more important nor the most expensive part of the motor car is at present being made in this country. The most expensive part of a motor vehicle is the engine -Canada make, their own; yet we are going Furthermore, without the engine there is no motor car. It is the thing that takes you there and brings you back again. ""Without it a car is absolutely of no use. I have been informed that in the internal combustion engines of motor vehicles to-day there are 3,600 parts. It mu3t, therefore, be a most complicated piece of machinery, and it is ridiculous to assert that the engine forms part of the 20 per oent. of the motor car which the Minister claims at present has to be imported. That 20 per cent., furthermore, covers many things other than the engine itself. The Minister gave honourable members some figures in regard to motor engines and asserted that the average cost was about £30 in the United State of America. I do not know [Si] where he got his figures. I know that many other honourable members beside myself have attempted to get some figures with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and have gone to sources where they would have reasonable expectation of being able to get them, but it was not possible to obtain authentic information which could be used in this chamber. The Minister, however, said that the cost was about £30. In addition to engines, we should also have to undertake the manufacture of other accessories which are not at present manufactured in this country. The only two firms that could undertake the development of this industry in Australia are General Motors Limited and the Ford Company. To mention just one essential part of motor cars, the manufacture of which is entrusted to specialists in America, only three motor manufacturers in Canada and the United States of America make their own clutches. The clutch specialists have, therefore, a market of millions, and the cost is low clue to repetition; furthermore, specialists are available to the British chassis builders. The comparative cost of a chassis made complete in Australia would be influenced to the detriment of millions of cars available overseas using standardized items sueh as wheels, selfstarters, generators, carburettors, speedometers, fuel pumps, brakes, and universal joints.

215,Mr E. Geeen,"As a matter of fact,last night that from the beginning we should be able to do the whole of the manufacturing in this country. was that the Australian manufacture of motor vehicles could be embarked upon without any additional cost to the Australian users. the Minister were "" If local manufacture takes place upon a progressive basis"". The second statement of the honourable gentleman to which I object was "" The policy will not cause an increased pric.2 to car users"". I do not think a more foolish statement has ever been made by a responsible Minister in this chamber. We have had an experience of the cost of making motor bodies in Australia. General Motor3-Holdens Limited makes large numbers of motor bodies, but at a price far in excess of similar imported bodies, and of an inferior quality. The name of T. J. Richards and Sons Limited has been mentioned in this discussion I had a Richards body on my car and I do not think I could find words to say how unsatisfactory it was. SinceI described this body in this House some time ago I have inspected other bodies made by the same firm, and all I can say is that their quality cannot possibly be compared to the quality of imported bodies. Motor car distributors who are able to offer for sale cars with imported bodies, make a great point of it in the advertisements they put in the daily press, This speaks for itself. The Minister also said that 80 per cent, of the Australian selling price of cars consists of costs and charges incurred in Australia. That may be true, but a good deal of the SO per cent, consists of taxes and charges of one kind and another imposed by the Government. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) gave, as a more accurate figure, 46 per cent, or 41 per cent. In any case the remaining 20 per cent -acceptin g the Minister's 80 per cent, for the moment -represent s the most important part of the motor car, the chassis and the engine. The Minister would have us believe that these can be obtained for the extra 20 per cent., but if our experience of the cost manufacturing motor car engines? say of motor body building is any criterion we niay assume quite definitely that the cost of making engines and chassis in Australia is likely to be more than double the 20 per cent, mentioned by the Minister. In any case to suggest that the price of motor cars to local purchasers will not increase if the complete unit is manufactured in Australia is absurd. The Minister has told us that as the engine would cost about £30 and a bounty of £30 is being provided, increased prices are not likely. The exact words of the Minister on this point were as followsI have indicated that before the price to Australian purchasers of cars containing Australian-made engine and chassis could be increased, in comparison with the present price of cars carrying engine and chassis of Canadian origin, the additional local cost must be increased by £72 8s., and in comparison with those manufactured in the United States of America, by £93 8s. Yet elsewhere in his speech the honourable gentleman stated quite definitely that there would be no increase of prices. Our experience, of course, has always been that the Australian manufacturers, without exception, chase the tariff and keep just within the margin. butter equalization scheme. gentleman has introduced quite another subject but his statement is totally inaccurate. We were told by the Minister that 4,700 internal combustion engines were made in Australia last year of which 827 were petrol engines. He added that the engines varied from 1£ to 80 horse-power. We were given no detailed information as to. the kind of engine that was manufactured here. Probably the Minister was referring to engines required on farms to drive sheep-shearing machinery, and to saw-milling machinery and pumping plants. I have no doubt that the revolutions of these engines would be quite low. At any rate, the engines would be totally different from the high compression units required for motor cars or aeroplanes. I have never heard of one motor car or aeroplane engine having been made in Australia. gentleman think that we should begin",58,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great

222,Mr Lane,"When does the honorablemany reasons which I could give, and certainly not under the plan sponsored by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties. If this whole subject had been exhaustively inquired into by the Tariff Board and that body had made a favorable recommendation, the situation would be different. Such a report might cause me to revise my views slightly, but I am definitely not prepared to approve of the harebrained scheme placed before us by the Minister and supported only by his ex parte statement. The internal combustion engines so far manufactured in Australia have been entirely different from those required for motor transport units. The Minister said that 85 per cent, of available motor vehicles are the most the cars selling on the Australian market efficient and the least costly. If we inrepresented only seventeen types of crease the cost of motor vehicles we shall engines. That may be true, but if undoubtedly add to the difficulties of those a monopoly is given to two trading who require transport services, and inorganizations to manufacture motor crease to an unbearable degree the burden cars in this country, we shall have on some sections of the community. only four types of engines, for repreAll sections of the community will have sentatives of the two companies conto pay toll to the companies which begin cerned-Genera l Motors-Holdens Limited manufacturing operations.

We may assume that if opposing this proposal by the Minister General Motors Limited became infor the manufacture of motor cars at terested in the proposal, it also would the moment in Australia, particularly have to instal plant requiring at least under the scheme propounded.

Secondly, there will be a heavy upon to include in the price of their bounty payment, and a tax on the public motor cars the interest, depreciation, and to establish and nurse an uneconomic dividend requirements for a capital expenditure of at least £8,000,000. In my opinion, locally-manufactured motor cars would cost the Australian purchasers from £90 to £100 more than they are at present paying for motor vehicles. Such an increased price would, undoubtedly, curtail the expenditure on motor vehicles. In view of the figures that I have given, I cannot understand how the Minister can possibly suggest that the establishment of this industry in Australia could be effected without increasing costs. Modern conditions require modern methods of transport. Our railway systems make no pretence to provide all the transport needs of the community. The railways must be supplemented by other means of transport, and of those to realize that which he has Mr R, GEEEN -That is a rather",59,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great

226,Mr E. Geeen,"As my time is drawindustry. Thirdly, it involves the destruction of distributors' assembling plants. The Eord and General MotorsHoldens organizations have already been hit very hard by this policy which the Minister initiated on the 22nd May last. Engines have to be imported to keep their works going. The employees of one of those firms have been reduced in number from 2,900 in March last, to 1,800. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr in Japan we are well known, and in Forde), when Minister for Trade and Customs always claimed that his tariff proposals would have the effect of increasing employment, but invariably the effect was in the opposite direction. I suggest that that experience will be repeated in this case. Australia cannot afford to decrease the volume of available employment either now or in the future. My fourth objection is that there will be a reduction of the output of bodies, tyres and other parts that are already produced in Australia, because the higher prices will restrict sales of cars. Fifthly the prices of cars and trucks will be much higher than they are now. Sixthly, in the aggregate there will be less employment and general stagnation. I think that I can now safely leave that matter and deal with the principle of trade diversion. Whether it is wise at any time to take bi-lateral action against any particular nation, instead of envisaging our trade as a whole and balancing it as far as we are able, with an excess of exports over imports, I take leave to doubt. We have many good customer countries, and there are others with which we have an adverse trade balance. This action of the Government is aimed at two nations, and peculiarly enough, one is a good customer country with a trade balance in favour of Australia, while the other has a trade balance that is definitely in its own favour and against us. The taking of this bilateral action has made Australia so unpopular overseas that the Minister felt impelled to refer to the matter when introducing to ratify the trade agreements he had made with Czechoslovakia and Belgium. Discussing the general aspects of the negotiation of trade treaties, the honourable gentleman pointed out how unpopular he had found AusMr B. Green-. tralia to be. I suggest that this action will make Australia even more unpopular than it has been. We have to study the psychology of those against whom we take action. Australia is not particularly well known to the bulk of the people of the United States of America. Those who have met citizens of that country abroad, realize that their general knowledge of Australia is very limited. But dealing with that country we have to be particularly careful, because its ideas have an oriental flavour. What they may consider ordinary we may regard with aversion, or at all events, in a totally different light. I have been to Japan on five occasions. A Japanese will look you in the face and tell you a lie knowing that it is a lie, and that you know he knows it. I mention this not by way of criticism of Japan, but iii order to stress the necessity for taking it into consideration in our dealings with that country. say such things just now. is perfectly true. The Japanese see nothing wrong with such a mental outlook from an ethical, moral, or any other view-point. Pethaps however it is not advisable to pursue the subject while negotiations are proceeding which we hope will reach fruition. I agree with the oft-repeated statement that Japan for ils own sake must buy Australian wool. On my last visit to that country about two years ago, I inspected a cotton and a woollen factory. No secret was made of the fact that they were mainly equipped to deal with Australian wool of a certain type. I was informed that experiments had been conducted with South African wool, and that it had been found to be not the best for the machinery that had been installed. This is not unknown either to the Minister or to honourable members. We underrate the bills the intelligence of the Japanese business man, if we believe that he will allow a profitable export trade in woollen textiles to vanish, and thus lose the results of years of work and the expenditure of many millions of pounds. I am of the opinion that an arrangement of mutual",60,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great

228,Mr R. Green,"What I have saidadvantage to Australia and Japan will shortly be made. ment has boon saying for six months. with the people of the East time is not as important as it is to us. They do not rush things as we do. Their patience is far greater than ours. It must not be forgotten that one of their principal characteristics is a keen desire for bargaining or haggling. That being ingrained in them, they give it f u l l play. We of the Occident become so impatient as to feel inclined to discontinue the negotiations. The United States of America is in a somewhat different, category. I have not the same admiration for the citizens of that country as have some other honourable members. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has said, the two countries against whom we have taken action border on the Pacific, as Australia does. If we make a war of any description, even a trade war, and reprisals or retaliations result, as has been the case in this instance, we forget the significance of the name of that ocean whose waters lave the shores of each of these countries. Let us be really pacific. I suggest that any action, bi-lateral instead of multi-lateral in character, is not conducive to the maintenance of the spirit of goodwill among the nations, the need for which is even more urgent to-day than it has ever been. [10.16J -In considering matters of this kind it is necessary to pay some regard to what constitutes international trade. There seems to be quite a lot of loose thinking on subjects of this description. Honourable members talk about what we import and export, whereas, actually, the fact is that the Commonwealth of Australia, or any other nation for that matter, does not export, or import, as a business concern or as an individual, but that the trade of the world is made up of hundreds of millions of individual transactions. We talk very loosely about Australia's markets being flooded by goods from Japan or some other country, whereas I do not suppose that any proportion of the goods entering this country from Japan, or from Great Britain, comes into Australia until it has been bought by some local Australian importer. Manufacturers, or merchants, in other countries do not charter ships or load them with goods and send such goods to our ports on the offchance of being able to pick up a purchaser for them. All of these transactions are finalized beforehand. Thus when we come to talk about our trade balance, it is just as well for us to get down to the real facts. Let us ask ourselves why we trade. Is it not for the reason that we desire to quit at a profit those products which we produce in excess of our requirements? And for what reason? If we send those goods overseas, it stands to reason that we must be paid for them in other goods. We cannot expect to be paid in cash. The currency of the United .States of America, Japan, or Germany, is of no value in this country unless the holder of it can exchange it for our currency. It would be well for the committee, in dealing with matters of this kind, to have a clear understanding of the terms we use. We have to consider the Government's policy from several aspects. I make no secret of the fact that I am opposed to the policy inaugurated by the Government on the 22nd May. I oppose it because I think it is wrong from Australia's viewpoint, and is not in the true interests of Australian industry; because I think it is wrong from the viewpoint of Imperial relations, and because I think it is wrong for the much more important reason that it is a menace to the peace and security of this country, and therefore should not be proceeded with. When we come to consider the antecedents to the introduction of this policy we must bear in mind two or three remarkable facts When we met here in March last we were immediately faced with a motion of no confidence by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), the burden of whose charges was that the Government had not taken steps sufficiently drastic to deal with the lessening of our trade balance and the lessening of our funds in London, which he contended was taking place. On that occasion the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), delivered one of the few orations he'has delivered in this House, at least since I have been a member of this chamber, and went to great pains to prove to the House that",61,Henry Gullett Thi S Anti Sir Henrygullett T H I S Is A Great

231,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"there was no foundation whatever for the charges of the Leader of the Opposition. He endeavoured to prove that our trade balance overseas, instead of declining, was actually improving, and improving at an alarming rate, whilst there was every prospect that that tendency would continue. H is remarks on this subject are reported on page 23, volume 149, Mansard. Dealing with i m ports, he saidAn analysis of the imports clearly indicates that they are employment-giving. They consist, in the main, of raw materials, capital goods and foodstuffs of a .kind not produced in Australia, tlie principal items being . . . He enumerated a list of siich articles including machinery, metals, motor chassis and parts, cable and electric appliances, oils, minerals, books, and paper. Probably a lot of that paper has been used by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( S ir Henry Gullett) in circulating his arguments among honourable members, and that fact may have helped to increase the imports of that item. On that occasion, the Prime Minister announced that, out of imports of a total value of £16,000,000, £14,000,000 were of an employmentcreating character. That want of confidence motion was followed by a motion for the adjournment of the House by the honourable for Elinders view to discussing our trade balance with the United States of America. interesting occasion. Flinders asked that certain action be taken in respect of our adverse balance America, and put up a very good case in support of his request. an honourable member who docs not feel that the traditional policy of the United States of America in international has been one-eyed and of the dog-in-themanger kind, and that the United of America has not played that part in smoothing the pathways of trade in the world which its resources and position entitled us to expect. During that debate, however, the Minister directing tions for trade treaties delivered of an oration in which he made some Mr Archie Cameron. rather remarkable statements. One of them was as follows:Happily, Australia has so far been able to continue down the old road; we have continued up to date to count our trade, apart from preferential arrangements within the Empire, not as balanced with this or that country, but as balanced in the aggregate. I submit that, when the final solution of this dispute is found, and we are enabled to reckon the costs of the policy we are discussing this evening, every honourable member w ill recognize that the honourable gentleman on that occasion was right on the target so f a r as the truth of his contentions was concerned. Sir HENRYGULLETT I clearly indi cated then that a change was coming. deal with that point. On that occasion, the honourable member continuedI desire to emphasize that the redressing of an unfavorable trade balance of this nature is not quite so easy, nor is it so completely' desirable, as was suggested by the honourable member for Flinders. Those are the honourable gentleman's own words, but the ink was not very dry on this prin t when he enunciated an entirely different policy. imports valued at Sir HENEYGULLETT I clearly in d i cated that the Government was going to take action. honourable gentleman saidI t is a simple matter to speak of taking member steps to redress an adverse balance ( Mr Fairbairn) with a but I remind honourable members that, if other countries with which Australia has an extremely unfavorable balance of trade, A very apply to us the same medicine as the honordebate took place on that able member for Flinders has prescribed, it The honourable member for would be a most unhappy occurrence for us.

In view of your ruling, however, I shall trust to memory. We have, in that speech which was made by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties in this chamber this year, just prior to the introduction of this very questionable policy, the strongest condemnation of it which has ever been uttered in this country; and the honourable gentleman uttered his condemnation in advance. Wheni t comes to considering the policy which the M in ister has actually pursued let us see how that policy compares with that which he advocated in 1930.

245,Mr Archiecameron,"I haveintroduced on the authority of the Government, which must accept responsibility for what comes out of it. That the Government has been extremely fortunate in one respect every one will admit this way. because, if the piice of wool had gone down instead of up, it would have had to face a very serious reckoning. Honourable members have had a good deal to say about the proposal of the Government's proposal. vernment to establish in Australia an industry for the manufacture of motor cars. I do not propose to go over the same ground, but merely point out that the Government took a very serious step when, by the introduction of this schedule of value. Only to-day, in answer to the on the 22nd May, it deliberately broke the law of the country. T,hat law provides that customs duties shall not be inCustoms( Mr White) admitted that, in creased or varied except upon the report of the Tariff Board. When that provision was enacted, it was the intention of Parliament, I am sure, that the Government should be bound by it. There is no other authority in Australia except the Government which can refer questions Tariff intended the Government to vary the tariff. In regard to the proposal for the manufacture of motor cars, Parliament would be wise to exercise a great deal of caution before it commits itself to the Government's policy. I have visions of deputations to the Government from industries already established asking for increases of tariff duties, and for the continuation or increase of bounties now being paid. The country must prepare itself to shoulder a heavy responsibility if it accepts the policy of the Government in regard to the motor industry. I say that as one who believes it would be an extremely good thing from the point of view of defence as well as of local transchase from all sources, but there is also port generally, if we could establish in this country on economic lines an industry for the manufacture of complete motor vehicles. I am convinced that every year transport will shift more and more from, the railways to the roads, and therefore, it would be in the interests of the country as a whole to establish, on a sound basis, a motor car manufacturing industry within our own borders. It is largely, however, a matter of cost. Ever since the inauguration of federation, the Mr Archie policy of successive governments has resulted in continuously increasing costs of production and transport, and there is a limit to what the country can stand in The committee would be neglecting its duty if it did not insist on tlie tabling of the report of the Tariff Board on this subject before any money is voted for the carrying out of the GoThe terms of reference to the Tariff Board in regard to-the inquiry are the key to the situation.

I make the uncharitable Board. The provision was suggestion that the Government had a to limit the power of very strong suspicion that the report of the board would take a lot of explaining, and it had no desire to erect a hurdle that might, at a later date, be difficult to cross. The subject of Imperial trade relations is of great importance at the present time, because the term of the Ottawa agreement will shortly expire, and the whole matter will have to be reviewed next year. There seems to be an idea in some quarters that Australia will be able to command an ever-expanding share of the market in the United Kingdom, but there could be no greater illusion. Not only is there a definite limit to the amount which the United Kingdom can pura limit to the share of the market which is open to Australia.

With regard to imperial relationships also, this policy is not going to assist us, and from the viewpoint of external relations or foreign affairs, taking a brief look at the gloomy outlook in Europe and in what we call the FarEast, I say that possibly a policy of this description at this time is likely very quickly to turn into a menace to the peace and security of this country. humble opinion, therefore, the committee should be extremely careful in dealing with it; I feel that it should be rejected. The only other point that comes to my mind is the attitude that has been adopted on this matter by some honourable supporters of the Government. I realize that if this country became embroiled in some foreign entanglement, we should all like to stand behind the Government, and it would be only after serious consideration and consultation on basic principles, upon which we should all act, that we could come out and speak against the Government of the country. But if the Government, as a matter of usage, is going to ask honourable members to maintain the same silence in regard to trade disputes as we should do in regard to international disputes, I warn it that, although I have been extremely silent for the last six months on this question, which I claim will react to the detriment of the public life of this country, I shall not be one to remain silent in the future, lest it become accepted as a principle of parliamentary government in this Commonwealth that the Government, when it makes some shocking blunder in regard to trade matters, has only to state that it is a matter of high policy and a selfimposed censorship will silence honourable members. of such a state of affairs as that. I believe that matters such as this should be discussed in the open. I also believe that there are other ways in which the Government could have effected its policy, but I do not propose to refer to them, because it is easy to be wise after the Mr Archie Cameron. event. What we want in connection with trade treaties is a man who is wise before the event, and in the present instance, I am certainly of the opinion that we have not got that man. I find it impossible to join in this debate with any enthusiasm, especially since I am fully aware of the great difficulties which the Minister in charge of this legislation ( Sir Henry Gullett) has encountered. I am most disinclined to put pinches of salt in the claymore wounds inflicted by the honourable memI n my ber for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) by following him with further expressions of disappointment. After listening to the spirited attack of the honourable member, I am reminded of Sir Alan Newton's description of one of the early surgical operations, in which he said that the surgeon with one sweep of the knife amputated a leg and two fingers of the patient and the coat-tails of an onlooker. I do not intend unduly to criticize the Minister or the Government, but because of my action in April when I moved the adjournment of the House to propose a certain measure of trade diversion, I feel it essential that I should to-night make clear what was then in my mind, express why I think the Government has departed from the principles I then enunciated and state where I think criticism is justified and improvement could be made. My motion on that occasion was for the purpose of discussingThe alarming growth of imports from the United States of America, which, in view of Australia's general trade balance position, is a grave menace to trade with the United Kingdom and good-customer nations, and, consequently, to our export industries. I did not notice until the 22nd May last that I moved that motion on the 1st April. What was in my mind then was that the purchasing power of Australia was definitely limited. Attention has been drawn to I challenge the wisdom this by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and by statements by members of the Government all suggesting that we should carefully have to watch our general .trade position. My desire at that time was that any restriction of trade should be confined to unsatisfactory customers, and that.",65,Sithenry Gullett Doe S The Honor
248,Mr Fairbairn (Flinders) [10.50].,"instead of indulging in an all round restriction of imports, with consequent dislocation to our trade, we should reduce our imports from a country which refused, or, to a certain extent, was unable, to buy to any extent from us. The other reason I gave for the motion was the growing demand by goodcustomer countries of Australia for an increasing share of our purchases. Even if we were prepared to continue to trade with the United States of America, those countries were not prepared to continue a similar type of trade with us. Some were not prepared to do it on grounds of fairness, but other countries definitely, owing to dislocation of the normal needs of exchange of goods between one country and another, found themselves totally unable to purchase from us the raw materials they urgently needed because of their inability to sell to us sufficient goods to enable them to pay for their purchases from us. My main reasons in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this matter were, therefore, first, that we should prevent an all-round stoppage of imports, and, secondly, that Ave should be able to meet the just demands of other countries for a greater share of our purchases. I now add, apart from those personal or local considerations that made some action of tlie sort taken by the Government necessary, the statement that the great tension that exists in the world-the great danger of war-make s it all the more essential that countries which have big supplies of raw materials, and are potentially able greatly to increase the production of those materials, should do everything in their power to put themselves in the position of trading more freely with industrial nations which do not possess supplies great, as it is in respect of certain counof raw materials. At the present time, not only Australia, but also the whole of the world is appalled at the prospect of war. One reason for the belief of the people that war is imminent is the intensive rearmament which is taking place throughout the nations. On my recent travels through Europe and AsiaI was impressed by the fact that one witnessed more tension and saw more men in uniform than one saw behind the lines in France during the great war. Many people have the opinion that war will come about through friction between Fascist and Communist nations. I concede that there is a risk in that direction, but I do not think that that friction is so likely to be an immediate cause of war as is the friction between countries which are satisfied with the status quo and countries that want a revision of the Treaty of Versailles. The latter countries outnumber the former by two to one. It is true that the situation that exists in that respect to-day may lead to war. The greatest danger of war to-day is in the inability of certain efficient and industrious people to obtain the rawmaterials essential to the maintenance of a reasonable standard of living. In Europe this applies particularly to the people of Italy and Germany, who are among the most efficient and industrious of the world and who, consequently, are entitled to a high standard of living. The only thing that stands between them and the reasonably high standard of living at which they aim is their inability to obtain the raw material from which to manufacture their requirements. It is, therefore, most desirable that countries like Australia, which produce large quantities of raw materials and have the capacity to produe? very much larger quantities, should do everything possible to exchange goods with industrialized countries. If this is not done, war seems to me to be inevitable. This was illustrated for us recently by the Italian adventure in Abyssinia. Italy went in search of very small potential sources of raw material in the face of the disapproval and opposition of over 50 nations. If a nation is prepared to take such a great risk for such a small prize, it must be inevitable that the risk of war is very great when the prize is tries capable of producing large quantities of raw materials. It was because I foresaw this danger that I moved the adjournment of the House six or seven months ago to discuss the subject. I had at that time no desire to penalize the people of the United States of America or even to disapprove of their actions for, after all, they are the producers of large quan.tit.ies of raw materials and have a very limited demand for goods of the kind we have to sell. The only disapproval I express of the Government's trade diversion policy is the meagre nature of the proposed deflection of trade from the United States of America. I hoped that steps would be taken to deflect a considerable proportion of trade towards Japan which was, at that time, next to the United Kingdom, our bestcustomer country. I fully realize the difficulties which the Government has encountered in this connection, and do not wish to minimize them in any way; but it was a disastrous circumstance that the Goverument had to take action against Japan just at the time when that country might have reasonably expected tohold out its hand for a larger share of our trade. Instead of obtaining more trade, it received a punch on the nose. That the Government had to take some action of this kind, I do not dispute. The peculiar nature and ruthlessness of Japan's competition called for some restrictive measures^ not only on the part of the British Empire but also on the part of other countries. I complain, however, of the extraordinary extent of the setback administered to Japanese trade in Australia. Our curtailment of trade with the United States of America was almost negligible. It amounted practically to a limitation to the figures of the peak years. Tn the case of Japan we did not merely say "" We cannot continue to take an ever increasing volume of imports from Japan "". We went further, and prohibited 40 per cent, of the trade that existed. sively drastic action. I wish to make it clear that although this is my view of the situation, I shall stand behind the Government in its negotiations. The opinions that I express on the general circumstances of the situation will not cause me to oppose the Government. I believe that all the people of Australia will, in fact, stand behind the Minister in his negotiations. We must realize that difficulties of the kind we are now facing will increase in the years ahead of us. The Leader of the Opposition sugthe users of these vehicles in any other gested, with what accuracy I am unable part of the world. to say, that the Government had restricted Australian trade with Japan present wretched system. much more drastically than the Government of the United Kingdom had reany country I have visited in which the stricted its trade with Japan, although prices of motor vehicles are even nearly the menace to the United Kingdom was so high as they are in Australia. The very much greater than that to Australia. best that the greatest optimist can hope Mr Fairbairn. I believe that we, in 'Australia, should in the future confer very closely with the Government of the United Kingdom in regard to the restriction of Japanese imports into British countries. The occasion of the Coronation, when members of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition will be in England^ seems to me to offer an excellent opportunity for the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White), and the Leader of the Opposition to confer with members of the British Government and the Leader of the Opposition in the Imperial Parliament, with the object of deciding upon a common method of facing the grave difficulty which confronts us. AlthoughI congratulate the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties on the enterprise and optimism of the proposal to establish the motor car manufacturing business in Australia, I view the enterprise with considerable misgiving and am unable to join in his optimism. Unless we are prepared to say to the people of Australia "" You will, in the future, be restricted to a selection of two or three types of motor cars,"" I feel that we cannot possibly expect to establish this industry on an economic basis. I have no doubt that the Minister has very carefully prepared the figures which have been submitted to us; but I have invariably discovered, in investigating business propositions submitted to me, that the reality is never so rosy as the theory. This was an excesThe Minister has no doubt convinced himself that the motor car manufacturing industry could be established in Australia, with, at the worse, a very slight increase of the cost of motor cars and, more importantly, motor trucks; but I fear that a very substantially increased price would be necessary to put the industry on a fair footing. When we consider the possibility of an increase, however small, we should remember that in Australia we are probably already paying more for motor trucks and motor cars than is paid by",67,Sithenry Gullett Doe S The Honor

It would be disastrous to the economic life of Australia to restrict the choice of motor vehicles used by producers and contractors in this country, and at the same time increase the already high prices of motor vehicles. I regret having criticized the action of the Government in this respect, because I fully realize the great difficulties confronting it in every direcBritain with food. A real struggle is tion; but I feel that if there is to be a diversion of trade, that diversion should have been greater from our most unsatisfactory customer, instead of what I consider the unnecessary curtailment of trade with Japan, a good-customer country, which has been harshly and abruptly treated. Further, I consider it my duty to express great concern at increasing the already high prices charged for motor vehicles in Australia. When the Government introduced its trade diversion policy in May last, it stated that it intended to divert trade from Japan and the United States of America to other, and presumably, bettercustomer countries. It is now said that another equally important objective is desired, and that it proposes to protect Australian industries against Japanese and American competition but more particularly against Japanese competition. If I remember aright, very little, if anything, was mentioned in May last about the latter objective. That has been developed as an afterthought in justification of the Government's policy announced in May to the effect that an attempt was to be made, as far as possible, to confine Australia's trade to the United Kingdom-w e were to export mainly to the United Kingdom, and to import largely from that country. That is a policy of exclusion, and as such is undesirable; but it is also somewhat uncertain, because I do not think that we can count for many years, or, in fact, for many months, upon the continuance of the policy laid down in the Ottawa Agreement. It seems that the real interest of the British people is to become a foodspect a self-contained community, not the food it requires. Great Britain is so menaced by war and its sea communications are so precarious that everything is impelling the British people towards the adoption of a policy of producing food for the British people in Great Britain. In every British political party there is a desire to develop agriculture and primary-producing industries in Britain. These have been developed and are being developed at the expense of the countries now supplying taking place in Britain to-day between the great financial interests on the one hand, and the real interests of the people of Britain on the other. The great financial interests are concerned in the perpetuation of what is known as the Ottawa policy, because it is that policy which secures to them the payment of their interest and possibly the repayment of their capital in respect of loans. MrH . M . Brailsford said that before 1930 one of every five ships sailing from Australia to Great Britain carried cargo belonging to the Oity of London; but he now says that one out of every three is employed for that purpose. I believe that sooner or later, probably sooner, the real interests of the British people will assert themselves and Britain will endeavour to produce all its foodstuffs. the British people will starve. a great deal more about the subject than the Minister does consider that Britain can produce the whole, or at any rate, most of its foodstuffs. Not only British Ministers, but also agricultural experts, consider that it is possible for Britain to produce all its own food, or, at any rate, produce food in much larger quantities than is being produced at present. The policy embodied in the Ottawa Agreement does not give complete satisfaction to Australia or to Great, Britain. One of our complaints is that Australian industries are sacrificed to the interests of Argentina; but that is the crucial test of the correctness of my view. The City of London will not sacrifice Argentine trade to Australia because Argentina, as well",69,Sithenry Gullett Doe S The Honor

253,Mr Blackburn,"Men who knowas Australia, is a. debtor nation, and can only pay its debts with exports. It seems to me that it is very dangerous to rely upon the people of Great Britain to consume our produce. The practice of thinking that we have in Great Britain a certain market that we can exploit to the fullest extent blinds us to the possibility of developing markets at our own doors. closer markets, because into them we must enter as competitors with other nations. We prefer to concentrate upon a market in which we are given preference, instead of doing our best to develop markets in what is to us the Near East. We regard them as practically unimportant, and believe that we can offend other nations bordering on the Pacific. It seems to me that our first consideration should be, that we are a people of the Pacific Ocean, far removed from Great Britain, and in the dangerous position of being surrounded by those who are potential friends or potential enemies and may be converted into actual friends or foes by any action of ours. I consider that the policy announced by the Government last May is one that may antagonize potential friends and make of them actual foes. I hope that a settlement will be reached of the present differences between Australia and Japan which will be honourable and satisfactory to both countries. I trust that if Australia has any economic advantage it will realize that to push that economic advantage to its fullest extent, will result in the making of an enemy which will retaliate when it is able to do so. Japan's war needs may make it dependent on Australian wool. But that may not always be the case. Now is the time for the Commonwealth to make friends with Japan. The friendship of Japan can be won only by Australia doing nothing that might humilitate or permanently incense and alienate that country. The same thing applies to the United States of America. The American people speak our language, and are almost as closely akin to us as are the people of Great Britain. best terms of friendship with them.

One who has any sense-and I give the Minister credit for having some-mus t realize that it would not be of much use for a small country like Australia to demand that the policy of the United States of America should be changed by a government that was proceeding to a presidential election. We are all aware of the tremendous influence of the farmers' vote in the United States of America. We know that the farmers of that country are organized politically upon a non-partisan basis, that there is in the House of Representatives a farmers' bloc which comprises men of all parties -republicans , democrats, and representatives of the farmer labour group. It is probable that to-day That body is intent upon the protection of the American farmer against overseas competitors. Taking all these things into account, it seems to me that it was very unwise for this Government to antagonize the Government of the United States of America. It is a happy circumstance for us that the Democratic party has been returned to power. I believe that if the Commonwealth is more conciliatory-as it will have to be-it may obtain some concessions from the United States of We need to be on the America.

We should use our tariff for the protection of our own indusis reported as having saidtries; but having done that, we should not attempt to give greater concessions to one customer than to another. I disbelieve entirely in the closed-Empire policy expressed by the Ottawa agreement. We should be prepared to give preferences to Great Britain without demanding a return. I am in favour of the old jDolicy of preferences which Canada initiated in the 90's. I am opposed to the policy of bargaining between Australia and Great Britain, believing that that is the best way to arouse ill-feeling between the two countries. There has been more ill-feeling and friction since the Ottawa agreement was made than there was prior to that event. Australia should protect, maintain, and develop its own industries by means of the tariff, and should not use the tariff as a weapon of offence or aggression against any nation. believe that it would be a mild statement of the case to say that when the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) introduced his new trade policy-which , I think, is unique in the history of the Commonwealth-it came as a shock, not only to honourable members, but also, and to an even greater extent, to the community generally. I suppose that those who expected to benefit from it were in agreement with it ; but obviously, those adversely affected hope of restoring the turnover of overseas by it were opposed to it. The great mass of the Australian people were simply bewildered, and eagerly awaited some pronouncement by the Government as to the reason for the adoption of this new principle in tariff-making. I believe it was suggested that the action of the Government was taken at the instigation, or, at least, with the approval, of the Government of the United Kingdom; but although we waited expectantly for some expression of approbation from that Government, the only reference to it by a responsible British Minister that I have been able to find was made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Dominions, the Marquis of Hartington. a dinner of conservatives at Retford, that honourable gentleman expressed regret that the recent Australian tariff measures had not met with greateT gratitude. He Tlie Australians knew that the British textile trade was experiencing anxiety and that Lancashire was still despondent. Australia, of her own accord, and without solicitation, imposed almost prohibitive duties on American and Japanese goods in order to help Lancashire. the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Curtin) said. MrM c BRIDE The speaker continued» It was a generous and free gift. At least £1,500,000 worth of goods will be imported in the first year from Lancashire in excess ot previous years. It is wonderful that a government 13,000 miles away should ask its people to undergo considerable risks and losses to help a distressed section of the Old Country. That is the only expression of approbation from responsible people in B r it a in that I have come across. On the other hand, some time after this action was taken there was a pronouncement by the president of the Board of Trade, Mr. Walter Runciman, when speaking on Britain's trade policy. London, 16th July. Speaking on the Board of Trade vote in the House of Commons this evening, the president of the board ( Mr Walter Runciman) declared that Britain's commercial policy remained unchanged. It was founded on equality of opportunity for all nations, qualified only by the duty of others to play their part in the same general scheme. Only by the removal of the artificial restrictions which hampered multilateral international trade could there be any trade which Britain enjoyed before the crisis of 1931. Tho policy of developing overseas markets by trade agreements was being steadily pursued. Buti t seemed probable that for some time to come the hopes of British exporters would have to be concentrated mainly on the continued expansion of trade within the Empire and with other countries of the sterling area. Nevertheless, looking at the whole world, there were certain encouraging features. Statistics suggested that, in spite of the growth of economic nationalism, the levels of prosperity in individual countries tended to rise and fall together, although it was true special factors continued to retard progress in the gold bloc countries. In support of that statement the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) mentioned a number of trade treaties which GreatB r it a in had entered Speaking at into with other countries.

I suggest that if , in fact, we do get some advantage in .respect of meat-and we have not yet had f u l l particulars of the agreement-suc h benefits as are enjoyed under it are common to all the dominions. I desire to know what the other dominions did to deserve the benefits that they obtained, or is it a fact that Australia had to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for. all of the dominions'? ['Quorum formed.] I shall quote now an extract from the London Economist of the 30th May. 1936The general purpose of the import licence system is to enable Australia to refuse to buy from countries which do not buy to a corresponding extent from her-to take another step, that is to say, on the road towards bi-lataMl trade. No attempt is made to disguise the fact that Japan and the United States of America will be severely affected by these increases and there. are already signs of retaliation from Japan. British manufacturers mav expect some immediate benefit: and the president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce has stated that ""Australia's action will he very warmly appreciated in Lancashire"". From a wider point of view, however, Australia's new fiscal venture can only be regretted. It is calculated to reduce the volume of international trade and to hasten the lamentable tendency towards bilateralism. It is. indeed, precisely the kind of exclusive protectionism that gives some substance to the 1 economic grievances of the so-called "" dissatisfied powers "". It is clear that this policy has not met tries, it was that the Government in with great approbation, even in the countended--and , indeed, up to date it has try which it was intended should benefit, carried out this intention-to reduce most from it . In respect of the danger tariff duties as much as possible. Along of a bi -lateral trade policy I shall quote with that promise the Government underan extract from a speech by Professor took that any proposed alterations of the Lionel Bobbins, as reported in the Lloyd Bank Limited Monthly Review, of May, 1936. He saidBut tlie politicalization of trade is not the only, or, indeed, the chief, political danger of economic nationalism. The main danger is tlie worsening of relations between States of tlie so-called "" haves"" and "" have-nots"" of popular discussion-whic h it almost certainly A f t e r the trade involves, it is u commonplace of elementary economics, that so long as trade and investment are free, territorial possession is a matter of secondary importance. 1 suggest that, as Australia is a member It was not menof the British Commonwealth of Nations and, in the past, has been dependent very L it t l e reference has largely for its protection upon the might, of Great Britain, and w ill most probably the British authorities continue to be so dependent, it is unwise In any event, for us to embark upon a policy which may have the effect of causing international trouble at the present time. That possibility has been suggested by many. I recall that Professor Giblin, who cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as a free trader, has strongly criticized this action of the Government, and has pointed out the dangers that may result from it . Ho sa i d More broadly, looking at the gloomy international situation, one would have expected a conciliatory foreign .policy for the next few years, until international relations are improved, or we have at least done something adequate for defence. Two leading features of such a policy would be to enhance in every way our friendly relations with the United States of America, and to avoid with particular care any action calculated to provoke Japan. Both 'these important considerations appear to have been deliberately flouted. .1 agree with that view. F r o m a domestic point of view this action transgresses the policy which was enunciated, on behalf of this Government, in the policy speeches delivered by the Prime Ministeri n 1931, and 1934. I admit that the Prime Minister made certain qualifications when enunciating that policy. If there was one plank of the Government's policy, however, which appealed more than another to the people of Australia, particularly those engaged in the exporting industariff would be referred to the T a r i ff Board. As has been pointed out in this debate, that course simply conforms to the law of the land. This particular action, however, has been taken regardless of that undertaking. I am not quite clear as to whether it is the Government's intention to refer only reductions of tariff duties to the Tariff Board, whilst it w ill , itself, increase tariff duties willy nilly without reference to that tribunal. That point vrises most prominently in connection with the Government's action on this occasion. I do not hesitate to say that, unless the Government is prepared to give the fullest protection to our exporting industries and the consumers of this country by providing for investigation by the T a r i ff Boardi n respect of both reductions and increases of duties, I cannot possibly support its policy. Dealing with this matter as it affects cur trade with the United States of America, some honourable members have applauded the diversion of Australian trade from that country because it is a bad customer from our view-point. adopted in the interests of our own security. MrM c BRIDE T h a t was not stated that country, it should have adopted an by the Minister. If this action is claimed to be laudable, we are giving a lead to many countries, whb buy more from us than we take from them, to follow a similar course. that lead to us long ago. less, be encouraging them to take further action along those lines. The main point which I desire to discuss concerning the effect of this policy on the importation of American goods is the unequal treatment meted out in respect of different products of American origin. We find that, in respect of motor cars, the Government, in its wisdom-and I am not questioning its decision on this matteraccepted last year's importations as a -luota for future imports of motor cars from that country, while supplies of other articles from the United States of America have been cut off completely, and distributors of these latter goods will not be able to import even one of those particular articles. I contend that that discrimination is most unjust, and w i ll cause serious dislocation of the trade in Australia. Sir HENRYGULLETT C a n the honourable member suggest any discrimination as between items, or importers? MrM c BRIDE I do not suggest that any discrimination has been made as between importers of articles of the same class; but, whereas a distributor of motor cars w ill be allowed to import his last year's quota, a distributor of typewriters, or printin g machines, w ill not 'be allowed to import even one of those articles. Sir HENKYGULLETT T h a t is not the case in respect of typewriters. MrM c BRIDE If I am in error in that respect, I withdraw my statement, but I repeat that discrimination of the kind which I have just mentioned will occur in respect of many articles of American origin"". Instead of disorganizing the trade and commerce of this country in this way the Government should have given consideration to those who T h a t policy has been have been handling goods from the United States of America. If the Government desired to reduce imports from equitable method. Another feature of the trade diversion policy against which I protest is the licensing system, under which this Parliament has no control over imports. The kinds of goods and the quantities that may be admitted are l e f t to the discretion of the Minister or his department. This is a most improper for m of tariff-making. A t the present time we have no knowledge of the way in which the licensing system operates. Por a number of years certain by-law admissions have been permitted, and these involve a similar practice. Only recently the Government reduced, to a large extent, the number of items to be admitted under by-law, but, shortly afterwards, it brought down another list of over 40 items to which this system has been applied. I emphatically protest against the practice. Although Australia has been unable to effect a. trade agreement with the United States of America, certain goods were exported to that country before the trade diversion policy was put into effect.

263,Mr Mcbride.,"CASE or MRS. EREER. proposedThat tlie House do now adjourn. This morning, I asked the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) whether he would take steps to set up a committee of inquiry before which Mrs. Ereer might state her case. The Minister replied that notice had been given of a similar question, but I now see that the questionNumber6 on the notice-paper-ha s been deferred. This is a definite dodging of the issue, and is characteristic of the bungling methods which the Minister has adopted throughout the whole course of this unfortunate woman's case. This matter is one of urgency, and questions without notice are justified. We are seeking justice for a white British subject, and a woman at that. Nevertheless, we are told to place our questions on the notice paper, and when we do so the answers are deferred. Such behaviour will convince a majority of the public that the Minister for the Interior is a ""fourflusher "", and that offensive to me, and I ask that it be withdrawn. this matter was first raised, the Minister for the Interior stated that he had received information of an astounding nature regarding this adventuress, but that he could not, in decency, divulge it in He also expressed surprise at the terras the House for fear of besmirching the lilyof section 498 of the Indian penal code, white purity of honourable members. He added, however, that he would supply the information privately to honourable members if they so desired. The honourable would probably be offended if anyone regarded him as a paragon of purity, interviewed the Minister, who supplied him with certain information, but the honourable member has stated that he is not satisfied, and he has returned to the attack anxiety to strengthen his position that he again and again. At first I was under the impression that the Minister might have signed a document in connection with this case without being fully conversant with its contents. However, he has denied that, and he must, therefore, take all that is coming to him. The Minister, on the 20th October, refused Mrs. Freer permission to land in Australia, and on the 14th November, after many references had been made to the case, he stated that he was in possession of information justifying his act. Why, then, did he, after receiving a telegram from a certain person in Neutral Bay, send to this person the following letterI desire to thank you for your telegram of the 11th November in regard to Mrs. Freer. Although there is adequate information in the possession of my department to justify tlie action taken by me in this case, I am anxious to obtain as much corroboration as possible, particularly from people in Australia who know Mrs. Freer. In your telegram you refer to "" Vera Freer "". I presume that she is identical with Mrs. Mabel Magdalene Freer, which is the name of the person restricted from landing. I should be greatly obliged if you would kindly let me have any information which you possess regarding this woman. If the information is used, your name of course, would not be mentioned. An early reply would be greatly appreciated. Again thanking you for your telegram, This letter and the Minister's continued negotiations with the Indian Government seeking further information indicate that he is doubtful of Mrs. Freer's identity. Apart from this, the Minister, according to press reports, has been in touch with this person by telephone. On Monday, the 16th November, he telephoned thanking him for the information he had supplied, and asking if he thought that Mrs. Vera Freer and Mrs. Mabel Magdalene Freer were one and the same person. which provides that any man who entices a wife away, or causes her to be taken away from the protection of her husband, even if she is not living with him, is liable to a penalty of two years' imprisonment. This shows how anxious the Minister was to build up a case against this woman. His case should have been complete before he debarred her from entering Australia. So great was his not only communicated with this man by telephone, but also wrote him a letter and then sent a trusted servant by car from Canberra to interview him. Fearing that the presence of a Government car outside his residence would cause comment, it was left in Martin-place, and",75,Henby Gulletx A Most Im Unequal Natural Resources And Populations

It is alleged that before he left for Sydney, the departmental officer was given a letter which the Government had received from Indiai n connection w i th this case. This letter has been denied to honourable members, but extracts from it were read to the informer at Neutral Bay. I understand that it says that Mrs. Ereer is supposed to be divorced from her husor the Government to deal with band, and that she is a "" good-looker"". Asked man to Mrs. Vera Freer, the man replied "" Definitely yes"". vant then said, "" I feel sure that the two women are one and the same."" After thanking the man for the information tendered he asked whether he could identify Mrs. Freer, and received the reply ""Yes, if she were in Australia."" The interview then closed, the officer being given a letter to take back to the Ministeri n which the Neutral Bay man asked for work in return for information which he considered might be of great value both to the Minister and the Government. To that letter, the Minister replied as follows:I am in receipt of your letter of the 10th November and desire to thank you for the information which you have been good enough to furnish. With regard to tlie other matter you menperson tion, I regret that I am not in a position to Even at this late hour, in the assist you, but you may rest assured that immediately I hear of something that would suit you, I shall use my best endeavours on your behalf. That shows to what depths the Minister is prepared to stoop in order to damn a woman. Yet, he has stated in the House quite frequently that before he took action he had adequate information which justified him in debarring Mrs. Freer from landing in Australia. it seems strange indeed that he should write such a letter on the 13th November, action to prevent Mrs. Freer from landing in Australia having been taken by him on the 20th October.
