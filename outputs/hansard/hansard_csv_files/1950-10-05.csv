Prime Minister a question regarding a broadcast -which I understand from the press that he proposes to make this evening and one on another evening concerning prices and subjects related thereto. Does the right honorahle gentlewhich proceedings could be taken against man propose to make these broadcasts over the Australian Broadcasting Commission network as well as that of the commercial stations? If that is his intention, will his address contain political propaganda or will it merely be a general recital of the facts of the economic position? If the broadcast is to activities of the Communist party. The contain propaganda and political matter will the Prime Minister see that the same opportunity is given to the Opposition to broadcast over national stations? the full arrangements that have been made, but I understand that the addresses will bc -broadcast over at least some national stations and over certain commercial stations of which I cannot supply a list at the moment. When the question of the broadcasts being transmitted from national stations arose I , myself, took up the question whether, iri the event of some statement in it being regarded as controversial, as it well might be, the same opportunity could be given to the Leader of the Opposition. If these broadcasts contain any such controversial matter, as I have a faint suspicion that they will, I shall do everything I can do to .provide a similar opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition.

If so, for how long has it had this evidence? Are there Commonwealth laws under those involved? If so, why has no action been taken by the Government? mation before the present Government which differs in any marked degree from the information that was -before the previous Government in relation to the honourable gentleman falls into the error of thinking that there should be either a prosecution for high treason or no action at all. This Government does not take that view. There are many degrees of activity which fall' short of provable high treason. They are the activities with which we are proposing to deal in the bill the passage of which is now 'being deliberately obstructed in another place.",8,Setup

If so, what steps will applicants be required to take in order to obtain such refunds ? the honourable member has referred has been under consideration by the Taxation Branch for some time. It is not so easy of solution as might appear at .first glance. It involves many difficulties and has been referred to the special committee of experts.

General aware that the Western Suburbs District Ambulance, which is an organization serving the whole of the western suburbs of Sydney, has an important scheme to provide two-way wireless communication with its ambulances? I may explain that the scheme will save a great deal of time in the handling of urgent cases. Does the Minister know that the operation of this scheme is held up only by the lack of a telephone line from the head-quarters of the ambulance station to the wireless ' organization, a distance of about one mile? Will the honourable gentleman have the matter investigated urgently with a view to seeing whether that line can be provided without delay? member has made personal representations to me on several occasions about the matter to which he has referred, and I am having it investigated. I realize the importance of ambulance work, and the necessity for the telephone in this instance. If it can possibly be provided, it will be. USE a question to the Minister for Air, and by way of explanation, I point out that the wet season in north Queensland is rapidly approaching, and a long-range forecast has been issued to the effect that throughout Queensland, does the Minister a severe cyclone is due to hit that area this year. Should that occur, it is quite possible that, because of flood conditions, work, and thus breaking faith with the the orthodox ambulance aircraft may not be able to land. Will the Minister inform me whether the Royal Australian Air Force will be able to station a helicopter in north Queensland that will be immediately available for use in an emergency and under flood conditions? was taken by departmental officers in this when I was in Great Britain and the and not .under any personal direction from United States of America recently, to me. The officers are very anxious to try out various makes of helicopters and to see the uses to which they could be put. I am satisfied that those machines can be used with much greater effect in Australia on rescue and ambulance flights helicopters to enable members of the Labour party to escape from this Parliament. Some of those machines have been ordered for the Royal Australian Air Force, and one of them will ultimately be stationed in Queensland. Meanwhile, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Department of Civil Aviation will co-operate in any relief work that may be necessary, as they have done in the past. Postmaster-General inform me whether it is a fact, as reported, that the Queensland Postal Workers Union was approached by his department, acting under his instructions, with a request to allow its members to work overtime on Saturdays in order to overtake the lag in the installation of new telephone services, particularly in country areas? Is it also a fact that members of the union agreed reluctantly to work overtime on Saturadys, but that after having worked OF HELICOPTERS. on four Saturdays, they were informed that no more such work would be carried out because the department had over-spent the amount of money that had been allocated for the purpose? In view of the lag in providing new telephone services consider that the action of the department in discontinuing Saturday overtime union, was in the best interests of the public?

In the areas in question there are, speaking in general terms, neither private nor public telephones. installation of the public telephones which has been approved is held up at the present time, apparently owing to a shortage of coin containers. Will the Mmister inform me when coin containers will be available, and if they will not be readily available, whether some substitute means could be adopted so that those public telephones may be made available for the use of people in my electorate? honourable member when it is possible to do something along the lines that he has suggested. As everybody knows, there is a shortage of certain essential equipment connected with the installation of telephones, including the apparatus that he has referred to. We are doing our utmost to overcome the shortages both by encouragement of the manufacture of those particular instruments in Australia and also by importing equipment, but despite all those efforts a very distinct shortage still exists at present. tion to the Minister for Labour and National Service concerning the slow turn-round of ships at Australian ports, which has led to a 10 per cent, increase of freight charges. Is it a fact, as has been suggested in some quarters, that the slow turn-round has been aggravated by the red-tape methods of Customs authorities on the wharfs? If so, will the Minister take the matter up with the Minister for Trade and Customs with a view to eliminating this red-tape or bottle-neck ? contribute to the deplorably slow turnround of ships in Australian ports. Thc aspect to which the honourable member has referred, though I cannot accept his definition of it as red tape on the part of the Customs authorities, has been investigated already by the Minister for Trade and Customs and a great deal of improvement has been effected in the method of clearing ships by Customs officers as the result of action that he has taken. I shall refer the question to my colleague with a view to obtaining a more The detailed reply to the question. failure of the Government, after almost twelve months in oflice, to put value back into the £1, will the Treasurer inform the House whether the Government intends to make all increases of age, widow, invalid and soldiers' pensions effective retrospectively to the lst January, 1950? Will he also, inform the House whether he intends to grant proportional increases of payments in respect of the wives and other dependants of invalid pensioners? Notwithstanding the statement by the right honourable gentleman earlier this week that questions such as this make him tired, I crave his indulgence on this occasion because I am firmly convinced that the people of Australia also are very tired of waiting for this Government to take some action to counteract the dwindling value of the fl. the latter part of the honourable member's question. If , as the lionorable member has stated, the people of Australia are tired I direct a quesof the continued increase of the cost of living, I suggest that the reason for their tiredness is that during the last eight years of administration by the political party to which the honourable member belongs, nothing was done to check the inflationary spiral. I shall not anticipate the provisions of the budget now or make any forecast concerning them, hut I assure the honourable member that age pensioners and all other sections of the community will be more sensibly and generously treated by the present Government than tbey were hy the previous Government.",15,Telephone Services

Since a contributing cause of that situation is the acute shortage of office space because a great deal of space that was acquired by Commonwealth and .State authorities during the war is still occupied by them, will the Minister assure the House that the Australian Government has reduced its demands on oflice space to a minimum, and that it is not holding space for which it has no immediate use? make the maximum amount of office space available to the business community, a committee was recently appointed to investigate the amount of office space held honourable member. by government departments in all capital cities. Reports have been received from that committee and have been considered, and when a final decision is made it will be possible to release certain space to the business community. The Government does not intend to retain space that is not efficiently used by its departments. for Supply aware that although the Queensland shipbuilding industry is acutely short of steel, large quantities of that metal are stored at Newcastle awaiting shipment to Queensland? Will the honourable gentleman inform the House why the shipping companies refused to call for labour to load SS. Babinda for the 5 p.m. shift last Friday, and also for the S a..m. shift the following day? Is he also aware that waterside workers at Newcastle are frequently sent home early because sufficient steel is not available for loading to justify a shift being worked and also because the steel arrives at the wharfs too hot to be handled? Has the Weaver, the secretary of the Newcastle branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, concerning this matter, in the course of which he asked that a complete investigation be made of all matters affecting the hold-no of carsro in the port of Newcastle? Will the Minister order an investigation to be made of all aspects of the hold-up of cargo in the port of Newcastle, more particularly in its effects upon the shipbuilding industry? mentioned by the honourable member concern the administration of my colleague, the Minister for Labour ancl National Service, and I shall discuss them with him. Concerning the general matter of steel supplies, it is true that the Queensland ship building industry is short of steel, and it is also true that approximately 75,000 tons of steel has accumulated on the wharfs at Newcastle because of the slow turn-round of ships, which is a state of affairs that is almost intolerable. I shall not attempt to apportion the blame for it at the moment, but after 1 have discussed the matter with my colleague, I shall communicate with the Health give urgent consideration to thc need for erecting a modern infectious diseases hospital as an entirely separate unit, and quite apart from the present Canberra Community Hospital, in order that the present isolation block at that hospital may be taken into use to meet the needs of this rapidly expanding community ? the honourable member's suggestion and communicate my decision to him in due course. for Labour and National Service in a position to inform honourable members whether the full bench of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has yet fixed a date to announce the result of the basic wage inquiry, which has been before the court for so long? the matter, but I shall bring the honourable member's question to the notice of the Attorney-General, who is the appropriate Minister to answer questions concerning the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and pn^oovour to obtain some information for him.",16,Pensions

Nobody has yet heen able to discover which particular importers applied for the refunds, which importers who applied for the refunds and received them passed that money on to the persons who bought the timber from them, or which importers applied for the refund of duty and put the money into their own pockets. It is my belief that the amount of money involved in these transactions runs into tens of thousands of 'pounds, and that it has jrone into the pockets of the importing interests in this country who weighed in Mr Cahoell. the action of the Minister in antedating and reckoning the two months' imports at 6s. per 100 super feet, we find that importing season in the year. member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), who spent a quarter of a century in the timber industry as a wage-earner, would know a good deal about that. Not only did the Minister remit the duty on the timber nsed during that period, but he reduced the duty on the timber that was in bond during the same period. He continued these reductions subsequent to the 24th February, 1950, and made them applicable until the 30th June of this year. That was not to be the last of the story, because* the importers would get a refund on all timber that they sold subsequently, out there was no guarantee that the reduction in the duty would be passed on to the people who would buy the timber to build houses subsequent to the 24th February this year. Not any of the Ministers administering prices control measures were consulted at any stage, and imported timber to-day is clearer in",20,Customs Duty On Timber Formal Motion For Adjournment
65,Mr Rosevear,That is the heaviest,21,Customs Duty On Timber Formal Motion For Adjournment
66,Mr Calwell,"The honorablesome States of Australia than nativegrown timber. So the people are getting no benefit from the reduction of duty. Those, who are getting the benefit are the importing interests. The Minister subsequently found that thei'e was a difficulty under the general international trade agreement made some time ago. He found that overseas interests were pointing out that the I2jr per cent, ad valorem duty was contrary to the international trade agreement which this Parliament had ratified, because it considerably increased the margin of preference in that agreement for Canadian timber, which is admitted free. The reference I am making to imported timber now relates to foreign timber, that is non-British timber, because Canadian and other timber which 13 grown inside the British Commonwealth is admitted free of duty. Then the Minister decided that he would distribute more largesse to the foreign timber interests at the expense of the Australian community and to the detriment of a large Australian industry in which millions of pounds are invested and many thousands of good Australians are employed. He brought down a by-law on the Sth June, 1950, under which he applied the preferential margins to which Australia is bound by the Geneva Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. TJnder that by-law, undressed boards are now admitted at the rate of ls. per 100 super, feet and dressed boards at the rate of 2s. per 100 super, feet. Thus the position has gone from bad to worse. On the 10th December last, foreign timber interests paid duty at the rate of 13s. per 100 super, feet on timber imported into this country. In February, that rate was reduced, by the Minister to a range of from 6s. to 7s. Gd. per 100 super, feet, and under the by-law of the Sth June last, the rate was reduced to ls. per 100 super, feet of dressed timber and 2s. per 100 super, feet of undressed timber. {Extension of time granted.] I shall summarize the story of this the Government. If the Government will political wrong-doing. What happened not appoint a royal commission to inquire was that without parliamentary sancinto this matter, then, perhaps, the Senate tion, without tariff board authority, will nnpoint a select committee to ascerwithout any consultation with Austain the facts. tralian sawmillers, without, or, indeed, in spite of, departmental Bdvice, the Minister for Trade and Custonis, for the personal and pecuniary benefit of the. Government's political friends among timber importers, reduced the duty on imported timber from 13s. per 1.00 super, feet to a range of from 6s. to 7s. 6d. per 100 super, feet and later to ls. per 100 super, feet of undressed timber and 2s. per 100 super, feet of dressed timber. That was bad enough, but, then, the importing interests, seeing what a racket was operating in this country, decided that' they themselves, had better benefit from it. So they ran up the price of timber on their own Australian agents. They were not going to let their Australian agents reap all the benefit. The price had gone up to the importing interests and, therefore, it must go up to the Australian people who must buy timber with which to construct homes. The argument that home builders are now likely to benefit by securing cheaper homes from what the Government has done since it applied its by-law of the 10th December, is so much nonsense. The saw-milling interests in Australia are very worried about the whole matter. If the same quantity of timber is imported this year as was imported in 194S, the duty remitted 'between the 10th December and the 17th February would total approximately £519,000. The position is so bad that nothing less than a royal commission is needed to inquire into ali of the ramifications of this business. The House is entitled to know who got the money that was remitted. We are entitled to know how many honest men among the timber importers, having applied for refund, passed it on to purchasers of their timber. We are entitled to know whether any importers were so disgusted with the business and had so much moral decency that they refused to touch the refund, but left it as tainted money in the hands of able member may not anticipate anything item that has already been validated by that the Senate may do. display of governmental patronage and by-law in respect of its proposals of the favouritism of its own supporters is Sth June last when those proposals hadnauseating.

The result was that the net exercised by various groups who have axes gain to the Australian home-builder was to grind, and whose interests do not coinprecisely nil. with that in my speech. the case in favour of the abolition of not to listen to the powerful voices of those the tariff on imported softwoods is groups of smug, successful individuals, unanswerable. Eveni f the tariff is who are already well consolidated, but abolished there will be no incentive for who are seeking at every opportunity to Canadian exporters of soft woods to inimprove their positions.

However, I do praise the stand taken by the honourable member for Gellibrand. In fact, he expressed very clearly the reasons that caused the Government to admit timber for building purposes under by-law. He has appealed to us to revise our tariff schedules. should not deny his previous utterances. However, the fact is that the present tariff schedules were approved by previous Parliaments after proper inquiry by the Tariff Board. Nevertheless, members of the Government applaud the honourable member's plea for cheaper timber for home-builders. The object of the Government in admitting certain timber under by-law was not only to decrease the price of timber but also to increase the quantity available. knows the difficulties which confront home-builders to-day, and any action that is intended to increase the supply of timber and to reduce its price should have the approval of the Parliament. Indeed, when we were in Opposition we put that point of view to the Chifley Government again and again. The present honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who was the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in that Administration, expressed approval of our representations, but nothing was done. In contrast with our attitude is that of Labour when it was in office. The previous Government waived the tariff on steel imported for our railways. Although a large quantity of steel was imported from Japan for that purpose, no protests were made by the Australian steel industry. Its attitude is in contrast with that adopted by the hardwood millers, who form a powerful pressure-group in this country. Because they feared that the importation of timber for home construction might adversely affect their interests, they enlisted the aid of the honourable member for Melbourne, who submitted the motion I have no doubt that that we are now discussing. The honourable member accused the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) of having taken illegal action, but there was no illegality involved in admitting timber under by-law. The plain fact is that the honourable member had his leg pulled by a powerful pressure group, and I am sure that he must now feel sorry that he raised the matter. The admission of timber for homebuilding under by-law represents an attempt by the Government to honour its pledge to the people to restore value to the £1. Over and over again, members of the Opposition have complained that the Government is not doing anything to restore value to the £1. Now they are acting as spokesmen for a group of merchants that is endeavouring to frustrate the Government's efforts to reduce the cost of home-building. I take this opportunity to assure a certain member of the Opposition from South Australia who will, I know, take part in the debate, that the timber that will be admitted Every honourable member by the Government will be of different variety from that produced in Australia, and will not compete unfairly with Australian timber millers. The honourable member for Gellibrand referred to the possibility of obtaining oregon from Sweden, but he should realize that Sweden does not produce Oregon. Eor years oregon has been admitted under by-law because it is used most extensively in coal mines as pit props. It has qualities which are not found in hardwood timbers, and it is admitted duty free under by-law. Therefore, the suggestion made by the honourable member for Gellibrand that the competition of Scandinavian timber exporters would regulate the price of Canadian timber imported to this country does not",27,Customs Duty On Timber Formal Motion For Adjournment

Furthermore, the concession has been Both Ministers who have spoken, and made retrospective, which is all to the also the honourable member for Gellibrand good.

108,Mr Rosevear,"That is so. I amof affairs exists there should be a remission of duty as an encouragement of the importation of timber from whatever sources it can be obtained. One important fact that we have to recognize is that Australia is not the only oountry in the world that has a housing problem. Our housing problein arises not from the destruction of homes in war-time but from a lag in the rate of construction. On the other hand, the problem faced by many other parts of the world is not a problem of lag in construction but a problem of reconstruction, as a result of war damage. We are competing in the world timber market witli war-torn countries which require the same timbers as we are seeking. I admit that international competition for timber makes it impracticable for the Government to continue to exact exorbitant tariffs on tiinber that comes from alternative sources of supply overseas, in view of the fact that Australia's own sources cannot supply our demand. If tbe Government had decided to remit the tariff as from a certain future date its action would have given f a ir warning not only to the importers of timber hut also to the consumers, and I should have had no complaint to make. My complaint, however, is that the Government back-dated the remission of tariff to a date so f a r back that it was absolutely impossible for anybody to trace what became of the timber upon which the remissions were granted. That is the point at issue and not the question of whether there ought to be alternative or additional supplies imported from overseas. If it wore only a question of alternative supplies I should admit immediately that the Government's action was correct. But as the position is, the Government has not only deprived the Treasury of the tariff due9 that should have been paid on the timber concerned, but also by antedating the application of these remissions, given what amounts to a cash grant to the importing interests, because, as I have pointed out, it is now impossible to trace where the supplies on which the retrospective remission was granted went to. that it is corruption. there is no proof that those remissions of duty from the date that was fixed retrospectively have given any immediate benefit to home-builders in Australia. On the other hand, I again emphasize that, because it is impossible to trace where the timber on which the retrospective remissions were granted went to, those remissions amount to a cash grant by the Government to the importers. That is the point at issue. I am not questioning the need for Australia to obtain supplies of timber from wherever it can obtain them. The Minister concerned has admitted in reply to a question in another place that the Government had no means of checking up on whether the concession represented by the remissions had ever been passed on to Australian home-builders. master-General) [12.13] -On e would think, after listening to what honourable members opposite have had to say in connection with this matter, that they have no doubt that a scandal of very gigantic dimensions exists and requires probing to the bottom. If any matter requires probing to the bottom it is the propriety of some of the administrative acts in the Department of Tra.de and Customs during the regime of the former Labour Government. I exclude from that remark the last Minister for Trade and Customs, Senator Courtice, because I believe that no more honest man than he lives in this country. The whole point at issue in this matter is not -whether it is necessary, as honourable members opposite have said, for foreign timber to be imported dutyfree in order to overcome the shortage of building timbers in this country. The point is whether the Ministerf or Trade and Customs took an unprecedented step in back-dating remissions of duty so that certain persons received a benefit. That is the scandal, if I may use that word, that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) is trying to establish.

Despite the criticism from honourable members of the Opposition, I am proud to be associated with such a Minister for Trade and Customs as Senator O'Sullivan, who has taken this action for the backing of the Australian home-builder. The Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) has made the same mistake in regard to this motion as have previous speakers on the Government side. assumed that this is an attack on the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) because he made timber available when it was in short supply in Australia so as to meet the needs of the consuming public. Thai is not the ground of the attack that is made on the Minister. The Minister has been criticized for having acted in regard to the admission of timber in a way that is not in accordance with the Customs Act. He has been criticized for having given a rebate on timber that was admitted into Australia between the 10th December, 1949, and the 17th February, 1950. Honourable members of the Opposition question whether what has transpired is in accordance with the Customs Act and whether the consuming public received the benefit of the remissions. This matter has been raised in order that the interests of the consuming public may be protected. I remind honourable members that this subject was raised by me in a series of questions that I asked in the House on the 15th June last. One of the questions that I asked wasWhat steps, if any, have heen taken by the Government to see that the importers pass TJnder such circumstances this timber these refunds on to the purchasers of the timber may have been sold and re-sold several concerned ? The reply given to me by the Minister applied ancl obviously the person who wasAs regards importations, benefiting by conof the remission. The great bulk of the cessions, which have been sold at thc dutyconsumers would not know whether the paid price it will be a matter for the purchasers or users to approach the importers for timber they had purchased had been suba price adjustment corresponding with the ject to a rebate of duty because they would duty rebate. It is known that a number of not know whether it had -come into Ausimporters has made these adjustments but as regards any who do not, enforcement is not tralia before or after the 10th December. practicable. The references by the Postmaster-General to what transpired in previous years are not an answer to what has been put forward by the Opposition. Section 151 of the Customs Act provides that before any remission of duty is made in regard to any goods the Minister shall refer to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report the necessity for reduced duties and shall not take any action until such time as he has received a report from the board. On the 17th February last the statement was made that duties would be remitted They have in regard to these timbers and that the remission of duty would operate from the preceding 10th December. At that time there had been no reference of the matter to the Tariff Board and no notification of the application to the Parliament. In fact, up to the present moment, there has been no ratification by the Parliament of this reduction of duties. Although the matter was referred to the Tariff Board for consideration that was not done until July of this year and, up to the present moment, the Tariff Board has not made inquiries into it. Nobody objects to the Minister exercising powers . conferred upon him under an act, but the action he has taken is not in conformity with the act and the Opposition is concerned about the possibility that those who have purchased this timber will not benefit from the remissions of duties. Timber that comes into this country first of all passes through the hands of the importer. It goes from the importer to the merchant and from the merchant to the builder or the carpenter or, in many cases, is bought direct by the public. times during the two and a half months during which the remission of duty first imported it would get the advantage I think that the whole matter requires",30,Customs Duty On Timber Formal Motion For Adjournment
114,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [12.20],"the attention of the House. It is a grave matter that although the Parliament has decided that the duties on specified material shall be a certain amount a Minister should, at a later stage, reduce the duties so imposed. The matter is even graver when that is done without reference to the Tariff Board as is prescribed in the 'Customs Act. Honourable members, Avhether on the Government side or the Opposition side of the House, should be concerned at all times to see that the rights and decisions of the Parliament shall not be swept aside or treated lightly by those who administer departments. It is necessary to ensure that the consumers shall be protected and the House should be made clearly aware of what action the Government proposes to take to see that all those who received the remissions of duty in connection with the importation of this timber during the period of two and a half months shall pass on such remissions to those who ultimately purchase arid use the timber. -As one of the persons referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr time to time. I shall quote a letter from Calwell) as having approached the Minister in regard to this matter, I shall not be wasting the time of the' House if I expound my views to honourable members. This matter should be lightly brushed, aside, because obviously the honourable member for Melbourne has made a mistake. That has been proved by the speech of the honourable ' member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens), who cut the ground from under the feet of the honourable member for Melbourne wben he said that the tem porary tariff revision should be made permanent. On the 17th February last, the Minister brought down a by-law providing for the temporary reduction of the tariff on imported timber. He did that in a very laudable attempt to increase the number of houses built in Australia through assistance to the timber industry. On behalf of some hardwood timber interests, a number of honourable members waited on the Minister to ascertain whether this was to be a temporary or a permanent arrangement. We did not want the alteration to be permanent, because this country is building up a magnificent timber industry, in which a great deal of capital has been sunk and a large number of men employed. There are photographs before me, which honourable members may see, of the first-class homes that have been built for workers in the timber industry. They would not have been built at great cost out in the bnsh unless some protection of this sort eould have been hoped for. At the moment the Australian sawmillers know that they could not possibly meet the great demand for timber and therefore offer no objection to a temporary reduction of duty, but, if a foreign timber began to be dumped here the future of the sawmillers and the bush timber workersa most hazardous occupation-mus t be protected and assured of continuity. We asked the Minister whether it was a permanent or a temporary measure, and he said that he would allow the timber to enter the country at a reduced duty for a brief period in order to assist our housing programme. He told, the timber interests that this matter would be reviewed from the timber interests in which their attitude is indicatedIn the first place we repeat that we appreciate f u l ly the expressed desire of the Government to obtain more timber and cheaper homes for the people, and we assert that that worthy ideal will not be obtained by the reduction of duty on imported timber. The timber interests were satisfied at that time that the Government intended this reduction to be a temporary expedient. The honourable member for Melbourne has fallen into error, as has the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey), in making an issue of this matter, because the Chifley Government approved reductions of duty without reference to the Tariff Board, following the tariff negotiations at Geneva in 1947 under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That is a reply to the charges of the honourable member for Bendigo, who al3o said that no attack was being made on the Minister because he had tried to make home-building cheaper, but that Opposition members were concerned about the retrospective remission of duty. It will be seen from the",32,Customs Duty On Timber Formal Motion For Adjournment

The speeches of honourable members opposite have resolved themselves into an attack on this Government for its attempt to improve the housing position. The Opposition is interested to know what happened to the money repaid to importers for timber imported between the 10th December February. about £100,000, which was arrived at by taking one-sixth of the year, or two months, as a basis, during which 173,000,000 super, feet at 6s. per 100 super, feet would be involved. honourable member for Melbourne knows that in New South Wales and Victoria at this time there was a strict scrutiny of timber prices by price-fixing authorities, and that any concession made to au importer would be immediately taken into consideration by them, and would be reflected in the price allowed to be charged. have happened in regard to price-fixing in New South Wales. Tremendous pressure has been brought to bear on price fixing authorities, as the Labour party well knows. A big increase of the price of timber was requested by certain interests, but that matter need not be discussed at present. Because something has been mentioned about action being taken in another place, which may be a serious thing, honourable members of this House should know that the price fixing authorities relate the price of timber to all the factors of production. They investigate every phase of production and the processing of timber from the felling of the trees through thesaw-milling, the transport to wharf or siding in the country, the transport to the merchant in the capital city and the final purchase by the retailer. Every operation is costed and priced by a corps1 have a copy of of accountants connected with the price fixing authority. honourable meniber for East Sydney( Mr. Ward) knows a good deal about timber,, because lie has had more experience than most of us and has been connected with some eminent gentlemen in the timberindustry. timber was sold before the rebate was made? Timber does not move so quickly. It is supplied to the millers in logs, and must be processed before it can be sold. and the IVth During the relevant period the ChristmasThe sum mentioned was holidays of two or three weeks intervened, ancl then the tiinber had to be sawn and' stacked and had to undergo other operations. Probably not much was sold between the 10th December and the 17tb The February. I consider that the honourable member for Melbourne wasted the timeof the House when he brought up this matter.

When a large amount of capital has been put into an industry and a large number of men are engaged in it, the Government should see that nervousness about its future shall not affect its prospects. able member's time has expired. It is perfectly obvious to everybody in the House that the originators of the motion were not concerned about timber being imported. They believe that they could embarrass the Government and prove that it was involved in a scandal of the first magnitude. In spite of the strenuous efforts of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) to redeem the position, we all have a very clear picture of the Leader of the Opposition claiming that the only issue was what happened to the rebate of duty. So it is quite clear that the only thing actuating the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in making his statement was the belief that he had something against the Government. That belief remained until the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) rose and "" wiped the floor "" with him.

I should be sorry if he were, because that wonld indicate that even in such a role he puts up a very poor show. It is wrong to say that the local timber interests cannot supply most of the timber required by this country. They supply up to 90 per cent, of our requirements at present, and poor transport is the reason why timber is not available in all quarters. I ask honourable members opposite to say whether they have ever heard of a remitted tax. They probably get rake-offs themselves every time the Commissioner of Taxation gives them a rebate on their income tax. It is wrong to say that the local timber interests object to the importation of timber for a specific period.

132,Mr Bowden,"The motion indicatesdebate has extended far beyond the question that is before the Chair. The desirability of reducing import duties on timber for a certain period, or entirely, has nothing to do with the subject-matter of the motion. It is curious that three Ministers should find it necessary to attempt to justify an act of administration. The Minister for the Interior Minister for Trade and Customs in this chamber, made one important remark when he said that the departmental officers were in favour of much of the action that has been taken. The Minister used that phrase and I inferred from it that some of the action was taken without the approval of those officers. Does the Minister say that that is not correct? responsibility for all administrative acts. portant, because the issue is not whether timber should be admitted free of duty or at a reduced duty in order to meet a shortage of timber for housing construction. That is not controverted as a principle provided certain safeguards are observed. The reduction of duty on timber was made retrospective in respect of the period from the 10th December to the 17th February last. mon practice. respects, but the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and other members of the Opposition want to know why the remission of duty was ante-dated in respect of that period. The Minister for the Interior said that at that time certain quantities of timber were held in stock. How much of that timber had not then been sold? What steps have been taken by the Government to ascertain whether any of it was unsold? What persons, or firms, benefited from this concession without the public or retailers obtaining any benefit whatever and without a single home-builder receiving any benefit from it, either directly or indirectly? That is the real issue. We are entitled to have from the Government details of the per[13] sons, or firms, who gained a benefit from these remissions. spective concessions that were made by the previous Government? details of any action of that kind that may have been taken by the previous Government. In this instance, the House is entitled to know how much of the benefit resulting from these remissions was gained by the public or homebuilders. If home-builders did benefit, the Government has a complete answer to the motion; but the Minister for the Interior has not said that the public benefited to any degree whatever as the result of these remissions of duty. It is clear that the Government cannot answer that question. We have been told that it is difncult to ascertain details of that kind. I repeat that the House is entitled to know to what degree, if at all, the public or timber dealers benefited from these remissions. If no such benefit accrued to them the remissions cannot be justified. To the degree that the public benefited, the action taken by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) can be justified. I shall say nothing with respect to the technical aspect of the Government's action. However, if , as would appear to be the fact, the puhlic did not benefit the repayment of these moneys was made for the benefit of certain individuals. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) said that the remissions would be taken into account in the fixation of prices of timber. However, after listening to the debate one naturally inquires whether the remissions were actually taken into account in that way. None of the three ministers who have spoken in this debate has said that that was actually done. Did the various State price fixing authorities reduce the price of timber imported during the period I have indicated? Such action would have been most appropriate in view' of the large sum of money involved. vant figures in totals. the totals.

142,Dr. Evatt,"I am not satisfied withwhether the benefits of these remissions were passed on to the public by a corresponding adjustment of prices of timber that was imported between the 10th December and the 17th February last, or in the ordinary flow of business. If that was not done then the action of the Government was entirely unwarranted. In view of the statement by the Minister for the Interior that much of the action that was taken by the Government was recommended by departmental oflieers we are entitled to ask him to lay the relevant file on the table in order to give ing commodities. The Government's an opportunity to honourable members to peruse it. The Opposition is not questioning any concession that may have been given in respect of timber imported during a period of emergency that can be related to the shortage of houses. We are concerned whether the importers alone derived benefit from such a concession. If they did, the remissions simply constituted profit paid to them without any corresponding benefit being passed on to tbe public. The Ministers who have spoken have not answered that question which is the substance of the submission by the honorahle member for Melbourne. The House is entitled to particulars that will enable honourable members to ascertain who reaped the benefit from these remissions or from any proportion of them without any benefit being passed on to the public. Those facts have not been given to the House. perfectly obvious that the Opposition is annoyed because the Government has done in a few months what the previous Government failed to do during the years that it was in office. When the Labour Government was ejected from office last December, the construction of thousands of houses which had been built to wall height was held up because timber for roof construction could not be obtained. In addition, many persons held vacant building blocks and were waiting for supplies of materials to commence construction of homes. As the result of the prompt action that this Government has taken, those houses have been completed and to-day are occupied by returned soldiers and widows, whilst on the thousands of building allotments that were previously vacant houses are now under construction or have been completed. The official figures show that in May last almost twice as many houses were in course of construction than the number that was being constructed in May, 1949. honourable member to confine his remarks to the question before the Chair. sulted largely from the reduction of import duties on timber and other buildprompt action in this matter has enabled progress to be made. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) is grizzling because he says the departmental oflieers did not approve in some respects of the Government's action. The day when departmental oflieers ran this country has gone. Now the elected representatives of the people are running it. During the preceding eight years Labour governments allowed so-called experts to dictate their policy. Because Labour took value out of the £1, one of the great problems that confronts the present Government is to reduce prices wherever possible. By taking the action that the Opposition now criticizes, the Government has reduced the price of Baltic timber by 3s. a 100 super, feet and weather boards by from 2s. 3d. and 2s. 9d. a 100 super, feet. The ex-servicemen and widows have benefited from the reduction. the remissions of import duty were passed on to home-builders? which has a Liberal government, the reduction was certainly passed on. Whether it was passed on in New South WalesI do not know, but honourable members opposite should ask the Labour Government of that State whether its price fixing authorities did their job in that respect. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan), in remitting these duties, did not depart, from the practice that has been recognized by the Parliament for a great many years. Obviously, certain quantities of timber would be held in stock at the date on which the remissions were made, and it would be grossly unfair to apply this",36,Customs Duty On Timber Formal Motion For Adjournment

147,Mr Wilson,"In South Australia,benent in respect of timber that might be imported the day after the duty was reduced and, at the same time, deny the benefit in respect of timber that was then held in stock. The Minister acted quite in accordance with practice when he dated the remissions back to a convenient date. It is quite ludicrous for honourable members apposite to suggest that timber is sold the day after the merchant receives it. Such a statement shows complete lack of knowledge of business methods. When a merchant receives timber he must mill and cut it. It is most improbable that timber would leave the factory within three months after the date on which the merchant received it. Therefore, it is quite proper tb apply any reduction of import duty to stocks that may be on hand. It is obvious, as the Minister for the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr given to that question, and it was as Calwell) moved his motion purely as the stooge of the timber millers in Victoria. Eepresentatives of those interests interviewed me and asked me to protest against the remission of these duties. I refused to do so. I pointed out to them that South Australia was screaming out for timber and that building authorities in that State had sufficient finance to purchase all of the timber that millers in Victoria could produce, but those millers could not take up that offer. prattle, of course, has been employed as -Indeed, they are not able to meet demands for timber in Victoria itself. In any event, they have nothing to fear in this matter because there is a grave shortage of timber throughout Australia, and to some degree home building is still heing held up for that reason. I trust that the Government will continue this policy until' the supply of timber equates the demands. The allegations which have been made by the honourable member for Melbourne are without substance. He has raised this matter at the request of vested interests who are trying to protect their own selfish activities to the detriment of the ex-servicemen and young people who urgently require homes. matter is really sensational. Senator O'Byrne, who first raised it, asked a question able gentleman may not refer to the Senate, to debates that take place in that chamber, or to honourable senators themselves of another place? allow that. which Senator O'Byrne asked was able gentleman may not refer to questions that have been asked in the Senate. all the necessary precautions were not taken, and why provision was not made to ensure that customers would obtain the advantages of the rebates in respect of goods that were ordered and delivered after the 10th December, 1949a most significant date. An answer was actually follows:In order to reduce the high cost of housebuilding the Governinent has thought f it to allow vital building materials to enter this country free of duty. One of the conditions of that concession is that the benefit shall go to the ultimate user, the actual home owner, and that no contractor or other intermediate person shall gain any advantage therefrom. I have heard a lot of prattle from honourable members opposite about the difficulties of ex-servicemen who are endeavouring to build their own homes. That a smoke-screen to hide corrupt practices that have been used in this matter. Members of the Labour party want to know, and the people of Australia will want to know, who got the £100,000. We contend that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) acted wrongly in authorizing a refund from Consolidated Eevenue of considerable sums of money, representing duties that had been legally collected from and paid by importers in accordance with the tariff rates as ratified by the Parliament-no t by departmental officers-and as legally payable at the dates on which some timber and other commodities were admitted for home consumption. Did ex-servicemen derive any advantage from the refunding of that amount of £100,000, or did the importing interests, who gave financial support to the Liberal party and to the Australian Country party in the last general election",37,Customs Duty On Timber Formal Motion For Adjournment

Curtin I venture to say that other matters will come to light in the near future. The importing interests received their rake off in return for the support that they gave to the Liberal party at the last general election. The other rabble, such as the private banks, are also demanding their rake off. By the ""way, they are becoming quite impatient about the delay, but all of them will be paid off one by one. If they were not to receive spoils from the Treasury, this Government would not last a day. I emphasize that a royal commission should be appointed to inquire into this timber transaction. Forty-five thousand of my constituents will demand to know what has become of the money that has been illegally refunded from Consolidated Revenue by the Minister for Trade and so ably supported the Liberal party financially at the last general election.

163,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Leade r ofof the community at heart has ever questioned the value of that action. The bill now before the House represents an attempt to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, which finally put an end to the intrusion of .private interests into the management of the Commonwealth Bank. I repeat that the Opposition does not object to the repeal of the Banking Act 1947 or to the expansion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank. It is prepared at all times to agree to the provitions with those of an ordinary trading sion of additional finance for the bank, provided, of course, that the Government goes about the job in the proper way. The Labour party approves of the activities of the Mortgage Bank Department and the Industrial Einance Department. I think that the Treasurer will agree that the development of the Industrial Finance Department has been a financial romance. That, of course, is true of all the measures that have heen enacted by Labour governments for the expansion of Commonwealth Bank activities. The value of the Mortgage Bank Department has exceeded our expectations. Its work has been of great use to many Australians. I cannot imagine any greater tribute to the economic and financial policies of Labour governments than is implicit in this bill. The Government does not propose to alter the structure of the Commonwealth Bank as it has been developed and strengthened over the years by Labour governments. In fact, it plans to extend the activities of the hank. The next point that I wish to emphasize is that the Opposition objects to the proposal to re-establish a board to manage the Commonwealth Bank and thus re-introduce private financial interests into the control of the organization. Our attitude on this issue is uncompromising, and I am sure that our stand will be fully justified when the history of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank Board in the past is written. I do not reflect in any way upon the gentlemen who served on the previous board. I have known some of them and I have the highest respect for their honour and personal integrity, but tlieir outlook upon the functions of a sorry part played by the management of central bank was deplorable. The present the Commonwealth Bank in those hapMinister for Health established the Compenings, reveal the complete inability of monwealth Bank Board when he was people drawn from other spheres to underTreasurer in a former government. That stand the duty which devolved on the Mr Ohifley. act .placed control of the Commonwealth Bank in the hands of men who, though excellent citizens, had not the faintest conception of the proper function of a central bank or of its vital relationship to the economic life of the nation. In fact, most of them knew nothing at all about that phase of Australia's economy which touched the management of a great central bank and allied the conduct of its operabank. One only needs to read the evidence given before the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems to realize the utter failure of the members of the former bank board to understand the functions of a central bank or to appreciate its importance to the national welfare. From 1924 to 1941, when the former board operated, the economy of this country desperately needed proper guidance from the Commonwealth Bank. Any one who takes the trouble to acquaint himself with the management of the bank during those years will realize what an unholy mess the board made of its job and the damage that was inflicted on our economy in consequence. Some day I hope that some one will take the trouble to publish the history of the bank during that period. I know something of it, because I was a member of this House for a brief period about that time. In 19311 was a Minister when the great financial crisis occurred. At that time. I had the advantage of working with the best financial brain that this Parliament has ever known. I refer to the late Mr E. G. Theodore. No matter what criticisms may be levelled at the late Mr Theodore, it cannot be denied that he had the most magnificent conception of the duty of the Commonwealth Bank and of the part which that institution should play in the national economy. It was a great loss to the public life of this country when Mr Theodore ceased to be a member of the Parliament. The tragic happenings of 1931, and the central bank at that time. I want to make it quite clear that I am not reflecting on the integrity or on the good intentions of the individuals who comprised the bank board at that time. My criticism is directed at their complete inexperience of banking and their utter lack of knowledge of the financial system, which rendered them quite incapable of grasping the problems that confronted the country. That board was appointed at the instigation of the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), and I believe that he is still a champion of the system of board management. The Bruce Page Administration, of which he was such an influential member, went on borrowing until it could not borrow any more, either in this country or abroad, and the policy of that Administration undoubtedly weakened our economy so seriously that when the depression came we sank into misery and degradation. I shall not indulge in tedious repetition ber of brilliant men who are thoroughly of what I have said on previous occasions qualified to tender advice on all the about the proposal to hand the managematters that, arise. Surely no one will ment of the Commonwealth Bank over to suggest that tlie members of the proposed a hoard.

Therefore, the hank, I recall that at one stage it I do not think that it can reasonably be was necessary to request the school authocontended that the appointment of a rities to conduct special examinations to board of individuals from outside the encourage children leaving school to join bank or the Public Service is necessary the bank staff. The expansion of a business in order to supplement any alleged shortis always regarded as a criterion of its comings of the officials of the Commonsuccess, and it is clear, therefore, that wealth Bank or of the Treasury. no fault can be found with the business side of the bank's operations. Can any fault be found with the advice tendered by the Governor of the bank, to the governnient of the day on financial or economic matters? I do not think that any one who is aware of the factswill suggest that any fault can be found, with that advice, either during the term of Mr Armitage, who has since retired, or during the term of the present Governor, Dr. Coombs. Indeed, Dr. Coombs is generally recognized throughout the world as one of the finest brains that this country has produced, and he has very few rivals, either in this country or abroad. Although he is still a young man it cannot be disputed that he possesses extraordinary abilities, and. those abilities have been devoted to furthering the economic interests of this country. In addition, the Governor of the bank has the assistance of the Advisory Council, which includes a numDoes the Government suggest that the operations of the bank under the present system of control by a governor have not been a success? The other day I noticed some criticism of the fact that the bank bad made a profit, after providing reserves, of approximately £7,000,000. What profits do honourable memhers imagine the private banks would have made had it not been for the competition of the Commonwealth £7,000,000, and probably much more, would have found its way into the fat pockets of private bankers and moneylenders. Had the Commonwealth Bank not been in existence during the recent war the government could not have got the money with which to carry on the war. I believe that the present Government has been able to reduce the amount of treasury-bills held by the Commonwealth Bank. It is clear, therefore, that it cannot be argued that the bank has not operated successfully. It might be contended that part of the bank's profits have come from the management of the note issue, but it cannot be denied that the Commonwealth Bank made substantial profits from the transaction of purely banking business. Having placed these matters fairly before the House and the public, as I have done on previous occasions, I am led to inquire now why the Government is so anxious to transfer the control of the bank to a board. Members of the Government say that they propose to do so in order to fulfil an election promise. I do not know of any promise made by the present Government during the last election campaign that it has fulfilled. In any event, the establishment of the proposed board will fall far short of the expectations held by the bankers, who subscribed hundreds of thousands of pounds to assist the anti-Labour parties to defeat us at the last election. It is idle for honourable members opposite to deny .that huge funds were made available to them because I can produce evidence to show the source of the funds, the amount subscribed and the purpose of the subscriptions. Every one remembers, too, that during the election campaign bank oflieers ran around from house to house in the time of the banks canvassing support for the anti-Labour Ur. Chifley. parties. However, as I have already said, the Government's proposal will certainly not fulfil the high expectations of the bankers and other persons who were so anxious that Labour should be defeated at the last election. Earlier, the Government spoke of establishing a small board of four individuals. Now the number is to be increased to ten-nearl y "" an Australian Bank? At least eleven"". In addition to the five individuals who will be appointed from outside, the board will include the Secretary to the Treasury and the Commonwealth Statistician, who is also Economic Advisor to the Government. That sounds quite plausible, but let me remind honourable members that the Permanent Head of the Treasury has always endeavoured to give effect to the policy of his ministerial head, who is the Treasurer. I do not know of a Secretary to the Treasury who has not done so. It is clear, therefore, that the Secretary 'to the Treasury would have to disregard any personal inclinations that he might have when he took his place at a meeting of the proposed board, and would advocate the views of the Treasurer of the day. I do not know what qualifications will be demanded of the five individuals who will be selected from the community. However, if they are selected on the same haphazard principle as that which characterized the selection of the members of the former board I think that it will be a most retrograde step. As I pointed out earlier in my remarks, the members of the former board had not the faintest conception of the organization of banking or of the functions of a central bank. Furthermore, the whole idea of entrusting confidential information of vital importance to the economic security of the country to persons chosen at random from the community is unsound. As an illustration of my contention, consider the position that would arise at the present moment if a bank board were in existence which included five individuals who were not responsible to the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasury or the Government. Most far-reaching proposals to appreciate or depreciate the currency are being considered by the Government. In order to assist the Government in its deliberations and to tender it the soundest advice, the Governor of the -Commonwealth Bank and the Treasury have assembled information of the most confidential character. Another illustration of the extraordinary information which comes into the possession of those responsible for the direction of the nation's financial policy is supplied hy the inquiries that have undoubtedly been made about the £300,000,000 of "" h o t "" or ""lukewarm"" money which is believed to have found its way into this country recently. I know the difficulties that arise in considering such matters and in making investigations concerning them. People who do not understand these matters expect those associated with the central reserve bank to be able to tell them just how the money came here. A hoard which included individuals who were selected because they represented interests other than those directly connected with banking would have placed before it information of the kind to which I have -referred, and it would be expected to make recommendations that would be of some practical assistance to our economy. ""What assurance has the country that the outside individuals on that board will not make use of the information placed before them, either wittingly or unwittingly, to further their own interests? But apart altogether from the possibility of those individuals abusing their position, it is clear that the national economy will be jeopardized by making such information available to persons who are not responsible to the bank or to the Government. Even at this late stage I impress upon the Government that in the Commonwealth Bank we have a magnificent institution which, although owned by the people, is not controlled like ordinary departments of the Public Service. Since the bank was removed from the control of a board and has functioned directly under the control of the Treasurer it has operated most efficiently, as is proved by the statistics of its increased turnover and profits. Furthermore, I have not heard any complaints of any kind about the efficiency of the bank. Certainly, the profits which it has made do not find their way into the pockets of investors or speculators, but are returned to the people in many ways. It is the Labour party's view that no private interests should be allowed to be associated with the management of the Commonwealth Bank. In fact, it really amazes me that, after ten months in office, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, who must have had many opportunities to observe the working of the Commonwealth Bank, the efficiency of the officials associated with it, the ability of the men who now operate as the bank's Advisory Council and the capacity, judgment, standing and prestige of the present Governor of the bank, propose to go out and take somebody off the street to tell the bank and the Government how the economic system of the country should be conducted. I do not use the phrase "" somebody off the street"" in a disparaging sense, but it seems to me almost burlesque that the Commonwealth Treasurer, with his great experience of finance, should suggest that some person associated with private business, who is, perhaps, connected with bed-making or the manufacture of radio sets, should be appointed to advise a great institution on its administration and to assist the Treasurer, who has a far wider knowledge of finance than anybody who is likely to be appointed to the proposed board from outside the bank, in respect of the appreciation of the £1 and what ought to be done regarding other problems of national economy. The Labour party is against the proposal on principle, quite apart from the other realistic considerations that I have mentioned, because we believe that it is essential that when a great financial institution is operating for the benefit of the people, the officials who are associated with its management should be completely free from any outside financial interests. People with outside financial interests would be put in a position to give out, consciously or unconsciously, financial tips to their associates in the business world. Although they might not do so with the definite object of making money we must realize that in these times, when world currencies are fluctuating or are likely to fluctuate, such information could be of great value to speculators. I read yesterday a statement by a very able economist, who is not associated with the Government, in which he said that appreciation of our £1 to parity with sterling could net speculators I shudder, on looking back to the days of £150,000,000. It seems to me that when euch huge sums of money are involved it is not the correct thing bo go out and the hoard system. I shudder also to think get builders or manufacturers of radio sets to give the Treasurer advice about how the economic system should function. For those reasons we oppose the introduction into the bank's affairs of private the guardians of the economic life of this individuals who would have equal voting strength with the other members of the board, although the bill provides for .a casting vote by the Governor. One of -the strange aspects of the constitution <of the proposed board is, of course, that it is to have ten members. The Treasurer himself-and I do not intend to make any -accusation against the present Treasurer --ca n very often tip off private people about the policy that he would like tbem to follow. With a bank board in existence the bank might follow a certain policy on the instructions of the Treasurer, delivered through the medium of the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Government would be able to disown responsibility for the policy because there would be no actual association in the matter between the Governor of the bank and the ' Treasurer. that reason we resolutely oppose any provision in this bill that would permit any private interests or private person to decision that was not a mistake was the occupy any position of control in relation to the Oommonwealth Bank. Such persons might be called upon to make decisions that they were utterly incapable of the best banking and economic brains of making reasonably. I have never been able to see why the man who occupies the position of Treasurer of this country, no matter to which political party he may belong, should not be considered more capable, in consultation with the Governor of the bank, to make -matters affecting the whole life of the community, than are people who are brought in from outside for meetings of the board, given a drink and a bit of lunch, and sent home hy about 3 p.m., and who can, by their votes on the board, determine, to some degree at any rate, the financing functions and the economic economic and nnancial policy of the Mr Ohifley. -bank, and its administrative policy in particular. I do not think that anybody could deny that the proposed board will decide the bank's administrative policy. crisis in the early 1930's, to think that this Government intends to re-establish that in the event of a national economic crisis such men as those who constituted the former bank board, excellent citizens though they were, would once again be country. When I was Treasurer during the early part of the last war the members of the Commonwealth Bank Board had strange ideas about budgeting. When I announced a budget of £100,000,000 they thought the end of the world had come. I should not be astonished if the Treasurer did not soon bring down a budget six times greater than that figure. The bank boards of previous days could have foreseen nothing but utter ruination in a budget of, say, £200,000,000. In fact, I understand that when the budget of £100,000,000 was announced, the board of those days had to have headache tablets in order to get any rest at all at nights. Mistakes are often made, but there was one action that was not a mistake. I refer to a Labour government's decision For -many years ago to establish the Commonwealth Bank. That decision has been completely justified by experience. Another decision to abolish the bank board and to place the control of the bank in the hands of a Governor, who would have the advice available to him. That decision was of immense benefit to this country, and this party will oppose at every stage any attempt to alter it. I particularly refer to clauses 5 and 10 of the bill, which propose, in conjunction with consequential provisions in other clauses, to establish a board similar to the boards decisions regarding economic that completely failed in the past. I am not speaking only of boards back in the 1924, 1930 and 1939 eras, but of boards that were in existence when I was Treasurer and that were unable to evolve a complete conception of the responsibilities of a central bank in regard to essential affairs of the country. For the reasons I have given we completely oppose those particular clauses. for Health) [3.25] I listened with interest to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) as he stated his case for opposing this bill in the final event, while effectively, although I was totally opposed at the same time being willing to accept the second reading without division. That seems to me an extraordinary point of view to take up and I shall examine it in a few moments. First, however, I should like to say that the major change provided for in the bill corresponds with the major change that I introduced in the Commonwealth Bank's constitution in 1924. The bill also proposes substantial increases of capital for the bank, and thereby will give it an opportunity to enlarge its functions and play a more beneficent role in the community. When I introduced the change in the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank in 1924 I provided for an increase of the bank's capital by placing at its disposal half of the Commonwealth Bank Reserve Fund. The remainder of that fund went into the National Debt Sinking Fund. About two years later I established the Rural Credits Department of the bank, with interest-free capital that came out of the revenue of the Note Issue Department, which enabled the Rural Credits Department to advance more money at the lowest rates of interest properly be performed only with the guidance than had ever been known in Australia. and In 1945, the present Leader of the Opposition, when he was Treasurer, was good enough to send me a copy of a statement about the actual amount of work the back? that the Rural Credits Department had done. He said that altogether it had Opposition the lie to twenty years of made, either directly or indirectly and propaganda. Everybody knows what the in association with orderly marketing, honourable member for East Sydney( Mr advances of something like £280,000,000. Ward) stands for. The quotation conI n fact, it was the existence of the Rural tinues as follows:Credits Department that permitted much of our war-time marketing to be carried individual bankers must in the end be fatal to out. It will be recalled that, at the same action of a central bank working always for time, I gave the bank the right to obtain thc good of all. additional capital from the puhlic, if For years that idea was scorned, until desired, to the extent of some £20,000,000. Mr Theodore, as Labour party TreaIn the same way, this measure provides surer, brought down proposals to create for enlargement of the capital of the a central bank and make it independent bank in connection with all its activities. of the ordinary bank. He provided for When the Leader of the Opposition brought down his proposals in 1945, when he was Treasurer, I pointed out, . quite definitely, that I was in favour of the extension in certain directions of the activities of certain departments of the bank to enable them to function more to his action in trying to nationalize the banking system. The present Treasurer has shown that he has no objection to an increase of the capital of the bank for he has made provision for certain departments to obtain £5,000,000 additional capital during the next five years. I consider that that is a very good thing if we are to have the desired expansion of our economy. There is no question about the bona fides of the parties on this side of the House in respect of the Commonwealth Bank. They have set out to develop the banks. In a speech in 1945, the then Treasurer congratulated me on my efforts to establish the central banking departments of the Commonwealth Bank. Indeed, he quoted the actual terms of my speech in 1924, and said that I had put the case for central banking much more clearly and succinctly than hanking authorities had done. He quoted my words with approval, and I shall now quote them again. I saidThe important functions of banking can control of a central bank.

I shall answer that allegation with the facts concerning the conduct of the board. The Leader of the Opposition has said that there are three reasons why this bill should be rejected. He stated that there had been a great extension of the activities sweeping objection and said, "" We shall of the bank under his system since 1945; that it had made great profits and that it had been an economic success since that year. I agree. It is still a great success. It could not fail to be otherwise with the basis that I gave it in 1924, but during the 23 years from 1923 to 1945 what progress was made by the bank? The number of its branches increased from 62 to 280. Its staff increased from 1,800 to 6,300. Its annual profits increased from £400,000 to £951,000, excluding the profits from the note issue. The right honourable gentleman has made a most unworthy suggestion which implies that anybody who is not a government servant must be dishonest. That is a most serious accusuation.

The then Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) said in his letter of 23rd July, 1945, that he disagreed with my propositions and thought that the existing capital was suflicient. I accepted that statement, but the fact is that I did raise this very matter and sought to increase the potential value of this organization to the whole of Australia.

I am not an expert on banking but as an observer of the most important component of our commercial and political life, I feel that time is a factor in regard to this bill which is defeating the ends of the Government. The reappearance of this bill is only made necesGibson. sary by the fact that it is one of the tin cans that the Government tied on to its own tail at election time, when Government members voiced moving slogans about putting value into the £1 and restoring the Commonwealth Bank Board. No wonder the Treasurer ( Mr Eadden) looks weary after his attempt to embody in the budget the promises which his followers made prior to the last general election and during discussions in this House. Under this bill an attempt is being made to replace the present form of control of the Commonwealth Bank hy board control. What is wrong with the present method of control? As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) pointed out, the present control is most efficient, it has survived the demands of war arid reconstruction and has worked smoothly. The report of the Commonwealth Bank, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), reveals ti romance of finance and commerce. The bank has performed such sterling service to tbe Australian people under its present administrative set-up that there is no reason why its control should be changed, It is reasonable to aver that if a. thing has been proved to be good and has shown its value throughout the years it should be retained. Institutions that If so, why have failed and died are not resurrected. It is well known from bitter experience, especially during the 'thirties, that the performance of the Commonwealth Bank under its previous administration was incompetent. Its actions have been recorded in the dark pages of the history of the depression. Its control in those days was not imaginative and flexible enough to be able to take reasonable risks or to gamble on Australia Unlimited. I fail to understand why the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) should be so fulsome in his praise of the proposed bank board when he is aware that a similar body was part of a system which in the past was an abject failure. It did not work, and the most that it can claim was, according to Australian standards, the very smallest measure of prosperity. Honourable members would do well to remember the lack of imagination of the board led by the late Sir Eobert Eor no reason other than to honour a welter of election promises, the Government is rushing this bill through the Parliament, and woulcl hazard a double dissolution on the matter It would go to that length to restore a system that has already been discredited. Tbe only yardstick of future performance is past history, and the past performance of this system of administration was disastrous; particularly so in the days of the depression. On the other hand, the performance of the present administration has been conspicuously good. It has played a great part in the progress of Australia during the last few years. If the Government fears socialism, or a bank that smacks of socialism, why does it hug certain socialist principles so closely to its bosom in these days? A tax on wool and projected controls in other directions prove that the Government is attempting to bolster with these principles the outworn capitalistic system, which is crashing to the ground. Honourable members on this side of the House are honest enough to say that no matter how one feels about certain measures they are essential to Australia's stability.

The Treasurer has a very difficult task at any time no matteiwhat government is in office. The nation believes that it can place more trust in the Treasurer than in any representative of some outside interest who might bc foisted on the bank hoard. Men in the street cannot learn all about banking by some magic, and they will be advised by the same officials as are advising the administration at present; so where will the difference lie in that regard? All that the Government i.» trying to do is to turn the clock back and re-establish an out-moded system. The statement of the right lionorable member for La Trobe( Mr Casey), "" We shall take them off the street; these fellows get to know these things"", amazed me. I was appalled when I heard him say that, but I have since learned that it is characteristic of him, and that he does not think deeply enough before he makes statements. Thc bank board is apparently to be a collection of businessmen. It is said that it will be a representative cross-section of the: people. If the Treasurer will then be. SP. he is now, the .final arbiter of the bank's policy, and if the bank is to be controlled hy very efficient pulblic servants, I say that there will be no lack of representation. The Government is seeking special and in some instances sinister representation. It is the judgment of the Opposition, but not of history that a bank board will not work in the best interests of the people of this country. Is the institution of a board made more valid because the late Mr Theodore considered a bank board to be a good idea? My grandmother thought that it was the height of fashion to wear a bustle, ancl she looked very charming when she did wear it , but these are modern times, and modern instruments must be used in our modern institutions. The bank to-day needs no bolstering by men taken off the street; it is a great institution and is served by brilliant men. We do not want men on the board who have made their fortunes in business; they may be good majorsgeneral, but they are failures as privates. control. The administrators The right honourable member for Cowper said that the Opposition had protested magnificent job and the final against only one portion of the bill. It is true that only one portion of it is exercising our minds, (because three-quarters of tbe bill embodies the ideas of the Opposition, and I dare say that the Treasurer would be the first to admit that to be the case. This legislation was introduced only to implement a promise made to the electors. It is wrong for the right honourable member for Cowper to say that the principles embodied in this bill, with the exclusion of the clause that we want eliminated, are not those that we have espoused. W it h all his -charm and eloquence he tried to persuade the House that everything was all right in the past and that again everything will be for the best in this best of all possible worlds. He says that £5,000.000 will be allocated to special sections of the bank and that there will be six banks within the one institution. That has been Labour party policy for the last eight years. I suggest that this bill is merely a bait to ensnare the people, and that it will not strengthen the bank in the least. It is fundamental nonsense and can be described as a sprat to catch a mackerel. When one remembers the debates that have occurred in this chamber one realizes how tremendous has been the success of the Commonwealth Bank. It is curious that the right honourable member for Cowper should put himself forward as an authority on financial policy because he is known as "" the tragic treasurer"". He was an incompetent Treasurer, as history has proved He must take some of the blame for the debacle when the Commonwealth Bank Board was unable to function because it did not have enough f a i th in the spirit of Australia during the depression. The story of the bank ancl of the depression has burned itself into the minds of the Australian people so deeply that I am sure that they will be reluctant to support the Government's proposals. I have proved by logic that if a thing was bad in the past the chances are that it w i ll be bad in the future, and therefore should not be risked. The next proposition is that the present form of control has been very successful, ancl therefore no reason now exists why the banking system should be altered. The Government is not concerned about the socialist aspect of the people owning their own bank; it welcomes that as an additional bolster of our crazy system. If the Government is driven to these lengths to stop inflation then it is certainly tottering. I ask honourable members to consider what would happen if the controls imposed by the Commonwealth Bank were removed. The people interested in the Commonwealth Bank try to explain why businessmen should be put in control. There was such a form of control once, and the nation nearly lost the bank. The ""phantom five"" members of the board, as they are humourously spoken of, are still unknown. Is the Government going to appoint a great wool man or a great financier? Who are these people who have been hiding their lights under bushels during the difficult war and postwar periods? What is the Government's purpose, and why is it trying to show that the present system is not efficient? There is no validity at all in clause 10. This country must have a strong banking system, able to withstand onslaughts from abroad and impacts from inside Australia. The Commonwealth Bank has shown that it can do that. This Government which is just beginning, or just concluding, its career, should realize that in modern times so-called bureaucracy must play a fairly large part. The bank officials are efficient,, and should therefore be left alone. We do not know whether the next administration will be efficient because you cannot make a banker out of a businessman by act of Parliament. Government supporters interjecting, guffaw from the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), I pay tribute to Jonathan Swift, who invented the term "" Yahoo "". This is a serious busil.css, and we shall fight the Government on any ground it chooses, in the House or on the hustings. There should be no Standing Orders, if I may be so preCommonwealfch Bank Board because such sumptuous as to say so, otherwise you a system has been a disastrous failure in would not have given a ruling. the past and might again fail and bring disaster in the future. There is no reason for clause 10 except that the Government parties are committed to it because it was one of the promises made to the people during the heat of their last election campaign. I venture to say that they wish that they had never made this promise. Deputy Speaker. Has the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) been suspended from the sendee of the House?

In this debate they are following the pattern that they have fol lowed in attacks they have made on certain other bills. They concentrate on one, or two, provisions in a measure to the exclusion of its other provisions. In this instance they have picked out for attack the clause that provides for the establishment of a board to control the Commonwealth Bank. The history of Labour's opposition to board control of the Commonwealth Bank goes back to 1945, amended the Commonwealth Bank Acti n order to abolish the board that controlled the bank at that time. In the interim honourable members opposite have been completely apposed to control of the bank by a board. The average person w ill have no difficulty in perceiving the reason for Labour's action in that respect. The banking legislation that was passed by the Chifley Government in 1945 was> a soften ing-up process in preparation for the attempt that Labour made in 1947 to nationalize the private banks. 1945, the Commonwealth Bank has been controlled by the Treasurer of the day. and that system of control w ill continue until this measure is passed. The Banking Act 1947, under which the Chifley Government sought to nationalize the private banks, had rather a sorry history, and not only recorded another discreditable page in the history of the Labour party, but also discredited the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) personally. creditable ? tliat, although the Chifley Government in which the right honourable gentleman was Attorney-General, had at its disposal the legal resources of t h e Commonwealth, cnat legislation was held to be invalid by the .High Court and by the P r i v y Council. One object of this measure is to repeal the Banking Act 1947, as the leaders of tlie present Government parties at the last We l l , the general election promised they would do. Those leaders in their policy speeches promisedIf returned to office, we will repeal the Bank Nationalization Act. We propose:(a) To set up uuder control by Parliament, a small Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank, of which the Governor of the Bank shall be Chairman; (5) To provide that if the Treasurer disagrees with the Board's policy, he shall refer the matter to Parliament for its decision. That is, we shall restore the sound principle that great financial decisions shall not be secret, and that the elected representatives in Parliament shall be able to control them. when the Chifley Government (c) To provide some much-needed check to inflation of culrrency, we shall restore Parliamentary control over the Commonwealth note issue.

Speaker made a mistake. I expressed regret for anything that I was supposed to have said and I left the chamber purely as a matter of courtesy to the Chair. honourable member for Reid has expressed regret and has assured me that he was not suspended, he may remain. remember that financial decisions made by great financial institutions such as the Commonwealth Bank affect many thousands of people. Therefore, they should be made not by a single individual but by a number of individuals who, as members of a board, would have the opportunity to examine thoroughly all problems that come before them. Board control of the Commonwealth Bank will restore to the people control of not only the trading operations of that institution, but also the control of the central bank in this country. the Commonwealth Bank was placed under the control of a board by the Bruce-Page Government. At that time, central banking technique was something new to Australia and was comparatively unknown to banking systems in Europe. However, that technique was developed over the years, including a period of world depression. The system of board control of banking institutions did much to co-ordinate banking policy with Government policy. During World War II . the Commonwealth Bank Board controlled the financial system of this country with remarkable success despite the grave difficulties that arose under warsingle man could be as wise as a group time conditions. It cannot be said that it failed in any way whatever in carrying out ifcs tasks which included exchange control, loan raising and the financing of the marketing of various commodities. Until 1945, nq contention arose with respect to the system of board control of the Commonwealth Bank. It is generally recognized overseas that the management of central banks should be entrusted to boards. For instance, the Bank of Canada and the reserve banks of South Africa, India and New Zealand are controlled by boards. Furthermore, although the present British Socialist Government enacted legislation in 1946 to nationalize the Bank of England that In most countries it is recognized that if central banks are to be enabled to function efficiently they must be controlled by boards. It is realized that the monetary and financial system of a country cannot be operated successfully except in accordance with a continuing financial policy. Periodical changes of financial policy would have disastrous effects upon a country's economy. For that reason the Government proposes under this measure that certain permanent puhlic servants who are members of the existing advisory committee will be members of the board to control the Commonwealth Bank. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is to be the chairman of the board and the Deputy Governor is to be Deputy Chairman of the board whilst the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury and seven other persons are to be members of it. Of the last-mentioned, two will be pubI n 1924 lic servants who have been named and the other five will be drawn from outside spheres with the proviso thafc none of them shall be representative of any sectional mterests and shall not be associated with any other banking institution. Any one who suggests that it is not wise to obtain the services of such persons to act in this capacity is mistaken. The board as the Government proposes to constitute it will maintain a balance -between persons who are familiar with general banking practice and persons who will be capable of safeguarding the complex interests of the general community. Emerson' once said that no of men after penetrative discussion. The measure provides that if the Government disagrees with a decision of the board, the view of the Government shall prevail.

Tlie Bank shall, from time to time, inform the Government of the monetary and hanking policy of the Bank. (2.) In the event of a difference of opinion between the Government and the Bank as to whether the monetary and banking policy of thu Bank is ""directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia, the Treasurer and the B'oard shall endeavour to reach agreement. That is the first step in the procedure that will be observed if a difference of opinion should occur between the Treasurer and the board. The. next two sub-sections read(3.) If the Treasurer and the BoaTd are unable to reach agreement, the Board ehall forthwith furnish to the Treasurer a statement in relation to the matter in respect of which the difference of opinion has arisen. (4.) The Treasurer may then submit a recommendation to the Governor General, and thc Governor General, acting with the advice nf the Federal Executive Council, may, by order, determine the policy to be adopted hy theBank. That is to say, the final control of banking policy w ill remain in the hands ot the government of the day. I do not believe that any member of the Labour party can honestly state that that is not a fair and reasonable way of dealing with the situation. The policy of the Government Banking operations in fair competition with the private trading banks. of the principal functions of the so-called welfare group of departments including thc General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank w ill be to assist homebuilding. The specific purpose of the Rural Credits Department is to assist to increase the productive effort of the country, particularly in respect of food and other primary products. The Mortgage Bank Department arranges long-term loans for primary producers, and the Industrial Finance Department, which, incidentally, has been in existence for only four years, has been definitely of great benefit to the industrial section of the community. Proposed new section 64 relates to the capital of the Rural Credits Department, and readsThe capital of the Rural Credits Department discretionary power to provide up to shall bc the aggregate of(o) the sum of Two million pounds, being the amount of the capital of the Kural Credits Department immediately prior to the commencement of this section; and (6) such sums as are paid to that Department in pursuance of sections fifteen aud forty-seven of this Act. Proposed new section 76 provides for the capital of the Mortgage Bank Department, as follows:The capital of the Mortgage Bank Department shall be the aggregate of{a) the amount of the capital of the Mortgage Bank Department immediately prior to the commencement of this section; and (b) such sums as are paid to that department in pursuance of sections fifteen and forty-seven of this Act. Provision is made in proposed new section 97 for the capital of the Industrial Finance Department, as follows:Tiie capital of the Industrial Finance Department shall be the aggregate of(a) the sum of four million pounds, heing the amount of the capital of tlie Industrial Finance Department immediately prior to the commencement of this section; and (b) such sums as are paid to that Department in pursuance of sections fifteen and forty-seven of this Act. The Government definitely recognizes the value of retaining the competitive provides for the General trading section of the bank, and the Division to continue it3 granting of that additional capital to the various departments is proof of its willingness to ensure continuous and f a ir One competition. The Government has strong objections to the proposal of the previous Government to nationalize banking, because such action would stifle the competition that is now provided by the private trading banks. The additional capital that will be provided for the various departments of the Commonwealth Bank will be obtained fro m the profits from central banking business and fro m the note issue, and it w ill assist, in a certain measure, to overcome our present housing finance difficulties. The proposed new bank board w ill have discretion to transfer an amount of £500,000 annually to the trading bank section from tbe profits of the central bank, and an additional £500,000 a year from the profits of the note issue. In fact, the board w ill have £1,000,000 annually for the various departments of the Commonwealth Bank. Over a period of five years, those departments may receive an additional £5,000,000 in the following amounts:£ General Banking Division Rural Credits Department Mortgage Bank Department Industrial Finance Department .. 1,400,000 I Opposition agree that additional capital should be made available in order to permit the various sections of the Commonwealth Bank to continue trading operations on a competitive basis. The provisions of this bill will definitely strengthen the Commonwealth Bank as a central bank and as a part of the commercial hanking system of Australia. [4.21] I oppose the bill, because it seeks to re-introduce into Australia's banking system a method of controlling the Commonwealth Bank that operated during those tragic years of the financial and economic depression of the early 1930's. That method of control was largely responsible for those tragic years. sible for them. with the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters). During the depression, the Commonwealth Bank-the people's bank -wa s handed over to the private banking interests and to other vested interests in order that they might have an opportunity to grow fabulously rich upon the impoverishment of the multitudes in this community. As one who, like many thousands of Australians, suffered from that terrible reign of private enterprise over the Commonwealth Bank, I am able to speak with authority about the ordeals, the privations and the poverty that were caused by that form of control over the people's central bank. I recollect very clearly the efforts that were made by the Scullin Labour Government during the yoaTs 1929-31 to provide for the people an opportunity to live happy and useful lives, and to engage in productive occupations. Bank, being controlled at that time by the direct representatives of the private banks, was in a position to dictate its terms to the Scullin Government, and to tell it how to administer the affairs of State. The Commonwealth Bank Board at that time, consisting as it did of the representatives of vested interests, was in the happy position of becoming, in effect, the .. 1,400,000 government of the country. The people .. 700,000 who elected their representatives to this .. 1,500,000 Parliament discovered that honourable members were quite im/potent to give am sure that members of the effect to a policy to promote the welfare of the nation. No one, not even the Government, can point the finger of scorn at the way in which the Commonwealth Bank has been controlled by the Governor since the abolition of the board. No one who holds a responsible position has been able to cite an instance to show that the Governor has been inefficient, corrupt or incapable of administering the bank in the interests of the people. Why, then, does this Government desire to re-introduce the form of control that was responsible for the financial and economic depression of the 1930's? The Governor has carried out his duties ably and loyally to the people and to the Government. money into the election coffers of the Government parties. in all seriousness, that the Government probably became so deeply indebted to the private banks, as a result of the enormous amount of money that they expended on behalf of the Liberal party during the last general election cam-, paign, that it now realizes that unless it re-establishes the board, and places the private banks in control of the people's bank, they may expose it. Some one who is associated with the private banks might, in desperation, "" l if t the lid off the can "" and tell us exactly what did happen during the last general election campaign. ister for National Development ( Mr Casey) visited England especially to obtain from private banking interests in that country an amount of £100,000 for However, the -Commonwealth the purpose of defeating the Chifley Labour Government, and replacing it with an administration that could represent very adequately the interests of private bankers and other capitalists in England and elsewhere, to whioh the",53,Fadden

Adermann) -Order! It is always recognized in the Parliament that an honourable member shall accept a denial by another honourable member. I ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh to do so on this occasion. I accept the right honourable gentleman's denial. I invite the Government to take the House into its confidence, and announce the names of the persons who wil] be appointed to the proposed new bank board. The bill provides that the board shall consist of ten memlbers, of -whom three are mentioned, namely, the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury. Probaibly only a few senior Ministens know whom the other seven members will be. Some time ago, I challenged the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) to deny that Professor Hytten would be appointed to the board. Honourable members will recall that the Hytten economic plan provides for a permanent pool of unemployed, equivalent to 10 per cent, of the number of people who are able and willing to work, as a threat against those in employment, so that they may be ground down to the slave-like conditions that were prevailing before the outbreak of ""World War II .

This argument is becoming rather amusing because the Treasurer has become so excited that he is continually buttoning and unbuttoning his coat ancl jumping about in his seat.

Because the Labour Government did not have control over the Senate at that time, it was not in a position to reject that ultimatum. It had to accept the terms that were laid down. That is why I am opposed to the re-establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board. No government would be able to rid itself of the incubus unless it had control of both Houses of this Parliament at the one time. at that time could have precipitated an election, could it not? of the greatest mistakes made by the Labour party in its entire history was its decision not to have an election on that issue., Had it gone to the people, there can be little doubt that it would have been returned to power with an overwhelming majority in each House of the Parliament. Then it could have struck off the shackles of the Commonwealth Bank Board. tunity to hold a general election very shortly. If there should be an election soon, fhe Labour party will be placed in a position to undo some of the damage that has been done by this Government in its short term of office. Eor example, we shall be able to guarantee to the primary producers that there will be no appreciation of the Australian £1, an important issue in relation to banking. Furthermore, we shall be able to guarantee that the stupid proposal to impose a wool tax as a means of arresting the inflation of the last eight OJnine months will not be carried into effect. The honourable meniber should refer to the bill. surer's interjections were mainly responsible for my departure from the subject of the hill. I shall return to it. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz), in trying to say some word! of praise for the actions of the Commonwealth Bank Board before it was wiped out of existence, referred to its conduct during World War II . The honourable gentleman overlooked the fact that the members of the board and the people whom they represented had more to lose during the war than had any other section of the community. They acted decently only because they knew perfectly well that otherwise the Government might be unable to defend their wealth and their positions of power. I venture to say that, had the Labour Government not had the foresight to remove those men from the control of the people's hank, their behaviour to-day would be entirely different from their behaviour when their positions and their wealth were in jeopardy during the war. lives also were at stake, but the people whom the bank board represented in the main have never sacrificed their lives in time of war. They have relied upon men like the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) and other honourable gentlemen who have done so much in critical times to defend the country. 1 have never yet known the son of any banker in a high position to do very much for his country in time of war. There may be some who have fought and I do not deny that there are, but most of the people who have done the fighting have been those whom memhers of the Commonwealth Bank Board sought to destroy and impoverish in peace-time. I do not propose to say anything further about the bill at this stage. Instead, I shall listen to the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey), who, I understand, has a very outstanding contribution to make to the debate. I shall have a great deal to say about the proposal to re-establish the bank board and about various other aspects of the bill in the committee stage. Many clauses require careful explanations, in the absence of which I shall have many pertinent remarks to make.

All that the Government and its supporters may say about the measure will not be worth twopence worth of snuff because the Senate, fortunately, is in the hands of a decent, sensible party, which will ensure that a measure designed to place the people's bank under the control of private interests will not be passed. National Development) [4.40] -This bill was introduced six month ago in April of this year. It was debated then at very great length in this House and at equal, or even greater, length in the Senate. It has been re-introduced by the Treasurer ( Mr Eadden) at the first opportunity. Some of the debates in this House become very wearisome. This is one of them. Everything that could possibly be said from the Opposition point of view has been said, I believe, at least 50 times. Members of the Opposition are merely treading water and going up and down in the same place. I listened to a great deal of the debate that took place earlier in the year and I have heard some of the speeches in the present debate. I have heard no new arguments on this occasion, and I believe that the public has become completely sick and tired of the repetitious discussion. I believe that the public is, in a very large measure, favorable to the proposals in the bill. Therefore, the sooner the bill is passed by this House, and, I hope, by the Senate, the better will it be for Australia. Chifley) used the same arguments to-day as he advanced on an earlier occasion. He concerned himself largely with advocacy of one-man control of the Commonwealth Bank as opposed to control by a board. The right honourable gentleman is a very recent convert to the principle of one-man control. That was not the policy of the Labour party until he inScullin in the late 'twenties and it was not the policy of the present Leader of the Opposition in the 'thirties. gentleman has said all that before. say it again because I have listened to such wearisome reiteration from the Opposition that I think that some of the facts ought to be rubbed home. The Leader of the Opposition was a member of the royal commission that inquired into the monetary and banking systems in Australia in the late 'thirties. That royal commission made a series of recommendations, one of which was to this simple effectThe present method of government of the Commonwealth Bank is by a Board, appointed by tlie Commonwealtli Government, and consisting of a Governor, the Secretary to the Treasury, and six directors . . . We are of opinion that this method of governnient is generally satisfactory. The Leader of the Opposition subscribed to that conclusion. only a majority report. Leader of the Opposition subscribed to that conclusion. He certainly made reservations in other directions, and made them very pungently, but even in those he statedI realize, however, that a government-owned central bank, with ample powers, whose policy is determined and direeted wholly toward furthering the interests of the community by men of capacity and courage, is a most important feature of any banking system. That was an implied personal sponsoring of the bank board system. to be otherwise. A great deal has been said about the depression that started at the end of 1929 when the Commonwealth Bank Board was presided over by Sir Bo'bert Gibson. man and his colleagues backed the board's policy at that time. native, but he rejected it.

As a matter of fact, Mr Scullin went out of his way to re-appoint Sir Robert Gibson, not for a short period but for a term of seven years. If actions mean anything, I submit that Mr Scullin showed that he did not disapprove of Sir Eobert Gibson or of his policy. I believe, therefore, that the apparent conversion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) to the conviction that the control of the central bank should not be vested in more than one individual is of very recent origin, and, as I have already pointed out, that conviction is not shared by the Labour party in any other country, or, indeed, by any democratic government. The central bank in every democratic country is governed by a board of directors. I have in mind particularly the Bank of England. Notwithstanding the fact that Labour has governed England for a sensible period, no suggestion has been made that the control of the Bank of England should be taken from the present board. The only conclusion that we can draw from those facts is that either the Labour party in every other country is wrong and the Labour party in this country is right claim. The Labour party in Great Britain has some prestige honourable member does not believe in its policy. to the point that I am making. I repeat that the Laibour party of neither Great Britain nor New Zealand is wedded to the conception of one-man control of its central bank. It follows, therefore, that either the Labour party in other democracies is wrong and the Labour party in this country is the only one that is right, or that any man in this country who is not a public servant is dishonest and is unfit to take his place on the board which is to direct the central hank. Those are the only two inferences that can be drawn from the right honourable gentleman's argument, and, I suggest they are complete nonsense. The Labour party in this country is not the only repository of wisdom and political sense in the world. Furthermore, the implied slur on all sections of the community other than public servants is wholely undeserving and dastardly after their own interests. tion back at certain honourable members opposite. This matter has already been debated at great length and I do not propose to take up much more of the time of the House on the subject. I believe that the public of Australia has entirely lost interest in the matter. It wants to see the Government's intentions translated into action now. One honourable member opposite made the point that time is a factor in this matter. He was speaking of the handicap which the bank is suffering through the lack of capital to increase the activities of its various departments. The original measure was introduced six months ago, and since that time the bank has been deprived of any additional capital. Mr ""WARD -In what way is that affecting the bank? tighten up its policy on advances because of the senseless delay caused by Labour opposition. That is why time is such obtain finance to build homes and those industries that cannot obtain advances to expand their enterprises have only one body of people tp thank for their frustration, and that is the body led by the Leader of the Opposition. During the last six months the lending policy of the bank has continually contracted.

The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson), who has been interjecting consistently, is not speaking from his place in the House and is entirely out of order. I do not want to have to deal with honourable members, but they must cease interrupting the Minister. there is anything else that I can usefully add to my remarks. In my opinion, the Opposition has not made out a substantial case against the measure, and I also believe that the time-wasting tactics employed by the Opposition are operating to the disadvantage of the whole community. Sitting suspended from £.51 to 8 p.m. introduction of this bill shows the necesThe Labour party recognized as long ago sity for constant vigilance on the part of as 1907 that if the country was to progress, those who support the continued existence of the Commonwealth Bank in its present form, in order to ensure that the bank's splendid achievements since its inception shall not be nullified. Ever since this bill was mooted, some months ago, I have been puzzled about why the Government considers it necessary. I recognize that some of its minor clauses are not controversial, and, indeed, the Labour party supports them. But the main purpose of the bill is embodied in clause 10 which, I think, must be very vigorously resisted by the Lahour party if it is to remain the friend of the Commonwealth Bank. The most important provision in the bill deals with the appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board and that particular clause will meet with vigorous opposition not only from the Labour party in this House, but, I am certain, from the people of Australia. The Government has been particularly shrewd in its approach to the bill, because it recognizes the esteem in which the bank is held by the people. The Government does not like the Comanonwealth Bank as it is now constituted because it offers much too severe competiany legislation more important than the tion to the private hanks that are the friends of the Government. But the Government has not been game to launch (Hon. Archie a frontal attack upon the bank, because it realizes that it would be politically unwise to do so. Members of the Liberal party, over a course of years, have admitted the efficiency of the bank, and there is not the slightest doubt that if the Government made a deliberate attempt to whittle down the powers of the bank in a frontal attack the political repercussions would be distinctly unpalatable to it. The Government therefore has decided to adopt Trojan horse methods in order to destroy the present importance of the bank in the economic and political life of this community. By placing the bank under the control of a board the Government can finally achieve its objective, which is the stultification of the bank's present activity. The Labour party makes no apology for its profound interest in the bank. Had there not heen a Labour party there would never have been a Commonwealth Bank. control of the monetary policy of the community should be in the hands of the people's bank. In 1907, therefore, provision for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank was added to the platform of the Laibour party in the federal sphere. We recognized in those far-off days that the control of credit literally meant the power of life and death over hundreds of thousands of Australians, and would decide whether the queues of unemployed would be long or short. Not only did wo recognize that fact but so also did the present Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), who spoke earlier to-day and admitted that when he introduced his famous, or infamous, Commonwealth Bank Bill in 1924, he had saidA very great power is exercised by the banks in their control of credit, in their control over business, and in their effect upon wages as well as other conditions. Nevertheless, in 1924 he placed the bank under the control of a board whose administration undoubtedly affected the economy of the country for very many years.

258,Mr Bird (Batman) [8.0],"The rethe legislation was first introduced into the Parliament the bank was intended to assist the ordinary people in the financing ence of the Commonwealth Bank, because of ordinary business transactions. But it had not been very long established before it was realized that, by its control of the very bad grace and that party has utilized monetary policy, it profoundly affected the nation's destiny. The value of the bank was amply indicated during the progress of World WarI . , because it became the foundation stone of the nation's financial structure and occupied a key position in the financial policy of the Commonwealth. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how we could have financed World WarI . , but for the Commonwealth Bank. It is definitely a truism that the importance of the Commonwealth Bank has grown year by year to such an extent that under present conditions Australia's economic progress is bound up with its progress. During the debate in 1911 it was asserted by the antagonists of the bill, the Liberal party of that era, that the Labour party, in establishing the bank, -intended among other things to confiscate the savings of the people. But time has proved the falsity of that statement, because the policy and legislation of the Labour party on banking matters have always been intended to safeguard the interests of the people. As a matter of fact in the Banking Act 1945, for the first time in the history of this Commonwealth, we had a provision in a federal act of Parliament that guaranteed the savings of the people in all banks, both public and private. But in 1911 the predecessors of the present Liberal party were opposed to anything of that nature at all, and opposed the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. . They suggested that the Commonwealth Bank sbould not control the note issue, and some of them even went so far as to say that the Commonwealth's bank notes, which they termed "" Fisher's flimsies "", would in two or three months time be purchasable on any street corner in Australia for 5s. However, we recognize to-day that those statements were the height of absurdity. WhatI have said demonstrates that Labour's attitude towards the Commonwealth Bank met the same opposition in 1910 and 1911 as it Royal Empire Society at a luncheon in is meeting to-day. Mr Bird. The Liberal party has long since recognized that it must accept the existpublic opinion is in favour of it, but that acceptance has been given with a every opportunity to snipe at the bank as best it can. The Laibour party makes no apology for opposing the re-establishment of the bank board because it believes that history has an unfortunate habit of repeating itself, and the history of the previous bank board that was established in 1924 by the Bruce-Page Government, from the date of its inception to its demise in 1945, makes very sorry reading for any supporter of banking progress. During the period of the last war the bank operated under the National Security Regulations, but with the exception of that period its history is indeed a tragic one. The Commonwealth Bank Board of that period can be indicted on two main counts; first, that it did not encourage trading activities; and secondly, that when serious economic and financial .problems confronted this nation, it decided to dictate, and did very successfully dictate, to the elected representatives of the people. In relation to the first indictment that the board did not encourage the establishment of new business, I know of at least twenty examples in one locality of businessmen who were banking with the private banks in the 1930's having decided to transfer their accounts to the Commonwealth Bank. When they approached the local manager of the Commonwealth Bank and told him that they had accounts with private banks they were told in quite definite and unequivocal terms that the Commonwealth Bank was not prepared to take business away from the private banks. Tho bank made no secret of the fact, because not only did local managers tell clients that that waa the bank's policy in that respect, but Mr Riddle, who was then the general manager of the bank, also made a public announcement in 1932 which was reported in the Sydney Sun of 22nd November, 1932, in the following terms:Addressing a meeting of the Fellows of the October 1932 dealing with the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Riddle stated that -although the Commonwealth Bank continued nomic circumstances are such that it is to conduct general business, that side of its ""possible that we shall have a repetition activities was not pushed.

With reference to your discussions with the position of Australia, when it was agreed that some concerted effort must be made to sible, the ultimate disaster which will other"" Subject to adequate and equitable reduction in all wages, salaries and allowances, social benefits of all kinds, interest and other factors which affect the cost of living, the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively co-operate with the trading banks and the governments of Australia in sustaining industry and restoring employment."" of the Australian' Government. The people of Australia have not forgotten that experience and it cannot be wondered at that honourable memhers of the Opposition, who represent a substantial proportion of the people, should take up the cudgels on their behalf and point out what would happen if this bank board were established. Under the bill, the Government proposes to set up a board of ten members. Five memlbers of the board have been named in the bill. They are the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Economic Adviser to the bank and the Commonwealth Statistician. In addition, the hoard will have five other members, in the terms of clause 10 (2) of the -bill. Why the hesitancy on the part of the Government in giving even the slightest indication of whom those five members will be ? It is quite possible that the Government has something to hide and, because of that fact, the Labour party is actively resisting the passing of the bill. The Labour party considers that the proposed appointment of the bank board is a breach of a firm Labour principle, namely, that representatives of private interests shall not be given control of the people's bank. The five unnamed memlbers of the board will he men who will represent private interests and whose actions could be detrimental to the Australian peonle. Apparently, the Government anticipated some criticism along these lines because it inserted a provision which it thought would dispose of the Opposition's objections. I refer to the new proposed section 26, which readsA person who is a director or employee of a corporation (other than the hank) the business of which is wholly or mainly that of banking shall not be capable of or of continuing to act, as a member of the BoardApparently the Government thinks that by inserting that provision it can hoodwink the people of Australia. One would think that the directors of private banks are the only people with vested interests in such banks. I have yet to learn that the shareholders with the largest number of shares in a company are directors of that company. Quite frequently directors hold comparatively few shares. There is nothing in this legislation to prevent a shareholder wbo holds a majority of a bank's shares from being appointed to tbe proposed board. In addition, the proposed appointees can be men who may be interested in large commercial undertakings and who may move in the same llr. Bird. social circles as the directors of private banks. I am not prepared to leave the fate of the bank in the hands of people who possibly share the same social outlook as the directors of the private banking system and who could, perhaps unwittingly, steer the policy of the hank in a direction which could further the interests of the private banks. The Labour party resolutely sets its face against the proposal for the establishment of this board. This bill has a number of features which, in my opinion, are reprehensible. It could give to the representatives of private finance a voice in deciding whether the bank should extend its activities in the public interest. Consequently, the public interest would not be considered to the extent to which it should be. It gives to private financial interests an opportunity to take part in decisions concerning where new .branches of the bank should be opened. It might be proposed that a new branch be established in the neighbourhood of a number of private banks and influence might be brought to bear, deliberately or otherwise, on the memlbers of the board not to establish a ranch at the proposed location. The bill also will enable the members of the bank board to exercise a measure of control over interest rates, a matter in which the viewpoint of private banks might be at complete variance with public interest. I have ample evidence to justify my remarks, and I propose to give to the House a number of examples which prove appointment, beyond any reasonable doubt that what I have suggested could happen because it happened under the administration of the last bank board. In 1932 the bank board refused to finance the co-operative housing scheme in New South Wales because the private banks had intimated that they did not intend to do so. In 1924, just after the bank board had been established, the rate of interest for financing primary production began to rise and the Commonwealth Bank raised its interest rate also. From 1923 to 1924 the interest paid by primary producers amounted to £3,000,000. In the next year it rose to £7,000,000. In 1936 the private banks raised interest rates on fixed deposits and immediately the Commonwealth Bank Board took similar action. This action so disgusted a number of people that even the newspapers were forced by pressure of .public opinion, to make a statement about it and the Melbourne Age, of the 25th March, 1936, published this commentWhether the reasons are sound or not, the fact that impresses and startles tlie community Batman( MrB i r d ) , I thought that peris that in matters of such vital importance the Federal Government can be a mere cipher and the great institution which is owned by and acts for the people-the Commonwealth Bank-instea d of making policy is forced to follow a course dictated by others. Even the Melbourne Age recognized that the Commonwealth Bank, in abjectly following the dictates of the private banks, was not safeguarding the interests of the Australian people. The Government's proposition has for its primary purpose the bolstering of the private banking system at the expense of the enormously successful people's bank. TJnder its proposals the Government is abdicating its power and avoiding its responsibilities. It intends to give power that has been in the hands of the Government since 1945 to a group of men who w ill not be responsible to the people. That is a retrogressive step. The Government is deliberately excluding itself from participation in the making or changing of monetary policy. That is an act of abdication and, in relation to a number of matters of public importance, if this legislation is carried, it w ill govern in the future only economy which maintains a very strong in a secondary degree. In a self-governing community such as ours that is not a very desirable state of affairs. The Treasurer is the person who should have the final voice in the determination of national monetary policy. He has had that final voice for the last five years and I have not heard one word of criticism to the effect that he exceeded his responsibility and did something inimical to the interests of the people of Australia. TJnder no circumstances should we allow the making of monetary policy and the determination of the credit policy of this nation to be taken from the representatives of the people and given to a body that is responsible to nobody. I hope that even at this late hour the Government w ill recognize the foolishness of its legislation and w ill realize that there is no earthly reason why the present monetary control as exercised by the Governor of the bank should not be continued in view of the fact that it meets with the whole-hearted acclamation of the Australian people. listening to the honourable member for haps the House might first consider the suggestion that we consider the problems of to-day in the light of the conditions of to-day. The honourable member for Batman dwelt for some considerable time on the history of the Commonwealth Bank and the events of 1911. It is not necessary for me to remind the House that some 40 years have passed since 1911 and that during that time vast changes have occurred throughout the world, changes which, perhaps, have been greater than any that occurred during the preceding century. Whilst, as the honourable member has suggested, there are lessons to 'be learnt from the past, honourable members must be careful to apply those lessons only when conditions are similar to those that then existed. Let us contrast the conditions of 1911 with the conditions of to-day. Australia's population has nearly doubled since then. Our industry has quadrupled itself many times. The national economy has ceased to be largely agricultural and has become a mixed secondary industry. We have fought two great wars in common with the rest of the world, and we have paid the price for fighting them. We cannot, in a motor car age, use the same old whip that we used during the horse and buggy days. However much we may look back on the past as the good old days, we must realize that they are dead and gone and that present-day problems are facing, us. I shall now refer to some of the amazing statements of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). Unlike the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, he followed the usual approach of the Opposition when he resorted to the history of the depression days to find his arguments. He suggested that the conditions which produced the depression of 1930 exist in precisely the same degree to-day. No",60,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot
259,Mr Davis (Deakin) [8.28],"Afte rintelligent member of tbe community accepts that as a fact. Furthermore, when the honourable member spoke of 1911 and of the giants of the Labour party who dreamed of and established a Commonwealth bank, I was reminded that in 1921 the Labour movement adopted the socialist objective which changed the course and structure of the Labour party. From 1921 the course of the Labour party veered sharply to the left. The honourable member for Parkes dealt with the suggested appointments to the Commonwealth Bank He said that business men, and those representing private interests, should not be included on the board and should have no share in the control of the bank's policy. That statement indicates a complete absence of knowledge of modern central banking practice and of the movements which have been taking place during the last 30 years, particularly during the last twenty years since the people of the world learned the lessons of the depression. To-day the central bank, as the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) has said, plays a large and an important part in the life of the community. It does not, however, make or break depressions, and in the generally accepted sense it has only limited powers. bility is that of controlling the credit and monetary resources of a country to the benent of that country. fairly easy to express as a principle, but is very difficult to translate into practice. that the lessons that we have learned If we assume, as we must if we have any knowledge of central banking practice, that the central bank has the responsibility of working for the general good of the community, and ,if we assume that the government of the day has a responsibility to the community which it can exercise through its control of a central bank and of budget policy, then we must accept the fact, which has been accepted in every country other than Australia, that the central bank should include in its management representatives of the economic and business life of the community. ""We must accept also that whilst the elected representatives of the people in the last analysis control the policy of the bank the representaives of the commercial and industrial life of the community should Mr Davis. have an opportunity to place their opinions alongside opinions which may be purely political. That principle is accepted in almost all other countries in which a central bank has grown up. It is accepted all the more readily because of the experience of some countries in the years after the first great war when central banking practice in Europe was left purely under the control of governments which acted without advice or check. That was one of the factors which contributed to the depresBoard. sion of which honourable members opposite speak so fluently if so illogically. It has been said by the honourable member for Parkes and others that they will vote against this bill because it proposes to replace the present management of the bank with a board. They spoke of the failure of the board during the depression to do those things which now many of us think might well have been done. The answer to that is that we speak to-day with a knowledge of what has occurred since the depression, a knowledge that has grown out of the agony and suffering of the depression days and of the events that have occurred since then. The people of 1930 did not have that knowledge. It is just as ridiculous for those honourable members to make Its .main responsithat suggestion as it would be to suggest that Nelson should have been court martialled for not having used dive That is bombers at the battle of Trafalgar. It is equally ridiculous to suggest over the last few years could have been applie'd to anything that occurred during our past history. The constitution of the Commonwealth Bank Board is detailed by this legislation, and both it and the power of that board to be radically and fundamentally different from the constitution and power of the Commonwealth Bank Board of 1930. In the last analysis the control of policy will rest with this Parliament, that is with the elected representatives of the people. The honourable member for Parkes displayed a complete lack of knowledge of the provisions of the bill, or a debating dexterity that I had not noticed in his previous speeches, when he said that one of the virtues of the legislation now proposed to be repealed is that it is in the most democratic form and that it vests control in the Treasurer of the day who is the elected representative of the people. The idea of democracy held by the honorable member for Parkes is that all power should be placed in the hands of one man. under the Government's proposal? difference. There are 123 members of this House, and the interjection of the honourable member reminds me that when there is a difference of opinion it is ventilated at considerable length and with great vigour in this chamber. If one man is in control of the bank and there are doubts in his mind upon some point, he himself must resolve those doubts without the benefit of advice, criticism or discussion such as we have in this House. That seems to be an essential and striking difference between the two methods of administration. If we must relate the past to the present time, we must think back to the adoption of the socialist objecvities, and to centralize that responsibility tive by the Labour party in 1921 and relate that to the bill. TJnder the legislation theory that all the knowledge and wisdom of the Chifley Government all power rested in the hands of one man, the Treasurer of the day. That is consistent with the modern practice of socialism, which entails the dictatorship of an institution or Parkes also said that time is a factor to country in fact if not in theory. A central bank is more than a banking institution, because the power it wields can modify depression and so regulate currency and credit as to expand industry and help the nation. The consequences of decisions by a central bank affect the life of every member of the community to a lesser or greater degree. While the elected representatives of the people have ultimate control, they sliould also have the benefit of the advice, wisdom and knowledge of those who are actively engaged, not in politics but in the business life of the community. The honourable member for Parkes disclosed a rather peculiar attitude when he said., in effect, that the sugsources of the country will rest finally in gestion that businessmen should be appointed to a board to control the central bank is bad because a knowledge of business is bad unless it is combined with a knowledge of special conditions. That is the objective that the Government has in mind in seeking to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board under this measure. The proposed board will be composed of representatives of the Commonwealth Bank and representatives of commercial and industrial interests. I fail to understand the honourable member's objection to that proposal. He has indicated unconsciously that he, personally, approves of the measure, but is not able to say so because he must submit to party discipline. Another aspect of this problem is that our economy is a mixed economy. It is not wholly planned or unplanned and it is not wholly open or wholly closed. The Government is responsible for the control of monetary policy in the interests of the country as a whole, that is, in the interests of all sections of the community. The alternative to control of the central bank by a board in consultation with the Government in respect of monetary policy, as the bill provides, would be to reduce industrial and commercial actiin one man. But we cannot accept the required to direct the monetary policy of a country can be found in one man, however earnest, practical and capable he might be. The honourable member for be considered in this matter. I agree with him. For that reason, the Opposition is doing its best to delay the passage of this measure. The bill was originally introduced about six months ago. Had it then been passed it would have enabled the Government to mitigate to a great degree the' unfavorable economic conditions that have arisen in the interim. This proposal has been rehashed many times until there is very little left of it to talk about. However, two principal points remain. The first is that under this measure power to regulate the currency and monetary rethe hands of the elected representatives of the people. That is an open method of determining such policy and will make it extremely difficult for any interests to practise secret diplomacy in the financial world, as happened in the past.",64,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot

261,Mr Davis,"There is a good deal ofSecondly, as the honourable member for Parkes advocated, the personnel of the proposed board will be free from the influence of private banking interests, and will thus be able to work effectively for the well being of the commercial and industrial life of the community. Fundamentally, .this measure is designed to put the Commonwealth Bank, as we know it to-day, back into leg-irons by placing it under the control of a board of ten members who will not be responsible to the people, or to the Parliament. The honoraible member for Deakin( Mr board control. When we examine Davis) gave expression to a strange piece of reasoning when he said that he was sure that the members of the board would act in the interests of the country as a whole, when he, himself, does not know whom the Government will appoint to fill five of the positions on the board. The Government has refused to indicate whom it will appoint to those positions. Therefore, it is ridiculous for the honourable member to say that ten men of whom five have still to be named will do certain things. The honourable member criticized the Opposition for traversing the history of the Commonwealth Bank. He said that we should consider this measure in the light of existing circumstances. It may be quite convenient for Government supporters to take that view, but it is utterly illogical. Harvests are good or bad according to whether the seasons have been favorable or unfavorable. The present is a product of the past and any one who endeavours when considering this measure to separate the present from the past ignores the historical process. I shall deal briefly with the history of the Commonwealth Bank which has become known as the people's bank. That history may be divided into three periods. From 1912 to 1924 was the period of its birth and early days and during those years the bank was controlled, not by a board, but by a governor. During that period Australia passed throught the critical period of World WarI . and at that time the bank financed our war effort to the tune of £350,000,000.. In 1924, the Bruce Page Government placed the bank under the control of a board and, dealing with that legislation the Sydney Sun at that time saidThis measure turns the Commonwealth Bank into a bankers' bank. That statement was perfectly correct. The bank's structure and policy were altered and from 1924 to 1945 it was the robot of the private banking interests. That was the second period of the bank's history and because of its record during that period we do not want the bank to be again placed under the control of a board. The third period of the bank's history is from 1945 up to the present day, during which it again operated free from the story of the bank throughout those three periods in relation to financial control generally in this country we find that the institution expanded to the greatest degree and rendered the greatest service to the nation during the two periods when it was controlled not by a board but by a governor. It is for that reason that the Opposition is opposed to this measure. We shall be guided by the results achieved by the bank when it was under what Government supporters describe as "" one-man control"" -that is a misnomer-and not under board control. Our opposition to the measure is also based on the record of the previous Commonwealth Bank Board during the economic crisis from 1930 to 1934-Australia's economic Dunkirk-whe n the bank failed this country in its hour of need. The test of any government is how it handle's its job in a crisis and that observation applies also to individual leaders, or persons, charged with grave responsibility in any sphere. During the economic crisis from 1930 to 1934 when the Commonwealth Bank was under the control of a board it failed the country abjectly and completely. Therefore, the re-establishment of that system of control is not worthy of the slightest consideration. During that crisis those who controlled the Commonwealth Bank made finance our master instead of our servant. They put Australia in a financial straitjacket. They were smug and conservative and were beyond the control of the Parliament. At that time, as the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) has said, it was not the government of the day,",66,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot
262,Mr Duthie (Wilmot) _ [8.51],"or the elected representatives of the people, that controlled this country but a body that was beyond the control of the Parliament. Evidence of that stark fact is provided by the refusal of the then chairman of the Commonwealtb Bank Board, Sir Bobert Gibson, to make available to the .Scullin Government the requisite finance to carry on the affairs of the country. ""When Sir Bobert Gibson refused to make available the sum of £1S,000,000 to that government, he and the board were the real rulers of Australia.. It was a sad state of affairs when financial interests controlled sibility for national financial policy should rest upon the Treasurer of the day, guided by an advisory council and a cabinet of responsible men as well as by the Parliament. The responsibility for our financial destiny, the very lives of our people from day to day, should not be shaped by a hoard consisting of persons who are not accountable in any way to the people. In a democracy the people should control the financial policy of a country through their elected representatives. Finance is the economic lifeblood which flows through the arteries of a nation, and should be consistently available through loans, credit, cash sufficient quantities to keep us economically and financially healthy. If some one taps a financial artery and draws credit from circulation, the nation can bleed to death economically, just as a person can bleed to death if an artery is severed in his body. That is how important money and credit are to a country. Money must be kept in circulation, and the control of it should be in the hands of the elected representatives of the people. honourable member for Forrest( Mr Commonwealth Bank. ""We remember the Freeth), because the proposed bank board stories that honourable gentlemen opposite w ill be similar to the previous bank circulated dirring the last general election board. Members of the Government have campaign about our banking policy, and. eulogized the system of board control, indeed, we shall never forget them. Some even though it failed us in the greatest people have not yet recovered from the economic crisis in our history. A . F . W. f r i g h t that they received when they heard Plumptre, who was the Assistant Profesthem. Members of the staffs of private sor of Political Economyi n the University banks went from door to door, and of Toronto, in Canada, in 1940, wrote a alarmed the people with their prediction [14] book entitled Central Bankingi n the British Dominions. He was not an Australian, and he wrote from the point of view of an outsider who had studied the story of our Commonwealth Bank. A t page 101 of the book there appears his opinion of the Oommonwealth Bank setup that existed from 1924 to 1945, as follows:This much is clear: Sir Eobert Gibson who, in the formative years following 1942 was Chairman of the Bank's directorate, was sufficiently forceful to attract much power into his own hands. Whatever his gifts in other directions it is patent from his many utterances that he never acquired the point of view of the country. The respona modern central banker; nor was the heterogeneous group of directors, which Governments appointed beside him, sufficiently powerful or well informed to guide him. Unfortunately such a dominant personality at the head of the directorate naturally tended to withdraw influence from the permanent officers of the Bank; for, continuously confronted with central banking problems, they at any rate would have acquired the appropriate point of view. Possessed of the proper point of view, ani of greater influence, their approach to central banking practice might have been less tentative. Recent developments seem to reflect the mergence of a more positive attitude. That is his summing up of Sir Bobert Gibson, whose record as the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board has been eulogized by the Government. According and our pay envelopes in to Professor Plumptre, Sir Bobert Gibson attracted power into his own hands and became a little dictator. In that role he drew power and influence away from the officers of the Commonwealth Bank, and that was a serious matter. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), who was Commonwealth Treasurer for eight years, did not at any time overrule the Governor of the bank. That is a remarkable fact, because members of the Government continually criticize what they call the "" one man control"" of the bank by the Governor. They say that we socialists It w ill be under this bill. want to grab the people's wealth through I disagree with the our system of one-man control of the great",67,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot

The Leader of the Opposition said a few months agoDuring the eight years that I was Treasurer, inchiding the period of four years since the 1945 Commonwealth Bank. Act has been in operation, I did not at any time overrule the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. There was never any need for me to do so because I was always able to come to a satisfactory decision. Tliat observation applies in respect of not only Dr. Coombs and Mr Armitage, who preceded hini as Governor of the bank, but even when there wae a Commonwealth Bank Board in existence. I have ncver issued a written instruction yet. I have expressed my views about what I thought should lie done but at no time was it necessary for ine to exercise that particular power. Yet honourable members opposite talk about "" one-man control"" of the Commonwealth Bank, and a financial dictatorship! That is a bogy that they deliberately raised during the last general election campaign to mislead the people into believing that the appointment of a heterogeneous group of directors to control the Commonwealth Bank was desirable.' Of course, the bank functioned most satisfactorily while Mr communicated to the Parliament. The Chifley was Treasurer. able member may not refer to another honourable meniber by his name. Speaker. tunate habit here. statement by the Leader of the Opposition should nail the lie that honourable gentlemen opposite have circulated to the effect that the right honorahle gentleman dominated, and indeed was the dictator of the Commonwealth Bank, controlled it in accordance with his own ideas, and overruled the decisions of the Governor. As the Commonwealth Bank has functioned with complete satisfaction under the present system of control, why does the Government wish to alter it? We consider that the bank should be free from outside interests, and should be responsible to the Treasurer of the day, whether he be the right honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley) or the right honourable meniber for McPherson( Mr Fadden). The Treasurer is responsible to the Cabinet, which is answerable to the Parliament and finally to the people. That is the logical way in which to control the Commonwealth Bank. The Advisory Council, which was appointed in .1.945 when tbe bank board was sacked, consists of four outstanding men in financial circles. They are not private bankers or the representatives of other financial institutions but public servants. They ha.ve met monthly during the last four years. They see the cables that are received in Australia daily about the financial trends in other countries, aud from day to day they keep in touch with one another, and with the Treasurer. Financial matters are thoroughly discussed at their meetings, and the Treasurer is advised of their views. Sometimes he may be called to a meeting, and at other times they wait on him as a deputation. All the facts are sifted, decisions are made, the Cabinet is informed of them through the Treasurer, and, ultimately, they are annual report of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank is submitted to this House. As a matter of fact, the latest report was distributed to honourable members earlier this week. The operations of and studied by the Treasurer, who is able to keep his finger on the financial and economic pulse of the country. What is I believe that that wrong with that kind of administration of the Commonwealth Bank? Do honourable members opposite pretend to discover any evidence of dictatorship there? I do not suggest for a moment that the right honourable member for McPherson, who has been Commonwealth Treasurer for ten months, has been a financial dictator during that period, yet the bank has been under the administration, not of a board, but of the Governor. The present system of control is precisely the same as",68,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot

270,Mr Duthie,"tliat wliieh Mr Chifley established in 1945. remind the honourable gentleman that he should say "" the right honourable member for Macquarie "", or "" the leader of the Opposition "". The present Treasurer has not been a financial dictator, and all the talk about the necessity to establish the Commonwealth Bank Board in order to avoid the dangers of one-man control must not be accepted without careful examination. The House has not even been informed of the names of some of the persons whom the Government proposes to appoint to the board. I look for a more sinister reason for this eagerness to re-establish it. Undoubtedly, the board would short-circuit the effectiveness of the Commonwealtli Bank which has functioned with complete satisfaction to the people since the abolition of the previous board in 1945. I propose to ask a series of questions. Why is this change proposed if the administration of the bank at the present time is completely satisfactory? I believe that the Commonwealth Bank has been so successful during the last five years, and has been such a strong competitor with the private trading banks, which backed the Government during the last general election campaign, that the Government must clip the bank's wings, place difficulties in its way, hamper its operations with leg-irons, or even strangle it, just as on the Commonwealth Bank because it it was almost strangled under the administration of the previous board. The Government believes that the operations of the bank should be restricted. The Treasurer, when he moved the second reading of the bill, endeavoured to whitewash the Government's intentions, and to give the impression that it wholeheartedly supported the expansion of the bank. However, his efforts were designed to have the effect of a smokescreen for the purpose of hiding the real purposes of the Government in seeking to re-establish the board. Government supporters have criticized the system of what they call "" one-man control "" of the 'bank, and I have pointed out that their charges in respect of a. financial dictatorship are completely unfounded, and, indeed, are a bogy that has been deliberately raised in an endeavour to mislead the people. My next question is: Has there been anything in the management of the Commonwealth Bank since 1945 that can be criticized? I claim that the answer .is in the negative. Has anything been done during the lastfive years that has not been for the good of the community and in the interests of the sound management of the bank? Again the answer is "" No"". Can it be said that Mr Armitage, and, later, Dr. Coombs, took any action that was prejudicial to our national welfare? A fair-minded man must answer "" No"" to that question: answer would be that the previous Government tried to destroy the private trading banks. of them. That subject is not related to this bill. ment used the Commonwealth Bank as an instrument to destroy. the private banks. General( Mr Anthony) still believes in Father Christmas. ment persist with this bill, which is designed to give the private trading banks another opportunity to place leg-irons is so successful to-day? In 1945 the previous Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) introduced legislation to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act, and the bank board was abolished. In the 35 years that the -bank had then been in operation, 373 trading branches had been established. When the Labour Government freed tha bank of control by the board, the number of branches was increased considerably. In the years 1946 and 1947, 90 new branches were opened. Yet under the old system of control, only 373 branches were established in 35 years. It is obvious to me that the bank has progressed considerably since the shackles, represented by the conservative board, were removed from it.

We do not know for bow long tbe present economic conditions will last, and we must be prepared to meet the effects of a slump in the prices that are paid overseas for our export commodities. It is only a war, or a threat, of war, that is ^holding the Tjnited States of America together economically. Should those conditions pass, the prices of onr exports may decline as a result of the restriction of credit. We should ibe armed economically just as the Government wants us to be armed militarily, and if we bring back board control of the Oommonwealth Bank we shall be striking directly at the heart of our economy. The re-establishment of the board would knock aside the props that should maintain our economy in the event of another worddrwide depression. The dire prophecies of doom that were uttered by the present Prime Minister and the present Treasurer in 1945, when the Commonwealth Bank Board was sacked, make one wonder to-day whether they spoke with sincerity. The present Prime Minister, speaking as the Leader of the Opposition, described the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 as reactionary and unsound. He said that it would weaken the central bank and tend to destroy the currency, and that one-man control of the bank would lead to the subdevelop throughout Australia; it can ordination of its Governor to' the Government. the right honourable gentleman on the 21st March, 1945. On the following day, the present Treasurer described the bill as a revolutionary measure. Thus, the leader of one anti-Labour party described it as reactionary and the leader of the other anti-Labour party expressed the entirely opposite view. The Leader' of the Australian Country party also said, on the 22nd March, 1945, that the legislation represented a sentence of death upon private banks, and that it would liave an adverse effect on overseas conversion operations, would lead to instability and lack of confidence and would make currency policy the plaything of politics. Not one of those dreadful results has come to pass in the succeeding Mr Pnthie. five years. The Jeremiahs of 1945 were less reliable than was the Jeremiah of biblical days, whose prophecies came to pass. Labour party was not able to nationalize the banks. nationalize the banks, but it was proved that we could not do so constitutionally. Those thunderous prophecies failed to materialize, and therefore the leaders of the present Government parties are now unable to advance any arguments with which to convince the people that events have justified, the re-establishment of a conservative Commonwealth Bank Board not elected by the people and not responsible to the people. Unless they can convince the electors on that score, the bill will not be allowed to pass this Parliament. The manager of a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in a Tasmanian town told me recently that the business transacted by the bank in that district had increased by 400 per cent, over the last two years. That is typical of the rapid expansion that has taken place under the existing system of control. We do not want the bank to be strangled so that the country will revert to the conditions of the old days, when the private institutions controlled the finances of the nation. The Commonwealth Bank is now free to extend its activities to any area where That attack was made by its services are needed. ber only wants to strangle the private banks. banks held the field unchallenged in this country for over a century. The time has come for them to face real competition that will put them on their toes, keep interest rates down and keen credit flowing.

283,Mr Duthie,"Yes.the Labour party want to nationalize the banks? not have eliminated competition. I am sorry that the honourable gentleman has not appreciated that fact. The situation in the field of banking to-day is competitive but the private banks want to re-establish a monopoly for themselves. They enjoyed a virtual monopoly before the Commonwealth Bank was released from board control in 1945. T remind supporters of the Government that during the last 50 years the number of private banks operating in Australia has decreased from 56 to only nine. The stronger banks are gradually squeezing out their weaker competitors with the object ultimately of bringing the whole financial system of the nation into the hands of two or three great private institutions. The legislation that was enacted by the last Labour government was designed to prevent that undesirable circumstance. The nationalization of banking would merely have eliminated the other form of monopoly that private banks had exercised for a century or more. Tbe Commonwealth Bank, if untrammelled, will keep finance flowing throughout the nation. Its General Banking Division, Rural Credits Department, Mortgage Bank Department and Industrial Finance Department will pump life-blood through the veins of industry and commerce. The activities of the bank will keen interest rates at a low level, a condition that is vital to our progress and development -before this House to-day. If the will of Interest charges crippled Australia prior to World War II .

The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr of the bank, as opposed to board Duthie) appeared to be unable to understand wby the Government had found it necessary to introduce the bill that is now before the House. After examining the most recent report of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, I can realize why the honourable gentleman knows very little about the subject. I shall try to enlighten him. After all, the Commonwealth Bank has only six branches in Tasmania whereas it has 246 in New South Wales, which is more than there are in all the other States combined. Labour government! There may be some significance in the fact that a certain Labour Premier of New South Wales some years ago contributed very largely to the development of the Commonwealth Bank in that State. The Government has introduced this legislation because it has a mandate from the people to do so. There could not be a better reason for its introduction. All of us know that the subject of banking was a key issue at the general election last year, and there can be no doubt about the decision of the people on that issue. The Government has a clear mandate not only to obliterate the 1947 legislation from thc statute-book, but also to amend the legislation of 1945 so as to provide for control of the Commonwealth Bank to be vested in a board. Those honourable members who have said that the Government cannot justify the introduction of this bill have overlooked the expressed will of the people of Australia. This is a democracy, and the people have spoken. The Government ik merely keeping faith with the people. In fact, the bill should not be the people had not been thwarted by the Opposition earlier this year, it would now be law and the proposed Commonwealth Bank Board would be operating. Responsibility for the delay rests exclusively upon the Opposition. We have heard a great deal about the history of the Commonwealth Bank during this debate, and members of the Opposition have endeavoured to convince us that one-man control control, has been successful. Anybody who suggests that the Commonwealth Bank was a failure when it was controlled by a board is not being realistic and is ignoring the facts.

In fact, the greater part of his time and that of his deputy, Dr. Lloyd Ross, who lives in my electorate and who was a member of the Communist party u n t i l he resigned from it not very long ago should like to know what relevance D r . Lloyd Ross's connection with the Department of Post-war Reconstruction some years ago has to do w i th the measure before the House. honourable member's remarks are quite in order. Lloyd Ross merely to show the relationship between socialism and the control of the Commonwealth Bank, with which this measure deals. WhatI have been saying bears relation to the general debate because I was referring to matters that occurred about the time that the former Prime Minister decided to implement his plans to use the Commonwealth Bank to socialize this country. There is no doubt that D r . Coombs and his lieutenant stumped the country selling the idea of socialism to the people. In due course D r . Coom'bs, who is, I repeat, an able man, was appointed Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. While he is under the control of people who really believe in democracy in the true sense, as do the members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, he can do little harm. However, it is preferable that he should be sitting at a board table alongside men who are prepared to carry out the policy of democracy. It is essential, therefore, that the bank be placed under the control of a board instead of being under the control of a single individual. It is said that since 1945, when the bank was placed under the control of a governor, no great harm has been done, but who knows whether or not harm has been done? I shall pose a certain question to the House. Who is responsible for having made the decision to devalue the Australian £1 in SepMinister and Treasurer, the present Wasi t the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank? I do not know. This House does not know. The people of Australia do not know, under one-man control, but under the control that we suggest they would know, and the Government would know. The facts of the matter would be tabled in this House. TheI Governor of the bank, D r . Coombs, makes the following statement in the bank's report for the year ended the 30th June last:It would appear, however, that the results devaluation has so far achieved in increasing the dollar earnings of the sterling area do not warrant any nieasure of complacency. Some of the effects of thc devaluations that are directly related to the Australian economy I mentioned D r . are covered earlier in this Beport. In general they added to the inflationary pressures but to an extent difficult to measure. The point that I am making is, who was responsible for that one act that has cost the people of Australia so much, and has contributed so greatly to the increased cost of livin g that we hear so much about at the present time? I do not know whether the Governor of the bank is responsible or not but I suggest that the matter would have been given a very much greater airing, and much more consideration, had the decision been made by a board established in the for m in which this Government proposes to establish one. Then, not only would it have received greater attention but in addition the people's rights would have been protected to a greater degree, and the people would have known the reasons that lay behind and prompted devaluation. The report f r o n n which I have just quoted is very interesting and I consider that it is a credit to the Governor of the bank that he has paid a compliment to the trading banks of Australia in the fallowing statement :In the administration of credit policy, the Central Bank has had the co-operation of the private banks whose extensive contacts and valuable experience have enabled them to make an important contribution . . .",74,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot

308,Mr Cramer,"Although the Governor of the bank saw fit to pay that compliment to the trading banks, I have not heard during this debate one word from the opposite side of the House about the great job that the trading banks do, are doing, and have done for Australia, about their contribution to the development of this country from its infancy. As a matter of fact the gi'eater part of banking business in Australia is carried out by the trading banks, who are giving a magnificent service and are properly and healthfully engaged in competition with the Commonwealth Bank. I. wish to make it clear that the reason he has given us an exhibition of spleen why we are debating this measure to-night such as is very seldom seen in this House. is principally the great obsession in the We on this side of the House always try mind of one man who does not intend to avoid attacking men in high publio to let his teeth out of this proposition office, but the honourable gentleman went until eventually, by fair means or foul, out of his way to try to belittle Dr. he socializes banking, in Australia in Coombs. Admittedly he tried to render order that he may socialize the lives of his criticism less harsh by saying at the the people. There is no question about end of his speech that "" Dr. Coombs that. That is the basis upon which the is a clever man and that as long as an wliole of this fight is taking place and anti-Labour government is in office the upon which the Opposition is striving for Liberal party will be able to supervise one-man. control of the bank. It is to him and everything will be well. But prevent that socialization of the very he stated very clearly that Dr. Coombs lives of the people that the Government had stumped the country preaching the has pledged itself to re-institute the board benefits of socialism to the people. system. It is only by the re-establishment of the board that the people's rights can be properly and fully protected. 'Afr. DAVIES -What is wrong with the able members on this side mention thc bank, anyhow?

Why have the Bank of England Leader of the Opposition.

[9.51] -It is a great pity that the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) should have seen fit to import into this debate the personalities in which he has indulged. I consider that I am amazed at the arguments that honourable members opposite have adduced during this debate. When honorachievements of the present Leader of",75,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot
309,"Mr Speaker,",Order! The honor,76,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot
310,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"and Dr. Coombs, I consider that be has come to a sorry pass. I did not expect, when I was asked to speak on this measure to-night, that it would fall to my lot to have to refer to any honourable meniber in the terms that I have just used in respect of the honourable member for Bennelong, but I consider he did go out of his way to besmirch men to whom he should give credit instead of attempting to belittle them. He spoke about one-man control of the Commonwealth Bank and about the aim of the Government in regard to it. He also spoke about Dr. Coombs and of the allegedly sinister influence which the Leader of the Opposition, while Treasurer, exercised upon him, thereby implying that Dr. Coombs did what he was told by that right honourable gentleman. wished to abolish one-man control and to get rid of a man who would do his best to give effect to socialism. During this debate other honourable members have made use of remarks to the effect that under the bill this Parliament will bc able to exercise control .over the activities of the bank and have implied that that is a democratic provision. The people should understand why the bill was brought down. astonished, as were many of our leading newspapers, at its really small and inconsequential nature. I consider that it will not achieve what the honourable member has said the Government has in mind. Let honourable members imagine how the people outside must feel when they hear Governnient supporters talking about mandates. The honourable member for Bennelong claimed that the Government was given a mandate to introduce this bill. Last week honourable members opposite claimed the Government had a mandate to ban communism. Previously they had claimed that it had another mandate to abolish petrol rationing, and another to pay endowment for the first child. same mandate. that they all were the same mandate. Years ago I said in a State parliament that the only way to obtain a mandate is to have a referendum on a specific question. I still hold that opinion. When a political party or a coalition of parties goes to the people with a dozen or more different items of policy, some people vote on one item and some on another, and it is beyond my comprehension that it can be claimed that all the people voted for all and gave the Government a mandate in respect of every one. I revert to the matter of one-man control and the proposal to abolish it. We are now debating a measure that affects policy and not administration, because the Governor and his assistants will, under this law as they did before, deal with administration. The Government wishes to be able to determine the ]jolicy of the bank. The honourable memHe said that the Government ber for Bennelong asked who was responsible for the devaluation of our £.1 concurrently with the devaluation of sterling. I say straight out that the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) was responsible for it. I do not know whose advice he had about it, whether he had advice from the Advisory Council of the Commonwealth Bank, or only from the Governor of the bank, or whether hedid it without any advice at all, but he was the man responThey were sible for it. Now the honourable member for Bennelong, who has just left the chamber, says that the Government proposes, under the bill, to abolish one-man control and to pass control over to a board. Let us see how the responsibility will be placed under the bill. Clause7 (2.) statesSubject to this Part, the Board shall have power to determine the policy of tbe Bank or of the Savings Bank in relation to any matter and to take such action as is necessary . . . The clause also states that when the board decides a policy matter and the Treasurer does not agree with its decision, he may, through the Governor General, determine the policy. Under the bill the Treasurer will have the same control that he has under the present act. To say that this Parliament is to be given control over the bank is ridiculous. The bill states that if the members of the board do not do as the Treasurer directs he shall prepare a statement of the board's opinion to put before the House.",76,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot

314,Mr Thompson,"Not just ""youtheir money would not he safe in the bank. I appreciate the honourable .member's statement that the subject of banking loomed largely at the recent general elecPrime Minister of the day who selected tion. But what the people were concerned about, in the main, was the nationalization of banking, not whether the Commonwealth Bank's policy should be controlled by the Governor with the assistance of an advisory committee, with the Treasurer having the final determination in the matter, or whether the bank should be controlled by a board of ten members. I do not think that the people are very -concerned about tliat point, but I can quite understand why honourable members on the Government side are concerned about it. Many of them are men of my own type, but they realize that they arc representing the big financial interests Minister and Treasurer the present Goof this country. There is no question about that. Some years ago, in the Parliament of South Australia, I was a membei of a conimittee of managers that had 1 been appointed to try to compose the differences of thc two houses in respect of legislation then before the Parliament. After we had deliberated a leading member of the Government party said to me, "" I must congratulate you on the fight you put up, but my people are giving me hell for not doing something more for them"". He recognized that, whilst a member of the party that then constituted, the Government might be prepared to work in his district and do everything possible for pensioners and others, when it came to a showdown in Parliament his vote went to support the big interests that his party represented and against the interests of the people. I was a member of the Opposition in that Parliament for ten years and never, on any matter of major policy of the party concerned, was there any wavering in a division. Each member would vote with his own party, except, occasionally, when the matter was not of any great consequence. I have seen that happen once since I have been in this House, but it happens very rarely, even on small matters. I thought that the honourable member I mean Bunnerong. I think that the for Bennelong was rather offensive, people who are listening in will suffer although he may not have meant to be, some blackouts. They hear a Labour when he said that the former Treasurer man speak and what he says seems all Mr Thompson. had his first lesson in banking when he was appointed to the banking commission. Did the honourable member think very highly of the judgment of the Liberal for appointment to a banking commission a man who had his first lesson in banking when he took up that position ? The honourable gentleman belittled not only the Leader of the Opposition, but also his own leader of that day. I hope that the Government does not insist on the reconstitution of the bank board. If it does so, its attitude towards making more money available for the Mortgage Bank Department and the Industrial Einanee Department is not very genuine. The honourable member has just admitted that even during the regime of the right honourable member for Macquarie as Prime vernor of the bank did not do any harm. I am wondering why, if Dr. Coombs is not a fit and proper person for the position, the present Government is retaining him as Governor of the bank. The honourable member says it is because he has done a good job. He also claimed that the Leader of the Opposition was trying to implement his sinister beliefs through the medium of the Commonwealth Bank, yet in the next breath he said he should like to know who was influencing the exchange rate and inferred that it was Dr. Coombs. First he said that the Leader of the Opposition exercised a sinister influence on the bank; then he said that the sinister and dangerous mind was that of Dr. Coombs. He cannot have it both ways. To cap all, he admitted that Dr. Coombs is a clever man who' did not do any-harm-in which category he also placed the previous Governor-bu t claimed that one does not know what might happen in the future. He said that while there is a Liberal government there is no danger and then demanded the reconstitution of the bank board. I cannot understand his line of argument. about blackouts.. We have had them in our State, but not because of Bennelong-",78,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot

316,Mr Thompson,"I do not knowright; then when an honorahle member opposite speaks, his side of the question seems all right and they can only come to the conclusion that they should stick to their own side. That is the conclusion of many people outside; but after listening to the honourable member for Bennelong they will have a few blackouts on this matter and will be unable to understand the issues. I am not concerned about the identity of the five men who are to be appointed to the proposed board. Some of my colleagues have asked whom they are to be, but I am not concerned about that. day will decide their identity, and when he does so decide, he will not ' place men in the position of being able to formulate policy who have different beliefs from his own. If he did so, he would merely be admitting that his own ideas were not dependable and that he was putting someone else on the board to prevent his own wrong ideas from being put into effect. It is quite clear that the Treasurer of the day will appoint five men whom he believes will formulate the policy which he considers is in the best interests of Austhe currency, up or down, that board tralia. I do not cavil at that, but it shows that the identity of the five men need not concern us at all. Seven persons are to be appointed, two of whom may come from the Public Service, but it is not provided that they shall be public servants. It is laid down that five shall not come from the bank or the Public Service, and that if two are appointed from the Public Service their terms of office may be terminated by the Treasurer at any time. At the discretion of the Treasurer one of the other five members will hold office for five years, one for four years, one for three years, one for two years and one for one year. Each year one will retire. N'o doubt the man appointed for one year will be the person of whom the Treasurer is most doubtful. The one apointed for five years will be the man in whom the Treasurer reposes the most confidence. mind the honourable member has! mind. ' I am detailing what I believe to be the common-sense view on this matter. able member's time has expired. I know that if the honourable member for Hume( Mr Charles Anderson) had to engage one person for a year and one for a week, he would engage for the year the man in whom he had most confidence. Therefore, what I say is the ordinary plain truth. The threat of a double dissolution on the issue of this bill has been made. I repeat what I said six months ago, that this is a sham fight. The Government would not dream of having a double dissolution on this matter alone. If the Government requires the passage of this measure only in order to obtain The Treasurer of the power with regard to profits and capital for the Mortgage Bank Department, as the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) suggested to-day, I cannot understand honourable members arguing about the board. The Government has only one object in view; that is, to constitute the proposed bank board. Its object is not to increase the capital of the various departments of the bank, but to set up a board which will take responsibility for policy away from the Treasurer. The honourable member for Bennelong said that if there were a proposal to revalue would consider it and its report would be tabled in. this Parliament. I do not know where he got that idea., because I cannot see anything in the bill to that effect. If any disagreement occurs between the Treasurer and the board, and the Treasurer overrides the board, then the matter will be brought here; but I tell bonorable members that the only time any such controversial matter will come before this House for discussion will be when the Treasurer orders the board to do something against its wish and the Treasurer's instruction is carried out. Apart from that, honourable members will have no voice in the policy of the bank. The people listening in and the people throughout the country should realize that the story about honourable members heing able to discuss in Parliament any of these financial matters is just a myth, because only in the circumsuch matters will ever come before the Parliament.",79,Cameron Th E Right An Important Factor Those Who Cannot

The honourable member for Port Adelaide has not given any reasons why the decision already made by this House should be changed. Mr TiroMi'SON -What is the place for? no good at all. It can be abolished as far as I am concerned. The honourable member gave no valid reason why the decision of this House should be reversed. He referred to certain clauses insisted upon by the Government as essential if there is to be satisfactory and progressive administration of the Commonwealth Bank. The main clause in dispute seems to have been moulded upon the ideas of a previous Labour Treasurer who was of the firm opinion that provision should be made for a bank board. Boards are in control of all our great modern banking institutions. In fact, throughout the world most large financial institutions are controlled by board. The Labour party is of the opinion that one individual, who is subservient to political control, should administer the bank. Banking institutionls shouldi be freed fro m the possibility of political attack. for Port Adelaide( MrI n recent history honourable members may find one example of a political attack on a bank. That occurred when the actions of a New South Wales Labour government, after wrecking its own Saving Bank, were responsible for a serious rush by depositors to withdraw their savings from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. That attack failed and a further threat was averted with the removal from office of the government concerned and assumption of oflice by a non-Labour government. That administration had a diflicult job to build up public confidence which had been almost shattered by the political attack on the bank. In the interests of the future of the Commonwealth Bank this Governshall control the bank and that they shall have certain freedom, of action. The late MrE . G. Theodore, the greatest Labour Treasurer, originated the scheme that this Government is now putting into force and which is being blocked by the Labour party. We know that the Labour Opposition in the Senate will hold up this measure because Labour wants the Commonwealth Bank to continue to be controlled solely by one man, that is, by a czar or a Stalin other who shall not be open to advice from any one. The Bank of England is still controlled by a board, although the socialist Government of GreatB r it a in passed legislation in 1946 to nationalize banking. That board consists of a governor, two deputy governors and sixteen directors. The Reserve Bank of SouthA f r i c a is controlled by a governor, a deputy governor and nine directors; the Beserve Bank of In d ia is controlled by .a governor, two deputy governors and ten directors; the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is controlled by a governor, a deputy governor and seven directors, and the Bank of Canada is controlled by a governor, a deputy governor and eleven directors.

Yet, because tbe Labour party accepts dictation from an outside junta, this legisand even the Australian Laibour party lation was rejected by the Labour Opposition in the Senate when it was originally introduced six months ago. Labour has employed the same tactics in respect of other legislation because it accepts dictation from interests that are not concerned about the welfare of this nation but, on the contrary, have virtually declared war upon Australia. Thus, the will of the majority of the people as expressed by the majority of members in this chamber is being frustrated. Those interests to which I have referred are responsible for under-production of materials essential to our industrial and economic development. They seek to increase the cost of living and to aggravate the disabilities confronting our people. The members of the Opposition are merely agents of those interests, and tbeir attitude towards this bill is clear evidence that they are Avilling to act as tools of those interests Avhich are determined to Avreck our democratic institutions. Under this measure no person Avho is associated Avith private banking institutions Avill be appointed to the proposed board. That provision answers fully the arguments to the contrary that members of the Opposition have advanced in this debate. The Government has already indicated that the members of the proposed board will include two gentlemen Avho are among the greatest economists in this country. The Government is prepared to place its trust in them although one of them, the present GoA^ernor of the bank, who was appointed to that position by tbe previous Government, and for whom members of all parties have the greatest respect, is known to be steeped in socialistic theories. The Government's proposal to place the Commonwealth Bank under the control of a board was accepted by the late Mr Theodore when he was Treasurer in the Scullin Labour Government. The policy of the great Commonwealth Bank was controlled by a board from 1924 until 1945, when the Labour Government became imbued with Communist ideals, abolished the board, and made one man the dictator of that institution. Every great commercial enterprise, every private bank, are directly controlled by boards or executives. ""Why then, should the great CommonAvealth Bank, Avhich controls the financial and monetary policy of this country, be denied the advantages of direction by a board ? The former Labour treasurer, Mr E. G. Theodore, favoured the system of control of the CommonAvealth Bank by a board. In vieAV of that fact, the present Government should not be criticized by the Labour party because i i also favours that form of control. This young CommonAvealth should have the benefit of the services of able men to direct the financial and monetary policy of the bank. The Labour party, however, demands that control shall continue to be vested in one man, a. financial dictator. job? has been no turmoil in the finances of Australia during the' last nine months because the Labour party has not been in office. Had it been in power, the present Governor might not have done a good job. The fact that the right honourable member for McPherson( Mr Eadden) is the Treasurer may have prevented a repetition of the difficulties that beset this country during the financial and economic depression of the early 1930's. It is true that the Commonwealth Bank was controlled by a board in those yea.rs, but, unfortunately, the Scullin Labour Government Avas in office at that time, and Australia was overtaken by a Avorld depression that no board or individual could have prevented in this country under the existing . circumstances. Let us forget about the Stalinists. Let us re-establish in respect of the Commonwealth Bank the system of control that is in operation in the other countries constituting the British Commonwealth of nations.

What the Communists advocate on n. Sunday is repeated by members of the Labour party during the following week. They are bitterly hostile to the proposal sented :to abolish the one-man system of control of the Commonwealth Bank by the appointee of the Chifley Labour Government. Their opposition, no doubt, is strengthened by the realization that they will not hold oflice in this Parliament for many years planation is so obvious that the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) must be aware of it. The Labour party, if it considered that it had any prospect of being returned to oflice in the next six years, would not resist this bill .so strongly, because it would know that it would have an opportunity, in due course, to abolish the bank board. McmThe bers of the Opposition are making a lastditch stand against the re-establishment of the board, in spite of the fact that the people endorsed that feature of our policy at the last general election. This House agreed a few months ago to the re-appointment of. the board, but the Government has not been able to fulfil its pre-election promise because the Senate has accepted dictation from the definitely its consideration of the original bill. Indeed, that executive told members of the Parliamentary Labour party that they must vote against that nieasure. Is that democratic? Members of the Opposition, if they were confident of regaining the treasury bench in the next ten years, would not be hostile to this legislation, because they would know that tbey would be able to amend it later. However, they recognized that they will sit in opposition for the .next twenty years.
