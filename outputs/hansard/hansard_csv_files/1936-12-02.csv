Has the Government yet come to a decision in the matter, and, if so, will the right honourable gentleman inform . the House as to its nature? communication from Mrs. Freer's legal representative, seeking permission for her to enter Australia or a tribunal to deal with her case.

Question not answered. for the Interior if a certain ""Walter Townsend Hunt, resident of Neutral Bay, Sydney, gave him information regarding Mrs. Freer in the form of a seven-page letter? Is he aware that this person has a criminal record, that he was convicted for perjury and served twelve months imprisonment for that offence, and was also convicted for false pretences, for which offence he served nine months imprisonment? an honourable member should not ask "" I s the Minister aware of the fact?"". If honourable members would read the rules governing the asking of questions, it would not be necessary for the Speaker so frequently to call them to order in this respect. Interior aware that informed the honourable member that he should not, ask his question in that form. Interior whether the difficulties that have informed that the person from whom he received certain information, has served case sentences of three months in India, twelve months in Sydney for perjury, and nine months for false pretences?

As to the part, of the question which suggests that I gave the man a promise to assist him. what every other honourable member of this chamber, including the honourable member for Martin, would have done, and no doubt has done, on many occasions, when approached by a person looking for a job. I said that if there was anything I could do to assist him I would do it. ment by the Minister that he had banned Mrs. Freer's entry to Australia on information received prior to the interview with the person at Neutral Bay, and that, his information was quite sufficient to justify such a ban, will the honourable gentleman inform the House of . the cost incurred in sending a departmental officer by car to Neutral Bay to interview a certain person there?

Question not answered. HOUR OE MEETING. That the House, at its rising, adjourn until II a.m. to-morrow. Sir Yesterday, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) asked the following question, without notice:W it h reference to the fatal shooting of a section 7 of the Customs Tariff (Industries public officer in Thornbury, Melbourne, recently, by a militar y trainee, can the Minister for Defence inform the House as to the rules and regulations governing the rights and authority of individual trainees to carry weapons when not on duty and also to use ammunition? If ho is not in a position to give such information forthwith, w ill he kindly obtain a report on the matter for the information of honourable members? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that arms, such . as rifies, which are the personal weapons of individual soldiers, are made a personal issue. They remain in the possession of the soldiers, who are responsible for their care and safe custody. A soldier who puts such a weapon to improper use is dealt with by his commanding officer, and, should the improper use be a breach of the law, he is amenaible to the norma! processes of law. Under no circumstances are soldiers permitted to have ball ammunition in their possession after dismissal from parade, and, by order of the Military Board, the men are periodically reminded of this prohibition. TheI claim the right to ask case to which reference has been made is being inquired into, but, as the inquest has not been held, and the matter is still sub judice, it would be undesirable to complete the departmental inquiries at this stage.

Is not this company connected with the Australian Investment Company Limited, hotter known as Vcsteys. Are not the offices of both companies located in the same building in Sydney. Is the honourable Eric John Harrison, M.H.B., whose name appears in the list of directors of this company, identical with the honourable member for Wentworth, a former Minister of the Interior? I am now able to supply the following answer:The company in question submitted its prospectus to my department for approval. It has been established for tlie purpose of developing certain products in the Northern Territory. According to the prospectus the Honourable E. J. Harrison is on the directorate of tlie company. I I am informed that the company has no connection w-hatever with the Australian Investment Agency or Vesteys, although it happens that the company has its office in the same building as the Australian Investment Agency. The Australian Investment Agency (or Vesteys) holds a lease of Melville Island. According to the prospectus of tbe North Austi a l i a Enterprise Limited, the company proposes to purchase a lease of Melville Island from the Australian Investment Agency. That would be a perfectly legitimate business transaction. Apparently Mr Hutchins, one of the directors, has an option to purchase the lease and the company proposes to acquire that option.

91,,"I gained personal knowMr McEWEN -But we all know thatUntil he is able to furnish us with figures just as definite as those which I have cited, he must be prepared to meet with a challenge that the rate of duty on unassembled chassis has been doubled. No man in this .House has supported more solidly the principle of trade diverobject to the change from the ad valorem sion than I have, but I say, in respect of the Canadian motor car, that the Government is endeavouring to divert trade in cars for which the people of Australia liave indicated their preference to a type of car manufactured in the United Kingdom, the sales figures of whicli indicate that it is not wanted by the Australian car iisers. I say, without fear of contradiction, that the cars manufactured in England do not constitute a type suitable to Australian conditions, or desired by the Australian users, and, whilst I stand behind the Government solidly on the principle of trade diversion, I am not able to support it in diverting trade in such a way as to deprive the Australian car user of the type he wants, in an endeavour to force him to use a type entirely unsuited to Australian conditions. English motor cars are subjected to a horse-power tax, which means that their power is less than that which it would normally be, and also less than the power which is necessary in a car equipped to cope with Australian conditions. I do not have to argue that; I merely have to refer to the percentage of American makes of cars imported from Canada and used iby Australians, as against the percentage of cars imported from the United Kingdom and used by Australians. There is no need for me to mention the actual figures-al l honourable members are familiar with them-bu t they speak for themselves, and indicate that the typical English car is neither desired in Australia, nor suitable to the conditions here. I cannot support the Government in diverting the trade from a sister dominion for the purpose of forcing the Australian public to buy a type of car which it does not want. With regard to the application of the principle of trade diversion to foreign cars, however, I am wholeheartedly in support of the Government. I stand on that matter as I stood last night. I trust that the Government's policy will mean that in. a time not far distant we shall be able to manufacture cars in Australia, and, pending receipt of the report of the Tariff Board on the proposal, I am prepared to support the bounty duty, but I do basis to the new per lb. basis in its application to Canadian cars. This change is not necessary to assist the establishment of the motor car industry in this country, and it is not desirable to divert the car trade from Canada to England,, where a less suitable motor vehicle isproduced. Two further aspects of this matter which are worthy of consideration are:: first, the change of the method of imposing the duty from the ad valorem basis' to the weight basis has had the effect of substantially increasing the rate of duty imposed on the cheaper type of car, and substantially lowering the rate of duty imposed on the luxury or expensive type of car. The weight of metal used in the manufacture of a luxury car is uot substantially greater than the weight of the metal used in the manufacture of the cheaper cars. The weight of luxury cars, as the honourable member terms them, is substantially greater than the weight of cheaper cars. pensive cars are heavier than the cheaper cars, but I still argue that the change from the ad valorem basis to the weight basis definitely has had the effect of increasing the rate of duty on the cheap cars and substantially lowering it on the expensive car. An examination of the figures will substantiate that. The second ooint I desire to make is that the 'Government is proposing to divert trade from a sister dominion, from which, almost without exception, cars .are imported unassembled and without 'any body or components parts of the body. It is proposing to divert that trade to'the United Kingdom, which produces, a car which, in the first place, is not suitable to Australian conditions, and, ' in .the second place, because the imports will'not be subjected to. the weight'duty/will-be exported fully assembled. If the imports from the United Kingdom were dutiable on the ad valorem' basis, the '.importers",20,Weightand Bounty Basis
92,Sir Henbt Gullett,That is not so.,21,Weightand Bounty Basis
93,Mr Mcewen,"I admit that the exwould be forced to import cars in an unassembled, state, and tbe work of assembly would be carried out in Australia. If tbe Government pursues its policy in this regard, Australia will be forced to buy cars which are neither wanted by them nor suited to the conditions of the country, and the thousands of Australian workmen, who are at present employed in the motor assembly industry, will be thrown out of employment. That, to my way of thinking, cannot be justified by the Government on the general principle of trade diversion, and it is particularly objectionable on the ground that it endeavours to confine Australians to using a type of car which they clo not desire to use. The American type of car which is imported from Canada is imported unassembled, and the work of assembly is done in Australia. Since the higher duties were imposed, with the general approval of Parliament, upon foreign cars, certain American manufacturers have adopted the practice of exporting to the United Kingdom a very substantial proportion of the components of some of their cars, adding in England just the necessary amount of labour and material to qualify for the British preference provision in Australia, and then exporting them to this country, where they are admitted duty free, except for the -duty of .Yd. per lb. imposed for the purpose of paying a bounty upon Australian made cars. honourable member that very little of that kind of thing is being done. The situation is being very carefully watched by the Customs Department. These assertions are the result of one of the dirtiest the plainest way possible the figures bits of lobbying by one of the big Canadian motor firms that I have ever heard of. be careful that our tariff policy does not admit into Australia duty-free cars which are, to a large extent, of foreign manufacture. By admitting that the department is watching the situation he has conceded that there is something in what I have said. orable member has said is merely one of those general statements which are inspired by unscrupulous lobbying. prepared to go to considerable lengths in order to give preference to British motor cars as a proper return for the preference which Britain gives to our produce, but we should take care that our preference provisions are not abused. I should like to know what the Government proposes to do to put a stop to this practice. I move That the item he amended by adding the following:"" And on and after 3rd December, 193C(4) Chassis, buit not including rubber tyres and tubes, storage batteries, shock absorbers excepting steering dampers, Dumper bars, sparking plugs, springs, spring hangers, shackle bolts pins and assemblies, TJ bolts, king pins, tie rod pins, tie rod ball pins, tie rod ball studs and high tension ignition coils{<?.)

I propose to give the correct official figures regarding chassis imported from Canada under the old ad valorem duties, and the figures under the new system of assessment. These figures were not compiled from a single invoice, nor do they apply to a single make of car only; they apply to the average run of cars imported into Australia. The Customs Department has made a very ctreful stocktaking in regard to this matter, and the position in all the States has been investigated.

In order to show how complete and thorough investigation has been, I may mention that the figure as worked out is not exactly 2d. per lb., but is actually 1.996 pence per lb. Thus the average extra duty on each car is Â£3 8s. 4d. which, on the gross selling price of standard Ford and Chevrolet sedan cars, represents an increase of only about 1 per cent. That is the extent of the extra preference to the United Kingdom about which the honourable member has been protesting so vigorously. I remind him that, in the year 1934-35, Australia sold to the United Kingdom produce to the value of Â£63,600,000, and in the same year we sold to Canada goods to the value of Â£1,400,000. In 1935-36, we sold to the United Kingdom produce to the value of Â£68,000,000, while our sales to Canada fell to Â£1,300,000. Bearing this trade position in mind, and bearing in mind also the electorate represented by the honourable member for Echuca-a n electorate in whicli I was born, and which I know very wellI cannot see how he can justify the attitude he has taken up in this matter. are used in my electorate because they are not suitable. be so, but the fact remains that Canadian cars will, as the result of the new duty, be only Â£3 8s. 4ld. dearer, and I have no hesitation in saying that there is not om. irrigationist in the honourable member's electorate who is not benefiting to the extent of at least Â£100 a year as the result of the Ottawa agreement. only Â£3 8s. 4d. to the cost of Canadian cars, they will not do much to divert trade. already having a desirable effect in that direction, or, at any rate, something is, because more British cars are being sold in Australia. Moreover, it is well known that British car manufacturers are now producing cars more closely resembling the popular American types than at any previous time in the history of motor car manufacture. The new British cars are The much more suitable for roads of the kind existing in Australia. I remind honourable members that the figures I have given represent a true average taken over the full range of importations. I have no doubt that the honourable memher presented his figures to the committee in the firm belief that they were correct,, but the discrepancy .between the two sets of figures may be explained by the fact that the Customs Department makes its calculations on the basis of what is called: the stripped chassis, whereas the honourable member's calculations may have been made on the basis of chassis with a number of accessories attached. I have checked my figures over and over again with senior officers of the department, and must regard them as correct. tween the ad valorem duties, and the duties assessed on weight appears, on the Minister's own showing, to be only Jd. per lb., why was -the change made ? method was deemed to be more satisfactory for administrative purposes.

I have no doubt that the ^matter will be discussed when the -Canadian delegation reaches Australia.

I desire to know why the term "" dirty lobbying "" should be applied to a resident of Australia, who has charge of a large industrial undertaking in this country, and not to persons who are not Australian citizens, but have made overtures to the Government for years? The Minister 'directing negotiations for trade treaties mained, silent on this matter until he dramatically produced a tariff schedule which, on the face of it, threatens dangerous repercussions as far as,the present volume of employment in Australia is concerned.

That is the crux of the argument.

130,Mr Hutchinson ( I N D I ) [12.32],"American and Canadian firms, and commence certain manufacturing tions in Australia. to tlie time when we shall he able to commence the manufacture of most of the parts of a motor car. We hall have to decide upon the appropriate a lime to do this. I cannot say when that will be, but, when it arrives, I hope we shall have English firms manufacturing in Australia American firms, so that production shall not be, as it is to-day, confined to two American combines. I have held that idea for quite a long time, and it has been the basis of all of my speeches on this stibject. Some honourable members liave stated that British cars generally are not suitable for Australian conditions. In the course of my brief remarks last night, I endeavoured to point out that the British manufacturer, having in mind the requirements of his home market compared with those of the dominions, has been in somewhat of a dilemma as to what policy he should follow in respect of manufacturing in Australia; and it was not until recently, when the horse-power tax was reduced in Great Britain, that he was given an incentive to embark on manufacturing in this country cars of horse-power suitable to Australian conditions. As the result of recent developments, we find that at least four British companies are now attempting to do this. The Motor, a British publication, reports that, as the result of competition from American firms in Great Britain, and because of the fact that the horse-power tax has lieen slightly reduced, the tendency in Great Britain to-day is to produce a car of higher horse-power. I hope that this tendency will continue, and that British manufacturers will increase their sales in this country, and soon be enabled to place on the Australian market cars suitable to Australian conditions at reasonably competitive prices. Already three English cars of different make are selling in Australia at prices very much competitive with the prices of American car3 here. importer of British cars that, if he could increase his order by 100 chassis, he could effect a reduction of from Â£20 to Â£30 a car. That particular car to-day is selling Mr Hutchinson. at about Â£460, and a reduction to this operaextent would make it definitely competiI look forward tive with many American, cars, and give that particular British firm a chance to place on this market a car suitable to our requirements and at a reasonable price. I hope that such a development will take place. Many English cars still require to be altered in certain directions for Australian conditions, and I in competition with hope that such alterations will be made. The decision of the Government to alter the basis of duty from the old ad valorem basis to the present weight basis, has resulted from considerable agitation on the part of British manufacturers, who have stated that certain American firms, in order to take advantage of concessions in our tariff to Canada, were beginning works of some magnitude in Canada and shipping their parts to Ausr tralia at a great saving of duty. Whether that is actually the position or not I cannot say, but manufacturers of British cars contend that their sales have been prejudiced because of that fact. I know that 50 per cent, of a Canadian car must be of Canadian origin, but I suggest that, as it is most difficult to police that provision, there appears to be some ground for the contention of the British manufacturers. As to the acceptability of the new basis, and the contention that it does, in fact, operate unfairly in respect of the cheaper as against the higher-priced cars, it has been asserted that, under the ad valorem basis, the duty was charged on the invoice price, whereas, under this proposal, a light car, which sells at a comparatively high price, may now be imported at a much lower comparative rate of duty than a heavy car selling at a lower price. Undoubtedly, that is one of the big arguments against this alteration, but I point out that nearly all of the lower-priced American cars are light cars, whilst the higher-priced American ears are usually heavier ears. The argument, therefore, does not apply in respect of American cars to any great degree. On the other hand, however, it I have been told by one does apply in respect of cars from other foreign countries. Italy, for instance, manufactures 10-horse-power or 12-horsepower cars which are definitely in the high-priced range. Those cars would have an advantage on a weight ba.sis over other makes of heavier car. AlthoughI admit that this point can be argued with a degree of soundness against the proposed change, I repeat, it cannot be applied to any great extent in respect of American cars. There is a discrepancy between the figures given by the honourable member for by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett). When I visited the United States of America last year I studied the cost of American cars and obtained figures dealing with this matter. From those figures and my' own knowledge of our duties, I worked out a set of costs for imported 15-cwt. Canadian cars in the cheaper class, first, on the old ad valorem basis, plus primage, and then on the hasis of the duty of 2^d. per lb. arrived af figures very similar to those given by the Minister, and, as our computations were made .independently, I am i.r.clined to believe that the honourable made a mistake in those which he has given. It is claimed that the price of many American cars has been advanced recently by from Â£15 to Â£25, because of the alteration of the basis of duty from the old ad valorem basis to the weight basis, and also because of the additional cost of .7d. to provide the bounty. It would, indeed, be interesting to know whether this increased cost, which has been passed on to the purchaser, has been due entirely to that cause, or whether it includes a little extra profit for the seller. I repeat that, on the main issue in this matter, namely, the diversion of portion of our trade to the United Kingdom, I support the Government. I believe that the British motor car manufacturer should be given every opportunity in this market. I say to the British manufacturer, however, "" If you fail to take ful l advantage of this opportunity, and, within four or five years, you are not meeting the demands of this country, we shall then be entirely justified in taking portion of this trade away from you and allowing cars manufactured in other countries to come in at a cheaper rate"". This proposal offers the British manufacturer the chance of a lifetime in the Australian market. To-day, owing to the free admission of panels, he is able to assemble his body on a low-duty basis. It is up to him, therefore, to get down to business and to give the Australian purchaser a car of the type he requires, at a reasonable price. We have done our job at this end, and it now remains for the British manufacturer to do his job at his end and to endeavour to meet Australian requirements. Sitting suspended from 1248 to 2.15 p.m. [2.15] I should like the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) to try to appreciate the. fact that we have reasons for the arguments that we advance. I know that he will believe me when I say that I do not doubt in the slightest I degree the figures that have been supplied by the Department of Trade and Customs. I know how careful are the officers of that department. I also want the honourable gentleman to agree that other honourable members and I have no desire to weaken in our support of the Government's policy of endeavouring to plan for the production of a complete motor car in Australia. I stand absolutely for that policy, and I am certain that every other honourable member on this side of the chamber also does so. But we say that, in the transition period, the harm done may outweigh the advantages that accrue. If the honourable gentleman can show me that I am wrong in that belief, I shall vote for the pror posal of the Government. A t the moment, I feel inclined to vote for the amendment. Surely such an attitude cannot be described as anti-British! gested that. news to me to learn that Canadians are not as British as we are.

135,Mr Holloway,"It would bewhether or not this proposal of the Government will prove advantageous to us. It appears to me that the new method of imposing the duties w ill be of advantage to what are more or less luxury cars, which should carry any additional burden that has to be borne, because their owners can afford it , and that it w ill be of disadvantage to u t i l it y cars and trucks, which are an absolutely necessary part of the equipment of the business people and many of the wage workers of this country. My second fear is that the cars from GreatB r it a in to which encouragement w ill be given w ill be imported as assembled cars, as against the chassis which were formerly imported from Canada. What, I ask, is likely to happen-no t all at once, but gradually-to the hundreds of men in Australia who assemble cars, as well as to the bodybuilders, if the switching of trade from Canada to GreatB r it a in encroaches on their present domain? The bodiesfor the Canadian cars which we wish to import as cheaply as possible, are made ir. Australia, and will continue to be so made until something happens that we cannot avoid. This change-over w ill have a tendency to encourage the importation of the assembled car, and tbe harm thus done will more than outweigh any advantages that may accrue. member knows that imports from Canada and the United States of America have been left at last year's peak level.

We are not doing anything that is needful in the direction cf trading with Great Britain, because we already trade with that country when we trade with Canada. Sir HENRYGULLETT I do not think that the honourable gentleman can make that point. It is necessary to consider the relative markets, and their value to Australia. British as Australia is ; therefore, it cannot be said that preference is being given to foreigners. All that we have to do is to see whether this policy suits Australia, and if it does we should adopt it without considering the matter of preference to New Zealand, SouthA f r i c a , Canada or Great Britain. Surely that is a fair proposition! The Minister used an argument which has no connection with this proposal, when he said that, because GreatB r it a in takes from Australia Â£60,000,000 worth of commodities, Australia sliould do all the trade that it can with Great Britain, whether or not it pays more for its goods. On paper, that may look all right. But.. us the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Curtin), has said, GreatB r it a in probably has to take from Australia goods to the value of something like Â£30,000,000 per annum on account of our interest liability, because we cannot pay in cashand are not expected to do so.

If the Minister can assure me that this policy will not cut into local employment in the assembling of cars and the making of bodies for chassis imported from Canada, and that it will not increase the duty on cars and trucks that we cannot do without, I shall be satisfied; otherKingdom chassis enjoyed a preference wise, I consider that I shall be perfectly justified in voting for the amendment. ister directing negotiations for trade treaties) [2.26J -As I have already said, the Government cannot accept the amendment. The duty of .7d. per lb. does not come into the comparisons. There is, however., a revenue consideration, with respect to which an adjustment would be necessary if the amendment were accepted. On the basis of collections prior to May last, the loss would amount to about Â£170,000 per annum, which is considerable from a budgetary viewpoint. On the basis of existing collections, the loss on the current financial year would be at the rate of some Â£272,000 per annum. I must insist that a very thorough investigation has shown that the increased cost to the buyer of a car will be Â£3 Ss. 4d. That is a weighted average, taken over all Canadian imports. I can only assume that the difference between the departmental figures and those quoted by the honourable member for Echuca( Mr way impaired the position of Canada McEwen) is that the invoices covering a number of chassis on which ho has based his amendment vary in some way from the average stripped chassis which is the basis of the Government's calculation. I should be very much indebted to the honourable gentleman if he would allow me lo submit those invoices to the officers of the Customs Department. I believe that if he did so they would be able to disclose very quickly the error that I have no doubt occurs in them. discovered where the discrepancy is between the honourable gentleman's figures and mine.

Tlie honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has said that .in trade adjustment we should make no distinction between one part and another of the British Empire.

The present proposals, in some measure, restore the old position. I cannot believe that an amount of Â£3 8s. 4d. for each chassis will have any effect in this country, on either the amount of employment available or the number of Canadian chassis sold. Sir HEN RY GULLETT -This was intended, not as a trade diversion measure, but as a means to increase the degree of preference given to British cars. It will come into consideration in relation to trade diversion only when the time arrives, be it sooner or later, when Australia is manufacturing chassis. The British Government has asked that, in the interim period, this adjustment be made. The Government has not in any compared with that of the United States of America-in fact, it has improved it. Last year Australia imported 30,000 chassis from the United States of America, and 30,S20 from Canada. It must be perfectly obvious, therefore, that the increase will not have an adverse effect of any consequence as between Canada and the United States of Amerioa. Honourable members should bear in mind that the old ad valorem preference was equivalent to 2d. per lb. in respect of Canada, Under the new conditions, the rate will be 5^-d. per lb. in respect of the United States of America, 2^d. per lb. in respect of Canada, and 2d. per lb. in respect of Great Britain.

It is therefore open to Canada to supply to Australia a number of cars equivalent to the number imported in that twelve-month period if it can do so, the only obstacle being the slightly increased preference being granted to tlie United Kingdom. I ask honourable members to bear in mind, in considering this subject, the relaagainst those of Canada, But the hontive importance of the market in the United Kingdom, and the market in Canada to the producers of Australia. Keeping that consideration before us, the additional preference being granted to the United Kingdom is justified a thousand times over. In terms of Australian currency in 1935-36 our exports to the United Kingdom were valued at Â£68,000,000 while those to Canada were worth only Â£1,300,000. Our exports last year to the United Kingdom increased by Â£5,000,000, while those to Canada decreased by Â£100,000. In consequence of our trade treaty with (Canada, Canada's Australian trade has increased enormously, but Australia's Canadian trade has scarcely varied. In 1931-32, when the treaty was made, our imports from Canada were valued at Â£1,700,000, and our exports to that dominion were valued at only Â£1,000,000. In 1935-36 our imports from Canada were valued at Â£6,700,000, whereas our sales to that dominion were valued at only Â£1,300,000. In other words, while Canada's trade with us improved in value by Â£5,000,000, our trade with Canada improved in value by only Â£300,000. The importance of the market for Australian primary produce in the United Kingdom is, therefore, immensely superior to that of Canada. For that reason, the small adjustment to which the Government now seeks approval is abundantly merited. have listened with great interest to the arguments of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) against my amendment, and I confess that I have found them most confusing, and not at all convincing. The honourable gentleman stressed the value to Australian primary producers of the British market in comparison with the Canadian market. He need not have done so on' my account, for during the last few days, I have myself placed -figures before this committee to demonstrate the same fact. He also said that the British Government had asked the Commonwealth Government to make this adjustment. I presume that that statement was made in an endeavour to establish a prima facie case for the granting of a substantial additional preference to British motor-car manufacturers, as orable gentleman immediately proceeded to destroy the whole structure which he had erected by asserting with great emphasis that, after all, the additional degree of preference being given to Great Britain amounted to only 1 per cent. was that the actual increase in the cost of Canadian cars to the Australian purchasers would be only 1 per cent. stated figures to show that the new duties imposed an additional cost of Â£3 8s. 4d. on each stripped Canadian chassis imported to Australia. Figures which I used earlier in this debate indicated that the added cost was very much greater than that I think I have discovered where the discrepancy exists. The Minister stated that the average rate of duty collected . over a period on stripped Canadian chassis was Â£13 10s. lOd. I find' that the amount of duty under the old ad valorem rate, plus primage duty, would have totalled Â£13 l is . Sd., which approximates to within a few pence of the figure given .by the Minister. The Minister then compared his figure of Â£13 10s. lOd. with my figure of Â£17 6s. 6d. as the rate of duty under the new weight basis for stripped chassis imported on the 21st Spetember last, and said that the difference under the new rate of 2^d. per lb. was only a little over Â£3. I submit that his basis of comparison was quite unfair. Primage duty was never intended for protective purposes in respect of either British or Canadian imports against foreign imports, for it was a purely emergency impost to increase the general revenue, and was collected from all countries on an equal basis.",29,Henby Gullett I T All Comes Thus Enjoy A Preference Of 3d Per Lb

In my opinion, any consideration of primage duty should be abandoned for comparison purposes. The only f a i r basis of comparison is British, free, as it always has been; the old ad valorem rate on chassis imported from Canada; and the new duty payable on the per lb. basis. posed as an emergency measure to raise revenue. It has now been removed from Canadian imports and from United Kingdom imports, and therefore it has been removed from the whole field as a basis of comparison. comparison to-day is that the British chassis is, as always, free of duty, whilst under the ad valorem tariff the Canadian chassis, which was previously dutiable at Â£8, is dutiable on the new per lb. basis, at Â£17 6s. 6d. That bears out my original contention that the effective duty on stripped Canadian chassis has been doubled as the result of the alteration of the method of imposing the duty.

153,Sir Henry Gullett,"Hear, hear!Minister has failed to make any reference whatever to what I disclosed at the outset as the main basis of my argument. It was then, and it still is, that this added tariff has for its purpose the diversion of purchases by Australians from a type of car to which they have become accustomed, and which they desire, by increasing its cost, to a type of car which, with all my respect for and, with all desire shipped through Canada then enjoy the existto further the interests of the United Kingdom, I still have to say is not acceptable to Australians or suited to Australian conditions. That is the substantial -basis of my argument. With the desire of the Government to establish the motor car manufacturing industry in Australia, I associate myself wholeheartedly, but to expound on that would be to repeat what I have said on several occasions previously. Pending the receipt of the report of the Tariff Board on that particular proposal, I say that it is not desirable, and has not been proved necessary to compel Australians to buy a type of car from the United Kingdom which the history of car selling indicates that they do not wish to buy. Nor is it fair, without giving adequate reasons, to compel them to pay more for the Canadian type of car which past purchases have shown to be suitable and desired. I have not been convinced by the arguments advanced by the Minister, and must press my amendment. Before the vote is taken I wish to give the committee the history of the events which led up to the replacement of the ad valorem rate of duty by the per lb. rate. The application for this alteration was first made in 1934 by the British motor traders' organization. Again_ in 1935, when the Australian delegation was in London, further representations were made, and, some time ago, the importers of the United Kingdom motor vehicles in Australia interviewed the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) and the Comptroller-Genera! of Customs, Mr Abbott, on the same subject. I am not supporting the case put forward, but the reason given for the proposal of the British manufacturers and the Australian importers was that some American manufacturers were side-stepping the ad valorem duty. They reportedInstances exist of certain United States of America manufacturers exporting chassis through Canada to Australia, the chassis being stripped of such items as running board assemblies and aprons, lock washers, Hat washers, various bolts, nuts and rivets, hood side and top panels, front fender assemblies, these parts being shipped direct from the United States of America, and' the "" remains "" ing British preferential tariif. I do not say that the case put forward was right or wrong, hut it was contended that the American manufacturers were gaining advantages in Australia which it was not intended by the Australian tariff should be allowed to them. Similar arguments were advanced by the British manufacturers to the Government of New Zealand some months ago and the result was that the proportion of the car which hacl to be manufactured in Canada, was increased from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent. I submit that, it was in answer to the representations made in Australia that the Government decided to alter the method of imposing the duty. the Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to maintain this altered rate of duty on Canadian cars, or does it intend to use it in negotiations when the Canadian delegation comes to Australia in the new year. ister directing negotiations for trade treaties) [2.55] -The intention of the Government is to maintain the duties as they have been passed, but they might come together with all imports and exports in our trade with Canada-indee d I have no doubt that they will-unde r consideration in those negotiations.

A case came under my notice in which a rebate of freight was received twelve months after the time of shipment, although no rebate had been asked for, and none was expected. Another point which appears to me to be well worth consideration hy the Minister is the position that arises when a shipping company owns a trading company.

Events in recent months have proved how tariff provisions can be evaded to such an extent as to remove the protection which Parliament has sought to give to an Australian industry. It is unfortunate that the Government did not take earlier action to safeguard the interests of local industries. It is necessary for the Tariff Board to recognize this danger in making reports and recommendations in respect of various industries affected by dumping practices by means of a reduction of freights. I have read a most illuminating document concerning the activities of overseas interests, ancl it showed that those interests are prepared to manipulate and fix their freight charges on an unfair basis. Whilst this bill admittedly seeks to correct anomalies, it would be well to realize the dangers that lie ahead, and to take prompt steps to see that Australian industries are properly protected. The Opposition supports the Government in its belated proposal. Even now, because of the low duties, certain Australian industries will find, it impossible to carry on. interesting and somewhat amusing to notice the efforts made ,to prevent anything from being imported into Australia that may be regarded as cheap and nasty. We have heard many complaints regarding the plight of the unemployed and those in receipt of the dole, but we have done all we can to increase the cost of living. favours a policy which would put men out of work, and prevent them . from buying anything. orable member that for every four minutes the Government,of which he was a supporter was in office a man lost his> job, and that as the result of that Government's administration unemployment was more serious in this country than it has been at any other time. I was rather I said that if such a amused at the horror expressed by the honourable member for Moreton (Miv Francis) in respect of dumping, particularly when we realize that so important a Queensland product as sugar is being dumped in Great Britain and being sold at from Â£6 to Â£7 a ton, compared with the enormous home-consumption price paid for sugar in this country. Great Britain under a preferential agreement, and, therefore, it cannot be said to be dumped in that country. applies to butter and many other products which we export. So far as cement is concerned, I point out that the only cement factory in Western Australia is situated in the electorate which I represent. If it costs cement companies from. Â£4 to Â£4 10s. to produce a ton of cement, I cannot understand how big gold-mining, companies, such as the Wiluna Gold: Mines, can raise the hardest rock from a depth of from 1,500 feet to 2,000 feet,, and put the ore through its many processes, at the same time paying each employee at least Â£6 a week, and clo thiswork at a cost of from ISs. 6d. to 22s. a. ton. [Quorum formed.] The wording of the act, which this measure seeks to amend, is a little vague. It says that the rate of dumping dutiesshall be 5 per cent, of the market value of goods at the time of shipment. I can quite understand the desire of the Minister to amend the act to give effect to a promise he made some time ago, and' I have not the slightest doubt he is endeavouring to carry out that promise through this measure, but I am a littlesuspicious about the rate of freight that will be fixed. Will it be that charged' by the shipping combine? WestralianFarmers Limited has been able to chartervessels and carry exports at freights-, below those charged by the shipoing combine. The freight on wool has been reduced by as much as 10s. a bale.

Evidence that such loopholes existed was provided in the debate last session on the duties on cement, and the Government has come to the conclusion that the dumping provisions of the act are inadequate. The amendments effected by this measure deal firstly with freight rates and secondly with the payment of the difference in freights in sterling instead of Australian currency.

180,Mr White,"We shall keep it thatremedied. The reason for using the words ""normal rate of freight"" instead of the wording in the existing provision is that during the course of some years the latter has been found to be unsatisfactory. For example, if several rates of freight operate over a certain period, how can the Minister decide what is the prevailing rate? It must be accepted that the Minister shall interpret the meaning of "" normal"", in a normal way, and will see that no unfair trade is allowed and that full effect is given to the provisions of the tariff in every case. I have mentioned, would the freight obtained by ""Westralian Farmers Limited be accepted as a normal rate in preference to the rate charged by the shipping combine ? be shown that a rate of freight is detrimental to Australian industry. It must be proved that goods are being shipped at a freight rate less than the normal rate of freight, and .then, when they come into this country, that they are detrimental to Australian manufacture. Those two tests must be applied. In the instance given by the honourable member, the rate charged by the shipping combine would not enter into the matter if the landed cost of the product, for instance, cement, did not operate detrimentally to any Australian industry. If the rate of freight hacl that effect, an investigation would be made as to the actual freight paid or payable, and the freight dumping duty would be imposed. That is the purpose of this measure.

Some industries are fearful that this provision does not adequately meet the position of a shipping company which also owns a trading company.

Will the Minister explain the procedure to be adopted to meet that contingency? Trade and Customs) [3.4'6] -The position would be the same as in connection with a cut rate of freight. A ship-owning firm which was also an importer would have to charge a freight rate.

The clause proposes to appropriate for the purpose of financial assistance to the States, to relieve the hardships of persons who are without employment, the sum of Â£150,000. I understand that the State Governments intend to restrict the relief to those persons whose names appear on the unemployment register from a certain date in November.

We cannot evade the obligation that rests upon us to do what is reasonable and satisfactory, by saying that already substantial relief has been granted. The resources of homes in which unemployment is still the rule, have been reduced to the lowest point. We should rather seek to increase the amount of any grant at this particular time, because those who will participate in it need it now more than at any time previously. persons, who cannot find employment. ber rightly points out, many of these persons are finding it increasingly difficult to object being to give to the unemployed a obtain employment. Considering the healthy state of the finances of the Commonwealth, and. the generous remissions of taxes that have been made by this Government in its alleged Recovery Budget surely the Ministry is only trifling with the plight of the unemployed in granting so small a measure of relief. The Opposition feels that if Â£500,000 were appropriated an amount equal to one week's wages at the basic rate could be given to each unemployed person. Surely that is not asking for too much! We should do what would be worthy of the national Parliament and commensurate with the needs of those who are unfortunately unemployed. Honourable members, who do not make direct contact with these persons cannot thoroughly appreciate their difficulties. I represent a constituency in which impoverishment markedly manifests itself. Reports received from authoritative desperate has become the situation in respect of malnutrition, even among the children of these communities. In the districts in which this unfortunate condition exists, the parents are anxious that their children shall have proper nourishment and clothing, but they are unable to provide these, and therefore, the welfare of the children is being sacrificed. The Opposition has no desire to obtain even the semblance of a party advantage out of this matter, but is anxious that a genuine effort shall be made to provide what Avill give to the unemployed the assurance that the Commonwealth is fully sympathetic towards their sufferings. I have moved the amendment in all good faith, hoping that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) will make available at least Â£500,000 to meet the urgent needs of a most distressing situation. [3.5S] -Everythin g material that I had to say was said when I introduced the bill and on the motion for its second reading. I would now merely remind honourable members that this does not by any means represent the efforts of the Government in respect of unemploythe older ment. The Commonwealth and all the States are doing a very great deal in a wide variety of ways. This is entirely separated from what has been done previously; it is a simple gesture, the little extra at Christmas time, and must not be regarded as the only effort that the Commonwealth has made, as the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) might suggest. I regret that the Government cannot accept the amendment. port the amendment of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). Discussing this matter last week, I suggested that"" as a gesture by this national Parliament to the unemployed, the amount of the proposed grant should be' increased to a sum that would enable a full week's work at the basic rate to' be provided for married men, and at least lialf a week's work for single men, irrespective of, and . in addition to what is being done by the State governments. This bodies indicate how much at least should be done. The Government promised at the last election that it would reduce taxation. As a person must have an income of Â£8 a week to become liable to pay Commonwealth taxation, it must be evident to honourable members that any persons whose Commonwealth taxation has been reduced are in a fairly substantial position. In these circumstances it is only fair to ask that the Government should now turn its attention to the really needy classes in the community. In my opinion, the Government has not done anything effective to cope with the unemployment problem. Certain relief works have been provided from time to time, but no permanently beneficial steps have been",38,States Grants Unemploy

189,Mr Barnard (Bass) [3.59],"I suptaken to remove this serious bar to the progress of our community. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) may argue, in reply to these remarks, that the statistical information available to the Government indicates clearly that there is now less unemployment than when the Government assumed office, but as this returns supplied by trade union secretaries, and as it is well known that many young people of the community, who have never had a job in their lives, and have never joined a trade union, have not been taken into account, the figures must be regarded as quite incomplete and unsatisfactory. To look at the subject from another point of view, I remind honourable gentlemen that quite recently it was stated in this House, in reply to a question by an honourable member of the Opposition, that approximately 200,000 men and women in Australia were out of work. An amount of Â£150,000, therefore, could not provide even Â£1 for each of these persons. As so many people are now being called upon to pay many pounds less each year in income tax, it is asking very little of the Government to request that it should now do something really effective to make the Christmas season more cheery for the unemployed and needy people of our community. The buoyancy of the revenue also justifies the request that such action shall be taken. I join with other honourable members of the Opposition in protesting against the inadequacy of the proposed grant, and I shall vote for the amendment. not support the amendment. The amount which the Government is providing for the special purpose it has in mind is, in my opinion, adequate. This proposed grant represents, as the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has said, only a very small part of what the Government has done since it assumed office to relieve the distress due to unemgrant of Â£300 for the purpose. I suggest ployment, and it must be regarded purely as a Christmas gift. In discussing this subject at the second-reading stage, I urged the Treasurer to request the State authorities to keep in mind, in distributcould be ear-marked for the purpose of ing this money, the youthful section of our unemployed people, who certainly should share in this gift. I rpquested that at least 10 per cent, of this money should be devoted to this purpose. The Treasurer said that he would make a suggestion of that nature to the State authorities. I also had in mind that a proportion, of the money should be spent in such a way as to achieve some permanently useful results. Recently the information is based on Government of Victoria made availablean amount' of Â£300 to the Boys Employment Movement,, in order to makepossible the taking of a census of unemployed youths between the ages of 18-and 25, and also those engaged in deadend occupations; but, unfortunately, the limited scope of the proposed census, in view of the meagre amount made available for the purpose, will make it quite useless. ""When this proposal was first advocated, it was intended that youths registered with the movement as unemployed should make a thorough houseÂ« to-house canvass. It was estimated that it would take 280 boys five weeks to^ gather the necessary information. During that period they were to be paid 30s. a week, plus an allowance of 2s. 6d. aweek for travelling expenses. They were to distribute, collect, and sort inquiry schedules in the Melbourne metropolitan, area, and also in important provincial centres such as Ballarat, Bendigo, and Geelong. It was estimated that Â£2,275 would be necessary to pay wages and travelling expenses,, while an additional amount of Â£225 was allowed for contingencies, postage, and stationery. The information gathered; by such a census would be most valuable, for it would give a clear indication of the nature and extent, of youthunemployment in the metropolitan and the major provincial areas. Similar information covering rural areas could' be gathered through local councils. The Government of Victoria, while not disapproving of the scheme, stated it had only sufficient money available to make a that, if one-tenth of the Â£40,000 which the Commonwealth Government is how proposing to make available to the Government of Victoria for Christmas cheer gathering and scheduling information on this problem in our metropolitan and main provincial areas exceptionally fine",39,States Grants Unemploy
190,Mr Holt (Eawkner) [4.5],"I canuse would be made of tbe money. The information would be a guide to various governments in formulating effective plans to deal with the highly important problem of youth employment, and this section of the community would feel that in doing this work with the help of money provided from such a source, they would be effectively helping themselves. To divert 10 per cent, of the Â£40,000 proposed to be made available to the Government of Victoria for the purpose that I have outlined, would not inflict any hardship on any one. I understand that the Treasurer does not desire to fetter' the State authorities in any way in the expenditure of this money. According to press reports the Government of Victoria proposes to grant the money to sustenance and relief workers. If that policy is pursued the young people for whom I am making a special plea will be entirely overlooked. If the Treasurer is not prepared to agree to an amendment of the bill to make definite provision, for the use not to supplement the assistance already of portions of the money in the way I have outlined, I hope that he will at least make a strong suggestion to the Government of Victoria that some of it should be used for this purpose. If the Government proposed to make Â£150,000,000 Christmas cheer for the great army of unfortunate people in our community, instead of a paltry Â£150,000, we could show a little enthusiasm for the bill. Even such an amount as that, however, would not be adequate to provide reasonably for the urgent needs of our workless people whose prospects have been so seriously damaged in the last few years. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that this is a gesture of goodwill to the unemployed. Apparently the Government can only make a gesture. It certainly has not done anything effective to cope with the situation. The smallness of this amount is additional evidence of the futility of the Government's efforts to help the unemployed. The Government, like Mrs. Dombey, seems to be unable to make an effort of any kind. amount will not provide a lolly stick each for the children of unemployed people. As I told the Treasurer on another occasion, he is the most miserable Santa Claus that I have ever encountered. The Government thinks in pennies when it thinks of the unemployed, and in millions of pounds when it thinks of its wealthy supporters. With one hand it distributes pence to the unemployed, and with the other it takes the pennies back again to give them to the wealthy. The Opposition has been most moderate in its request on this occasion. No doubt it realizes that the extraction of money from this Government for the assistance of the unemployed is as difficult as the extraction of money from a Jew. Eveni f the Government will not consent to increase the proposed grant to Â£500,000, I hope that it will make every endeavour to see that anti-Labour governments in the various States will deal equitably with the unemployed who are intended to benefit by the vote. On every occasion when grants of this kind have been made to the Government of New South Wales, it has used the money being provided for workless people, but to reduce expenditure from its own resources for this purpose, so that it would be in a better position to balance its budget. behalf of the Government of New South Wales that nothing of that kind will be available to provide done. workers in my own electorate to be sacked on Christmas eve in order that the Commonwealth Government might not be obliged to pay them for the few holidays that would intervene before the new year. That happened at Liverpool. In two or three cases rectifying action has been taken subsequently by this Government, but many workers have been left to lament the injustice that they have suffered on this account. My main purpose in rising to speak at this stage is to emphasize the necessity for the Treasurer doing everything possible to prevent the Stevens Government of New South Wales from using this money for improper purposes as it has used similar grants on This past occasions. Honourable gentlemen opposite claim that they have made many efforts to assist in the solution of the unemployment problem, and that because of these",40,States Grants Unemploy

193,Mr Lazzarini,"I have knownefforts the unemployment figures have shrunk. that in New South Wales men who are on relief work are not classed as unemployed. Eor many years the Commonwealth figures have been generally recognized as being the most unreliable figures that his office publishes. They cannot be anything else than unreliable, because they are based on returns from trade unions whereas, if a man is out of work for two or three years, he is not registered by the union. Unemployment is so extensive that it is tragicfor this Governweigh upon the Government and that itment to offer the paltry amount of Â£150,000 towards the relief of distress at Christmas; if it were not so tragic it would be humorous to call it Christmas cheer or, as the Treasurer has done, a Christmas gift. I remind the Treasurer that the money cannot be classed as a gift because the men will have to work for it. given either in cash or in kind. all I can say is that the honourable gentlebe present when this bill was introduced, man has opened his heart a little more than usual. I am glad, however, to have the Treasurer's assurance, but I should like information as to how the money is to he distributed. I understand that the States will be entrusted with this task. I would like the Treasurer personally to undertake it. In my electorate alone the whole amount of the grant could be distributed among the unemployed, and there would be no noticeable diminution of the amount of distress that prevails there. The same position exists in the coal-mining areas which were the fir3t settlements in Australia to enter into the issue of dole or unemployment relief, the depression. I do not intend, however, to labour the question; I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) which is designed to increase the amount of the grant to Â£500,000, which, indeed, is little enough. In my opinion the Opposition should ask for Â£1,000,000, but it realizes of course that it would be hopeless to do Â«o. It is, however, amazing that the Government of its own volition has not come forward with a proposal for a grant of much bigger dimensions because it is continually 'boasting through the newspapers and elsewhere about its surI would point out, however, pluses and about the buoyancy and stability of the revenues. It purposes expending in the near future about Â£8,000,000 in avenues which might easily lead to Statistician's unemployment the destruction of life; surely, therefore, it could allocate more than Â£150,000 for the purpose of making the conditions of life a little better for those who, through no fault of their own, but, because of the continued existence of an anachronistic system of economics, suffer the miseries of unemployment. I hope therefore that these considerations will will decide to accept the amendment. It is obvioiis from the remarks made by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), following the appeal made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) for an increased grant, that the Government does not intend to accede to the Opposition's request, although members of the Opposition have produced convincing evidence in favour of the grant being increased. Unfortunately, I was unable to but I was interested a few minutes ago to hear the Treasurer announce by way of interjection that this money is to be distributed either in cash or in kind. from the remarks of the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt) that it is the intention of the Government to allow the State governments to handle the distribution of this money. I wish to point Gut, however, that in each of the States departments have been established for and that regulations framed to deal with permissible income and such things as that debar many homes from securing relief which they very urgently require. In this matter I speak with authority on what happens in New South Wales, but I suppose that my remarks would have equal application to other States.

It may be argued bysupporters of the Government that certain limitations are necessary, but although I would agree that that is so, 1 think that it will be agreed generally that, in many instances, such regulations have harsn application. I realize that it is the desire of this Government that harshness should not enter into the question of the distribuAbout Â£60,000 of this money is to be tion of this money, and that it is an effort expended in New South Wales, and if the to give to the unemployed some real assistance at Christmas time. I am afraid, however, that it is acting wrongly in entrusting the. States with the distribution. I contend that the State relief departments are not the proper instrumentalities, and that there are people more in touch with actual cases of distress than the State governments. Those people are represented in the municipal and town councils and other semi-governmental bodies. Of necessity, they must be in closer touch with the requirements of the people than the Commonwealth Government or the State governments could ever hope to be. with the lives of the unemployed people they become aware of where real distress exists. point which I am trying to make. If the Commonwealth Government is not prepared to allow the municipalities themselves to undertake the distribution of this money, I suggest that there exist several societies with branches in all the districts where the poor live, which are better fitted to do the work than the State governments. In my own district, in which, unfortunately, there is a great number of people in distressed circumstances, these societies are carrying on good work, and I appreciate their efforts. There are, for example, the Society of St."" Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army. who is a member of the Church of England clergy, is also carrying on commendable work among the poor. All of these bodies and individuals know the real needs of the people, and have facilities which would enable them to distribute this money in the best manner possible. I approach this matter delicately because some of my colleagues who represent States where Labour is in power are naturally satisfied that the right thing will be done, while others represent States where colleagues of honourable gentlemen opposite are in power. This, however, does not alter my feeling that there is too much official investigation and too much red tape about the State relief organizations. spending of it were entrusted to the municipalities or to the voluntary relief societies, it could not be said that its spending would not be properly supervised. All of the municipal councils' funds are subject to audit, and the town clerks are trained men, able to produce satisfactory statements as to the expenditure of funds. It would be a fine gesture from the Commonwealth Government to the societies which exist for the relief of the poor, and evidence that it recognizes the wonderful work that they are doing if it decided to allow them to undertake the distribution of at least part of this grant. [4.29] I agree with a great deal of what the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt) said, in relation to the employment of youths, and realize his sincerity, but I feel that we should put as few fetters as possible on the States in the distribution of this money. Some of the honourable member's statements may well appeal to the States, and, of course, it is entirely within their province, in the terms of this measure, to apply this money as they please. I shall have the honourable member's remarks brought under the notice of the Premier of Victoria, to whom I think they were particularly directed. On the second reading, honourable gentlemen from New South Wales The Reverend Hammond, expressed some doubt-doub t in which I find myself unable to join-as to how the Government of New South Wales would act on the distribution of this money.

The Public Works Committee recommended the expenditure, but since then both the State and Federal governments have announced special Christmas allocations. That statement supports the contention of the honourable member for Reid, and shows that steps should be taken to prevent action by any State government which might desire to reduce the amount that would normally be expended generally in providing relief. I have no doubt, in view of the assurance received by the Treasurer, that the New South Wales Government w ill do what is fair, but he 'has not consulted the Governments of the other States.

The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) in earlier remarks attacked the Stevens Government of New South Wales. Now he has directed his attack at the Bavin Government. In his electorate he has several State Labour members, one of whom is the almighty Baddeley, an ex-Minister of a Labour administration.

When I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament, I remember a Labour alderman abusing his mayoral privileges by giving to his own son, a youth aged eighteen years, employment made possible by a grant like this, which employment should have been given to a married man with children. It ill becomes the honourable member for Hunter to suggest that the present Government of IM ew South Wales might take advantage of its position in regard to thedistribution of this relief. The sum to be distributed in New South Wales is only Â£59,000, and it .will not go f a r in affording assistance to the needy. If any local governing body is prepared to refrain from providing relief that would ordinarily be given by way of Christmas cheer, I should say that it would be a council that is dominated by Labour men who have a narrow outlook. The four municipal councils in my electorate are invariably most generous in their distribution of Christmas cheer, ancl they are not likely to reduce their benefactions because of the extra sum provided under this billThe honourable member for Hunter has not been sportsmanlike in this matter. I sincerely hope that the committee w ill reject the amendment.

Under such a method of distribution the recipients are treated on an equal basis. I understand, however, that some State .governments will not act as sympathetically towards the unemployed in the distribution of this grant as the Government -of Tasmania has acted. the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) is a very wise one, I support it. We know that in the past certain bodies which were States. -entrusted with the disbursement of relief, such as we are now considering, utilized the grants in a way which would not be countenanced by this committee. The amendment does not impose any unfair -condition in respect of this distribution: it simply seeks to make the nature of the grant more explicit. If the amount involved were very much greater than it is, we should recognize the desirability of requiring recipients to perform some act of service in return for this aid.

Its object is simply to make absolutely clear the intention of this Parliament, and, at the same time, to safeguard the unemployed against any unfair imposition on the part of the -Replying to the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), I point out that there are no means whereby this Government can effect, in any precise way, what he proposes. Three classes of bodies are concerned in the distribution of this relief-the Commonwealth Government, the State governments, and the local authorities. It is impossible to amend this measure in order to ensure that a State government, or a local authority, must provide assistance to the unemployed at Christmas in addition to this money. That is entirely the function of the particular authority concerned. A suggestion has been made that a local authority, in tlie electorate which I represent, for instance, might refrain from giving to the unemployed certain aid which it would give if this grant were In the case of South not made available. It is beyond our power to meet that eventuality. In the circumstances, we oan only try on our own part to do what is right, and trust the States to act similarly.

It is to the circumstances of that renewal that I wish to direct attention. If a mortgage carried an interest rate of, for example, 5 per cent., at the time of the imposition of this tax, the additional levy of 10 per cent, on the income so derived virtually reduced the interest return of the lender from 5 per cent, to per cent. It was the intention of the Government of the day to levy on this income to that extent, and very few protests were made against gages fell due, the lenders covered themselves by an addition to the interest rate.

It, would probably have taxed the ingenuity of the Government to avoid that state of affairs. I am not, at the moment, offering any criticism of the Government for not having aevised means to prevent the passing on of the tax. But, to-day, when we are considering the repeal of this additional levy, we find that thousands of borrowers are paying as part of their interest rate a sufficient additional amount to enable the lender to obtain the wherewithal to meet it. this special property tax, but also to the ordinary property rate of tax. perty rate of tax is covered in all borrowing. by 10 per cent. general reduction, which applied to income from all sources, and is not to be confused with this. Here is a levy that was specially imposed on a certain class of income, the consequence of which was to raise the rate of interest. I do not tliink that the Treasurer will challenge that statement. does the same thing. ing this special tax; but the borrower on mortgage will still be under contract to pay the amount of it to the lender, while the lender, in his turn, will be relieved of the payment of it to the Government. Therefore, what on the face of it purports to be a relief to the lender, will in fact amount to a gift to him, in that he will be relieved of payment of the tax, while there is no provision or suggestion for the relief of the borrowers. That is a matter to which the Government could well give consideration. The attachment of a condition to tbe removal of the tax would not be entirely without precedent. During the last two or three years, legislation has been introduced in the TJnion of South Africa, providing that certain relief from taxation should be given to lenders on mortgage, conditional only on their passing on the advantage to the borrowers by a reduction of the rate of interest. From the viewpoint of equity, I see no reason why a similar course should not be followed in this case. It will be very difficult for the Government to justify making lenders on mortgage and lessees a present of relief from this tax and at the same time doing nothing whatever to ensure that the advantage is passed on to the borrowers. I ask the Treasurer to endeavour, in the recess, to devise means whereby the relief may be passed on; although, for my own part, I believe that once the proposal has been adopted it will then be too late to devise any method. I protest against the absence of such a provision from the measure, and ask that my suggestion be considered.

I suggest that the rates whicli individuals have to pay on mortgage, and the current rates of tax on property income, are not the real determining factors. gentleman will agree that the imposition of this tax had the immediate effect of raising interest rates in order to protect the lenders. All taxation terms that the whole of the taxation on property income, of which that on mortgage interest is but a part, has a very definite effect. There are probably many impositions of which this, of course, has been one of the most onerous. I should say that the determining factors are, first, the character of the borrower, the security that he has to offer, and his past personal record; secondly, the scarcity or plentitude of money at the general rates of interest current at the time; and thirdly, the rates of tax on property income.

This clause reverses a principle that was incorporated in the consolidating In come Tax Assessment Bill which the Parliament passed earlier in this year-the principle that, where a taxpayer wound up his business and sold the assets, the value of the stock and assets, for purposes of taxation, should be as they were set out in the contract or the agreement. Subsequently, the question of the taxation of leaseholds and of any premium paid on the sale of a Crown lease, was referred to a royal commissioner, who recommended that the principle of the respective values of the different assets being set out in the. contract should be departed from, because a leasehold property would no longer be taxable, and presumably taxpayers might, by collusion between the vendor and the purchaser, concentrate a disproportionate amount of the price on the tax-free asset, to the detriment of the revenue, by reducing the price of the taxable assets. It applies more particularly to the sale of real estate on which there are livestock. It appears to me that this it> an unnecessary reversal of a previous decision of the Parliament, and also of the Taxation Conference, for if a purchaser allowed stock to be included in his books for less than their true market value, he would render himself liable to additional income tax when he realized on it. The difference between what he paid for it and what he received for it would be taxable in his hands. If , by collusion, he allowed his purchase price to be unfairly understated, he would render himself liable to taxation to an excessive amount. I ask the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) why of producing assessable income, has incurred this was overlooked earlier when freehold expenditure in making improvements which, properties were being considered? Freeprior to the first dn.y of January, One thousand hold properties were not subject to tax nine in this way under the act, as passed last lease . . . May, and it would have been possible in such circumstances to concentrate more on the purchase price of the freehold and less on the purchase price of the livestock. If the obvious interests of the purchaser were sufficient to safeguard the revenue in the case of freehold sales, which constitute the enormous majority of sales in Australia, why are the royal tion officers more suspicious of the veracity of the people who buy leasehold property? Personally, I shall not resist this amendment. In practice, I think it will work out reasonably. I am certainly not pressing for any leniency to, or concessions in favour of, taxpayers who do not have regard to fair dealing according to the law, and who seek to escape their liability to pay tax in accordance with the decisions of the Parliament. The Treasurer should, however, explain why this provision, which was not considered necessary in the case of freehold sales, is considered to be necessary in the case of leasehold sales. [5.35] -Al l I can say is that the need to deal with cases of the kind affected has just come to light. It -was evidently overlooked earlier. I do not demur from anything the honourable member has said. Actually, I suppose this matter should have been reviewed years ago, but it has been brought to light by the review of the recommendation of the royal commission in respect to the taxation of the proceeds of the sale of leaseholds.

This is a long machinery measure which the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) claims is designed to alleviate certain disabilities and difficulties of sales tax payers. It will simplify the law and remedy certain weaknesses which at present make tax evasion possible. It is proposed to curtail the retrospective incidence of the tax-first , by imposing a three years' time limit; and, secondly, by providing that in cases where taxpayers act in accordance with departmental rulings and advices, no retrospective tax shall be collected except in a limited way. . It is, of course, prescribed that the three years' limit is not to applywhere the Commissioner is satisfied that evasion has been practised. It is now apparent that the collection of taxation as from, the date at. which this class of tax was first levied in Australia, could easily prove a grievous hardship, particularly where the taxpayer's neglect has been due to inadvertence. . The imposition of the tax in this way at present appears unjustified owing to the inability of the taxpayer to recoup the tax in the price charged, ajid it is therefore-fair to impose a time limit upon the retrospective application of the tax. It appears reasonable also that where taxpayers accept and act upon the rulings and advices of the Taxation Department, they should be absolved from liability for retrospective taxation when these rulings or advices are varied. This bill, being a machinery measure, may he more appropriately discussed in detail at the committee stage. Mr E. J.

It is surely not intended that retailers shall be required to question customers as to the nature of their business I cannot believe that either the Treasurer or the Taxation Department wishes to insist that retailers shall be forced to make unnecessary inquiries of this kind.

Representations have been made from time to time to the Treasurer asking him to make a percentage rebate or discount to firms on the payment of the sales tax in cash within 30 days in accordance with the usual business custom, or to bring the sales tax legislation into line with the more modern legislation of Canada and New Zealand, thus enabling returns to be lodged and payments of tax to be made over an extended period. For instance, the Treasurer knows that an extraordinary amount of trouble is taken by firms in the compilation of the sales tax returns in order to submit them within the prescribed period. In Canada, tbe time for payment is extended over a longer period than that prescribed in the Australian legislation, whilst in the New Zealand act, it is laid down that a return must be furnished within 28 days of the end of the month in respect of which the return is made. If the Commonwealth followed that example the firms concerned would he given more time to give consideration to the actual returns, and a lot of time which is now wasted in the department in. the checking up of returns would be obviated. The payment of the tax in Canada must be made on or before the last day of the month next succeeding the month covered by the return. This provision gives the Canadian taxpayers a much longer period for the payment of the tax than is permitted to the Australian taxpayers. The Treasurer, I submit, should give consideration to extending the period in which tax returns must be lodged and, although I know he has already dealt with the matter of allowing discount for payments in cash within 30 days, I submit also that he should give consideration to extending the period in which payments of the ta'x may be made. A definite principle is involved* in clause 11 of the bill. All honourable members object to retrospective legislation, hut in this clause there is a retrospective provision which may react to the detriment of the taxpayer. It has been suggested that, under this clause, retrospective action may operate back to the 5th October, 1932. Up to the present time taxpayers, generally speaking, have comMr E. J. Harrison. plied with the existing law, but proposed amendments in this clause will give to the Commissioner the right to re-open the question of sales values. Although taxpayers' returns may have been forwarded under the existing law and may have been accepted by the department, although the taxpayers may have assumed that their liability in respect of the goods on which the tax is levied has ended, and although the profits of a taxpaying company may have been determined and dividends distributed from them, and income tax paid upon them, if the right of retrospective assessment in this regard is given to the Commissioner, and he acts upon that right, the profits of previous years may easily be converted into losses. Such retrospective legislation may easily react to the detriment, not of individuals who have been paid their dividends, but of the companies themselves. This should not be tolerated. The Treasurer may say that this clause is needed to prevent the Taxation Department from being deluged with claims for refunds, but I direct his attention to the fact that, in the principal act, the Commissioner is covered in this regard by the phrase "" The Commissioner may "". I stress the ,fact that it is at the discretion of the Commissioner whether refunds shall be made. On previous occasions the Commissioner has sheltered under that provision. ting butter out of a' dog's throat. Mr E. J. HARRISON I agree with the honourable gentleman. The revenue is fully protected by the use of the word "" may""; and also by proposed new section 12c 1 of the Sales Tax Procedure Act, which specifies that no refund of overpayment of tax shall be made after the expiration of a. period of three years. ""With that provision, I am in complete accord, but I draw the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that in the principal act he has a safeguard which if used in conjunction with this would give him all the protection he desires. This matter bears relation to a review of returns made by the taxpayers, based upon the fact that they could have obtained goods from another manufacturer. I know what the Minister is after, and I do not want to give the impression",51,Casey
240,Mr Blackbubn,"It is a case of getthat I am trying to support a man who is attempting to cover up a fraud, but firms should not be forced to go back over their sales for a long period in Order to satisfy the Commissioner that they could not have purchased from another source. To have to do so would strain their resources to the utmost. Treasurer should consider this matter from the viewpoint of a big firm like David Jones' or Farmers. They would have to go back over a. period of years, and would have no opportunity to pass on the tax; it would put them to an unnecessary amount of trouble to show that they could not have purchased from another manufacturer. It would strain the memory of any one to have to cast one's mind back over a period of years, and to demand that a firm of the magnitude of either of the two I have mentioned should do so is asking too much. The work involved would be extraordinary, and it would be impracticable to determine a hypothetical "" could"". The Minister may have some knowledge of firms which have made out returns at just about under cost price and have not entered reasonable purchase prices. Those are the firms which he seeks to cover by this amendment. If , however, he will give an assurance, either by way of amendment, or verbally, that it is not the intention of the Government to harass firms unless they are definitely attempting a fraud, I shall not press this matter further. I draw attention to the proposed inserword ""shall"" is used. I consider that tion in the Sales Tax Procedure Act the Treasurer should remove the of a new section 12c 1, whioh apparent anomaly of the Commissioner stipulates that no refund of overhaving discretion and the taxpayers payment of tax shall be made after haying an obligation, by making it also three years.

In other words, if section 12A is invalid, then the proviso 26 of section 12c becomes of no value, and the right of the litigants to a refund may be nullified by section l-2c. That is to say, if a decision were given against the Commissioner it would be impossible to The recover anything from him, because refunds can only be made within a period of three years of the assessment, and this action relates to assessments which were made more than three years ago.

HARRISON"" I am pleased to know that; but I knew that the Treasurer would not seek to rob these people of any just dues they might obtain from a ruling of the High Court. I wish to point out what appears to me to be a further anomalous provision. Proposed new section 12B stipulates that the Commissioner after three years may remit unpaid tax, but I draw the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that section 17 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) and section 3 of the Sales Tax Assessment Acts (Nos. 2 to 9) provide that the tax mentioned therein "" shall"" be levied and paid. In other words, a definite obligation is imposed on the taxpayer to pay the tax, after which the Commissioner "" m a y "" make a refund.

Harrison) inquired regarding the proposed amendment of section 3 as contained in paragraph (g) of clause 5. I assure him that the amendment is merely consequential upon the alteration of the definition of "" manufacturer "". It has no sinister intent, nor does' it alter the situation of the persons concerned. The present position is that the maker-up of goods is a taxpayer in that his transactions attract sales tax when the goods are for the private use only of the supplier of the materials. When the goods are for business use, the supplier of tbe materials is the taxpayer. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Ho w can department determine whether the goods are to be made for the individual or for stock unless the customer is questioned? only criterion is whether the goods are eventually to be sold. The honourable member also asked that greater consideration be given to sales taxpayers in regard to the time allowed for payment, and he put forward a proposal that discount might be allowed for prompt payment. These matters were all considered by myself and other members of the Cabinet when the budget was being framed because they have an important bearing upon the revenue. If the time for payment were extended-and nothing less than a month would be of any use-the result would be that approximately one month's sales tax revenue would be lost to the Treasury for the financial year in which the change was made, and the Government could not agree to that. The Government examined with much care tive operation to these amendments is not and sympathy the suggestion that disto disturb past returns, but to obviate counts should be allowed for prompt paythe possibility of having to refund a ment, but it was found to be impossible large amount of revenue collected in the to evolve machinery to enable the propast in accordance with the clear intenvision to work with reasonable fairness tion of Parliament.

Honourable members should know that he is reasonably kind-hearted (Corio-Treasurer ) in the administration of these matters, and he will grant an extension of time if it is evident that a genuine attempt is being made to pay. Another point raised was the substitution of the word ""could"" for the word "" would"". The relevant amendment is connected with a matter that has given the department a great deal of trouble in recent years. The act imposes sales tax, as far as possible, on the last wholesale transaction before the goods go into retail consumption. Immediately difficulty is encountered in the case of individuals and institutions which are at the same time manufacturers and retailers, because in that event there is no wholesale price to work on. The vast majority the of such taxpayers have returned every month what the Commissioner was able to agree was a fair statement of what might be considered to be the wholesale value of the goods-somewher e between the actual cost price, and the retail price which the goods command. There are. not wanting a few individuals, however, who have sought to take advantage of the great technical difficulty of the position in order to evade payment of tax. The law says that the wholesale price is to be an amount for which the taxpayer would purchase similar goods in the market, but immediately they reply that they would not purchase the goods in the market if they cost more than the price for which they could manufacture them. The substitution has been made in order to provide a reasonable solution of this difficulty. It gives the Commissioner the right, if he is thwarted by an individual, to determine for himself a reasonable wholesale value.

[8.1] -This clause deals with goods produced by a manufacturer for his own use, and exempts them from sales tax, provided that no goods used for the same class of use are produced by other manufacturers. The first amendment which I shall submit puts the onus of proof on the manufacturer himself, who must prove to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that goods of this type are not made by any other manufacturer. The object of the amendment is to avoid an impossible administrative situation arising by absolving the Commissioner from the onus of proof in possibly many thousands of cases, and putting it on the manufacturer himself. A manufacturer of dies, for instance, from his knowledge of the trade as a whole, would know whether the goods manufactured by him were produced by anybody else.

""Will this clause meet the request repeatedly made by these organizations? [8.12] -Yes. There is a complementary amendment which I think the honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) may also have in mind, providing for a time limit of three years on the making of refunds. Refunds will still be payable in the event of a judicial decision being given in favour of appeals lodged by certain taxpayers. By virtue of the provisions of section 12 A of the Sales Tax authorized in certain instances in respect -of tax paid on the sale of second-hand goods. That right is preserved by the second of the exceptions to the three year time limit provision. Another exception is in respect of goods eventually sold to government departments or other institutions exempt from tax. There are no less than seven or eight circumstances in which the right to refunds beyond the three-year period is preserved. In fact, in all the circumstances which the department has been able to fine toothcomb out of the experience of the past, the rights of the taxpayer to retrospective payments over the period of the three years have been preserved, where it would be clearly unjust to debar such payments.

254,Mr Hawker (Wakefield) [8.20],"very good friend of Australian primary industries. The very lengthy schedules attached to the treaty quite probably do not represent any very great increase of the volume of trade which will flow between the two countries as the result of this treaty, but of much more importance is the fact that the agreement almost cerwhich Australia gives concessions to tainly marks the termination of bitter disagreement between the countries and the generally bad feeling commercially between the Trench consumers of primary products and Australian primary producers who formerly found markets for their products in France. A large number of our commodities in the past found a market for special lines in France. For instance, apples, of a size which it was difficult to sell in England and Germany were bought in liberal quantities at remunerative prices for special purposes in French food requirements. The loss of that market following the bad feeling encity to purchase French quality goods. gendered some years ago seriously affected the price of all apples offered for sale in England and other European countries. Apples of an unsaleable type in those countries tended to depress the price of our exports. The same observation applies to our barley and wheat and a number of other products which formerly used to be imported into France for special purposes. Australian wheat has a special quality for blending to imIn the past I have heard some wineprove the colour and texture of flour, and makers say that they would welcome a this was mixed in France with home grown and North American wheat. The action which the French Government took some years ago to place practically a prohibitive duty on Australian wheat, led to our loss of the French market for wheat of that quality, which was used for blending purgood quality French wine, and this poses in France where people have a disdevelopment might well be the means of criminating taste for high-class bread. For the recovery of that market, and many other benefits which I shall not go into in detail, honourable members in all parts of the House will be glad. Although the action whicli was taken by the previous government in order to.rectify our adverse trade balance w.as not taken in any hostile spirit towards France as a country, there was no doubt that it was bitterly resented and was entirely misunderstood in France, and the result of French retaliation, in the long run, injured Australia's trade balance rather than improved it. It is a very good thing that we have got back to cordial relations with such a good purchasing country as France. On Australia's side there is an imposing list of commodities in respect of French imports. The reductions of duty in the main are not very considerable. In the large majority of cases the tariff and primage will remain to all intents and purposes, prohibitive against the great bulk of French exports to Australia. The concessions made in this agreement will not weaken the general protective effect of the Australian tariff, but will allow a small trickle of special quality products from France to this country. In the aggregate the agreement holds out some hope of a small increase of Australia's capaWhile welcoming the treaty in the main, I wish, however, to point out that as regard certain kinds of wine-sparkl ing wines and champagneand brandy, particularly the imitation brandy which is made only with a little real brandy flavoring, the proposed reductions have caused a certain amount of anxiety in the wine-growing districts in Australia. reasonable mitigation of the prohibitive duties on French quality wines as they felt that some lowering of the duty would not lead to any serious competition with our main Australian wines but would enable wine-makers themselves and connoisseurs to obtain small quantities. of developing the taste for quality wines in Australia. So far as I can gather, there is not likely to be any serious effect upon the large lines of Australian wines as the result of these alterations of duties. It is with regard to sparkling wine and brandy that Australian wine-makers feel particularly anxious, and particularly in respect of French imitation brandy which is mainly fermented out of sugar and water with just a little flavoring of brandy essence. I do not know sufficient about the trade to be able to say from an examination of the schedule whetliei' this anxiety on the part of winemakers and brandy distillers is wellfounded or not. I hope that the Minister will be able to allay these fears on the part of producers of sparkling wines, champagne and brandy in Australia, by promising that the position will be very carefully watched and that, if any appreciable injury is done to the Australian industry, he will take steps to rectify it. [ notice that in respect of a number of items in connection with which France has made concessions, that country undertakes to consider sympathetically certain concessions in the way of quotas. In the light of that flexibility in this agreeany material degree, the Government will ment I hope that the Minister will be in a position to secure the sanction of the French Government to review the items involved should it happen that any appreciable injury is done to Australian industry. One method that occurs to me by which injury might be averted, is by the adjustment of the excise by the amount necessary to enable Australian industry to hold its own for the normal volume of its output. I have not had the time or the opportunity to consult with members of the wine-making industry since the particulars of the schedule were circulated yesterday, but it appears to me probable that an assurance by the Minister that he will consider an adjustment of the excise where practicable and if necessary, would be acceptable to the principal wine-makers concerned, particularly if that assurance were eventually given effect. I , therefore, support the treaty generally. It is one that I welcome, and I congratulate the Minister upon having brought to a successful conclusion yet another trade negotiation with an important overseas customer of Australia.

I also assure him that if , as the result of the trend of the trade, the Australian industry, in connection with brandy and the particular wines that he mentioned, suffers to consider sympathetically the taking of measures that will afford protection, whether by the reduction of the excise or in other ways. the assurance that he will watch the duties in respect of knitted goods and textiles? treaty is for a short term-onl y one year -and can be terminated at two months' notice.

This is a formal measure, which proposes to rectify a drafting error in the Financial Relief Act (No. 2) passed through this Parliament quite recently. originated in the Senate. Prior to the depression, the variations of the salaries of public servants in accordance with the rise or fall of the cost of living were effected under the authority of regulations made under the Public Service Act-that is in respect of the Public Service proper. In respect of other Commonwealth employees, the variations were made under regulations, by-laws, or awards applicable to the time of the enactment of the Financial Emergency Act, cost of living adjustments were implemented under that act and not under the Public Service Act and corresponding provisions in various regulations, by-laws and awards, as they had been previously. Consequently that enactment, practically speaking, put out of court the regulaI do not tions made under the Public Service Act. The Financial Relief Act (No. 2) recently enacted, repealed al; the provisions relating to salaries that were embodied in the Financial Emergency Act; consequently, in respect of the regulation of cost of living adjustments, we are thrown back on to the Public Service Act and other statutory provisions, whi T' > controlled this particular situation, in the pre-depression period. Regulations made under that act specify that the ups and downs But I do not feel disposed to in respect of cost of living adjustments shall be effected as from the 1st July of each year. The recent Financial Relief Act (No. 2), as honourable gentlemen know, was not enacted until a few weeks ago; that is to say, after the 1st July. Therefore, technically, it was not possible to implement under the Public Service Act normal cost of living adjustments of the salaries of public servants and other government employees. This short measure is designed purely to right that matter. It makes no alteration whatever of the existing position; the salaries of public servants will still rise or fall according to the movement of certain cost of living index numbers. the bill is simply to rectify an error that was overlooked when the Financial Relief Bill was passed some little time ago. I assure honourable members that It no new principle is incorporated in the bill, which is purely a technical measure to remedy a flaw.

The principal alteration is the provision of intermediate tariff rates for the benefit of France and other countries which may be accorded ""most-favouredforeign-nation "" treatment by Australia. However, where an intermediate tariff rate has been provided in relation to goods subject to protective duties it is at a level which is not lower than that which the Tariff Board considers necessary for the protection of Australian industry against importations from foreign countries. In a small number of cases outside the scope of the trade agreement with France, items have been amended. instances in which the items were included in the same tariff board report as items under the trade agreement in question. Special notation has been made of these cases in the memorandum circulated for the information of honourable members. offer no objection to this motion; but I wish it to be known that we understand that this schedule is entirely experimental. ""We are not able to judge the effect it is likely to have upon the textile industry of Australia. As the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) has given me a positive assurance that he will watch the interests of the textile industry very carefully-h e gave a similar assurance some little time ago to the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker), that he would watch the interests of the wine industry very closelyI am prepared to allow this motion to pass without protracted debate. It should be remembered, 8). however, that the Government has a much more direct association with the wine industry of Australia than it has with the textile industry. I have no doubt that the persons connected with the Australian wine industry are in a better position to make prompt representations to the Government on any matter which they think may affect their . . . interests than are the persons connected with the textile industry. This schedule is one of a series dealing with trade agreements with foreign countries, and is, in fact, cognate with that relating to Belgium. We should face the fact that agreements of this kind must almost inevitably be allowed to .run the full course of a year, for very strong reasons indeed would be required to denounce such a treaty within that period. It is hardly likely that advantage will be taken of the provision to give two months' notice within the period of a year. As the Government has undertaken to safeguard the textile industry and enable it to maintain its present efficiency, I shall offer no objection to the motion. It seems to me that the Government is seriously impairing the effectiveness of However,, these were our protective policy.

Power exists under State legislation, I think in Victoria and New South Wales, for the respective Boards of Commissioners to make freight contracts to meet road competition, and it is exercised to prevent loss of traffic. South Australia legislates to prevent what is considered to be unfair competition with its own railways in that State, but it has taken no action to protect its own railways in like circumstances. The Commonwealth railways operating in South Australia get no protection from the South Australian legislature, and, in consequence, competition takes place by reason of which the people operating motor vehicles are now taking the legitimate and payable freight of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. There is no certainty that they will stay on the routes on which they are at present operating, because as soon, as it becomes unprofitable or their trucks wear out or become expensive they can leave the people without the cheaper serseems necessary -for legislation of this The purpose of the proposed amendment contained in clause 2 of the bill, according to the Minister's explanation, is to make it clear that it is to repair an omission with respect to a particular section and to take care of regard to a short section of line between Katherine and Pine Creek in the (Maribyrnong) Northern Territory.

277,Mr Drakeford,"power to conduct the business of the railtransport in Australia, it will be alsoways on as near to a commercial basis as possible, although the railways' generally in Australia-particularl y the Commonwealth railways-ar e developmental rather than commercial. I have never subscribed to the belief that, the railways should be considered as commercial propositions. At the same time, I agree that they should not be handicapped by restrictions, such as those which exist in section 30 of the principal act, which this bill proposes to amend. ""When the parent bill was under consideration conditions such as exist to-day had not been thought of, and, in many other countries, as well as in the States of Ausland transport. tralia, action such as this bill contemplates has had to be taken. The intervening years since the legislation which this bill amends was passed, have brought into being a new mode of transport, and the Commonwealth Railways Department, in common with railway services all over the world, is being forced to alter its methods in order to hold business. it now stands, compels the Commissioner to charge alike to all persons using the railways under the same conditions, but the amendment now before the House will give him greater latitude in fixing fares and charges where the risk of loss of traffic is involved. This merely places the Commissioner on an equal .competitive basis with road transport enterprise, and I look upon it, as a reasonable provision. fact, in my view, the Government could have gone much further in amending the act to meet current needs. Provision could have been made to permit of the Commissioner engaging in the conveyance of goods by road and by air in conjunction with the railways. Already, in 'Great Britain, and in many other countries to-day, the development of efficient transport by railway authorities over land surface with various kinds of transport, has been achieved. It is realized that, in order to give services for said, by way of interjectionwhich the railways were originally established, those in control have to hold the power to take over or develop road and air services and to make them operate as feeders to the railways. It seems to me that, as the result of development of air necessary to endow the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner with power to take over air services. In the sparselypopulated territories in which the Commonwealth railways operate, it is important that the Commissioner should ,. when occasion demands, be in a j>osition to place at the disposal of settlers in those far-out localities road and air services as feeders to the railways. I offer this suggestion for the consideration of the Minister for the Interior in connection with the development of the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth should have full control of all forms of Years ago, when consideration was being given to the construction of the trans-Australian railway, it was said that it was never likely to return the cost of axle grease, but it will be seen from the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner's annual report that, last year,, the line not only paid all operating costs, -but also it contributed more than Â£45,006 Section 30 of the act, as towards the interest bill. The Commissioner's latest report is an interesting document, particularly when it is compared with reports of previous years. It shows the progress that has been made in the territory over which they operate, where there is a small population-pro bably the least populated area in the civilized world. Despite that, the people there are developing it with the aid of the railway, and, I believe that, given proper As a matter of legislation, will be capable of considerable improvement on the conditions which now exist. When the Railways Estimates were under consideration about three weeks ago I referred to concessions in freights, which contributed towards losses in railway operations, and stated that the losses on the working of the railways were used as weapons against the employees when claims for improved wages and working: conditions were before arbitration t r i bunals for consideration. The Minister The value of those concessions is made good by the Treasury and the railways are not affected. The Minister was mistaken with respect to that matter, as what he said was far from being the case. Losses which arise from concessions are not always made good as they should be, when ordered by tlie Government. That the losses are not made good or are only made good in part is proved by an answer given to a question asked by myself. to ascertain whether the concessions in freight rates operating since the 1st July, .1930, had been made at the expense of the Government or of the Railways Department. The answer given to the question was "" Yes "". Particulars were also sought regarding the value of the concessions, and what proportion of the loss was being borne by the Government and what proportion by the Railways Department. After the question had been asked, it was represented to me that a considerable amount of time and trouble would be involved in compiling the information asked for. I agreed with this point of view, aud eventually I was furnished with a reply by the Minister which concluded with the following sentenceI t is understood that your question related only to reductions affecting local traffic on Commonwealth railways. I am not complaining about that, but the reply indicated clearly that concessions were given in regard to freight rates by both the Government and the department. The most important concessions were stated to be in regard to wool, fodder for starving stock, the conveyance of starving stock for agistment, long distance rebates in respect of consignments to localities more than 150 miles from the railways, and in respect of petrol, kerosene and lubricating was further stated that records were not available for the full period, but that on the figures for the year 1934-35-the latest available-the respective proportions of the concession losses borne by the railways accounts and by the Government were Â£3,556 and Â£919. It will thus be seen, that approximately only one-fourth of the cost of the concessions are borne by the Government, while three-fourths are borne by the Railways Department. Those figures are for one year, and are, in relation to local traffic only. It is clear from the Minister's reply to my question that the Treasury does not make good to the department all losses which it should defray, arising out of the granting of freight concessions. If the same proportion applies to concesifr. Drakeford. sions granted on through, or non-local traffic, as it is reasonable to suppose, the losses would be even greater, particularly on the trans-Australian line. It is evident, therefore, that railway losses are It was sought being swollen by causes arising out of government policy. I do not object to the concessions as such, but I object to the representatives of the Railways department going into court and opposing the claims of the employees for higher wages and improved conditions, on the ground that the railways are running at a loss. The employees quite properly believe that, if the Government desires to make freight concessions, the resultant losses should be a charge on the community as a whole, and should not be borne by them. The elimination of the breaks of gauge at Port Augusta and Terowie by the construction of the RedH ill railway will still further improve railway business, and next year, when a day is saved on the overland journey in connection with this extension of the standard gauge, I feel sure that further financial benefit will accrue. At the same time, it seems to me that the best results will only be attained when the standard gauge is extended right through to Perth and Eremantle. I hope that it will not be long before the Government will face this question, and provide a truly national standard guage transcontinental Tailway from coast to coast. It is disappointing to read in the report of the proceedings of the recent Premiers Conference in Adelaide that the oils. It question of standardization of railway gauges is to be still further postponed, and that it is considered that another investigation is to be made before anything further is done. The resolution of the Premiers, which is rather vague, readsI n view of the progress which has been made in road and air transport, this committee considers that, before any decision is arrived at with respect to standardization of railway gauges, a further inquiry by a competent body should he made, having special reference to the economic and defence aspects. Erom this resolution, one might think that, before long, railways will cease to operate. It is strange reading this sort of thing in conjunction with the information available of the developmental railway policies which have been adopted in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and other important countries. Overseas, we have examples of business men paying millions of pounds of their own money for modernizing privately owned railway enterprises. They are improving their railways, confident in the belief that, for the bulk of the traffic, rail transport will be the principal medium for the conveyance of goods and passengers 100 years hence. like to see the Commonwealth and State .governments, as owners of the railways, treat the situation here with equal seriousness, and bring their railways into line with the rest of the world by making a serious effort towards standardization aud modernization. I could quote figures to show that large sums of money are being spent in South Africa, Great Britain and the United States of America on bringing railways and railway services up to date-and this applies also to other non-English-speaking countries -bu t I shall not delay the House with them at this late period of the session; perhaps another occasion will present itself. clearly that the belief is not held abroad that railway services are about to be superseded by other means of transport. I shall deal now with the claims of the union in respect of the bill. The amendment provided for in clause 4 appears to improve the position from the point of view of those leaving the employment of other railway services to join up with the Commonwealth service, but it does not seem to meet the needs of those who, after leaving other railway services, may be required to commence duty on the Northern Territory railway, and ha<ve to proceed, say, from South Australia to Darwin by steamer. The clause proposes to extend the period from three days to twelve, but I suggest that, in the case of the men to whom I have just referred, the period might be extended to as much as 24 days. be met. M!r. DRAKEFORD I am pleased to know that clauses 5 and 6A are designed to bring into accord with Treasury methods the system of keeping plant and stores expense accounts. The clause is non-controversial. With reference to clause 7, experience has apparently shown the need for the establishment of an insurance fund to cover damage to railway property arising from storm as well as from fire. This seems to be a wise and necessary provision. ClauseS proposes to amend that section of the act relating to the acquisiI should tion of land for railway purposes. I cannot understand the purpose of the amendment relating to trespass on railway property. I trust that it will not be used in order to prevent union officials from having access to railway property for the purpose of interviewing employees. orable member an assurance that it will not be so used. have that assurance. Union officials have never abused their privilege to enter railway property to interview employees, and it is essential that they should continue These figures indicate quite to enjoy it. No explanation has been given by the Minister regarding clauses 9 and 11, but perhaps an explanation will be given in committee. Clause7 merely provides for adding the words "" or storms "" after the word "" f i r e "" , so that damage by storm may be covered by insurance. I can visualize that damage may be done as the result of flooding following upon ordinary heavy rain which could not really be described as a storm. In flat country, the waters from rains which fall a considerable distance away may wash out the ballast and damage the railway. I suggest that the words-"" and floods"" might be added. Clause 10 appears to be justified on the ground that it will result in the saving of time and expense. If the State laws provide that a person charged with an offence can be represented in court only by a properly qualified legal man, hardship may result to a person brought before a Justice of the Peace in a locality where no lawyer is available.

Clause 12 provides for a heavy increase of the amount of fine which may be i m posed 88 of the principal act. This paragraph provides for a fine of Â£20, or imprisonment up to fourteen days. Some explanation and justification arc needed for the proposed increase of the penalty before it should be agreed to, particularly as it i=s proposed under paragraph c of clause 10 to allow the jurisdiction of the court to be exercised by a Justice or Justices of the Peace sitting as a court, perhaps, at a place where the person charged usually resides. W h y is it necessary to increase the penalty from Â£20 to Â£50? On general principles the Opposition is opposed to the imposition of penalties, and would probably not feel justified in voting for such a proposal in the absence of a good reason for more than doubling the penalty. I take it that the Minister will clear up this point. As far as the bill extends the power of the Commissioner to protect the railway asset, of which he is a trustee for the people, it should meet w it h approval.

I believe, therefore, that if the Minister will not accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) lie should at least have this provision more clearly defined. [9.45J -The arguments advanced by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr that the Minister will have no difficulty Lazzarini) do not sound so humorous to me as they appear to sound to some honourable members. In a case which I have in mind, one of my constituentsa cattleman of Adelaide River-suffere d the loss of many of his stock because these ate grass on railway property, which employees had been ordered to treat with arsenic. This man's claim against the Commonwealth Commissioner for Railways has not yet been cleared up. I contend that it is incumbent on the commissioner to have the boundary of the railway line, whicli is usually three chains in width, clearly defined. He should at least fence dangerous areas, particularly those areas under his control in the vicinity of watering places for stock and adjoining trucking sidings. In an instance of the kind which I have just given, an injured person has a ""very good claim for compensation. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr points out, that the burden of proof Nairn) I remind the honourable member that the clause before the committee refers t.o trespass by persons and not, by stock. should fence off such areas as I have indicated, or he should, at least, make some provision to notify the public when certain areas are about to be treated with poison. A very important principle is involved in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford), a principle with which you, Mr Deputy Chairman, as a legal practitioner, will be very familiar. It involves the placing of the burden of proof upon the accused person, a process which I have always opposed, and which, I think, should be opposed strenuously tally out of harmony with the principles of justice. A charge is made against a man that he has trespassednpon the property of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. The ease is then very simple-the burden should rest upon the person who makes the charge to prove it. It has always been the endeavour of the Labour movement to stand for that principle and resist encroachments npon it whenever they are made. I am aware in finding precedents for this provision. If he refers to his legal advisers he will find ample precedents in previous Commonwealth statutes for this perversion of a sound rule of common justice because such occur only too often in Commonwealth statutes. But proof of innocence should not rest upon the accused; the burden of proof of guilt should rest upon the accuser. It may easily happen that a person discovered on railway property has a sufficiently good reason for being on such property. There may exist a variety of reasons, such as, the reason of necessity, the reason of his claiming the right as an employee, or as an agent of an employee, or as a licensee, or agent of a licensee, who has the privilege of going on to railway property in the discharge of his business. That, however, is merely amplifying the matter. The main principle involved is, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong rightly should rest upon the accuser, and I hope that honourable members on this side will always stand for that principle. I would,therefore, encourage the honourable memThe commissioner ber to press his amendment to a division. I am not so much concerned about the burden of proof as about the clause as a whole.

If a man walked upon a railway line without doing the slightest harm to any one, he would be trespassing within the meaning of this clause, yet, in such an instance, he would probably not be able to justify his action. I should like the Minister to show the committee what need for this provision has arisen out of past experience. It is one thing to provide that a man shall not trespass upon property which is fenced in, but it is quite another thing to provide that he shall not walk upon an open railway line. Even in Sydney and Melbourne many people occasionally walk along a fenced-in railway line and, I suppose, people in the country would he even more prone to walk upon open railway lines. ter for the Interior) [9.53] -This is one clause of the bill upon which I have not been furnished with full information, beyond the fact that the experience of the department has shown that this provision is necessary. If the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) is prepared to let this clause pass I give him the assurance that I shall make full inquiries into the matter in the morning from the Railways Commissioner in Melbourne and, if I find that the clause is not satisfactory in the light of informathe Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) tion supplied by the commissioner, an amendment to meet his request will be made in another place. orable members apparently regard this provision as being more vicious than it is intended to he. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner is entrusted with the duty of protecting millions of pounds worth of property, and the lives of people who travel on Commonwealth Railways. I believe that if any man were found walking on a railway line because he found it better to walk there than on a rougher track in the vicinity, no earthly harm would befall him so far as this provision is concerned.' The issue arising here would be whether a man trespassed on railway property for any sinister purpose, and in such a case, the accused himself could best explain the reason for his presence on railway property. I believe that honourable members are making toa much of this matter. Something of this kind is necessary to enable the commissioner, and other persons vested with the responsibility of looking after millions of pounds worth of property and safeguarding the lives of the travelling public to carry out that duty. A man, for instance, might trespass upon railway property with the object of placing a detonator on the line. To meet such a case a provision of this nature is essential. oppose this clause, because it represents a reversion to the policy that an accused should bear the burden of proof of his innocence. It has been the invariable practice in British courts that the onus of proof rests upon the person making the charge. This provision reverses that practice. The Government sought to insert .a similar provision in the Immigration Bill. If the practice is extended a position might well arise where an alleged offender might not be given even the right to justify what he knows to be right, as instanced in the case of Mrs. Freer. The principle involved in this provision is wrong, and every honourable member should oppose it. In effect, it declares that a man is guilty until he proves himself innocent. I suggest that the Minister should refer this matter to before proceeding further with it. Every one who believes in the fundamental principles of British justice should stand for the principle that a man is not guilty until he is proved guilty. Now, according to this provision, a man will be guilty of trespass so soon as he is charged with such an offence, and it will then devolve upon him to go to court to prove his innocence. ber for Batman( Mr Brennan) has said that there are any number of precedents for this provision. they a.re bad.

But, it seems to me that it should not be a penal offence for a man merely to walk on an open line.

Clause 10 (Arrest of offenders). for ' the Interior) [10.9] -Unde r the existing provision, offending persons can be brought before a police, stipendiary or by him to his assistance, may seize and detain special magistrate only. In South Australia, the magistrates referred to have jurisdiction over extensive areas and visit the various district courts only periodically. At Port Augusta, where most of the railway cases are heard, the visits of the magistrates are not frequent, and it has been found necessary to hold offenders for quite a while before bringing them before the court. The State has complained on occasions of having to hold such offenders on the ground of the expense of maintenance, and at times they have been released instead of. being held pending the visit of the magistrate. Under this clause, provision is made for such persons to be brought before a justice of the peace, or a police, stipenand may be of the most trivial character. diary, or special magistrate.

Paragraph a proposes so to amend section 76 of the principal act, that the Railway Commissioner or his representative, after an arrest has been made, may take the person charged before a court of summary jurisdiction without any warrant or other authority than this act. I consider that some reason should be given for dispensing with a warrant or other authority than the act. A man might be caught in the act of walking along a railway line and might not be able to give a satisfactory explanation. the fact, that he has to be taken to court; he cannot be laid by the heels indefinitely. A warrant is not necessary in respect of a man who is caught committing an alleged offence. trivial nature of the offence, he should not be taken without a warrant or other authority than the act. Authority should be obtained from a magistrate. it is not customary to require a warrant. Usually, there is some guarantee of the existence of a court, ancl that an offender will be taken before the nearest court.

The Minister challenges criticism by submitting them for observation in connection with this amending bill and transferring them from the 1904-1934 act to the prea single statute.

336,Bill Brought Up By Mr Menzies And Sent Bill Which It Is Intended Shall Be,,73,Menzies
337,Mr Brennan (Batman) [10.36],"raised for consideration here as to what offences are felonies, misdemeanours, or constant tendency in our Commonwealth legislation to draft, or worse still, to steer, away from the principle of trial by j u r y . If this House had before it the particular class of offence which the framer of these provisions had in mind, we should be able to vote intelligently on the question as to whether it was a matter which should be made indictable, or whether it was not. There seems to be a considerable amount -of indefinitaness in the minds of jurists as to what is felony, and what is a misdemeanour. The position seems to have been reached that a felony is what is made a felony, and the misdemeanour is what is made a misdemeanour, by act of Parliament, and that there is no more -exact definition. I suggest that those sections might very well be omitted from the bill. The fact that they are thereat all might be overlooked even by a practitioner who considers the law relating to a particular offence, when that law is not definite as to whether the offence is indictable or non-indictable. This bill raises also the matter of government by regulation. members who are interested w ill know that I have always strenuously opposed the growing tendency to legislate by means of regulation. The period of the war provided many shocking examples of the misuse of that power. It illustrated very well how debate might be prevented, and Parliament itself stultified, but I am prepared to admit that the power to make regulations is necessary, and even i m portant, and should remain, though liable to abuse just as all administrative power is liable to abuse. I even grant that, power which is taken in this bill, to make legislation retrospective, and may be justifiable also, though there is a greater danger in making regulations operate retrospectively than in making an act of Parliament so operative. An act at least does run the gauntlet of f u l l and free discussion, and is assured of intelligent understanding, but this does not apply to regulations. I understood ( Mr Menzies) to say that it was proposed to omit sub-section 1 of proposed Mr Brennan. section 4S, and I quite agree that it should be omitted. I think it asserts a .new and what not. There has been a entirely undesirable principle, that of the predominance of officials over the Parliament. That the officials are expert and highly skilled is entirely beside the point. They should act, not from the throne, but from behind the throne. In any case the provision would be ineffective, and should be rejected. The sub-section provides that the minister shall obtain a certificate from the proper official to the effect that a proposed regulation is within the competence of Parliament, but the issuing of such a certificate does not in fact ensure that the proposed regulation is within the competence of Parliament. That is a matter for the courts of the land to decide. It is unprecedented and absurd that a responsible Minister of the Crown should have to submit from his own department a certificate of the competency of Parliament to pass a law which the Minister is asking should be passed. Some interesting debate occurred in the Senate a little while ago regarding these matters, arising out of the fact that that chamber had set up what it was pleased to call a Regulations Committee. Honourable Indeed, some honourable senators seemed to regard that committee as something in the nature of a super-parliament. Section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904 providesWhere an act confers power to make regulations all regulations made accordingly shall unless the contrary intention appears(a) be notified in the Gazette; (6) take effect from the date of notification or from a later date specified in the regulation; (c) be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within 30 days of the making thereof or if the Parliament is not then sitting within 30 days after the next meeting of Parliament. The act of 1930, passed by a Labour administration, altered the law, and provided that regulations should be brought before Parliament within fifteen sitting days after they were made. It statedIf either House of the Parliament passes a resolution of which notice has been the Attorney-General given at any time within' fifteen sitting days after such regulation has been laid before such House disallowing any regulation such regulation shall thereupon cease to have effect. This provision sharply limits the power of the Executive to withhold regulations from review hy one or other of the Houses of Parliament, and, in the meantime, to act upon the power given by the regulations. That is sound in principle, though it is not always sound in practice because, as in the particular instance which occurred during the regime of the Labour Government, it reduces the power of the Executive to give effect to a policy endorsed ,by the people. This difficulty is incidental to our cumbersome system of legislative machinery which enables a non-representative chamber to restrict arbitrarily the policy of the Executive. The Labour Government was defeated in 1931, and the Senate which, during the Labour regime, hacl been dominated by non-Labour forces procured an amendment of the act in 1932. The amendment laid downAfter section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1004-30 the following section is inserted:1 OA (1) Where in pursuance of the last prea reaction against what was thought to ceding section, either House of the Parliament disallows any regulation, no regulation, being the same in substance as the regulation so disallowed, shall be made within six months after the date of the disallowance, unless the resolution disallowing the regulation has been rescinded by the House of the Parliament by which it was passed. (2) Any regulation made in contravention of this section shall be void and of no effect. It will be remembered that, arising out of the clash between the two Houses of Parliament, regulations were constantly being made by the Executive, and disallowed by the Senate, and as fast as they were disallowed they were, in substance, I suppose it may be admitted, regazetted. I . think that the Attorney General might very well reconsider the propriety of that provision now that the ' opportunity presents itself. It is objectionable from two points of vieAv. In the first place, the language is vague, and gives evidence of amateurish draftsmanship, for which I am sure the office of the Attorney-General is not entirely responsible. For instance, what is really meant by the words "" any regulation the same in substance "" ? It is extremely difficult to prove that a regulation, which is at least verbally different, is in fact the same' in substance as .another. That, however, is not the main objection. The House of Representatives is the popular chamber, and it may happen again, as happened before, that an Executive, coming fresh from the people with a definite maudate to legislate in a certain direction, sees fit to proclaim regulations for the purpose of carrying out that mandate. Next time it may not be a Labour Government which is in that position; it may be a government of which the Attorney-General is a member. This popular chamber, whose members have come fresh from the people, may pass a regulation to give effect to government policy, and the other branch of the legislature may disallow it ; yet it has to remain disallowed for a period of six months. I suggest that the Minister is yielding part of the authority of the popular chamber by allowing that provision to remain. It is a question of the relative rights andpowers of the two chambers and it affects equally all parties in this House. It is common knowledge that this provision was adopted as be the arbitrary action of the Scullin Government in constantly regazetting regulations disallowed by the Senate. It is entirely proper that whatever government is in power it should have authority to give effect to the mandate received by it from the people. At all events, as between the executive government and the other branch of the legislature, this House should not yield its authority. I should like the Minister to discuss the clause from that aspect, and not from the narrower point of view at all. The Government is acting wisely, I think, in consolidating the two sets of Acts Interpretation Acts. The act passed in 1901 was based on the tradition of the English legislation-the Acts Interpretation Act 18S9; but in 1904) we began a series of acts now known as the Acts Interpretation Aet 1904-34. I think it was Mr Charles Cameron Kingston's idea to shorten the sections. He provided that once and for all there should be a standing interpretation of the words "" indictable offence"" and "" summary offence"", and a standing provision that "" penalties "", unless otherwise specified, should mean maximum penalties. That measure also contains provisions that are",73,Menzies
338,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [11.3],"curious in an Acts Interpretation Act. It provides that regulations shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and may be disallowed by either; but, unfortunately, no machinery is provided to compel the discussion by parliament of regulations. Although a great deal has been said about the evil of government by regulation, I consider that the regulation-making power is necessary, and under proper safeguards, salutary. Much of the details with which members of Parliament concern themselves should be dealt with by regulations, provided the regulations come before Parliament to be revised by it. This consolidating bill reproduces the sections relating to the disallowance of regulations. I have not much objection to these sections, provided they are made effective. The Senate has settled down to the discussion of regulations, and has made provision for the -consideration of them, but I think that this House itself should consider regulations. The right of a member to challenge a regulation in this House is rather illusory at the present time, because, although he may place a motion on the notice-paper challenging a regulation, the -Government can prevent the motion from being brought on for discussion. I shall submit an amendment to provide that, .after notice has been given for the dis.allowance of a regulation, the regulation itself shall lapse altogether, unless within fifteen sitting days the motion is either withdrawn or disposed of. That means that this House would have real control -over regulation-making. I quite agree with the honourable memher for Batman( Mr Brennan) in his objection to the proposed new section 48, and concur with him in the hope expressed by him in regard to the Attorney General. It is placing the Attorney General in an invidious position to ask him to express an opinion beforehand whether a regulation is valid or otherwise. A government department would not draw up a regulation unless it considered it valid; but, if the Attorney General stated that he believed the regulation to be valid, and a court subse-quently declared it invalid, the Attorney General and the official to whom power was delegated to draw up the regulation would be placed in an invidious position. Mr Blackburn. This bill, as drawn, states that the same consequences shall follow the disallowance of the regulation as follow its repeal, and the consequences of a repeal are stated in the proposed new section 51. I submit that a disallowance should not have the same consequences as a repeal. If a regulation is disallowed, it is because one branch of the legislature thinks it should never have been made. If it is repealed it is because the body that made it has decided to repeal it. The proposed new section 51 provides that, when a regulation is repealed, any proceedings commenced under the section may still be continued. That may be reasonable; but, if a regulation is disallowed by the House, nothing should be done under it after that. We could validate what has already been done; but it seems to me entirely wrong to say that notwithstanding the disallowance by the House of a regulation, any prosecution commenced under it should continue. It seems to me that the proposed new section 51, combined with the proposed new section 50 (5). does that. I can see no reason for section 49 (5). In the past, if a regulation was disallowed, It was of no effect, and no pending prosecution could be proceeded with. If the act were altered as proposed, it would be competent for a government to proceed with a prosecution under a regulation of which the House had already disapproved by disallowing it. I propose to submit in committee an amendment, which I have already discussed with the Attorney-General, providing that, within fifteen sitting days of the giving of notice of a motion for disallowance of a regulation, the motion must be either disposed of by the House or the regulation shall be treated as disallowed. I originally intended to propose that the period should be within ten sitting days, but, after discussing the matter with the Attorney-General, I altered the time to fifteen days. I had also intended to submit an amendment dealing with the proposed new section 42, providing that an offence punishable with imprisonment for more than six months shall be always an indictable offence. There are some cases where imprisonment for a longer period than six months can be ordered by a magistrate. I have discussed this matter also with .the Attorney-General, and he is prepared to consider the whole question of penalties in relation to these definitions. I am prepared to accept that promise, and not proceed with my amendment. ""Whatever is provided in the present bill could be over-ridden by a subsequent measure. member for Batman suggested that this proposed new section should be omitted from the bill.' I cannot go as far as the honourable member in that regard, because it would mean that all the existing acts would have to be overhauled and special provision made for punishments. Most of the acts now providing for penalties state that offences shall be indictable or summary. Tbe deletion of these definitions from the act would mean that a great number of acts would have to be overhauled, and the machinery for enforcing a number of acts would entirely disappear. member for Batman that, when we look at an act, we should know what penalty is imposed and who should impose it, but we cannot do that very well now. A great number of acts would, in my opinion, become meaningless if we cut out the words "" indictable offences"" and "" summary offences"". I applaud the principle for which the honorable member stands. I agree with him that punishment by imprisonment should not be imposed except by juries, at any rate for terms exceeding three months; but I do not consider that, by the deletion of these sections, we shall be going the right way to bring about that result.

General) [11.16] I propose to move The honourable five amendments to this clause. The first four are formal drafting amendments, having regard to the date of the proclamation of an act after assent has been given to it. The fifth carries out what I foreshadowed in my second-reading speech, namely, that acts to alter the Constitution should come into operation on the day on which they receive the Royal Assent. In the interests of distant States, ordinary acts should have a postponed operation, in order -to enable them to become known in those States. That does not apply in respect of alterations of the .Constitution, because such proposals become notorious I agree with the honourable before they are enacted. I move That after the word "" Act"", first occurring, proposed new sub-section IA , the words ""(other than an Act to alter the Constitution)"", be inserted. toThat at the end of the clause, the following sub-section be added:"" ' ( IB.) Every Act to alter the Constitution to which the Royal assent is given by the Governor General for and on behalf of the King on or after .the first day of January, One thousand nine -hundred and thirty-seven shall come into operation on the day on which that Act received the Royal assent, unless the contrary intention appears in that Act.'."".

General) [11.19] -It has been suggested by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) and the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) that proposed section 42 should be omitted. It is a literal reproduction of section 4 of the act of 1904 and, therefore, contains a provision which has been part of the statute law for the last 32 years, and has stood throughout the whole of that time without any criticism of which I am aware. In ""those circumstances, I should not be willing, in a hurry, to repeal it , although, as I have indicated to the honourable member for Bourke, I am perfectly prepared to consider what effect it has had in relation to existing statutes. The particular point made by the honourable member for Bourke was that the words ""unless the contrary intention appears"" should be omitted, his general contention being that offences punishable with terms of imprisonment exceeding six months should, as a rule, be tried by jury. I agree with that. As a matter of principle, it is. perfectly sound, but it may very well be that if it has been departed from, it has been departed from ! for some special reason. As the matter came to my notice for the first time this afternoon, I have not had an opportunity to go through the various acts of Parliament to find out how it came to be departed from, but I shall be glad to have such a search' made; and if it should appear that the principle has been departed from, as I think, improperly, I shall be willing to sponsor legislation to put the matter right. .Subject to that qualification, I am not able to adopt the suggestion that proposed section 42 should be omitted. I am equally unwilling to omit proposed section 43 for the reasons indicated by the honourable member for Bourke, that if it were omitted, its provisions would need to be re-inserted somewhere else; they have a definite significance and importance. I think the honourable member agrees that they should, as a matter of form, go into thecrimes law, but as no crimes measure iswhich we could insert this section, that objective could not be achieved in this instance. However, I have in mind the honourable member's suggestion, and I share his desire that these provisionsshould be inserted in the various acts appropriate to them. To omit them in this instance is impracticable. I indicated in the course of my second reading speech that I was prepared to omit proposed section 48 for the reasous. I then stated and which, I gather, are concurred in by the honourable members for Batman and Bourke. I , therefore, move That the proposed new section 48 be omitted. Amendment agreed to. In respect of proposed section 49, the first point I take, is that proceedings under a disallowed regulation can continue to proceed after the regulation has been disallowed. the regulation disallowed may .have repealed some other regulation. Difficulty arises in respect of the survival of the original regulation. the Attorney-General means, but I should like him to consider whether there should not be a difference between a regulation repealed by another regulation and a regulation rejected by either House. point in the honourable member's argument. more on the point. I move That at the end of proposed new section 49, the following new sub-section be added:"" (6.) If within fifteen sitting days after the day on which notice of a disallowing resolution has been given in either House of the Parliament in accordance with sub-section (4.) of this section, such resolution has not been withdrawn or otherwise, with or without, amendment, disposed of, the regulation named: in such resolution shall cease to have effect inc all respects as if it had been disallowed."".",77,Menzies

In this House, or in any House in which the Government has complete control over the time-table, the Government can render illusory the rights of the House to amend .regulations simply by postponing a motion for disallowance. Unless the regulation is brought on and disposed of, either by withdrawal or by a vote of the House, it will lapse at the expiration of fifteen days from the date of its appearance on the notice-paper. I understand that the Attorney-General is prepared to accept: this amendment. General) [11.27] I accept the amendment; in fact, I am indebted to the honourable member for having drawn my attention to this point. It seems absurd, that Avith one hand a House should be given the right to disallow a regulation, and with the other hand the Government should be given power to overcome that by keeping the motion at the bottom of the notice-paper. The effect of the amendment is that, unless the motion is debated and decided within fifteen days of its appearance on the notice-paper, the regulation being challenged shall automatically lapse. In other words the House must be given the right within a reasonable period to express its views on the regulation. Government desires to bury it. would hardly want to bury it, if it has been father to it. At my suggestion, the . lionorable member for Bourke has increased the number of days from ten to fifteen because, within so short a period as ten days, we do hot know what small difficulties might arise. Amendment agreed to. am very reluctant indeed, to allow to pass without a division a portion of this clause which, by inference at all events, Avould lead to the conclusion that the Opposition, for which I speak, acquiesces in the view that offences for , which a less punishment than six months is prescribed, should not be tried before a jury. I am impressed, however, with the representations made by the Attorney General( Mr Menzies), and the honburn), that I . may not have fully considered the possible repercussions, to use a favourite term, arising from the deletion of proposed section 42, because, as I pointed out in my second-reading speech, it has been the law since 1904. I do not think that the effect would be as far-reaching as is feared by honourable members, because I feel that in the majority of cases the penalty is prescribed in the substantive act dealing with the offence; although it may very well be that in some cases that is not so. But realizing that there is always the safeguard that an acts interpretation act does not impose penalties, and that the matter must come before Parliament for reconsideration in due course-a t least before further penalties are imposedI am satisfied to allow the clause to go without division and with the explanation that I have made. General) [11.31] I am sorry that I overlooked referring to the criticisms which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) made of proposed new section 50. This, of course, is riot a new provision, but, as .the honourable member has pointed out, derives from the stormy history of a few years ago. I am afraid that I must say that I do not regard the honourable member's criticism as being by a government and is disallowed according to the provisions of the law, and that government can then again introduce the same regulation and have it disallowed, and go on introducing it and having it disallowed, with no restriction such as is here contained, the law achieves a sort of occult quality-ther e is a legal obligation to-day, which is gone tomorrow ; "" Now you see it, and now you don't,"" Avill be the idea; a regulation will be made on Monday and disallowed on Tuesday, with, as the honourable gentleman says, great .accuracy.

The principle implicit in this bill is, in -measure is purely verbal, and is tendered my opinion, sound. In connection with the stamp duty upon dutiable instruments, the tendency has been to subordinate the rights of the contracting individuals to the exaction of the last penny due to revenue. It is quite right that the revenues should be protected, but it is wrong to make the money claim of the Commonwealth so far predominate as to prevent the enforcement of the contractual legal rights of the individual. The validity of the instrument-in this case a bill of exchange-is not destroyed by reason of the non-payment of sufficient duty, though of course the defaulter may be penalized according to the proper law in that behalf. From that point of view I think that the law is too strict with regard to the inadmissibility in evidence of an insufficiently stamped instrument. However, the bill is an attempt, taking advantage of the International Convention of June, 1930, to put bills issued in Australia on the same footing as those issued out of Australia so far as stamp duty is concerned. I think that it should be passed. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. Debate resumed from, the 18th November (vide page 2011) on motion by Miv That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is a proposed amendment of section 115 of the Trade Marks Act 19051934, which will be found in the Consolidated Statutes of Messrs. McGrath amendments; and Sullivan, volume 3, at page 2478. The section as it stands at present affords protection to an applicant for protection in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, or any foreign country with which an arrangement of the kind mentioned in the section has been made, but it fails representatives of the applicant, in the interests of his beneficiaries and in the event of his death. The bill supplies that omission. The other portion of the for greater exactitude. measure is to be welcomed, as being the first to remedy the existing unsatisfactory position of industrial property generally in the Commonwealth. The legislation affecting industrial property-patents , trade marks, and copyright and designshas been the subject of much criticism in the legal profession. Mr Arthur Dean, a well-known barrister who specializes in patents work, says, in volume 7 of the Australian Law Journal, 1933-34, page 182Our Commonwealth legislation in regard toindustrial property, especially that dealing with patents and trade marks, affords many opportunities of indulging in such criticismI t is notorious that our law upon these matters lags far behind that of Great Britain,, and that there has been expressed by responsible authorities from time to time a general intention of reconsidering the whole of it for the purposes of revision.

In the second class, the High Court and all Supreme Courts have jurisdiction; and in the third class, the Supreme Court alone has jurisdiction; and "" Supreme Court"" is defined as being the Supreme Court of the State in which the Patents and Trade Marks Office is situated. The Supreme Court alone has the power of rectifying the register of patents; but Patents Office to Canberra, there has been no tribunal which could exercise this particular power. Mr Dean points out that there is an obvious solution of this difficulty, and of others inasmuch -as section 76 ( i i ) of the 'Constitution provides for the giving to the High Court of jurisdiction in matters arising under any laws made by the Parliament. He says that if the High -Court were given original, but not necessarily exclusive, jurisdiction in all matters relating to industrial property, in-cluding infringement proceedings, very -definite advantages would result; it would -overcome the difficulties created by the present confused state of the law, and would have the effect that the rights conferred by the legislation would extend throughout the Commonwealth. In most -cases, validity and infringement could be -considered by the same tribunal. He also points out that in some States the judges have had little experience in patents and allied work, and that the conferring of original jurisdiction in all these cases and remuneration to persons employed on the High Court would result in their being tried by judges possessing some specialized knowledge of patents law. I suggest to the Attorney-General( Mr consisting of Dr. Woolnough, Dr. Wade Menzies) the desirability of investigating the anomalies that may have been -created by the removal of the Patents Office to Canberra, and to give consideration to the other suggestions for reform that have been outlined by Mr Dean, and have the support of many responsible legal authorities.

I may say that in the preparation of the amending patents bill, I have had the advantage of being assisted by a very expert committee of gentlemen, to whom I shall in due course since the removal of the make acknowledgment, and that one of that committee was Mr Dean, the author of the article from which the honourable member has quoted.

Sitting suspended from 1145 p.m. to 12.15 a.m. (Thursday). Thursday, S December, 1936. (No. 2) 1936. for the Interior) [12.16 a.m.] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The Petroleum Oil Search Act 1936 appropriated Â£250,000 for the purpose of making advances to persons engaged in drilling operations in connection with the search for oil, and in payment of salaries by the Minister under the act. To advise the Minister in connection with expenditure under the act, a technical committee, and Dr. Ward has been appointed. The technical committee recommended that, in addition to making advances for drilling operations, moneys should be applied for the purposes of conducting geological surveys in Australia and purchasing core-taking drilling plants which could be let out on hire to persons engaged in drilling for oil. In the course of the years, the drilling plants employed in this work have become obsolete. The Government approved of the recommendation of the technical committee, and this bill provides for the necessary amendments of the original act.",80,Menzies
356,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,Attorney,81,Second Reading
357,Mr Paterson (Gippsland,"MiuibtÂ« rThe technical committee is of opinion that the restriction of assistance to deep drilling may defeat the primary object of the legislation, as bores may be sunk at sites without adequate preliminary geological survey. The drilling of a deep hole without the initial steps designed to supplement superficial data might result in an expensive failure, which might deplete the resources of the companies engaged in the search, and discourage shareholders from further participation in prospecting operations. The committee considered, therefore, that the Governbeing satisfied with the nature of the work ment should provide assistance to enable companies to conduct the necessary preliminary geological surveys to justify the sinking of deep bores. Assistance towards geological surveys will be at the rate of Â£1 for every Â£2 provided by the companies. The Government does not consider it necessary to give this new form of assistance to companies operating in New Guinea and Papua under existing permits. These permits are all issued under New Guinea and Papuan ordinances which stipulate the expenditure of considerable sums on definite geological operations. The Papua Oil Development Company Limited holds an area under permit for a period of twelve months from the 1st September, 1936. The company must spend at least Â£15,000, during each of the periods of six months for which the permits are in force, making Â£30,000 in twelve months. The Oriomo Oil Limited holds an area under permit for a period of twelve months from the 1st November, 1936. The Company must spend at least Â£5,000 during the first six months, and Â£7,500 during the second six months of the currency of the permit, making Â£12,500 in all. Island Exploration Company Proprietary Limited has an area under permit, for a period of twelve months from the 1st November, 1936. The company is required to spend at least Â£15,000 during each of the periods of six months for which the permits are in force, making Â£30,000 in all. The capital of these companies must be at least two-thirds British. All the companies in question will be to be on the basis of Â£1 for every Â£2' eligible to apply for financial assistance expended in this work by the companies in connection with drilling operations, but concerned. in view of the conditions stipulated in the Mr Patemon. permits, as to the amounts to be expended, it is considered that there is no necessity at present to subsidize them for survey work. The work that must be carried out during the twelve months for which the permits are in force must be in the nature of survey work. To grant subsidies for survey work would be tantamount to relieving the companies of a large proportion of tbe expenditure they must incur in accordance with the terms of the permits. Any renewal of the permits depends upon the Commonwealth's carried out. The conditions under which companies are operating in Australia are entirely different from those in force in respect of the three companies in Papua. It is the considered opinion of the three geologists on the technical committee advising the Government in this matter that the granting of subsidies for geological survey work in Australia is essential. In view of the facts that the majority of the drilling plants engaged to-day in Australia on the work of boring for oil' are out of date, and that there has been a rapid evolution of efficient core-taking drilling plants within recent years, particularly in the United States of America, the technical committee considers that it would be wise to obtain a few of these plants foT hire to companies requiring them, rather than to allow companies to waste their resources in the purchase of unsuitable plant. .Consequently, provision has been made in the bill for moneys to be expended in the purchase of drilling plants, and for the Minister to let the plants out on hire to companies. Briefly, therefore, it may be said that the purpose of the bill is to make two amendments of the act passed earlier this year to encourage the search for oil. Authority is sought for the Minister to purchase efficient core-taking boring plants and to hire them to approved companies, and to permit of money being expended to subsidize work of a preliminary geological survey character before boring is undertaken. Such subsidy is The bill provides that the cost of actual boring operations can l e subsidized by the Government on a Â£1 for Â£1 basis. I commend the bill to honourable members. A.m] -Although, broadly speaking, I -consider that the principal act could be amended much more radically than is proposed in this bill, I shall not oppose the measure but will take this opportunity to direct attention to certain phases of the search for oil which, in my opinion, demand more attention than they are receiving. I doubt whether the Government is fully aware of all that is going -on in Australia at present in regard to the search for oil. I cannot see how some of the companies referred to by the Minister a few moments ago will be able to -expend from their limited resources the large sums suggested by the Minister, for their subscribed capital would seem to make such expenditure impossible to them. Oriomo Oil Limited, for example, has a capital of only Â£5,000. Island Exploration Company Proprietary Limited has a paid-up capital of only Â£1,050. These companies have already been given permits to search for oil over very extenconsequence in comparison with the ultisive areas. Oriomo Oil Limited has permits covering 12,000 square miles of country, the Papuan Oil Development Company Limited has permits to search over approximately 20,000 square miles of -country, and Island Exploration Company Proprietary Limited has permits to search over 21,000 square miles of country. Estimates, I made reference to the immense importance of oil to the security of Australia and particularly to its economic sufficiency. I frankly doubt whether the Government is giving this important subject the serious consideration it deserves under present-day condieffect, only subsidiary companies to the tions. I could speak at considerable length regarding the vital importance of oil to the industrial life of Australia, and also for defence purposes. Looking back over a number of years we find that the Government has continually made excuses for its failure to take adequate steps to encourage the extraction of coal, and it is only in recent months that Island Exploration Company Proprietary it has done anything to encourage the finding of indigenous oil. The Government has done nothing of a practical nature to develop our shale deposits, although report after report has been attained on the subject. Similarly, although in nearly every country in the world oil is being extracted from coal in large quantities, either by the hydrogenation process or by the low temperature carbonization process, this government has done nothing to encourage such enterprises here. In reply to a question that I asked in the House some little time ago, the Prime Minister stated that a bill would shortly be introduced to enable assistance to be given in connection with geological survey in relation to the search for oil within the Commonwealth. The right honourable gentleman intimated also that no assistance would be given in relation to geological survey, within Papua or the mandated territories. This 'bill is evidently to be regarded as the fulfilment of those promises. An amount of Â£250,000, in all, has been made available by the Government. The expenditure of any amount of money would be of little mate value to Australia should flow oil be found either within the 'Commonwealth or in Papua or in the mandated territories, and for this reason every assistance should be given to companies which are legitimately trying to find oil. In my opinion we canDuring the discussion of the not separate the activities in Australia in the search for oil from those in our adjacent territories. In a previous speech on this subject, I referred to the fact that the Papua Oil Development Company Limited, and the Island Exploration Company Proprietary Limited were, in Vacuum Oil Company and the Shell Oil Company. My reason for that statement is that of the directors of Papua Oil Development 'Company Limited Mr V. Smith is also general manager of the Shell Oil Company; Mr C. J. Ahearn is a. partner of Messrs. Gillott, Moir and Ahearn-solicitor s for the Shell Oil Company, and Messrs. W. H . Anderson and M. Bland are officials of the Shell Oil oil . from shale and from Company.

It would appear that this company, which has little or no resources, is doing far better work than the subsidiary companies of the Shell and Vacuum Oil companies, and it is possible that it may discover oil.

I wish To the extent that this bill gives to the-every means possible to provide Australia with oil supplies, whether from flow oil or from coal or shale or, in the absence of oil from those sources, if practicable, from the development of power alcohol. I do not think that this bill does anything except make provision for a few companies which might feel disposed to exploit the proposal. The original legislation made provision for the distribution of Â£250,000 to encourage the search for well oil. When the legislation was introduced into this HouseI spoke at considerable length and expressed the opinion that the Government was not genuine in its desire to make Australia independent of oil from"" overseas, because already about Â£500,000 had been spent in unsuccessful efforts to locate flow oil within this country. This bill widens the scope for the expenditure of the grant by making provision for a Minister to allocate the funds for the carrying out of work of a preliminary nature, such as the installation of machinery for drilling. The original bill was specific in that the only expenditure to be allowed under the grant was on actual drilling operations, subject to approval by a committee of experts. I remind the House that a number of experts have gone abroad from Australia to inquire into another method by which this country could be made independent of foreign oil supplies. On their return they have all said that the time is not ripe for Australia to embark upon the extraction of oil from coal or shale. Their reports, however, contrast strongly with the position in a number of other countries of the world which do not possess flow oil, countries which have adopted a process whereby at least one of themI refer to Germany-expect s to be independent of imported oil fuel by the end of the current year. I do not intend to repeat what I said when the original bill was before the House, when I gave details as to the amount of tons multiplied into gallons of oil that Germany is producing from coal. Britain also has rendered itself independent of foreign oil sources in respect of its requirements for its army, air force and navy, but in contrast with the steps that have been taken overseas Australia lags behind. In the last eight years I have constantly advocated that steps should, be taken to extract oil from coal and shale. My representations were made not only to this Government and to its predecessors of the same political colour, but also to the Scullin Labour Government. Nobody, however, seemed able to appreciate the benefit that would accrue to Australia if my advocacy were translated into fact. ber does not appear to be debating the bill. the widening of the scope of the act will make it possible for "" go-getter"" companies to put forward some ""spec"" for the purpose of attracting public subscriptions to companies which will never find oil in this country. Similar happenings have occurred in Queensland and Gippsland, and other parts of the country where the public has been fleeced. I am endeavouring to show that a saner proposal would be along the lines I have steadily advocated. I wish to point out that my advocacy of the claims of coal and shale oil have the support of Mr Stevens, the Premier of New South Wales, who has just returned from a tour of Europe, during which he gave much attention to the coal-oil problem. He claims that the extraction of oil from coal has advanced far beyond the experimental stages, and in addressing meetings at Newcastle, he has recommended the enterprise as a commercial proposition. irrelevant to the bill. show that the Government should shield the public from exploitation by companies which are never likely to discover oil, and which probably are never intended to discover it.

He approved of the boring plant installed there. I have asked that the technical committee should examine both the plant at Earley, in West Maitland, and the other plant at Belford Dome, but I was informed that the committee was conducting investigations in the north-west of Western Australia. At Earley, the bore is already down 5,000 feet, supplies of gas have been tapped, and it is claimed that all the indications point to the presence of oil. I do not know whether that is so or not, but there seems to be sufficient evidence to justify an investinotably in the United States of America gation. It is strange that some interests are able to have the committee examine propositions as far afield as the Kimberleys in Western Australia, while it is impossible to get it to make an inspection of provides for certain safeguards in this a nearer proposition, which has been in operation for the last five years. For my part, I am not so optimistic, as are some people, regarding our prospects of obtaining supplies of flow oil. A large area of country has already been prospected, and much money has been spent in the search for flow oil, and I suggest that car engines and chassis and aeroplane we should now be guided by the experience of other countries, and concenthe establishment of those industries, trate on the production of oil from coal or shale, so that we may be assured of supplies for defence purposes. If the country were attacked, we should be powerless to defend ourselves if we lacked adequate supplies of oil. The original act provided that the total government grant should be spent on drilling operations, but this bill provides that already know to exist. The Minister for up to one-half of the grant may be expended upon preliminary operations. g [12.50 a.m.] -This bill provides for the making available of money to approved persons or firms conducting drilling operations for oil, for the conduct of geophysical surveys in search of petroleum, and for the purchase of drilling plant. It also gives authority to supply effective plant for drilling purposes. Certain restrictions are imposed to safeguard the expenditure of the money. There is a strong belief in some quarters, that the major oil companies, which have undoubtedly made huge profits out of the present order of things, are not serious in their search for flow oil. It is even alleged-thoug h I do not necessarily associate myself with the allegation-that they are more interested in preventing the discovery of flow oil than in finding it . It is claimed that they are capable of promoting companies, which will never bring any profit to the investors, because it was never intended that they should do anything but continue the existing highly profitable state of affairs for themselves. Those honourable members who have read literature on this subject, know that in other countries, and Mexico, this sort of thing has. definitely been done, so that it behoves the Government to ensurethat similar practices are not indulged in here. The bill direction, and we must trust the technical committee which advises the Minister and the Government to see that the money provided is not wasted. This subject assumes great importance in view of the Government's policy to encourage the construction in Australia of motor engines. Little good will be achieved by unless we provide ourselves with adequate supplies of oil, either by laying in large stocks, by developing the production of the flow oil that is available, or by making provision for the production of oil from shale and coal, &c. We should give more attention to the development of those oil resources which we the Interior( Mr Paterson), in whose electorate the area to which I refer is situated, is probably more familiar with this matter than I am, but any one who visits the Lakes Entrance oil-field can see the oil being extracted. It may be that the quantity so far is limited, but it is claimed by those on the field that, if they were given practical assistance, there is no reason why there should not be in this area which has already proved to be oil bearing 1,000 wells each producing 80 or 100 gallons a day. I do not know whether that is true or not but those concerned are criticizing the Government for its failure to provide the assistance which they desire. I take it",85,Second Reading
372,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"that, under the provisions of this bill, the Government will be able to make that assistance, provided the technical committee reports favourably upon the propositions submitted to it. A great deal will depend upon the quality of the men appointed to the committee. I know that the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) wishes to encourage the development of the production of oil from coal and shale, so that the unemployed ir. his district may be absorbed in the new industry. When it was suggested to those interested in the Gippsland oilfield that, if their industry were expanded, it might throw workers out of -employment on the Wonthaggi coal-field, they asserted that all the miners displaced -could easily be absorbed on the oilfields. If it can be proved that the -development of this oil-field is a commercial possibility, it is the duty of the Govested interests are established it is very vernment to give every assistance possible, and it can count upon the Opposition to assist it. The Government must .also take steps to ensure that nothing is done by the powerful overseas oil companies in Australia to prevent the successful development of the oil-producing industry in Australia. The oil companies operating in Australia are sections of the big overseas concerns which exercise a great influence on, not only the commercial and industrial life, but also the politics, of the world. The statement made to me by numbers of persons when I visited Gippsland was that the oil resources of Australia would be -developed only when those interests were ready to do it. If that is the position Australia is suffering a disability which it should not be called upon to experience, and it is the duty of every government to see that no restriction is placed on the development of our oil resources. Every possible assistance should be given to those people who are genuinely -engaged in the nationally important enterprise of producing oil on a payable basis. [1.1 a.m.] -It is unfortunate that such important measures as this should be introduced in this chamber between 1 and 2 a.m., when their discussion is necesssarily restricted. I do not know of any -measure that is fraught with greater possibilities than is this bill. I am not at all enamoured of what the Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) hopes to do under this measure. The fears I expressed in May last are still with me. The Government is being used to consolidate in Australia the interests of certain big overseas oil companies. I do not approve of this. I said last May that, if millionaires are to be made, let us have Australian, not American, millionaires. Clause2 of the bill gives the Minister extraordinary power to make any agreement whicli he thinks fit. This matter should not be left to the discretion of one Minister, but should be subject to the approval of Parliament. things can be regulated afterwards. difficult to induce Parliament to say to a financial octopus, ""Thus far and no further"". Much could be done by the Government further to investigate our oil resources. The best proposal I have yet heard has been put to me by Mr A. E. Ejiight, one of my constituents, who said it should be possible for the Commonwealth and States to arrive at an arrangement under which Is. or 2s. in the Â£1 of the money collected by the States for motor registration fees would be placed in a separate fund, motor owners being given scrip for that money as it accumulated. The amount could be subsidized by the Commonwealth, and thus an Australian company could be established, which could be granted the sole right to conduct the search for oil in this country. If this were done every motor owner in Australia would be a part-owner with the Commonwealth Government in the concern. No member of this House is more anxious than I am to see flow oil discovered here. The kinds of companies that would be assisted under measures such as this would be more of a nuisance to us than they would be worth. I think that the Government would be wise to withdraw this bill. On a matter of such outstanding importance, a committee of this House, or a joint committee of both Houses, should be appointed to give further consideration to the problem.

I then explained that its chief objective was the removal of a minor anomaly in the tariff treatment of certain territorial goods entering the Commonwealth. When preferential tariff treatment was first extended to those territories in 1926, provision was made The Governfor free admission of all their major products.

It is sought to remove this anomaly by providing that all goods not specified in the schedule shall be subject to the duties in force under the British preferential tariff. I may say that it is anticipated that the change w ill have very little practical significance. In the case of Papua, the imports of dutiable goods in 1934-35 amounted to only Â£70 in a total import of Â£115,926, while in the case of New Guinea, they represented Â£244 in a total import of Â£76,684. The Government is also availing itself of this opportunity to consolidate in a single schedule all the duties relating to Papua and New Guinea. A t the present time duties are imposed on some territorial products under the main customs tariff schedule. vided for in the Papuan and New Guinea preference tariff. These proposals bring all items together in a single schedule. Apartf r o m the proposal to apply the British preferential tariff to commodities not specified in the schedule, the duties at present applicable to Papuan and New Guinea goods remain unaltered w it h a single exception, namely, the duty on tea. ""With regard to tea, the Administrator of Papua is impressed with the possibilit y of successfully producing tea in that territory.

There is some government disappointment at the failure of planters in the two territories to take advantage of the rather generous bounty provisions provided in existing legislation. There are many reasons advanced -for this failure, but I would emphasize that if the territories are to be developed along sound economic lines it is imperative that there should be greater diversification of agricultural production. Notwithstanding the Government's inability to point to any real achievement in production in the territories by reason of the enactment of the bounty legislation of 1926, the Government has decided to renew the legislation for a further period of twelve months. inquiry will he held and the administrations, planters and other interested parties will be provided with an opportunity to show an earnest of their desires for continuance of this bounty legislation.

I do not think that I should go into details in respect of the conditions laid down in section 151A of the Customs Act, which vary as applied to goods falling within different categories. The amendment, in effect, empowers the making of regulations to prescribe conditions to be fulfilled before goods imported from a country entitled to the benefits of the intermediate tariff shall be deemed to he the produce or manufacture of that country. As it is impossible to foresee what conditions should be reasonably and appropriately applied to cover a great and varying range of circumstances, it is necessary that flexibility should exist, particularly in the early I ask the Ministeri f any stages of administration, in order that suitable conditions may be established from experience and practice.
