0,"Is To Hold Up This Motion To Prevent Him. From, Travelling Further On His Present Lines. Mr Speaker Mir, Hector Lamond","They are. all anxious to get to the Budget! sneers from the honourable man. may seem a' matter of comparative unimportance to him, but it raises a very serious question in that it concerns the attitude of Parliament towards .the programme of measures which the Government has indicated it desires to pass before the session closes. I would willingly support the motion taken by itself. I and most of my friends would be ready to git here early'and late, from Monday morning until Saturday at midday, were that required of us by the exigencies of the situation.' .But support to this motion will apparently be taken to include acquiescence in the policy of the Government, and endorsement of its proposa] to pass within about a week the thirteen measures that have been mentioned by the Prime Minister, and a number of others on the business-paper which are not ineluded in the urgent list, and I cannot support that. that in voting' for an extra sitting day any one will be taken as supporting the whole programme' of the Government. whenever extra time is given by honourable members for the consideration, of public business, we find later that the opportunities ' for discussing that business are being curtailed House itself. what course we should take. If we agree to every proposal of the Government for lengthening the hours of sitting, we may discover that it is intended to shorten the session in order to meet the convenience -of some persons by having an early election. If opposition to the motionwill put a check on the Government, I shall -oppose it, or I will support any other method that my right honourable friend may suggest for putting a check on Ministers. I am prepared to come here every -day, if th© interests, of th© public require' that. But while we increase the number of sitting days in each week,, we find Ministers constantly endeavouring to diminish the opportunities of honorahle members to discuss matters of the utmost importance. If the thirteen measures in the Prime Minister's list, to say nothing of. the other business on the notice-paper, are to be adequately discussed, three gentleweeks or a month will he needed to do jusThe discussion of the .motion tice to them, even if we meet every day in the week, commencing at 3 p.m. on Monday and finishing a t ' l p.m. on Saturday. Much has been said about "" stonewalling "" and of the multitude of motions of want of confidence. I was not here when most of the motions of want of confidence were moved. was doing good work elsewhere. able member for that interjection -During my absence in EnglandI had an opportunity to attend the debates of the House of Commons, the mother of Parliaments, and the mother of this Parliament, to whose procedure -we look for guidance. member brought back tjhe mannerisms of its members? question of principle, not of mannerisms.

15,Mr Jowett,"-During this debatein June last. I have been a member of this House for five years, representing hero the electoral division of Grampians. Whatever may hereafter be said for or against me, 1 shall at least go down in history as the last member for that constituency. It will not he my fault that I shall he the last member for Grampians. I should have liked to know that there would he an electorate of Grampians represented in this Parliament long after I was dead and gone. member connoct his remarks with the question? there would still be an electorate of Grampians. 'to do with the question. properly robbed of a member. member not to continue in this strain. had the honour of representing the electorate of Grampians. When I go before my electors^-and I shall be able to appeal to 11,000 of them who have been removed from the electorate of Grampians to another electoral division-who n I go before my electors, I shall have to say that I see no way in whioh honourable members, can give adequate expression to their opinions, or impose any check upon the recklessness or. carelessness of the Governand rules which, however, I say aro very ment of the day, or obtain adequate information regarding measures' brought before the House, except by moving motions of want of confidence. son) -Order l Will the honourable member come to the motion before the Chair? excellent reasons why we should sit or should not sit on Monday, but the strongest reasons I oan advance for somo change in the hours and days of sitting is that, under present conditions, honourable members, except Government supporters, have no means of obtaining information regarding matters of the utmost importance to the community except by moving, motions of want of confidence. I ouce moved the adjournment of the House to discuss the shipping freights, and, simply because the Government were so J Bitting Dag. careless as not to talk out the motion, it went to a vote, and the decision of the House, and of the whole people of Australia, was in my favour. I should like to Bay a few words about the way in whioh honourable members are dragooned, not necessarily by the Government of the day, but by the rules of procedure and precedents which have been adopted by the House. I do not claim to bo a student of constitutional or parliamentary history, but during the last few months I have come in contact with many men who are, and I have come to the conclusion that there is no Legislature in the world in which honourable members are so dragooned and fettered in their discussion of matters of public importance as thoy are in this House. They aro certainly not under the same restrictions in the House of Commons. Members of that august Chamber receive infinitely greater consideration from their Government than honourable memhers of this House have had sinco I have had a seat iu it. According to our Standing Orders, interjections are disorderly, and what is the result? Interjections or questions addressed to the honourable member who is speaking are forbidden, and if any other honorablo member wishes to put in a good word, he has to rise and shout in the loudest voice what he has to say. If he continues to do that, he is chided by the Speaker or Chairman of Committees -ver y properly, according to precedents wrong. I should like to have an opportunity of debating them with you, Mr Speaker. If an honourable member continues to interject, he is told from the Chair that he iB disorderly, and that if he repeats the offence he will be named and ordered out of the Chamber. The practice of the House of Commous is totally different. orable member to address himself to the motion that the House shall meet on .Monday next. the time to consider vvhat we shall be called upon to do on Monday next.

AlthoughI did not mean to refer to the honourable member for Balaclava, I admit that he is one of the 'highest authorities. I am not sure that be is not the very highest. It is clear that the object of the motion is that for somebody's convenience all the measures which have been mentioned are to be rushed through Parliament in the hope of the session terminatms: next Friday or Saturday. almost as mucb time n disenssinsr the ; motion as we sball gain by meeting on Monday. much is to be gained by meeting on Monday.

There might be a month more inconvenient to the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), and it may be that he has been consulted and a December election has been suggested to suit him. It is hopeless for any private member, or even the Leader of a party, to do anything in this House unless be is supported by the Government. Tbe Government are absolute dictators. I was very much interested in a discussion we bad a little time ago on tbe subject of parties. It was stated that for all practical purposes it did not matter how many men were in Opposition carefully to tbe bonorable member.

39,Mr Speaker,"I have listened veryfollow tliem rather than to debate the motion before tbe Chair. your warm appreciation, not only of this speech, but of all my other speeches. I shall endeavour to follow more closely your wise advice. I understand that the object of meeting on Monday is to allow us to get through our business so that tbe general election may be held on tbe 9th December. To that end we must rush through all tbe proposed legislation withcommunications from tbe Imperial Goout consideration. with the Budget, upon wbich. the bonorable member's Leader desires to speak. with the Budget. I am sure tbe Leader of the Opposition will deal with it in a most adequate and illuminating fashion. We all look forward to hearing tbe honourable member. I protest, in tbe name of public necessity, against the Government's intention to rush on this legislation without allowing opportunity for it to be adequately discussed. There is no real necessity for the House to rise at tbe end of next week, or even the week after that. We need not rise before the middle of December, as in former years. Of course tbe session ought to finish about that time, because all honourable members desire to return to their homes and foregather witb their wives and families at Christmas. It is a piece of brutality and folly to introduce into this House any measures dealing witb the lives, liberties, and fortunes of the people withthat when tbe outlook is so grave, it is out allowing tbem to be adequately discussed. It will be impossible to adequately strong Governmenit in power, and that, if discuss and pass tbese measures before tbe middle of December; and I should like to know whether any reason bas been given or suggested why the House should not continue to sit, and tbe election be held next year? ment are afraid of the axe of Sir George Fuller, in New South Wales. mind of the Government may not be so deep as that of the honourable member, but I do not think he is quite justified in taking that view. Representatives of the Government are silent because. I take it, they know of no reason wby tbe election sbould not take place next year. Tbe bonorable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) bas advanced one powerful reason why the House sbould not rise in this indecent haste and the election be rushed on in this unjustifiable fashion, and that is tbe difficult international position. I regret to find myself at variance in ths remotest degree with that bonorable member, but I do not join witb bim in asking that tbe Prime Minister sball make a statement to the House regarding bis vernment. promised to do so. Prime Minister did promise to do so, unless, of course, he himself is quite satisfied as to tbe wisdom: of that course. I havo been a close observer of foreign affairs for years, and I bave become profoundly impressed, especially during the last nine months, witb the fact that everything that is said in this Parliament, no matter how hasty, ill-considered, or indiscreet, is cabled to the otber end of tbe world, and, within forty-eight liours, is made use of by our enemies to tbe disadvantage of Australia. the information. able members are entitled to information, but statements made on tbe floor of tbe House are apt to be cabled and circulated throughout Europe, and a great deal of harm may thereby be done.

No doubt, the argument will-be raised that these men entered into specific agreements. They were anxious to get homes of their own, and, naturally, they signed the agreement, because to refuse to do so would remove their only opportunity to socure a home. When they attached (heir signatures they appreciated the fact that they were dealing w it h the Government, and they did not reckon upon a breach of f a it h .

But many applicants have been unable to loam the extent ment has heen unable to say, accurately, what has heen the cost of many of the homes; there has been no method of costing. Many of the homos have been built in groups; and, in these instances, the aggregate expenditure has been divided by the number of dwellings in the group.

I think that my proposal \irould cover nine-tenths of the cases in which there is a dispute as to the amount which should be charged: There were cases in which the statutory cost waa not exceeded, but most of the soldiers have been asked to pay something more than they expected to .have to pay. I nope that the Minister will consider the matter, and I am willing to give him time to do so. We promised to provideour soldiers' with homes on' certain terms, and we should keep faith with them. If bad administration has increased costs . beyond the statutory limit, the public should take the responsibility ; the extra liability should not house.

Mr .FRANCIS -That is, we are now amount standing in our books', in an taking that amount from the soldiers. that members should hear what I have to say before coming to a conclusion' on this general ! matter. The Commissioner, in every case in which excess cost has been due to malsum has been written off in only a few administration, such as defective accountcases. Sometimes the valuation in our. ancy, the wrong charging of materials, books is below the actual cost.

In every case where there is reasonable doubt that the prices are in excess of the real, values the excess is written off, and the loss borne by the War Service Homes Commission. the reasonable doubt exist f the mind of the soldier, but must eventually be conveyed to the mind pf the Minister. There «xe several ways in which an estimate of value may be made. We are still building houses like those we have to value, of the same type and of similar materials, and know what they are costing. We also know what the. land costs. We can check the estimates by means of valuations from different firms of auctioneers and valuators, That is a very unsatisfactory method, but by getting two or three check valuations we are able to arrive at what is the fair value of the though I have met many groups of soldiers BinceI became the Minister administering this scheme, I have heard ' from them none of the complaints which have been voiced by honourable, members in regard to unfair valuations of homes: The soldiers are not presenting themselves as suppliants for qharity; they are merely asking for a fairdeal, and the Government are .giving it to them. The position to-day is that some-houses that are worth £1,000 and many houses that are worth £900 amd could be sold in the market at higher prices, have been built fpr the soldiers under an arrangemont that they wpuld pay whatever the houses cost the Commissioner.

The question put to the valuers is, "" H o w much is that house worth ?"" The reference has nothing to do with the provisions of. the Act or things other than the fair value of the house. The question now before the Committee is whetiier the Commissioner should sell housee to Boldiers, who have undertaken to pay whatever they might cost, at a lower price than their actual value, simply because of some provision in the Act which has no relation to the price at which the Commissioner sells, but which places a restriction upon him in regard to the amount of money that he may advance for any one house. the present date; will that date be moved, or iB it a fixture? troubles will not arise again.

If the amendment valuation iB carried we shall sell a (house worth £1,000 for £800, and to-morrow the soldier will go upon the market, re-sell the house, and put £200 in cash into, his pocket. For what reason? The soldier is not asking for this money. He is asking that his house be fairly valued and sold to him at a reasonable price. And I do not think we are justified in going beyond tlhat, having regard to all the circumstances. We have already offered relief to soldiers whose houses are too expensive for them. We say to a soldier, "" This has cost us £ 1 , 1 0 0 ; we say it is worth £900.

It is fair to give the soldier this opportunity, and having taken ' seme pains, in Victoria particularly, to ascerquite sure that the majority of soldiers in occupation would have no difficulty in selling their homes at a considerable advance on the prices they will be asked to pay. Unfortunately, the opinions of honourable members are too much influenced by two or three defective groups of houses that proWe have sent the greatest difficulty to me. It . is not fair that the Commonwealth should sell to a soldier a house that is not properly built, or that is not hygienic, but No ; and I where the soldier has acquired an asset of real value it is reasonable to keep him to his contract, particularly when we give him the option of having another house",35,Commonwealth Shipping

We could not ask a soldier to go out into the street simply because of some mistake which the Department (has made. the Department will do. most unfair reflection upon the Department. I have had access to tihe files as freely as anybody, and there is very little evidence in the Department of any offioers -and we have had some very poor ones -tryin g to take advantage of the soldier. Our real misfortune is that the problem is exceedingly difficult. We have to revalue thousands of houses. I have had experience with some of the most qualified valuators in Australia. I 'had one house valued by three of the most prominent valuers in Sydney, and their opinions varied to a maximum of 50 per cent. Many of the valuations are held up because I desire to be perfectly satisfied that the soldiers are getting their houses at the present-day value. We have abandoned the idea of trying to arrive at the accurate value two years ago. Inevitably all the valuations are against the Department. The houses were built when labour and material were dearer than they are to-day, and the valuator does not attempt to arrive at what would have been a fair valuation two years ago; he declares the house to be worth so much to-day. All the valuations we get show present-day values. hold to them, or will they be altered? matter is cleaned up, and that will not be for some months, the prices fixed must be final. It is inconceivable that the Commonwealth, because it has undertaken to build a home for a soldier, should also accept responsibility for any depreciation of the property market in years to come; that is not a fair request to make. that has been written oS the capital cost of these houses to date? give au accurate estimate, and probably oue sbould uot attempt to do so, because these estimates are used for all sorts of purposes. I am quite certain from what I have seen that the total amount to be written off as a result of selling the houses to soldiers at fair present-day values will be under 5 per cent, of the total expenditure on tlieir consti uction. The trouble over War Service Homes has been grossly exaggerated, as is the way of the modern newspaper. I do not supE ose there is anybody in Australia who as not heard of the Goulburn group. But for one badly constructed house in that group we can show 100 houses tliat challenge comparison with any other buildings of the same date. One houorable member stated yesterday that the contractors were averse from taking contracts under the Commission because they would be held to the conditions. controlled by departmental officers, not by the War Service Homes Commission. big building authority the Commission employs to-day is directed by a State officer, so there is no uoint in the honourable member's interjection. Tliere is no need for the apprehension that some honourable members seem to have that hy asking the soldier to pay more than £700 or £800 for his bouse, as the ca«e mpy be, we are placing any part of the losses of tbe Department upon his shoulders. Not one penny of the ascertainable losses due to maladministration, faulty supervision, or loafing on the job, as shown in tbe books of the Commission, will be charged to the soldier. On the contrary, I am satisfied that in making these adjustthe Department ments, tbe benefit given to the soldiers amounts to a very considerable sum of money, and that 95 per cent, of tbe purchasers could sell tlieir homes at a profit. Of the soldiers I bave met-and I have talked to tbem in tbeir homes in the groups-onl y a very negligible number would contemplate for a moment selling their houses at the prices which the Commission is charging them. say that the estimated value is not likely to be exceeded in the future? succeeded in satisfying the Committee upon the point immediately under notice, I 'have no objection to deal with other",36,Lamond Thes E Tain The Values Of These Houses I Am

129,Mr Hector Lamond,"If I havephases of the question. strongest reasons for the adoption by the Government of the contract system is thai the soldier is able to see a definite contract in writing before anything is done. The Commission is able to say to the soldier, ""The contract for this house is £790, and that is all you will be called upon to* pay, unless you interfere with bhe contract, and then, of course, according to whatever demand you make, it will cost you an additional amount."" a definite contract from the beginning none of the troubles which have occurred in the past can arise in the future. The soldier will know before his home is built how much it will cost, and the only objection he can raise is that it bas not been well constructed. Before he goes in we shall require him to examine it, but as during the progress of the contract we have examinations by our own officers, we can tell, bim before he goes in that the job has been well done. I strongly object to tbe soldiers going into their homes before they are finished. Most of the troubles we bave had have arisen from that fact, but in order to convenience tihe soldiers themselves we allowed them to enter into possession of the bouses before the values were ascertained. Of course, we are all exceedingly wise after the event, but I ask honourable members to turn their .minds back to the time when we had thousands of soldiers coming back to Australia. them married on their return, others bad married abroad, and brought tlheir wives and often young children with them. I ask honourable members to realize the shortage of houses existing Even when I undertook the control of tbe Department, as late as six months ago, young soldiers came to me pleading for a home in Victoria, aud I was amazed at the conditions under which I found some of these men living in Melbourne, with families, occupying two rooms and paying extortionate rents for such poor accommodation. If the Coimmissioner, seeing the needs of these men, allowed them to go into leading to many of these troubles, I do not think that our judgment on him sbould be too harsh. tried to meetthe need that was urgent at that time, and, of course, in doing so, led to some of these troubles. However, I can assure honourable members that the methods adopted by the Mr Hector Lamond. One of the Commission to-day to undo tihe evi] that was done and give the soldiers their homes at a fair and reasonable price are completely efficient. I can also assure bonorable members that if wben tihese values bave gone out there still remain individual cases that appear to be unjust and in need of review they will, have most careful individual attention. Had tbe Minister( Mr Hector Lamond) Witb -made in introducing the measure the explanation be has just given, a good deal of misapprehension would have been cleared away, because hitherto honourable members have been rather in the dark as to the proposals of the Government. However, his explanation does not entirely meet the case. Por instance, he concluded ihis remarks by saying that it was a mistake to allow the soldiers to enter houses before they knew the cost of them. As a matter of fact, it was a mistake on tihe part of the Commission not to know the cost of the houses. It was certainly nota mistake on their part to allow tbe men to get into the homes, seeing that it was nearly two or three years in some cases before tihe Department knew the cost of tbem. What would have happened to the dwellings if they had remained unoccupied for that period, and what would bave happened to the men who needed homes ? It was a wise thing for the Commissioner to allow Many of tbe men into tbe bouses, although his action in that respect may have led to trouble in other directions. member is right as to that point, but the value of the homes would have been ascertained much earlier if the men bad not been in occupation of them. values have been ascertained earlier, even if the men were permitted to 'get into their homes ? Surely tbe fact that people were living in the houses had nothing to do witb the question of arriving at their cost? the soldiers were in occupation of the homes rendered tbe matter of ascertainHe ing the values mucb less urgent.

Some of the men who entered into written agreements to get theirhouses at a ' certain oost are quite safe because they have a legally binding agreement; but, othera, who went in on exactly the same footing, but without signed contracts, may be called upon to pay extra for their homes. It is not fair treatment to those who trusted to the Government that they should be let down. statement that the soldiers are being "" let down."" elucidate. that remark. The soldier is being let down in regard to the intrinsic or actual value of the house he occupies. Having made it his home, and improved its surroundings, he is to be asked to tear himself -away, and probablylose the employment he now has. a thousand will leave his home at the price at which we shall give it to him. to agree to the unanimous recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee that the soldier should have his house at the price at wbicb he thought he was going to get it. Eveni f it costs the Commonwealth £100,000 to do this it will be a small price to pay for bringing contentment to a great body of returned soldiers'. am disappointed at the attitude adopted by the Minister, and I desire to make my position clear so that if there are further complications at a later stage I shall be able to point to my record. We ought to have sufficient manliness to decide this matter, in view of what has happened. We are responsible, as a Parliament and a Government, to the returned men, and ought to take care that they do not suffer because of blunders in administration. will. ful not to be too definite on the point. indefinite ? it was a question of values, and that whatever valuation may be given he will decide accordingly; I desire to go further and admit the wrong that has been done to these men through maladministration. I propose to submit the amendment, and every honourable member here will be responsible to his constituents and ' the returned soldiers for the vote he gives. The amendment will provide, beyond doubt, that the men shall have housee worth the £700 or £800 as provided by the Act. This proposal as to values is the most misleading ever placed before a Parliament. We all know that in oases of land resumption for railways and so forth, great-difference of opinion is shown resent tbe in the evidence of valuers; it all depends on the persons by whom the valuers are engaged, and the exact evidence that any person requires can be obtained. I know that to be a fact. from personal experience iu a case concerning the Railway Commissioners in New South Wales and in other cases. Buti t is not a question of valuos now; it is a question of what Parliament intended should be the cost of these homes to the returned men. Why should we say that a house which has oost £1,100 shall be valued, and that if the valuation be £950, the soldier shall pay the difference between £800 and the latter amount. the soldier more than the war gratuity. really does not desire to concede the-soldier anything, but to rely solely on the valuation. Parliament ought to rectify as far as possible any mistakes made by the Government, and even if to do so moans a cost of £100,000 the Government ought to pay it. Why should a sold'er be called upon to pay £150 because of. a mistake by the Government T . house which was estimated to cost £800, but actually, cost £1,0001 If in such a case the Government presented the £200 to the soldier, the' latter might immediately sell the house for £1,100.

As in the main, the extra cost in these instances is admittedly duo to bad administration and defective supervision, it is not right that the soldier should have to pay for these. Where a complaint of this kind has been made, a valuation, aB at the time of the erection of the house, should be obtained from an impartial source, and the amount thus arrived at should be the price charged to tbe soldier. That is the principle on whicb the Commission has acted, and it seems to me to be a perfectly just and equitable system, and the only one that is suitable. up to that, for it says, "" at the time of erection."" really giving tbe soldier the benefit of the falling prices since the house was erected. no fall. has been, and no one will dispute the fact.

ToAustralia tbe matter begins and ends tbere. We are not concerned witb tbe merits of tbe dispute between Turkey and Greece. We do not denounce either party, or attempt to say where the blame lies.' Let me remind honourable members of what has led up to the present position. The provisions of the Treaty of Sevres all but dispossessed Turkey of ber foothold in Europe, leaving to her but a shadow of bar former greatness as a European Power. It stripped her of the control of the Dardanelles; she had lost Adrianople in the Balkan war; and she was dispossessed of Thrace. Turkey suffered heavily during the Great War, both in Europe and in Palestine and Syria. The Turkish Government, qua Government, accepted the Treaty of Sevres, but there was much dissatisfaction witb its provisions amongst the Turkish people, and another Government was set up at Angora, of which Kemal was the moving spirit. It was under Kemal that tbe forces which would not accept the Treaty of Sevres and the new arrangements stances with which honourable members are sufficiently familiar, took up tbe cause of his Grecian compatriots in Thrace and elsewhere, and, gathering large forces, attacked the Turks. For a time his army made great headway, but it was at length driven back by tbe Turks. Tbis brings us to tbe position of affairs as it stood three weeks ago,, or thereabouts. ' Tbe Britisb Government was a signatory to the Treaty of Sevres, as was also the Commonwealth. It is essential to remind the House and tbe public that upon posed an obligation to maintain its provisions.

187,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime MinBelgium's neutrality. if reason is to be substituted foree, and the rule of tbe law is to bo extended into the international sphere, tbe observance of Treaties is essential. There is imposed upon all signatories of Treaties, and, indeed, upon all peoples desiring peace and the substitution of law for the rule of force, an obligation to punish international criminals who attempt to ignore or violate Treaties just as there is imposed upon civilized nations the duty of punishing those who offend against statute law. The Kemalites, flushed with victory, declared their tered tbe neutral zone, and were moving intention to violate the Treaty of Sevres by invading the neutral zone, which includes the Gallipoli Peninsula, and is the British troops. hinterland to the Straits of Dardanelles. Some days ago, when the Kemalites declared their intention, whether or not through the mouth of Kemal is immaterial, of taking Thrace by force of arms and seizing the Gallipoli Peninsula, and when it was stated quite frankly that Bussia proposed to. support them in their claims, Great Britain moved instantly, and stated that as a signatory to the Treaty of Sevres she intended maintain its provisions. that declaration was the clear and unambiguous statement of her desire for a conference at which the provisions of the Treaty of Sevres coidd be considered. I may go so far as to say that Britain declared that she would sympathetically consider the claims of the Tasmania. Kemalites, although not undertaking that she would grant thorn in tbeir entirety. Notwithstanding Kemalites declined to accept the .invitation, and Britain then made a communication to the Dominions, that reached me on Sunday weak. As a signatory to the Treaty, and a nation particularly inyield to force. With this policy the Goterested in it, Australia was asked to stand by the Treaty and to say plainly to Kemal, as an international offender, tliat while we were prepared to grant everything to reason, we would yield noththe honour of speaking in the House ing to force. That, in effect, was and is the slogan of Britain, and it sbould be the slogan of the civilized world. For a time it appeared that Britain would act alone-I say it appeared, not that it was so. Our attitude was never in doubt. We have done everything we could by moving, directly through our representatives, the ilr. Bughes. It is clear that League of Nations, to intervene, and for by urging upon Britain the necessity for attempting to preserve peace by all honourable means. It appears that during the week Britain, France, and Italy, and probably other powers, sent a message to the Kemalites inviting tbem to a conference, and it is stated that the French Government made representations to Kemal strongly urging him to accept the invitation. I shall not pretend to say for a moment whether or not Kemal was responsible, but it is a fact that on the 27th September Kemalite troops enwith the intention of seizing the heights above Chanak, whicli is occupied by The British general in command interviewed the Turkish officer ancl urged him to retire. The subsequent events are a little obscure. Whether or not there was any firing I am unable to say; but serious hostilities were not reported in the information that has reached me. It is a fact, however, that the forces of the Kemalites are steadily concentrating around Chanak. Whether they are concentrating inside or outside to the neutral zone I do not know, but bonAlong witb orable members will realize that they are almost within striking distance of that place. Of course, we are not speaking of a great country like Australia, with its immense spaces, but of a small territory considerably less in extent than the State of Victoria, probably about the size of Under such cdremmstances. ovents move rapidly, a day, nay, even a few hours, may precipitate a conflict. this declaration the That was the position yesterday. British troops are in occupation of Chanak, and thc British Government, using every effort to obtain a peaceful settlement, are nevertheless resolutely determined not to vernment of the Commonwealth is in complete accord. No further communication has passed from the Commonwealth to Britain since I last had on this subject. The Government have been kept fully posted as to the progress 1 of events; but, having set out our attitude quite clearly, having done all that was possible to secure the intervention of the League of Nations, being confident that Britain herself was using every means at the disposal of a civilized Power to prevent war, we were satisfied to leave the matter where it was in the conviction-"" that interference at this end would be calculated' to embarrass rather than to help. The declaration of Australia's intention was unqualified, and, having given that, it was not necessary for us to strengthen it . We have said, "" We pray that there will be no war. We urge upon you to do everything in your power to prevent war. Buti f war comes wo are going to stand by your side."" Wo are satisfied that Britain is doing everything in her power to avoid hostilities, and if war unhappily breaks out one nation in the world at least will be in the right in this matter-Britain. Even though she stands alono she will still be the only nation in thc right, because the others also are signatories to the Treaty of Sdvres, ancl upon them all is a solemn obligation to uphold that Treaty, unless and until it be modified by a conference or by the League of Nations. Once we yield anything to force, after having subscribed to the Treaty, the last hope of peace to the world disappears. We must, while being ready to yield everything to reason, ruthlessly punish the offender. A dissatisfied nation says that it has not been treated fairly, and that it has a right to a place in the sun. It is not for us to say that the last word has been said, and act like the gods, never willing to revise our . decision. should yield everything to reason. There is another phase of the matter that must be spoken of, the position in Greece. There has been a revolution. I am informed that the Army and Navy have revolted against Oonstantine. There is a suggestion that Venizelos should bo recalled, or that thero should be a dictatorship. Tho recalling of Venizelos does not necessarily improve the situation, so far as we are concerned, becauso he could hardly be expected to be reinstated aud given absolute power unless he was prepared to do something for those thousands of his compatriots who have been driven out of Thrace, and whose lives are now in danger. If Yenizelos declared that ho was in favour of the evacuation .of Thrace, that would hardly commend itself to the Greeks. not certain that he will-the position would not bo materially improved. As for the. possibilities of a military dictatorship, they are obvious. It would mean war. The military faction in Greece is in favour of continuing -the war in Thrace, and that naturally adds to the' fear of the Kemalites, who have suffered, but are now victorious, and are now, so they believe, within a stone's fihrow of their goal. With matters in Greece we caunot interfere, .and the less we say about them the better. That is also true of the position gene-, rallv, because wo would resent very stronglv another nation attempting to interfere with any question affecting Australia. As for our policy, I have already declared if. We want, above all things, a peaceful settlement. We in Australia certainly do not approach the question with a bias against Kemal, knowing, nothing of tbe rights or wrongs of the. situation. But I think I can safely say that the feeling of the soldiers of Australia is that they do not harbour any feeling against the Turks, although tbey have fought them. But we are for the right. It is the intention of Britain to remain at Chanak, where her troops are. She stands there representing the international police of the world. If she is not joined by other nations, the fault lies on their shoulders and not on hers. It is the duty of the civilized nations to uphold the Treaty We or else disband the League of Nations and their pretensions to substitute the rule of law for that of force. There would be a definite obligation upon us to supply our quota if the League of Nations declares that "" it will resist by force of arms any attempt to anticipate its decision."" Britain says, ""There is our signature."" Wo are, as a signatory to the Treaty of Sevres, and an integral part of the British Empire, compelled to supply our quota. I leave the matter tbere, having, I hope, put it in proper perspective. If war begins it certainly will not begin and end in Turkey alone. It is impossible to ignore what-may follow from the conflagration. A war must involve the Balkan*, and it could hardly do that without involving the Soviet. It could hardly arouse Turkey without arousing the East, and it could not do If he were recalled-and it is that without menacing our very existence, and'aiming a'blow at the very heart of thc Empire. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) suggested this morning that, if tha coming elections synchronized with theoutbreak of war it would be most unfortunate. He. said that if war was probable,. Parliament ought uot toprorogue. The position is as I have stated it, and no man is able , to, say whether war will come' or. not. Although-1 have not read the cables to the House, I have given their substance. Honourable: members have read the press. Whether the press messages are censored^ or not,! I cannot say. accept tbem literally, in every particular, and regard every detail as accurate,, but, broadly, they present the"" position. As ono can see, it is an ever-changing position. One day it' seems to be resolving itself into' a peaceful solution, while at the next moment one can almost hear the roll of. the' drums of. war. We shall be in a' much better position to ' deal with thismatternext week. continue for any great length of time. That conclusion is one declared to all the world, and, therefore, requires no further corroboration from me. If the position demands it, I shall make a further statement to the House, putting the position exactly as it is. It would bealtogether wrong for me to say any more than that, because we must not anticipate trouble; But the Kemalites surely understand, or I hope they understand, what their position is, and in whatdanger they stand. Those who lead them are men of (Treat character and force. They know what nations will be arrayed there. They may believe, because, with all men, the wish is father to the thought-the y mav believe that Britain alone, will be against them ; but iu that they, are mistaken : whoever fails to stand by Britain we shall not. We desire, peace, more than we desire anything in this country, because peace is the very foundation of our future greatness. Anotherwar might bring down the temple, of our hopes in ruins to the ground. But let me speak plainly. Let.. rae say that Kemal' and his troops know the Australian soldier well enough-they have met before. I remind the Komalitos and Turks that, notwithstanding all. that haa come and gone, the Australian soldiers, and, I believe, the Australian people, are not hosMr Hughet. tile, but approach this question without bias. But the Kemalites are not to believe that Britain will stand alone. We are only a small population of 5,50O,OOOi but in the Great War we put far more troops into the field than everTurkey could maintain to-day, ancl if occasion demands, we shall do so again. With that I leave the matter, and hope Kemal will understand exactly where Australia stands. He has, as I say, met the Australian soldier before, when the odds were all. in his favour on GalliJSto doubt we"" should not poli. He met them once more in Palestine, where the fighting was'open, and' we know the result. He knows that if it comes to counting the graves on Gallipoli which number the most, they are not the graves of Australians, nor those arrayed with them. If there is to be war, we shall do our duty, but we earnestly desire peace. I make this declaration feeling certain that the majority of the people of the country are behind me. The present situation cannot I only wish to say that we are not interfering in the negotiations. It would bo futile and dangerous for the British Empire to speak with two voices. We leave .to Britain the business of conducting diplomatic negotiations. Lord Curzon has done magnificently; no-one could have acted with greater taot or more effectively, or have done more in the interest of the peace of tbe world, than, he, and I leave, with confidence, the conduct of negotiations with him and his colleagues. I only wish to say once more that if, despite everything we can do, war should come, we shall stand' with Britain. Ur.

Wo all desire peace-w e do not desire to see the Empire, or any part of the world, thrown into war if it can be avoided, and our only object is to prevent it . It appears that, though we are expected to participate in a war, if it should occur, we are not to have a voice in regard to the making of war; and that in my view is a very serious .matter. Everything should be open and above board, and I remind the House tihat some of the Dominions are given more information than is made available to us. From all I can learn the South African Parliament has had the fullest information laid before it . As I say, we have gained no more information from the statement of the right ihonorable gentleman than we have had from the press in the last week or w>. I understand that it is not the Prime Minister's intention to prorogue Parliament if theire is to be war. that. I said I would make a statement to the House, and that we would discuss the situation.

I take it that wben the right honourable gentleman receives any information .which ihe considers urgent, it will be placed before us, and thab tihere will be no despatch of troops unless the House is consulted. [117] I wish now to draw the attention of the Minister, representing the Minister for Home and Territories ( Sir Granville Ryrie), to a telegram that I have received from Darwin to-day. It is rather an urgent communication, or I should have preferred to leave it over until! next week. The telegram says that I am not going to it is reported in Darwin tlhat the Government propose to light that town w i th electricity, and that the municipality it self is already negotiating for a similar work to be carried out. I mention the matter now, because I think it just as well that the Minister should be in formed, so that he may make inquiries, and that any duplication may be avoided. The statement made by the PrimeM i nister ( Mr Hughes) is naturally a very guarded one, but the House owes its uhanks to tihe honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) for that statement, so far as it goes. I do not wish to say anything thatwill embarrass the Government, or to do anything to raiso trouble at this particular juncture. It has been, said that if war starts this Parliament should not prorogue. The Prime Minister interjected that it would dependon what kind iof a war it is. Every one who has in ally way studied world politics w ill realize that if this war starts at all it will be a very serious affair. It was I did not quite say comforting to hear the Prime Minister say officially that'. France and Italy are now standing in behind Great Britain. It should .be unnecessary to say that if there is a 'war in which Great Britain is involved, \ye stand in . There can be no doubt aboi^t that. We are not looking for war. I agree entirely with the Prime Minisier, wlhen he says tlhat what Australia needs more than anything else at the present time is peace, except that we must, in any event, uphold our national honour. Since we are, as the Prime Minister rishtly said, part of the Empire There appears to be no that has signed the Sevres Treaty, if a war starts and the British Empire is involved, we, as a part of tlhat Empire, will, However, in view of the also be involved in it . I want to say that witjhout any hesitation or equivocation whatever.
