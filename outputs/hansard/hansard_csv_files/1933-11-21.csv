64,Mr Lyons,"by leave-Anticipatin gcoming within the range of its investigations. Simultaneously with the commencement of the public inquiry, the commission considered that its work would be considerably expedited if the companies concerned were supplied with a questionnaire seeking information regarding their activities in the importation, refining, treatment, distribution, and sale of the various products of mineral oils dealt with by them. The questionnaire covered nine main elements of the industry, and embraced over 100 specific questions in relation to such elements. It was realized that, as the questionnaire was designed to elicit information concerning the business of the companies since 1927, a period of five years, some time would be occupied in preparing the answers for the commission, especially in view of the number of products concerned, including crude oil, petrol, kerosene, fuel oil, and lubricating oils. The companies having x^ointed out at the public sittings of complete statement of the accounts that the commission in Melbourne and Sydney that a considerable amount of work would be involved, it was arranged for Mr A. J. Hancock, the accountant member of the commission, to make contact with the various companies and reconcile the questions with the form of business and accountancy methods adopted by each company, in order to secure the maximum of information as expeditiously as possible without undue labour on the part of the companies. This having been done, the work has been proceeding since the commission ended its last public sittings in Sydney on the 4th July. A progressive check of the answers and details supplied! by the companies is being made by qualified officers of the Development Branch of the Prime Minister's Department, under the direction of Mr Hancock. When the information from all the companies has been collated, the commission will hold a meeting to deal with the accounts and determine what further evidence is necessary, on the part of either the companies or the consumers, or other persons interested, in order to become fully acquainted with the whole of the ramifications of the industry. In view of the variations in the price , of petrol and other constituents of mineral oils sold in Australia during recent years, the commission considered it necessary to cover a period of five years in connection with the investigation of the accounts of the companies. The volume of work involved in going back five years has also been considerably increased by the fact that the whole of the distribution and sale of petrol and other products in Australia, and the accounts relative thereto, are controlled by companies located in Melbourne and Sydney. While, therefore, the accounts investigational work of the commission is at present being carried on only in the cities where the companies are established, such work will traverse . the whole business in mineral oils, petrol, and other products of mineral oils throughout the Commonwealth, including price differentials in country districts and in the various States. As already intimated, the future activities of the commission will be determined as soon as it has before it the are. now being compiled. Meanwhile, any persons who desire to submit evidence to the commission are invited to communicate with the Secretary, Royal Commission on Petrol, .Commonwealth Offices, Treasury Gardens, Melbourne. I have received from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The intention of the Government to go into a long recess without having formulated a comprehensive plan to provide employment for the workless."" Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion, move That the House do now adjourn.

65,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. H. Mackay).,,18,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment
66,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [3.36],"IOpportunity to ask honourable members to express their Opinions on the important matter of unemployment before the Government isallowed to go into a long recess without having made a sincere attempt to grapple with the position. I do not Bay that tbe Government has done nothing, but I do say that it has not taken adequate steps to deal ""with this important problem. It should not be necessary to stress the unfortunate position of the unemployed in Australia. If I were to describe it in detail I should probably be accused Of playing to the gallery, Or resorting to "" sob stuff,"" to employ a phrase I have heard used in this connection in this chamber. On previous occasions, when my colleagues and I have drawn attention to this matter, we have been accused of doing so merely for political motives. Such accusations are easily made, but they do not answer the vital question "" What has been done ?"" In May of last year, not many months after the Government was elected on the very definite promise that the unemployment problem would be practically solved if there was a change of government, a bill was introduced to provide relief for the unemployed. were very pleased to see that measure. It indicated an earnest desire on the part of the Government to deal with the problem. It provided that the Commonwealth should make available £1,800,000 and the States £1,200,000 for special relief. On that occasion the Prime Minister( Mr four years of depression, one expeets the Lyons) declared that the bill was intended to provide merely temporary relief during the winter months; and that it did not -represent a solution of the problem, but that a Premiers Conference was to be held at which the whole matter would be dealt with and a permanent plan evolved. As the result of a discussion upon a motion which I subsequently moved for the adjournment' of the House, the Prime Minister agreed to convene that conference earlier than was originally intended. The conference was held"", but I am sorry to say that we have not yet seen the long-range plan that was to emanate from it. The House remained in session while the Prime Minister prepared for and attended that conference, and, in his absence, the then right honourable member for Flinders Mr Scullin. Bruce), stated on the 24th of May, 1932, on behalf of the GovernmentI t is sincerely hoped that there will be evolved schemes of a truly reproductive character which will lead to the permanent absorption of our unemployed. That deliberate statement which referred to the proceedings of the Premiers Conference greatly impressed me, and honourable members on both sides of the House, some of them rising in their places and saying that they were looking forward with confidence to the formulation at that conference by the seven governments of a long-range policy to deal permanently with unemployment. We are still awaiting the appearance of that long-range policy. We are still awaiting even the beginning. Surely no one says that we ought to drift on, merely patching up the situation from year to year. It is idle to point to slight improvements that have been recorded in the unemployment situation, or to quote statistics showing that the percentage of registered uuemployed has declined. All such statistics disregard the boys and girls leaving school every year who, because they have never been registered on the books of any trade union, are not inHonorable members cluded in statistical returns. It is true that one can point to some greater activity in certain trades, such as the building trade, which is said to be indicative of the country's prosperity; but such improvement contributes little or nothing to a real solution of the problem. After public to settle down, to get used to the conditions, as it were, and to throw off the panic that beset them during the early stages of the depression. That, so far as I can see, is all tliat has happened in the last two years to bring about some slight improvement in the position. Figures have been quoted to show that there are fewer men on the sustenance roll, but the transference of thousands of unemployed from sustenance to work for sustenance is not a solution, or even an attempt at one. It may give an .appearance of activity,but it does not make any substantial. contribution towards the solution of the problem. This Government, unlike its predecessors, has a large majority in both Houses of Parliament. It is in a position to deal ( Mr firmly with the position, instead of allowing the present drift to continue. regret to say that the Government appears to be letting matters drift in the hope that time will improve the situation, believing that, as in past crises, we shall get down to the bottom, and then things will begin to improve again more or less of their own accord. This depression is so severe and so far-reaching, however, that, if we merely sit down and wait for things to improve, a big section of our population will be subjected to acute suffering for many years to come. How long, I ask, will the unemployed remain quiet? How long will they be content to wait passively for an improvement? The unemployed were assured again and again that bold, aggressive action would be taken to put into operation a long range plan to deal permanently with the position, hut the only notable activity displayed by this Government has been in the direction of attacking the tariff. That was a destructive policy; there has been no attempt to formulate a constructive one. I admit that the solution is not means as simple as the Prime Minister made it appear when he was seeking the suffrages of the people at the last election. At that time he said that it was only necessary to change the Government, which proved to be a simple process as it happened. However, while the task is not simple, it is possible of accomplishment by bold and consistent efforts. I do not wish to be hypercritical, or to indulge in political recriminations; rather do I desire to be helpful, and to offer constructive criticism. A sound plan must be evolved for unified effort by Commonwealth and State authorities, municipalities and other public bodies, as well as hy private enterprise, if we are to cope with tbe unemployment problem. In 1931, a plan was placed before Parliament to balance budgets, and it inoluded provisions for the re-employment of our workless people, as well as for other recovery measures. A comprehensive public works programme was outlined, and a tariff policy laid down for the protection and development of Australian industries. The manufacturers of Australia were given the markets of Australia which, I am afraid, they are I beginning to lose because of the alteration of tariff duties. The export industries of Australia received a substantial subsidy by the maintenance of the exchange rate at 25 per cent. Had it not been for the deliberate policy agreed upon at that time, the exchange rate would have fallen. In addition to the assistance afforded to the exporting industries by the exchange, direct subsidies were paid to certain rural 'exporting industries. The Commonwealth Government has certain powers in regard to banking, and it also occupies a strong position on the Loan Council. It has a strong working majority in both Houses of Parliament, and it can, in co-operation with the State Governments, push on with many undertakings that would be useful to the community, and could be carried out more cheaply to-day, because of lower wages, and lower costs of material, than would have been the case some years ago. I have sometimes been taken to task for dealing in generalities, but I have simple. It is not by any previously stated in detail the public works which might, with advantage, be undertaken for the relief of unemployment. As a matter of fact, a list was prepared three years ago, to which I invite the attention of honourable members. If money could have been found at that time, the works could have been put in hand, 'but there was no possibility of obtaining money except by means of a scheme which we put forward, and which was rejected by the banks, and, later, by the Senate. To begin with, the Government might press on with the water conservation scheme on the Murray River, which should be completed without delay. Then there is the work of unifying the railway gauges throughout Australia. I suggest that, to begin with, that section between Port Augusta and Adelaide might be put in hand. The work, when completed, would form a link in the entire scheme, and the money would not he wasted. There is also certain ballasting work to be done on the EastWest railway. Other works coming under the control of State and local authorities include the clearing and improvement of Crown lands in order to make provision for future development and production. There is also afforestation, a work which, so far, has been merely nibbled at. Other men might be employed on the construction of roads to act as feeders to the railwork is scarce, that is the time for goways, aud not as their competitors, as unfortunately too many roads are to-day. Those are all necessary and useful works, which might be undertaken during a time of depression. I suggest that the Commonwealth might follow the lead of the federal authorities in the United States of America, who, I understand, subsidize special work by local bodies to the extent' of 30 per cent, of their expenditure on relief works. leave the whole task to the State Governments and local governing bodies, as the tendency is at the present time. Of course some people say that, if public works are undertaken for the relief of unemployment, the men, when tlie work is finished, will be dismissed, and their second condition will be worse than their first. I do not agree with that. Their condition will be better even if they are put off when the work is completed; but, if the various schemes are properly coordinated, there need be no general unemployment following the completion of various sections. The work can be so spread that practically the same number of men are employed all the time, even if they are not the same men. I do not say that the establishment of public works is the only means of relieving unemployment. It is a start, certainly, but the plan should also include the protection and development of private industries. The benefits of a progressive public works policy would be an increase of employment. benefit from the value of the works constructed. There would be a substantial saving to the States in connection with sustenance costs, and. the increase of the purchasing powtfr would start an upward price movement, thus stimulating buying and production. As honourable members know, the depression was accentuated by the arrest of purchasing on account of falling incomes. The moment there was an upward trend, an impetus would be given to buying, and that would stimulate production, which, in turn, would increase employment. This was the comprehensive plan foreshadowed in 1931 by my Government. It could by now have been developed along practical lines, with certain benefits to Mr Scullin. the nation and to destitute workers. When vernmental activity. The result of the flotation of the recent loan of £10,000,000 proves that money is plentiful, and that in the circumstances, the interest rate offered was rather generous. Millions of pounds which are lying idle in the banks to-day could be obtained at low rates of interest. I suggest the exploitation by the Government of the practice of an open bill market, which is in We should not operation in Great Britain to-day. Too much emphasis is laid on the evil of short-dated loans. A large proportion of the debt of Great Britain, and of the money spent on works, is represented by short-dated treasury-bills. I can see no virtue whatever in the redemption of treasury-bills to the extent of one-half of the amount of the recent loan. If that £5,000,000 has been subscribed by the public, so much less will be available for other investments, and the result will be deflation. If , on the other hand, it has been subscribed by the banks, they are merely exchanging 2£ per cent, treasury-bills for 3-} per cent, bonds, and that paper transaction will cost the Governments of Australia an additional £50,000 a year in interest. I have often been asked, "" What was done by your Government?"" My Government operated to the limit of its financial capacity. Certain of its proposals were rejected by a hostile Senate, and unsympathetic banking institutions. Tlie communilty would But let me answer the question specifically. Approximate figures, which have been supplied to me by the Treasury officials, show that in 1930-31-the only full year which the last Government had, but the worse financial period Australia has ever experienced-the provision of unemployment, including assistance to the States, amounted to £3,170,000; whereas in 1932-33, the present Government's only f u l l year, the provision amounted to £2,200,000. I know that this year's Estimates for the Commonwealth and the States provide for an increased appropriation. I point out, however, that n large amount of it is represented by moneys that were unexpended by the States last year. But even so, the provision is not sufficient to meet the needs of tbe case. Many attempts have been made by the Labour party, and by the Opposition generally, to induce the Government to formulate a bold, progressive and permanent policy. This is a further effort to rouse Ministers from their lethargy. The Commonwealth Parliament will shortly adjourn, and it . is understood that the ensuing recess will be a long one. Are honourable members content to allow the adjournment to takG place without having expressed a definite opinion on this important subject; or will they demand the formulation, if not before the adjournment at least early in the new year, for tlie consideration of this Parliament, of a bold, progressive policy for a permanent attack on the unemployment evil? -The adjournment of the House could Ministers endeavour to do when answernot be moved for the discussion of a more ing questions. important subject than that of unemployment, because the dark shadow of it overhangs the whole of the Commonof the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), that the wealth, and affect3, to some extent, every present practice of the State Gohome within its borders.

Those honourable members who are able to return to their homes every week-end see, even at their doorsteps, the spectacle of destitution, and the weeping of women because of the distress and poverty that afflict them in their homes.

Private enterprise has always argued that the reduction of wages and the lengthening of working hours would have tha desired effect. That was the argument advanced .by bankers and political parties who are opposed to us, about three years ago, when the 10 per cent, cut in real wages was made, yet the result of that cut has been to accentuate the problem, thus proving that such an argument is fallacious. The Government will probably say that a certain amount is included in the Estimates for the purpose of dealing with unemployment. It may be contended that the expenditure of £180,000 on the laying of a submarine cable between Tasmania and the mainland will provide employment. I think, however, it will be found that much of the geai will be imported, and that the work will not be more than sufficient to keep in employment those who are now associated with the Postal Department. The same may be said of the proposal to build a sloop. There is no guarantee that this work will be carried out at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. It is suggested that tenders will be called; times been suggested in this House. We but we do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to have the sloop constructed in Australia.

About a fortnight ago, honourable members on this side of the chamber and hill) the desirability of having this important meeting of Premiers and the Loan Council, that was then about to be held. AlthoughI have no wish to leave the decision to another body, I have learned from my experience in this House that policies determined by Premiers conferencesand the Loan Council have to be accepted, and must not be varied in any direction no matter what views the Mr Beasley. Opposition may hold. I therefore considered it advisable to urge thar something more than already had been done should be undertaken. During the last I thought that the approach of the festive season might soften the hearts of those who are in authority, and who could deal adequately with the matter if they were prepared to depart from orthodox methods. Continuity of employment prior to Christmas ought to be provided for those who are so unfortunate as to be out of work. We thought that at least, the Government could provide work for the unemployed between this and Christmas so as to give them some little pleasure and happiness to which, it cannot be denied, they are entitled. No parliament is worth its salt, and no nation is worthy of being called a nation, unless it can adequately provide for its workless people. * I wish to join in the appeal for the formation of a comprehensive policy in regard to unemployment before the House adjourns for several months, and my appeal is quite different from that of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), or that of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley). I do not believe that a lavish expenditure of public moneys would be in accordance with a long-range policy for the provision of employment, such as has at various should, however, institute immediately a policy to provide for a certain section of the community which undoubtedly depathy. I refer to the young men of the community, between the ages of 18 and 24, many of whom have not yet had an opportunity to work. I suggest that the ComI urged upon the Acting monwealth should join with the States in establishing voluntary training camps at which some of these young men could be subject discussed at the trained until employment could be found for them in other avenues, such as afforestation. We should make every endeavour to provide work for them in the crucial years of their life. It has been suggested that this Parliament is primarily responsible for the relief of unemployment, but it must be admitted that the great bulk of the work in this country has always been found by the States, and the Com-",22,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment

75,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [4.6],"mou wealth's responsibility is to subsidize tbe States in respect of some of its development, settlement and relief schemes. Of course, the Commonwealth is responsible for the relief of the unemployed within its own territories. The most comprehensive method of providing some permanence of employment is to give immediate relief from taxation, both direct and indirect. Despite the sneers of honourable members opposite at private enterprise, the fact remains that 90 per cent, of employment in this country comes from that source. If we provide relief by employing men on unproductive public works, we shall only add to our interest and taxation burdens, and thus postpone still further the day when we shall be able to l if t the burden of unemployment from tbe community. It has been said that no great alleviation of unemployment has taken place, but I suggest that there has been a definite allevianot re-started operations to any satistion of the position during the last eighteen months, because the unemployment figures have fallen from 30 per cent, to 25 per cent. That ia a substantial diminution, and I am satisfied that it would have been greater had the Government instituted a more comprehensive scheme of taxation from indirect taxation by means of the tariff; because it is the high, tariff which has tended to widen the gap between the price of farm goods and that of industrial goods, and to prevent the free exchange of those commodities. After all, the maladjustment of prices is really the main cause of unemployment in this country. The high tariff prevents imports from being brought into Australia in any volume, and there is no doubt that imports of goods are absolutely essential to the full employment of the people. Many consider that imports are unnecessary, and should be debarred altogether, but our imports are really the payment for our exports, and there is no doubt that imports of partly manufactured and raw materials for our own manufactures provide a great deal of employment here. I hope that the Government will, before Parliament goes into recess, make provision for the relief of unemployment by bringing about a further reduction of taxation, and especially indirect taxation, because I am satisfied that the investment of capital in private enterprise is the best method of providing employment. A loan of £10,000,000 has just been subscribed in two days, and that fact undoubtedly testifies to the confidence of the people in the governmental institutions of this country. much confidence in industry. it would be a good thing for the community generally if more money were being invested in industry and private enterprise. It is well known that owing to the tariff policy of Australia, many industries which were notoriously unstable have been encouraged. For instance, the machinery industry, soon after the depression began, was unable to give employment to almost half of its employees, and, up ito date, has factory extent. It seems to me thatsuch industries might be carefully scrutinized with a view to relieving them of their burdens so that they may once more give employment to some of our people. If the free exchange of goods were encouraged and the purchasing power of relief, particularly relief wages increased there would be nothing to prevent the establishment of a long range policy for the relief of the unemployed. ter and Treasurer) [4.13] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), when introducing the subject of unemployment, said that he was under the impression that Parliament was likely to adjourn for a long recess. I assure him that the Parliament, if it remains under the control of this Government, will adjourn only so long as is necessary, and will meet when required in order to deal with urgent public business. There is no definite intention to adjourn the Parliament for any fixed period, and if urgent business arises it will be the duty of the Parliament to attend to it. There is, therefore, no justification for honourable members to assume that there will be a long recess.

Every country in the world has tried all sorts of schemes for the removal of the evil of unemployment, but only four or five countries, including Australia, have shown any improvement in the position.

In the second quarter of 1932 the percentage figure was, roughly, 30, and in the third quarter of 1933 it was 25.

It is true that some public works could be put in hand, and it is also true that a larger amount than £10,000,000 could be raised at present for public works. But we have to remember the important and adverse effects that heavy public borrowing for public works has had in Australia in years gone by. That policy has, undoubtedly, contributed to the financial and economic difficulties through which we are now passing. It is all very well to say that we should borrow every penny available for public works; but we must look to the future. It is suggested that we should pursue the policy of borrow and borrow again, and so load up our interest burden, and consequently our taxation burden, until we reach the point of depression that we have so recently touched? Surely no honourable member desires that the country should slip back to the conditions of two or three years ago! If we borrow money ancl put public works in hand, employment would be given to some thousands of men for the time being; but when the works were completed the men would again be on the unemployment market.

88,Mr Lyons,"I am making a comThe practicability of putting in hand the works referred to by the Leader of the Opposition has been surveyed by the Government. In 1932-33 the amount made available from revenue by this Government for public works was £87.0,000. The amount made available from this source this year is £1,600,000. The honourable member for ""West Sydney( Mr unemployment by spending money on Beasley) has said that this will not completely absorb the unemployed, and I admit if , but it is not within the capacity of the Government to provide work for all the unemployed. In addition to the £1,600,000 that I have just mentioned, we are, this year, providing £1,200,000 from loan for public works and for financial assistance to the States in the relief of unemployment. Nothing was provided from this source for public works last year. that some of this money may go in the purchase of materials from overseas, but, as against that, I remind honourable gentlemen that the increased expenditure in government departments this year, apart altogether from the amount accounted for by the partial restoration of salaries, is roughly, £600,000, the bulk attention to the following comparison of of which will be spent in providing employment. It is quite just, therefore, to say that, as against, an amount of £2,220,000 found last year by this Government, an amount of £2,800,000 is being provided this year. This is apart from the additional departmental expenditure of £600,000, to which I have just referred. But I repeat that the Government cannot pursue an unlimited borrowing policy to provide money for the relief of unemployment. Let me indicate to honourable members the position of Great Britain. 16th February a censure motion was moved in the House of Commons in regard to unemployment and kindred matters, and in speaking to it the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Imperial Government was satisfied that the expenditure of loan moneys upon public works was not a solution of the unemployment problem. The Government had ascertained that between April, 1924, and September, 1931, £700,000,000 had been expended on works, including £450,000,000 oil housing; £120,000,000 on unemployment grants, £90,000.000 on roads, and £40,000,000 on miscellaneous Mr Lyons. works;, but in spite of this expenditure unemployment figures had increased during the period from 1,850,000. to 2,800,000. dictment of the whole system! the argument that governments can cure public works. The Government is doing as much as it possibly can in this direction. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the ballasting of the. EastWest railway could be put in hand. This has already been considered by the Government, which called into consultation the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. That gentleman gave an assurance that every penny that could be efficiently and adequately spent on that It is true work was now being expended upon it. The Government must, of necessity, be guided in such a matter as that by its expert officers.. In order that honourable members may be assured that everything possible is being done by both Commonwealth and State Governments to pursue an effective public works policy, I direct the amounts of money provided in the last four years for this purpose, taking into account loan expenditure, expenditure on relief, and expenditure from revenue by Oommonwealth and State Governments alike. The figures are as follows:£ 1930-31 .. 26,900,000 1931-32 .. 23,000,000 1932-33 .. 25,050,000 1933-34 .. 31,700,000 gentleman is comparing estimates with On the actual expenditure. amount made available in the respective years. carry-over has not been indicated.

The speech of the Prime Minister( MrI endorse the remarks of the Leader Lyons) has shown once more that the unemployed people of Australia have very little reason to hope for much assistance from this Government. The Government still insists that it is only tlirough private enterprise that the unfortunate unemployed can hope for succour, and that it is only by the remission of taxation that money can be made available for private employers to increase the amount of work available. This Goverument has remitted taxes to the amount of £7,500,000, chiefly to wealthy classes in the community, but so far I have not been able to see any 'beneficial effect in the relief of unemployment. Time'and time again, figures have been quoted by honourable members who support the Government, and to-day they have been used by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) to show that there has been a reduction of 5 per cent, in unemployment since this Government assumed office. It would be as well to place on record the unemployment figures for the quarters of 1931, 1932, and the first two quarters of 1933. They are as follows :Per cent. urnIst quarter .. .. 25.28 2nd quarter :trd quarter 4 th quarter 19321st quarter .. 28.3 2nd quarter 3rd quarter 4th quarter 1933] st quarter .. 26.5 2nd quarter 3rd quarter 4tli quarter Those statistics prove that from the time the Scullin Government left office, when the figure was 28 per cent., the decrease due to the so-called beneficent works policy of this Government has been only 3 per cent. I claim that the Scullin Go[109] vernment did reduce unemployment appreciably, and that the subsequent policy of this Government arrested what would otherwise have been a perceptible and continued fall in the figures. Tbe repercussion of the tariff-slashing policy of the Government has yet to be felt; it can have only one effect, that of increasing unemployment. of the Opposition (M.r. Scullin) and the leader of the corner group ( Mr Beasley). In common with other honourable members, I have on previous occasions dealt with the position of unemployment generally. I shall now refer to it in specific terms. The Prime Minister spoke of the money that his Government has expended on unemployment. It may interest honourable members to learn that the total falls short by £1,000,000 of the sum spent by the Scullin. Government for a similar purpose. The right honourable gentleman declared that as the country must depend upon private enterprise to relieve unemployment, the burden of taxation has been lessened in the hope that the problem will be eased. Private enterprise will not increase its employment by one unit unless a market is found for its products, and members of the Labour party submit, that the only way to create a demand for those products is for all governments to spend large sums of money on public works. The Prime Minister would have honourable members believe that private enterprise and State Governments alone can provide avenues to reduce unemployment.

In reply to .. .. speeches and questions made by me during the last few months, I have been told that the Government was going to increase the ratio of employment in this Territory. For the first six months after it assumed office, all that it did was to provide work which gave those concerned",27,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment
95,Mr Speaker,The right honor,28,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment
96,Mr Blakeley (Darling),"[4.33]an income approximating what they would have received had they been on the dole. His Excellency the Governor General informed the unemployed in the Federal Capital Territory that the ratio ofwork was to be increased from one week in three to one week in two for married men, and from one week in five to one week in four for single men. That can be accepted as an expression of Government policy, as His Excellency must have received the information from the Minister for the Interior. I have been told that the unemployed could rest assured that every one of them would be given employment prior to Christmas. In the Canberra Times of Saturday the l l t h November, the Minister for the Interior is reported to have said that in previous years there was always a rush at Christmas to get certain work completed, but that this year there would be no special rush. "" He would not "", he said, "" promise them constant work, but they could rest assured that the work would be more continuous than in previous years, and they would fare better for the rest of the finanments; and unemployment is the result cial year."" I assure honourable members that there has been no rush, and that the promise made through the medium of His Excellency the Governor General has not been fulfilled. While the Minister might justifiably claim that a few men have benefited, the majority of those 800 are now in no better position than they were when this Government began to put its unemployment relief policy into operation.

If the amount then received does not equal the dole, these men are given an order to bring their income up to what it would have been if they were on the dole. In his reply to the unemployed, His Excellency the Governor General said that certain periods of the year ber has exhausted his time. General) [4.44] -The problem of unemployment is perhaps the most serious that exists in the world to-day. Unfortunately, it is not peculiar to Australia, but exists in all countries. It is in the first instance a human problem-perhap s the most profoundly human problem that exists-bu t it depends upon economic factors more than upon anything else. Unemployment, however, is not a specific, separate fact, for which it is possible to devise a specific remedy as in the case of a human being. While there may be a specific remedy for the man who cuts a finger or breaks a leg, there is more difficulty in treating the man suffering from general debility and wasting. Unemployment in the social organization is like the man suffering from general debility; there is no obvious cure for its removal. It is possible to pass an act of Parliament saying "" Let everybody be employed "" ; but that accomplishes nothing. Employment is provided by work given by the industries of the countiy, added to, to some extent, by work given by governof the preseut failing and weak condition of many industries. If industry generally were healthy, there would be no occasion to demand assistance from governmental sources. Accordingly, we find that in the case of some industries unemployment is the result of specific causes particularly associated with those industries; in the case of other industries it is, to-day, a result of general world conditions. Some industries are producing commodities in excess of the effective demand, which in that sense, are not wanted, but in another sense, are badly wanted. Consider, for example, what cannot' be regarded as unemployment, but what is the rural analogue to urban unemployThere we have the result of many concurring conditions. We have the storage of wheat, designed for the purpose of raising prices; we have seen the resentment that has been caused by the action of countries to raise prices, which has been intensified by the national development of cereal-growing in Europe, coupled with the exclusion of the cereal products of other countries. We have also noted the wild speculation in wheat that has taken place in the United States",28,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment

These have all resulted in uncertainty as to the future, and the complete analogy between unemployment in the wheat industry and urban unemployment. of the wheat-growers to make a living corresponds economically with the failure of the man in the city to obtain employment. meut"" may fairly be used as a term to explain all the inability of various industries to provide useful productive and supporting occupations for mankind. ""World troubles are largely responsible for unemployment to-day; no single government has found a remedy, and the recent World Economic Conference has, unfortunately, shown that it is beyond the capacity of all governments combined to provide a ready remedy. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr ment had been given to about 2,000 men Scullin) has admitted frankly enough that sustenance and work for sustenance are not a solution of the unemployed problem. Neither is the payment of unemployment relief a solution. These and measures for the relief of human distress do not even begin to solve the unemployment problem. When comparisons are made between the amount expended in various years by Commonwealth ancl other governments for the purpose of alleviating unemployment, I admit that I view with mixed feelings any claim that an increase in that expenditure is anything for which to be thankful. Surely we all know that when it is possible consistently with humanity to reduce these amounts, we shall be more certain that things are improving in our own country. If it . were possible to abolish the payments altogether, that would be a mark of complete recovery. The right honourable gentleman recommended a policy of expenditure on public works. As the Prime Minister( Mr unemployment, including the unification Lyons) has said, part of the unemployment trouble is due to the public works policy pursued by government's of Australia in the past. I shall mention only two causes for this. It is unfortunately the case that a government very often gets the worse possible value for its money. It is unfortunate, but that is the position. Owing to the necessity for maintaining a system of checks not required in private industry, administration expenses are unduly high. Moreover, large programmes of public works undoubtedly .bring about an undue proportion of unskilled labour. Even in Canberra, it The failure has been found necessary, in some cases, actually to bring in skilled men from outside the Territory, while hundreds of unskilled men have only relief work to do. "" TJnemployExperience has shown that what may be described as a vigorous policy of public works cannot possibly be a cure for unemployment. Speaking at the World Economic Conference in London some time ago, Mr Runciman, president of"" the Board of Trade, saidThe, United Kingdom Government considered that nothing would be gained at present by developing public works policy. It had devoted about 100 millions to various schemes (presumably since the crisis) and had found tliat for every £1,000,000 so utilized, employdirectly, and 2,000 men indirectly. The method was, therefore, very expensive and the Government did not intend to repeat the experiment. It had terminated its own schemes. In Australia, where wages are higher and materials more costly, the number of men employed per million pounds would be less. In order to absorb 50,000 men in public works, it would .be necessary to spend about £20,000,000 a year. We can do far better by relieving private enterprise of some of the burdens which beset it, so that it may provide employment. It can do so much more effectively than can the Government. If an attempt were made to raise a sum of money sufficiently large to provide employment on the scale mentioned, taxation would have to be so increased as to imperil the financial stability of the country upon which, in the last resource, the chances of a general restoration really depend. I have for years heard of public works which might. be inaugurated for the relief of of the railway gauges and water conservation schemes, although there seems to be no clear idea what is to be done with the produce to be raised on the irrigated land. One must hesitate at this time before embarking upon any large scheme of public works. We must aim at a policy that will restore industry to activity with a chance of profit, and that is being done by degrees in Australia. The' process can only be gradual, but all the evidence shcrws that it is in operation. In regard to the tariff, for instance, the Government has increased some duties for the purpose of assisting in establishing industries, and those increases are contributing to the solution of the unemployment problem. industries duties have been reduced with the object of assisting industries generally. Those reductions have not injured any industry to which they have been directly applied, and they have helped many other industries. We hear much about the primary industries, and we grant bounties and subsidies to assist them. No one has yet evolved a considered scheme for the reorganization of primary industry, and it may be that that problem has to be approached if the cloud does not lift . Large remissions of taxation have been made, and they will help employment much more effectively than would be the case if the volume of taxation were maintained, and the revenue so obtained devoted to the relief of unemployment. member's time has expired. not so optimistic as to think that the Government will discover a solution of the unemployment problem, particularly in view of the policy it seems determined to follow. I recognize that, in order to cure the trouble*, we must deal with the banking institutions which really govern the country. I feel, however, that the Government, in view of its promises at the elections to provide jobs for those who voted for it, should make some effort to relieve the suffering of those out of work. The fact is that the Government has shown no sympathy whatever with the unemployed. The Attorney-General( Mr to promote Australian industry, why not Latham) said just now that it was sometimes found necessary to bring men from outside the Federal Capital Territory to fill skilled positions. We vividly recoltrict people are losing the homes which lect that the present Government actually ejected unemployed men from No. 4 Camp in the Territory, and threatened to prosecute them if they did not get over the border. The Government was not even prepared to give the men shelter, let alone food, because it claimed that the State Government should undertake the responsibility. I claim that it is the responsibility of all governments, whether Federal or State, to see that their citizens are fed. There is plenty of developmental work to be done in Australia, and this work, 1 if undertaken, would prove reproductive In the case of other not only in the sense of paying interest on the money spent, but also in the more valuable sense of enabling a larger population to be carried. This is true of water conservation schemes, and I suggest that the work might be financed in. the same way as the war was financed. In the case of the war, action was taken to meet what was described as a national emergency, but when we suggest that the same thing be done now, honourable members on the other side seek to frighten the people by saying that we advocate inflation. The present Government is not doing anything to assist the coal-mining industry, which is slowly perishing. The Attorney General once said in this House that the industry had cut its own throat. I do not agree with him, but even if it were true, we are not justified in standing by, watching it bleed to death. As a honourable matter of fact, the trouble in the coal industry has been caused neither by the employers nor by the employees, but by the march of science which has resulted in coal being superseded by other sources of power. It has been proved that we can produce petrol and other oils from Australian coal, but the Goverument says "" Wait and see what is being done overseas."" The State Governmeut in New South Wales advanced £5,000 to the Lyons Brothers to enable them to exploit their process for extracting oil from coal, and they proved that they could produce oil in commercial quantities. If the Commonwealth Government is sincere in its desire take steps to have oil produced from coal in a large way? Why wait while mine after mine is closing down ? In my disthey have occupied for years because they cannot get work. They are wandering about with worn, haggard faces, getting deeper and deeper into debt, and with nothing before them but despair. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) says that he will not continue the policy of borrowing. What, then, does he propose to do? Will",29,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment
101,Mr Speaker,The,31,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment
102,Mr James (Hunter) [4.57],"I amlie allow the people to starve? I have lived for years now in the midst of privation. Ever since I came into this Parliament, the coal industry has been going back. Only a fortnight ago two of the largest mines in my district closed down, and there are now 7,500 coal-miners idle. The Prime Minister said "" Follow England "", but the British Government is paying a bounty of 4d. a gallon on petrol produced from coal. The Commonwealth Government says that we should encourage private enterprise, but why does it not make private enterprise an offer? I believe that private capital would be prepared to exploit the industry if it Avere granted favorable terms. One firm has already purchased Mosquito Island, at Newcastle, for the purpose of erecting plant for the extraction of oil by the hydrogenation process. The Commonwealth Government, however, is doing nothing whatever to help, except by remitting taxation in the hope that the provide additional employment. to the present our experience has shown that we have little to hope for in that direction. It is all very well to say that the perprovision of Avork in the Federal Capital centage of unemployment has been reduced, but the fact is that there has been little if any reduction. When the figures are compiled, those working for sustenance are shown as in employment, but that is merely misleading. On the coal-fields there are 5,000 youths between the ages of fourteen and 22 who have never done a day's work. I have four sons between fourteen and 22 years of age, only one of whom has been able to obtain employment. He is not engaged in industry, but, having been fortunate enough to win a scholarship which entitled him to go to the University, he was able to get a position as a school teacher. Lacking that piece of good fortune, he would be the same as thousands of others, Avithout employment, and Avithout any prospects of obtaining it. At the present time, we frequently witness the distressing spectacle of young men and women getting married with nothing to live on but the dole. Coal mining is a primary industry, so why should not the Government encourage it to supply onr own requirements of petrol, instead of sending millions of pounds every year to the United States of America? The money so spent might Avell be devoted to providing employment for our own people. ter for the Interior) [5.4] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) mentioned certain works which might be carried out on the East-West railway, and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), in reply, said that the Government was at present doing everything that could be done in that direction. The ballasting of that line commenced when it Avas opened in 1917, and was continued up to the beginning of the depression in 1929. This year's provision for the purpose is £50,000, which the authorities say is as much as they can comfortably expend. Employment Avill be prOAdded for 120 men, and by the time the vote is exhausted, 644 miles of track will have been ballasted. Although the taxpayers who benefit may work Avill have to be continued for a year Up or two, no more than 120 men can be engaged upon it. I wish to reply particularly to the remarks of the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), concerning the Territory. It is surprising that that honourable member should attack the Government in this connection, because he, as Minister for tbe Interior, was confronted Avith conditions that Avere practically identical with those that exist to-day, aud he merely secured the establishment of an advisory committee, which invited the citizens of Canberra to contribute to an unemployment, fund that would be subsidized by the Government on a £1 for £1 basis. The amount thusmade available for the relief of unemployment was only about one-half of Avhat is being spent to-day. In -reply to a question this afternoon, I pointed out that this Government is, and future governments will be, confronted with the problem of unskilled labour. At the beginning of the financial year, the promise Avas made that married men would be given one week's Avork in three, and single men one Aveek's work in five. A. few months ago, in reply to a petition presented to him by the unemployed, His Excellency the Governor General pointed out that the Government had improved",31,Unemployment Format Motion For Adjournment

Figures that have been supplied to me this afternoon show that those ment of unskilled workers on house conwho are registered as unemployed in Canstruction, and the purpose behind the berra number 741. In 1927, when all Canberra works were in full swing, employment was provided for 3,000 persons. In 1929, when these works began to close clown, there was a bigexodus of men from the Federal Capital Territory, with the result that the honourable member for Darling had to make provision for only about 400 unemployed. New South Wale3 and the other States also found themselves confronted with the problem of unemployment, and when the dole system was introduced the Commonwealth was asked to look after its own people; consequently, the exodus from the Territory ceased and those who remained here had to be given either sustenance or employment. As I pointed out this afternoon, the streets, roads, bridges, sewage, electric light and water supply services are practically completed. the way of levelling to be done, and the planting of further trees would add to the expense of maintenance. Already the expenditure on Canberra amounts to £13,000,000. If unskilled worker's were kept fully engaged on unreproductive works, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth would be called upon to find a substantial sum for the maintenance of this city. ployed in the Federal Capital Territory has increased since the Scullin Government went out of office. tinue to increase if the Scullin GovernOpposition ( Mr Scullin) in making ment returned to office. I hardlylike defending the Government in such a matter, because I know it is pitiable to see men unable to procure work; but we have to act within i-eason, and I do not think that the Commonwealth can afford to provide continuous employment at weed chipping and other similar unremuneraAlthough not so laudable tive work.

In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 17 th November (vide page 4749). Proposed vote, £3,522,820. I desire to deal with two matters in connection with the vote for civil aviation, the first of which concerns the overseas air mail service from Great Britain which will come from Darwin to Camooweal, and thence to Charleville, Bourke and Cootamundra, with branch lines to Brisbane, and down the north-western coast of Western Australia. I bring before the notice of the Assistant Minister( Mr diately to call for reports in connection' Francis) the great service which would with the provision of emergency landing he rendered to the community if another groiuids along the route from Charlebranch line were inaugurated from Bourke to Wilcannia., and thence to BrokeuH ill and South Australia, including a service to Mildura. Under the present scheme Brisbane and Sydney, will be served exceptionally well, and it is but fair to ask that the people of South Australia aud Victoria, should also benefit from the advantages connected with this splendid service. Really, I do not see how the Government can deny them that advantage, for it should do all that is humanly possible to extend the benefits of this modern method of transportation and communication to the citizens of Australia generally. It. is therefore important that the Assistant Minister for Defence should make the necessary alterations in the tenders before they close. There will, necessarily, be a certain expenditure of money to provide emergency landing grounds in addition to those which already exist on the route followed by Qantas. Particularly will they be needed in New South) Wales where, while the country generally lends itself to emergency landing, some provision in this respect will be necessary, after the hills in the vicinity of Cobar are reached. The Government of New South Wales has made available an amount of £250 for the provision of suitable lauding facilities at Tibooburra thereby relieving the Commonwealth Government of that expense. There is a keen desire on the part of those who live in the far west of New South Wales to have emergency landing groiuids provided for their use. Recently, the Far West Children's Health scheme, which is sponsored by the Reverend Stanley Drummond, has been examining the problem of providing a doctor with a small aeroplane to enable him to operate in the far west on lines similar to those followed for some time in the north-west with such advantage to residents in that sparsely populated areaFor this purpose alone centres like Tibbooburra and Milparinka would be greatly benefited by the establishment of emergency landing grounds.

Sof a r Australia has been most fortunate with its air services, having experienced only one really bad catastrophe, wbich occurred between Melbourne and Sydney when some eight lives were lost. It would be unfortunate if a tragedy occurred shortly after the inauguration of the Australia to GreatB ritain air mail service, for it would then be futil e for us to point out that our air services have been so free from fatalities in the past. This work could be done now probably more cheaply than ever before in our lifetime, and as it is a 100 per cent, labour proposition it can be justified on many grounds. The other matter with which I desire to deal concerns the subsidy that is being granted to the Inland Mission to provide a plane for the conveyance of a medical officer. I appeal to the Assistant Minister also to grant a small subsidy to help the Far-West Children's Health scheme, which provides for the transport of persons in the outback to Bourke where they are treated, and, if necessary, sent by r a i l to Sydney. A similar work has met w i th splendid success in the Northern Terri tory. think that the case for the prosecution of a comprehensive and continuous policy of defence was f a i r l y well ""stated in the debate that took place in this chamber on Friday last. The honourable member for Bendigo( MrE . F . Harrison) made a notable contribution to this discussion, dispassionately presenting the salient facts and enabling honourable members to arrive at a just appreciation of the situation. The debate also disclosed that, while some honourable members opposite favour a reduction of the vote for defence on more or less indefinite grounds, quite a number of them confess to favour the provision of an adequate system of defence. The trouble about those who favour adequate defence is that wheu they are asked to come down to concrete P r o b a b l y eight or facts they are inclined to shift ground somewhat readily. The term "" adequate defence"" is all embracing. Y o u either have something which is adequate, or have something which is inadequate. However, if the matter is referred to an expert who states what is necessary for a. policy of adequate ""defence, but whose specification is not in line with the political views of an honourable member opposite, that honourable member then takes leave to depart from the opinion of the expert, at the same time stoutly maintaining that he is in favour of "" adequate defence "". The platform of the Labour party makes provision for adequate defence against possible foreign aggression. The fact that the word "" possible"" is used leads one to believe that even the Labour party thinks that there is some risk of foreign aggression; otherwise there would be no need to provide for such a contingency. It s policy rejects the idea of compulsory service, compulsion being anathema to its members except in matters political, when it is held in high esteem. In other words, these persons who profess to stand for a system of adequate defence are quite prepared to let the other fellow provide it , they themselves desiring to take no personal part in the programme. A further plank in the platform of the ' Labour party is that "" decisions of courts martial shall be reviewable by civil courts "". Although the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has on I several occasions stated that in Australia we have no courts of justice, but only courts of law, he, as a member of the Labour party, presumably subscribes to that, plank of its platform. Apparently, if the decisions of courts martial are not to stand, it is because there is something suspect about them, and to remove the final responsibility to civil courts w ill achieve nothing if there is anything in the contention of the honourable member for East Sydney. The next point I shall refer to is that the Labour party would have no offence created or penalty imposed, by regulation. Apparently, every penalty provided",37,Depabtment Of Defence

Obviously such a system is wrong and the inclusion ot such a plank in any policy i again merely dodging the fads. To Have adequate defence tliere must be discipline with provision for punishment and reward but those who avoid defining what "" adequate defence"" means can° not bring themselves to concede that it must have a code of rules and must prescribe obedience thereto. Again, if we make a comparison between the defence proposals of fhe Labour party, and the methods of administration which they employ within their own party, we are brought face to face with a startling contrast. In their own party, discipline is preserved at all costs, and sometimes most drastic action is taken to enforce it. The fifth plank of the Labour party's defence platform is that no Australian citizen shall be sent outside Australia in defence of his country. During the last war, the defence of Australia was conducted at a distance, and well for us that think of p,,jii„ g t j it was. If the Labour party's stipulation correct that fault.

I could not help being struck by the fact that when the Leader of the Opposia tion ( Mr Scullin) replied to the budget speech of the Prime Minister, he said not one woTd on the subject of defence. He left us completely at a loss 'to know whether he supported any measures for defence, and if so, what kind. I have no doubt that he stands for the adequate defence of Australia, and 1 am strengthened in that belief by his attitude m 1917. At that time, he stood lor compulsory military service, and, at a Labour conference held in Victoria he laid down very definitely that, notwithstanding certain criticism of what was taking place m the Defence Forces, the defects were only minor ones, and the system itself was worthy of support. I have here a copy of the report of that conference, and this is what the right honourable gentleman said on that occasion„ If, for instance, a chimney in his hou«e l e w l l , j d 'wiwdyinjf that trouble, the w „?e i U t h e C it i z e "" 'V«chein£ A the view that, iu the event o interutional (-amplications, Australia, might find t?''h' ' t , y °-? h e To w u If that were , 0 l d f r t , , e i r °°'»PUlsorv"" f l ' o m e defence, so that they could ho? i ° n i ™ t r a l i a should hive t l l e r A JTP ""1 °f d e f e n c e ' ftn<1> if sl'e !« ™ t h e n B n » « « d mifiht provide 1 h«W«ng of the ImperialP ,Ji en a ani Even if in Australia they f ift atiaid to discuss this terrible subject of defence at all, and seemed to regard it as something to be spoken of with bated breath. He seemed to think that if Au3-. tralia did anything to improve its defences we should immediately lead the world in a mad race for armaments. That, of course, is ridiculous. When the honourable member for Wannon( Mr and then came home feeling that they had Scholfield) actually mentioned the word "" Japan "", he was taken .to task by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as if he had been guilty of an indiscretion. timidity of this subject. measures are a plain straight-forward matter of insurance. It is not our desire to provoke any one, but we must face the situation, discuss it fearlessly, and do what we think best. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) raised the subject of obtaining oil and petrol supplies from coal. He stands for the adequate defence of Austi'alia, but, in his opinion, apparently, organizations be certain of success. the defence of Australia means, almost first and last, the production of oil from coal. He restated his opinion this afternoon on the motion of the Leader of the Opposition on unemployment. I agree with him that a defence organization must include provision for materiel as well as for men, and of the materiel required none is more important than oil. I remind the honourable member, however, that, in regard to the production of oil from coal, new methods are constantly being evolved, and the process is yet largely experimental. I can understand the impatience of the honourable member that something should ne done, but these are big matters, and plans cannot be brought to fruition at once. I commend the Government on its policy of making careful investigations, and I am confident that, in the end, we shall see oil being produced from coal and shale in Australia. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) made a fighting speech on behalf of brotherly love and peace. It is an odd thing that these pacific .people are generally great fighters in debate. He told us how he had visited Germany, addressed meetings of Germans, and how they had been all in complete accord with him. Of course, the honourable member Achieved nothing by those addresses, except, perhaps, his own gratification. Before the war there were conferences between representatives of the British Labour Party and those of German organizations, but ' in that case also nothing was achieved. They talked a great deal, drank a few pints of lager, advanced the cause of peace; but, when the blast of war blew in our ears, all their work was as if it had never been. There is no need for any be that we should do nothiug to try to Our defence improve international' relations. should try, but we would be foolish to leave it at that, and do nothing for defence. Not even the. application of the principles preached by Carlyle iu his Sartor Besartus, which the honourable member read to us, was able to prevent the last war, nor will good-natured conferences between various international Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m. that the working men of one country have no particular quarrel with those of another, nor do they wish to go to war. It is a fact, however, that wars occur, and that no speeches, not even those delivered by such eminent gentleman as the ex-Minister for Defence( Mr A. Green), have much influence iu preventing conflagrations when the stage is set for them. The honourable gentleman is aggressively pacific, and I cannot sec how he can reconcile his views with his occupancy of the office of Minister for Defence in the last Government. The function of a Minister for Defence is to see to the defences of a country. The only warlike operation the honourable gentleman conducted was his declaration of war on the officers of his department. honourable member is hardly in order in discussing a past administration. ment of Defence was administered by tbe honourable gentleman, and the depression hit Australia, his first act was to impose on military officers a substantial sacrifice that no one else was asked to bear.

It was the Labour party which, in the days when it was a substantial party that could stand up to its responsibilities, gave to Australia its compulsory military training system and its navy. In those days, members of the Labour party in the Commonwealth Parliament took pride in the fact that they placed the safety of Australia in the forefront of their political programme. I have consulted the records, and desire to make one or two quotations. Senator Guy, the father of an Assistant Ministeri n the present Government, who represented Tasmania, moving the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Replyi n the Senate, in October, 1914, saidI do claim tliis credit for our own party, that we were tlie first to initiate the Australian citizen soldiery and the Australian Navy. the honourable member that the policy of the Labour party on defence is not the question before the Chair. Hansard, in order to make a point that I think it is apropos in view of the attitude of honourable members opposite w i th respect to the question now before the Chair. I merely wish to contrast their attitude in those days w i th that adopted by them to-day towards the adequate defence of Australia. Senator Guy went on to say that it was fit and proper that defensive measures for which the Labour party were responsible, should be administered by that party in times of necessity. vividly with the attitude that has been adopted on defence matters by some members of the Labour party during this debate. who moved the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Replyi n the HouseT h e honourable memOf Representatives was equally eager to claim for the Labour party the credit of having forged these instruments He may have done of national security and defence. These are the words which were used by Mr. Jolley, member for the Grampians afraid that the honourable member does Order ! I ask not understand why I have called h i m to order. Labour party towards the defence of Australia, either in the past or in the present, is not the question before the Chair, and it cannot be discussed .at length upon these Estimates. question before the Chair is, whether we should or should not expend the proposed appropriation upon defence. Some honourable members opposite have maintained that we should not. I am merely endeavouring to show that members of the Labour party in the past have held totally different views. I hope that out of the mouths of their predecessors, honourable members opposite w ill be converted to the right view. Mr Jolley saidBetween Australia and material disaster there stand our two great arms of defencethe Army and Navy. These were fashioned hy a Labour administration, and it is meet and fitting that the party which fashioned Order ! I remind those weapons by which we are enabled to avoid disaster should be the first to use them. I shall now quote one of the most historic utterances ever made in this I am quoting from Parliament. It is that of the late Right Honourable Andrew Fisher, and deals with the responsibilities of, not only the National Government, but also the members of the National Parliament in the matter of the defence of Austraha. It was made shortly after the outbreak of the Great War, and reads as follows:We shall not fail in our duty on this occasion, even if in trying to carry out our duty as wo see it, we make extraordinary demands on the public treasury and on the citizens of the Commonwealth in order that the present trouble may be brought to a sucThose sentiments contrast cessful issue.

We shall pledge our last man and our last shilling to see this war brought to a successful issue. of either. courage, patriotism, a sense of responsibility aud determination. Such qualities were outstanding in some men in those days. I take pride in the fact that the first vote that I gave as a Commonwealth elector, was for the government which, provided Australia with the instruments for self-preservation given to us by the Labour party. I merely make these quotations to show how severe is the contrast between Labour then and Labour now. In those days there was no doubt whatever that the British Navy was supreme. views, and that attitude, of responsible statesmen, were justified then, how much more justified are they to-day, when Australia has not the sure and certain shield of a Britisli Navy of incomparable strength to protect it ! I shall now make what I hope will be a constructive suggestion or two in regard to the organization of Australia's defences. The role of the Defence Force is threefold. There is defence at home, which is a sort of last resort should any nation attempt to do us injury within our own borders. Then there is defence at a distance, which consists of meeting an aggressor and holding him off our shores. The third phase is in the direction of co-operation with the other parts of the British Empire. If we are not willing to be a partner in Empire defence, we cannot complain if other parts of the Empire stand aloof from us in time of our peril. We must adopt either the one attitude or the other: Either we are a part of the Empire, and therefore are willing to co-operate with the other parts, of it, or we are not a part of the Empire and are prepared to take our gruel. As to the distribution of expenditure among the different services, I have only a general statement to make. My view, which is based upon some knowledge, is that if we had £10 to spend on defence, £5 of it should be devoted to naval defence, £3 to land defence, and £2 to air defence. That is approximately the proportion in which expenditure upon defence, in my opinion, should be distributed in Australia. ' As an island continent, naval defence must come first and military defence be comparatively secondary. A great deal more can be done with a couple of million pounds on air defence than on either land or naval defence. The air Force, the limit of whose usefulness is not yet properly understood, needs every encouragement. Its function is, not to win a war or to effect the defence of Australia on its own, but to co-operate with the navy and the army in a properly coordinated plan. At Seymour, Yictoria, there is at present in camp a brigade of infantry, with respect to which a newspaper cutting that I have before me saysI f these The 14th Infantry Brigade., under the command of Brigadier-General. ] . G. Stewart, now in camp at Seymour for six days, musters less than 400, including all ranks. Its peace time establishment is 1,200. Tlie satisfactory training of military units so pitifull y attenuated is a practical impossibility. Putting into camp for six days, a brigade of infantry in such skeleton form, is equivalent to throwing money into the sea. In those circumstances, little value can be received for the expenditure. I suggest that if Australia can afford a certain expenditure on a peace establishment, and one is laid down within, those limits, we should see that the requisite numbers of men are obtained and that the training is economical. I am not proposing reversion to the system of compulsory military training on the lines formerly adopted. I believe that that was too widespread and too thin, and full value for the expenditure was not received. But we do need pre-eminently, a regular tally of our man power. There should be compulsory registration of all able-bodied citizens, from which, with organization and technical equipment, we should be able to build in the shortest space of time a force that would meet an emergency. From this big roll of compulsorily registered men, there should be a call to service by means of a ballot, so that our peace establishment would be filled and their training made effective and economical. Surely there is nothing undemocratic in that suggestion. I know that it runs counter to the views",41,Depabtment Of Defence
148,Mr Mabtens,He would be tbe last,42,Depabtment Of Defence
149,Mr Hutchin,"That is evidence ofof those who mouth the phrase "" adequate defence,"" and leave it to the other fellow to give the actual service. Let us have a democratic ballot, uuder which men would be brought forward to the embodied units in the correct numbers and for the right period, so that they might receive effective training. The technical services, obviously, would need longer training than the infantry in view of the specialization required. We need open minds in the matter of training and equipment. In this sphere of activity matters move as quickly as in the industrial sphere. The day of mechanized military forces has more than dawned. Army mechanization is proceeding apace. Australia is' on the outskirts of the world, and is not closely in touch with developments in other parts. Actual experience in the field with embodied units and experimental mechanical equipment, are necessary in order that we may determine what is the best equipment to meet whatever situation an emergency may present to us. suggest that the Government should keep a stream of professional men moving steadily between Australia and Great Britain, so that we may keep abreast, not only with the latest developments in technical equipment, but also with the methods of their employment. gentleman's time has expired. Tlte question whether we should expend an additional £1,500,000 on defence this year has been discussed from every conceivable angle. Some honourable members contend that the defence system as at present constituted is adequate; others claim that it is inadequate. The virtues of the voluntary system of training have been extolled, and we have heard the advocacy of the re-introduction of the conscription system. It is interesting to hear the opinions of the Government supporters respecting the meaning of the plank of the Labour party's platform which provides for the adequate protection of Australia, but I suggest that when putting its policy into effect the Labour party and not its political opponents will determine what adequate protection means'. . The Labour party \as is the defence of the living standards of the people of Australia, and we are more concerned with the preservation of those standards than with .the provision of money for munition and armament firms which are at present carrying on active propaganda in Sydney. I agree with the following passage in Bond or Free, written by tlie right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) :A healthy, well-nourished, well-clad, wellhoused people is the nation's greatest asset. A policy which ensures tlie people abundant food, gnud clothes, aud decent houses to live in is the best policy. We entirely agree with that statement. We aim at a high living standard, as the first and most important line of defence. If we gave the people a standard of living which they would be prepared to defend against outside aggressors military compulsion would be absolutely unnecessary. We are still living in the shadow of the last European war which, according to Whittaher's Almanac of 1929, was estimated in 1924 by the BankI ing Trust Company of New York to have cost the nations of the world £56,000,000,000. Because that sum disappeared in smoke, and destruction, the world'to-day is suffering as it has never suffered before. Among those who are suffering the worse are the people who fought to make the world a better place in which to live. It was alleged to be a war to end war. But our war-time Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) stated the other night that peace cannot exist in a world that is unstable financially and economically. The financial and economic instability of the world to-day was created by the vast expenditure of money on the last war, and it would appear, according to the reasoning of the right honourable member' for North Sydney, that that condition will be responsible for the nextwar. I have not the slightest doubt that the accentuation of the economic and financial instability as the result of another war will lead to further wars^ It is an entirely hopeless outlook. On the 13th October, 1916, the right honourable member said at HobartThe only peace tbey-the people of Aus* tralia -woul d have would bo on the field at the final battle when the military power of Germany was crushed for ever on the western front. Then and only then would we have another defence policy, which world peaoe.",42,Depabtment Of Defence

151,Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [8.16],"Germany and her allies ""were crushed, yet we still have the threat or promise of war; so that the final blow struck at Germany on the field of Plunders was not the end of all wars. The right honourable member said the other night that the last war was a trade war and that all future wars would be trade wars. I remember distinctly the occasion on which he threatened to deal with a distinguished cleric of opinion that the last war was a sordid trade war. The right honourable gentleman also compared the trade relations in the Pacific to ten men in a boat with .food enough for three, and the question was who would get the food. One inferred that the strongest in the contest would prevail. Progress reported. Bill returned from the Senate without requests. Tn Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed) : The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) suggested that, in that case, that might would be right, and speaking on that subject on the 27th October, 1916, in the Sydney Town Hall, he saidI cannot too often rejieat that Germany has It was the experts who carried on the inscribed on her banner/'Might is Right."" This power tliat stands for Might is Kight is the power with which we are now at death grips. One of ns must go down. Who is it to 1)0? The power which had inscribed on its banner "" Might is Right"" fell, yet the policy which the right honourable member condemned at that time is the one which he to-day advocates, because he now wishes to increase armaments in order to associate this country with might in the next war. The last war for which many honourable members can always find a reasonable excuse was alleged to have been fought to make the world safe for democracy, yet no matter where we look throughout the world 'to-day we find that democracy is being crushed by the very military power which wi set out to defeat. It was claimed that the war was fought to preserve the rights of small nations, yet the League of Nations stood idly by while the rights of a small nation like China were violated by our late ally, Japan. Mr E. J. HARRISON -I s China a small nation? military sense. It has been claimed that Melbourne who ventured the the last war was fought to make the world a bettor place in which to live. It will be generally agreed that the conditions of living in the world to-day are worse than ever before, and that is particularly applicable to many of the men who fought in the last war. They were told that they were fighting for security, yet many of them cannot find security even in a war service home. With a sort of supercilious attitude some honourable members with military careers assert that laymen should not discuss defence matters without due deference to their superior knowledge, and that we must accept the advice of the experts. It was the experts who prepared the nations of the world for the last war. The experts of Germany prepared the-military machine of that nation. The experts in close collaboration with munition manufacturers and ship-builders prepared the British Navy for naval defence, and the experts in preparing that navy took fine care that before any ship embodying the jatest innovations in naval construction left the slips it was obsolete. war to end war. It was the expert diplomats aud international jurists who prepared the peace which has successfully ended peace. The world to-day is controlled and advised in almost every aspect by alleged experts, and as the result is seething with animosity and distrust. We have witnessed the development of intense nationalism, both social and economic. The fight to-day is for markets and it is necessary to camouflage the real issue in the discussion of armaments. Vague suggestions have been made by some honourable members that this proposed additional expenditure is not sufficient arid that many more millions will have to be spent on Australian defence; and to justify this expenditure they raise bogys as",43,Depabtment Of Defence

Those honourable members are endeavouring to stampede the people into accepting any system of defence that the warmongers inflict upon them. The right honourable member for North Sydney has said that the millions in the East are seeking room. We have heard that story before. The millions in the East did seek room in Manchuria. While it has no direct connection with Australia or Great Britain, we notice that some international capitalists are very concerned about the violation of Manchuria, not because of the danger to the Chinese or the Manchurians, but because of the possibility that the markets of Manchuria will be exploited solely by the Japanese. It would appear, however, that the Japanese are content, at present, to confine their activities to Manchuria, the people of which country are more akin to themselves in race, habits and goneral outlook than are the people of Australia, for instance. The right honourable member for North Sydney went on to speak of what he called the "" German menace"", because certain newspapers had revived the story that Germany is busily developing a huge fighting force. ditions imposed on Germany by the peace treaty make it practically impossible for that country to become a potential enemy of Australia. The right honourable gentleman also discussed the so called "" red menace "", and one could infer from his remarks that a huge Russian arrny might swoop down on Australia. Our grandfather's were scared by a similar story 50 or 60 years ago, and were told that the Russians would come down through India and invade Australia. Later it was the Japanese who would invade this country;, but after an Imperial trade treaty was made with Japan any possibility of aggression from that quarter was conveniently forgotten. Thoughts of that kind were thenceforward concentrated on Germany until the great war actually started. Although the right honourable member tried to focus attention on the possibility of a "" red "" menace from Russia he failed to Ifr. ftoseienr. Australia tell us that on every occasion when RusThey say that we are sian delegates had attended an international conference on disarmament, they alone among the delegates had advocated complete disarmament. I suppose that people who read the reports of the right honourable member's speech will be inclined to think that' some heed should be paid to his remarks, because he was our war-time Prime Minister; but we should do justice to our own common sense and to the people of Australia if we directed attention to the fact that Russia is the one country in the world to-day which is seeking to develop her own affairs according to her own desires. If other nations of the world would show as clearly as Russia has done that they are favorable to the international disarmament there would be no fear of war. 800,000 men under arms? cut-throats outside its borders. One other rather nebulous plea made and insisted upon in support of the proposed additional vote for defence involves the re-imposition of conscription in Australia. The right honourable member for North Sydney pleaded that conscription was necessary because the present voluntary system was a failure. He made it clear that he The disarmament conbelieved in conscription in Australia and that Australians should fight for Australia within Australia. I remember that the right honourable gentleman said on a former occasion that he believed in compulsory military training for the purpose of defending Australia within Australia. He said at that time that in no circumstance would he consent to the sending of men away from Australia against their will to fight. But those views were completely upset later. After expressing such hostility and abhorrence to compulsory military service the right honourable gentleman said on the 13th October, '1916, in Hobart-whic h seems to be a favourite verbal battleground of hisI t was to prevent conscription of Prussia from ever being riveted on tlie limbs of Australians that they were fighting this war. Yet fifteen years after the Prussian hordes have been defeated the right honourable gentleman is still talk-",44,Estimates 1933 34

On tbe 27th October, 1916, he saidI shall say that the destiny of Australia is being decided on the battlefields of France. built within Australia and that this will I bid you go and fight for White Australia in France. I have not the slightest doubt that if the right honourable member again found himself clothed with sufficient power he would discover just as much justification for sending men. and boys overseas to fight as he found for it in the last warand he would not be troubled whether the Avar had to be fought in China, Japan, Palestine, or any other country. The honourable member for Pranklin( Mr Blacklow) advanced the rather novel argument that the re-introduction of compulsory military training would be beneficial to the morale and physique of the children, and he made a special reference in this connection to the district of Rozelle in the heart of my electorate. I do not think that the fathers and mothers of Rozelle would be flattered by gestion that compulsory military training was necessary for the development of the morale and physique of their children. 'Football, other sports would be much more effective to that end than training, but there is no suggestion that those .sports should' be subsidized by the Government. able gentlemen who advocate compulsory military training are more concerned about providing gun-fodder for the next trade war than about providing children with healthy minds and bodies. should the shouldering of a gun be more effective in developing physique than the shouldering of a broomstick, or any other implement % It has been said that additional expenditure on defence would, in a measure, relieve the unemployment market; but, on examining the Estimates, I find that there is every reason to assume that a good deal.of the extra money for defence will be spent outside of Australia. An amount of £93,000 has been provided under two items for exchange, and other amounts of £42,000 and £35,000 are also provided under this heading, clearly indicating that heavy purchases are to be made overseas. An amount of over £400,000 is also to be spent on aerial defence. The whole of that money will go overseas. It has been said that under the Government's defence policy a few munition factories will be provide local employment, but any employment of that kind will have very little influence upon the unemployment problem. The Government intends to spend a considerable amount in the purchase of a sloop, but this will be built within Australia only if 'an Australian shipbuilder is able to submit a tender below those submitted by overseas shipbuildersa remote possibility. We have been told that certain British destroyers will be visiting Australia shortly. There are some interesting aspects of this subject. Recently, I submitted to the Assistant Minister for Defence a series of questions regarding these destroyers, and I can only describe as evasive the answers that were furnished to my inquiries. I directed attention to a report which appeared in the press to the effect that at the honourable member's sugcertain naval manoauvres at Portsmouth, England, some destroyers were unable to put to sea, and that it was believed that this was due to the heavy weather and swimming, cricket, and the general unseaworthiness of vessels of that particular type. I wished to know military whether the report was correct and also whether destroyers of a similar type were to be sent to Australia. The Minister Honorsaid that he did not intend to make an investigation to see whether destroyers of that type were to be sent here. The honourable gentleman apparently is not much concerned about the lives of the Why seamen who will have to travel on these vessels. If destroyers are unseaworthy in any respect they should not be sent to Australia. However, I elicited the information that the destroyers to be sent to Australia were between fifteen and sixteen years old. Although the Minister would not intimate that the destroyers to come here were of the type concerned in the Portsmouth naval manoeuvres incident, to which I have referred, it is interesting to know that those vessels are of the same age as the destroyers to be sent to Australia. The information I obtained in answer to my question as to the estimated cost to Australia of these vessels was also vague. I learned that it probably would be another five years before tbese destroyers would be declared obsolete, although after that period it might be possible to get a little more use out of them. The vessels are to remain here for five years. The amount mentioned for the upkeep of these vessels while in Australian waters was more than £40,000 a year, so that in the five-year period each of them will cost Australia £200,000, making an aggregate of more than £1,000,000. In view of the fact that these destroyers are. of an unsatisfactory type and are unseaworthy in certain circumstances, I am of the opinion that they will be entirely worthless as fighting units of the Australian naval forces. No justification has been given for the proposed additional vote for defence. The Government's defence policy is associated with wild-cat bogy stories about potential enemies. No government supporter has yet said .definitely who these potential enemies are or from what quarter they are likely to come. In the circumstances it would be far better to use the money which the Government intends to spend on additional for defence, plus a few more millions, to provide genuine work for the unemployed. help both unemployed, and would enable us to make some very necessary improvements in their living standards. If that were done, people would have some incentive to fight to protect their homes-if they have any. Unfortunately, many people have lost the homes that they were buying a few years ago. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) sneeringly referred to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green), who had spoken of the way in which he had fraternized with the workers of Germany, and heconveyed the idea that no understanding could be arrived at by conferences of workers. In my opinion, whether the cause of war be ascribed to trade, finance, or economic conditions, whether it be claimed to be waged to sa.ve democracy, civilization, or anything else, it is certain that we shall have wars in the future unless an international understanding is arrived at among the workers of the world. are the persons who are called upon to do 3fr.

What are, the actions which have characterized the desire of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics to effect international peace and goodwill? A most aggressive propaganda, carried on for twelve or fifteen years, thousands of murders during the early Bolshevic regime, and ruthless dumping of the surplus products of Russia in an endeavour to destroy the markets of other nations. I was interested to listen to the honourable member pointing out the necessity for international goodwill and then to find that he suddenly lost that characteristic and generated a most perverted nationalistic outlook when it came to providing money to promote Australia's preparations defence. The amazing feature is that, while the honourable member's party has demanded the expenditure of public That policy would money to lessen unemployment, its memthe employed and the bers denounce public expenditure on defence, which is no less reproductive than-many of the proposals sponsored by them. I feel that the only effective way in which we can defend this huge continent of 2,974,581 square miles is by securing its effective occupation. The next valuable line of defence is a foreign policy that will tend to make Australia friendly with other nations of the world. That would do more than anything else to lessen the international instability and friction about which the honourable member complained. Failing both of those desirable objectives which we have lamentably failed to achieve, we should take adequate defence measures in cooperation with every other part of the British Commonwealth of Nations which is sufficiently strong to take such measures, to enable Australia to carry on its development under the most peaceful conditions possible.

No one can read the history of the world for the last 300 years without realizing that, during that period, Great Britain and its policy have been the biggest single factor that has made for world peace and goodwill. It is quite obvious that the 6,500,000 persons in Australia and the limited money that is available for our development do not permit the provision of an adequate defence force. But Australia can have a nucleus force on sound and sane lines which could expand rapidly and make use of the human sources of the country when called upon to do so. The Bruce-Page Government inaugurated a definite five-year defence programme to improve Australia's military and naval forces, no less than £1,500,000 being expended each year above the amount expended in the year previous to our taking ofiice, in addition to which £8,000,000 was allocated from accumulated surpluses to modernize the Australian Navy. I am astounded that some who regarded the then Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and myself of being woefully extravagant because we spent this money, now advocate the. carrying out of a similar policy involving similar expenditure. What has happened? A government came into power which determined to have nothing to do with those definite and progressive measures for defence. It scuppered that policy, destroyed the system of compulsory military training, practically eliminated the nucleus of trained officers, and ruthlessly discarded the system which had been established by the first Federal Labour government in Australia. It is now necessary to begin to rebuild Britain where the Warren-Fisheri nsteadily on sound lines.

That argument applies equally as effectively in connection with the professional side of the forces. From an examination of the summary that has been supplied to honourable members to enable them to understand the Defence Estimates, I found, that the medical complement of medical officers in the navy was Itwo short, and upon inquiry, I found that this was because of the meagre pay offered. Medical organizations are definitely advising their members-who , unlike other officers who are trained at the expense of the country, train at their own expense over a considerable number of years-that there is no future for them in the forces comparable with the opportunities offered by private practice.

The war proved that every man of standing in the medical profession in Australia was only too ready to disregard profits and serve his country for a comparatively meagre pittance. There is no question about the patriotism of the medical profession. The Government cannot afford to neglect to staff its services properly, and I urge it to reconsider the whole position.

It must be recognized that, under any disarmament plan, Australia and the Empire would be justified in disarming only to that extent which would be consonant with national safety. doubt the extent of "" national safety"" would be defined in any agreement entered into. ""While no disarmament agreement is in existence, the Empire will be justified in at least providing itself with armaments sufficient to ensure its safety.

It was fortunate for Australia that, before the last war, she had so developed her secondary industries that she was able to send her soldiers across the seas equipped with everything except their arms. All their other equipment was produced in the factories of Australia, from Australian material, by Australian workers. The defence of Australia involves, not only ithe expenditure of money on armaments, but also the effective organization of our civil population and economic resources. Situated as we are in the Pacific, we are not concerned so much with theories as with practical considerations, whereby we shall be able to develop our national strength to such, an extent as to enable us to mainpotent to do more than it has done. If tain this Commonwealth in all circumstances as a distant outpost of the civilizait! tion which we cherish. Even from a defence point of view it would be better for the Commonwealth if we were able to ensure to all our citizens a greater degree of comfort than many of them enjoy to-day. electorate I represent there are many young men who have 'been unemployed for a considerable time. They come from all parts of the Commonwealth, and most of them are decent men who have been reared in good homes. They are the men upon whom we would largely depend for our defence in the event of war, and it is deplorable that they should be in their present plight. If they were regularly employed they would probably feel much more like exerting themselves in the defence of their country than they do now. Of course, owing to their unfortunate economic position, it is probable that, if war broke out, they would immediately volunteer for service because they would then be assured of shelter and regular meals. I have here a leaflet issued by 'the Society of Friends, iu London, in which it is stated that the cost of a modern battleship is about £6,000,000, and then it goes ou to enumerate all the things which might be done with that sum of money. The list is as follows:£ 50 hospitals .. 1,000,000 50 miles of arterial mads .. 1,000,000 100 miles of country roads .. 1,000,000 100 recreation grounds) .. 1,000.000 100 schools.. .. .. 1,000,000 1,000 furnished houses .. 1,000,000 6,000,000 If money were spent on homes that would meet our needs, on roads that would benefit primary producers and the community generally, on recreation groiuids and other similar works, there would be something for our young men to fight for; but when thousands of them are unable to obtain food and clothing, and are practically denied the right to live in the country of their birth, it is rather a stiff proposition to put up to them. The Government has confessed that it is imwhat has been done is its best, God help I realize that Australia, notwithstanding its shortcomings, is probably in a better position, and offers greater opportunities, than any other country; but there is still ample scope for improvement. A little while ago, this Goverument issued a large amount of what I suppose we may assume is real money. In the The paper of which it consisted did not contain a promise to pay anything; but it was made legal tender merely by reason of the printing of a statement to that effect on its face, and the backing of an act of this Parliament. No harm would be done if a few more millions were similarly made available, so that the people of Australia would have a chance to obtain useful Work. It is difficult to learn where defence and offence begin and end. Australia might be most effectively defended in another part of the world. The best interests of this country would be served if war were kept out of it, although its occurrence here might teach those who have not seen it what it is like. I have not witnessed it, and hope that I shall never do so. I hate its very name. But the world Will continue to engage in it for a long time to come.

At one time the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said that Australia would never again trade with Germany; yet trading relations between this and that country have been resumed. Bitterness was stirred up against the German race during the war for the sole purpose of inflaming the minds of the young people of Australia. Many thousands of the best citizens of Austi'alia came here from Germany, and doubtless many more will do so in the future.

The right honourable member for Oowper (Dr. Earle Page) has said that the history of Great Britain shows that it has always been a great advocate for peace. I contend that it has been one of the most aggressive nations in the world, and that it has taken possession of that great labour leader before then ? the territory of defenceless people. siders that he is an unassailable authority in such matters. I should like to know war of aggression for the crushing of a few people. The Zulu war was waged to crush an. almost defenceless people. Similarly, the object of the war in New Zealand was to crush the Maoris. The British nation is not peculiar in this respect; other nations have a similarly aggressive frame of mind. The Japanese are now giving indications that they possess it. It was not the people of Germany, but aggressive military advisers who desired the last war. It is the practice of these persons to 3tay at home, wave the flags, and toll the soldiers what jolly good fellows they are. Munitions manufacturers are consistent advocates of war. The right honourable member for North Sydney has visited two or three States urging the need for the defence of Australia, so that we may be ready for French statesmen argue an eastern menace that might submerge us.

Having signed the Labour platform, which makes provision for the adequate defence of Australia, I cannot do otherwise than support these Estimates. WhetherI believe that the So long as the present proposed appropriation will provide for adequate defence is beside the question; the purpose is to strengthen forces which will be called upon to defend Australia should the necessity to do so arise.

Certain persons will not on any account since the termination of the last war, take action for the defence of a country Great Britain, year after year, has in circumstances which mean the destruction of human life. Some of them have suffered incarceration in prisons because they have held those ideas. I consider that they are entitled to hold them. If many thousands of persons were of the same mind, we should be a better people. Whether the League of Nations has accomplished its purpose is beside the question. I believe that, in the main, it is honestly striving to bring about a better understanding between the nations, and that, whatever its shortcomings may be, the continuance of its operations will prove beneficial. If we cannot ensure the cessation pf hostilities, and bring about a better understanding among the members of the human family, by roundtable conferences of the different nations, we are in for a very bad time in the future. I believe that more can be achieved by reasoning round a table than by killing off hundreds of thousands of the cream of the manhood of every nation.

181,Mr Francis (Moreton,"Assistantsteadily reduced its forces, as an invitation to the rest of the world to follow its excellent example. To-day, its defences are below the safety level. Much of the time' of the British Cabinet as a whole, and of the leaders of it individuearly date to place an order for a sloop. ally, has been devoted to efforts, on the continent of Europe and elsewhere, to effect a general disarmament. Within recent years, no country has done more towards this end than the British Empire. In these efforts, Australia has nobly played its part. The results of the League of Nations and the disarmament conferences have been disappointing. Unfortunately, the rest of the world does not see eye to eye with the British Empire in its efforts to bring about disarmament. It is therefore vitally imperative that we should play our part in building up a defence force and a navy within the limits of the Washington Conference and the London Pact, so as to ensure -the adequate ""defence of the Empire. We are still striving towards disarmament, and I confidently expect that before long the need for universal disarmament will be appreciated by the world as a whole; but until that day arrives our sacred obligation as a Government is to do all within our power to provide for the adequate defence of Australia. To that end we are first taking steps to ensure a highly trained and efficient staff; we are sending overseas some of the most promising of our officers to attend various British schools of trainI t is beyond question that the camp training in order to acquire the latest knowledge in regard to defence in all its phases, and the use of the most modern equipment so that on their return to Australia we may reap the benefit of their experience; we are endeavouring to provide in Australia an ample supply of arms and munitions. Secondly, we are endeavouring to give every young Australian who joins the defence forces an opportunity to be trained in the use of arms and munitions under the guidance of an expert staff. The Australian Navy must be considered as part of the Empire naval defence under the provisions of the Washington Conference. We are keeping in commission the cruisers Canberra and Australia, and the survey vessel Moresby is operating in the northern waters of Australia with a view to the preof new pattern uniforms to be completed. paration of charts of those waters. The flotilla leader Stuart, and the destroyers Voyager, Vampire, Vendetta, and Waterhen are now on their way to Australia. In addition, the Government hopes at an Our army to-day is far from satisfactory, and we are hoping to improve it. I agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that there has been some falling off in the interest' in military training, but this has been due largely to the absence of sufficient funds, and that, of course, must inevitably cause lack of interest and stagnation. In addition, following the suspension of the compulsory provisions of the Defence Act in 1929, camp training which is intensive and continuous, and for that reason far more valuable than home training, was discontinued. There has also been a curtailment of the instruction to the permanent staff. Eor a period the staff officers and instructors were rationed in their employment, and this undoubtedly adversely affected the efficiency of the forces. The present Government has taken steps to make improvements necessary to our defences. This 'year an additional sum of over £1,500,000 has been provided for defence purposes. The Government reintroduced camp training during 1932-33, and provision has been made this year for the continuance of six days camp training in addition to six days home training. ing will increase the interest in, and the efficiency of, the forces. The Government realizes the adverse effect on the military forces of the restriction of the instruction of the permanent personnel who are the instructors for the militia units, and special provision is being made for "" refresher "" courses so as to bring the instruction of staff up to date, and to give added interest to the training. When compulsory training was suspended, it' was decided that one means of assisting to maintain interest in the forces was to provide a more suitable and attractive uniform. However, owing to the financial position, the equipment of the forces was delayed. The sum of £45,000 has now been included in the Estimates for 1933-34, and this will enable the supply The delay in the supply, whicli was due to financial stringency, caused much dissatisfaction among the trainees, and had an adverse effect on recruiting. It is anticipated that with the complete issue of new uniforms a considerable improvement will take place in the number of enlistments. Military training of infantry has been resumed at the following country centres:-Queensland : Warwick; New South Wales: Bathurst, Orange, Wagga and Gosford; Victoria: Bacchus M.arsh, Camperdown and Pakenham; Western Australia : North am and Bunbury. Approval has also been given for resumption of training as from the 1st January, 1934, in the following centres in New South Wales:-Armidale, Tamworth. Gunnedah and Quirindi. instruction for the permanent forces are also being held, such as school of artillery, small arms school, administrative course, engineer and signals schools. The courses conducted by militia formations include week-end courses and bivouacs. It is hoped that these courses will bring about a definite revival of interest in milihas already been made in the votes of tary training. Many of the complaints that have been made by honourable members are to some extent justified, but it is assistance for the outback children's hoped that in the near future, when the system of voluntary training has had a fair trial, those complaints will disappear.

The Government has gone as far as it can in submitting the present scheme, but the suggested service can be given further consideration when the present plans are given effect. The honourable member also contended that the Government should provide emergency landing grounds along the route from Charleville via Bourke, to Cootamundra. That has already been done, and properly marked grounds exist through sections where the terrain is not suitable for emergency landings. The honourable member also asked the Government to assist the Inland Mission, the flying doctor scheme in Schools of the far west of New South Wales, and the people outback generally. I am an enthusiastic supporter of these services on account of the good work that they are performing. They are essential to the outback people, and I am sure that as finances permit the granting of further assistance will be considered. Provision another department for the aerial medical service.

The final payment is waived if the purchaser is recorded as efficient for the four years. Rifle barrels can be obtained at a cost of 30s. each.

183,That Is Mr War D (East Sydney) [9.50],"On the total area of the cipality of Paddington, 30 acres are taken up by the Victoria Barracks, and 70 acres by parks, hospitals, schools and church lauds. The Defence Department has a number of other suitable areas t'o which the barracks could be removed, and I therefore hope that the Government w ill accede to the request of the State Parliament. From time to time the military authorities have advanced various reasons for not removing the barracks, but they have never mentioned what, in my opinion, is the principal reason for retaining them in the present locationtheir suitable strategic position in the event of civil disorder. Other properties held by the Defence Department to which the barracks could be transferred comprise the following: Bondi-Fort reserve Bondi (South Head)-Fort reserve 6 Chats wood-Rifl e range reserve .. 110 Dobroyd-Defenc e reserve Middle Head-Defenc e reserve Henry Head-Fort reserve .Long Bay-Rifl e range reserve Randwick-Defenc e reserve South Head-Fort Newington-Reserv e Mascot-Aerodrom e The Minister w ill agree that the buildings at the Victoria Barracks are unsuitable for military purposes. They are used mainly for afternoon teas and garden parties at which the "" brass hats "" entertain the elite of Sydney. They could do that just as well at one of their fashionable clubs in the city. If money is to be expended under the Defence Department vote, the workers in the navajl and military establishments , should, at least, be paid a decent wage. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) aud other honourable members pleaded for the professional soldier and those in the higher strata of the defence forces, but they did not say one word on behalf lower paid men of / Some of the employees at Garden Island, who are supposed to be operating under a State award, also complain of being treated unjustly by the department. Here is an extract from a communication written to me from Mr R. T. Reeves, who is secretary of the Painters UnionThere is only one award covering the industry, and that is a State award. The .rate Mr Ward. muniof wages payable under that award in shipping work is 2s. 5d. per hour, which totals £5 0s. 8d. per week. Erior to 1st October, 1931, the award rate of £5 19s. 2d. was being paid, but on that date the rate was reduced by 20 per cent. Since then it was reduced 4s. Od. on the 5th October, 1932, l i d . on 1st November, 1932, and l i d . on 1st February, 1933. I hope that the Assistant Minister w ill look into this matter and give me a reply, which, following upon previous representations, he has so f a r neglected to do. Another letter which I have received from one of the workers throws a similar light on the question. This man statesWhen the Financial Emergency Act came into operation during the regime of the last Government, we, in addition to the cost of living cuts, suffered an additional 10 per cent, cut. We were to suffer no more cost of living Acres. cuts until the 10 per cent, was covered by .. .. 22 the cost of living cuts. When this present Government came into power, they decided to give us the cost of Hying cuts again, and the .. 115 first one they gave us was 4s. 6d. per week. .. 260 The pay of our iron-workers assistants in 1930 .. 308 was £5 6s -it is now £3 12s. 6d., a drop of 32 .. 482 per cent. The pay of members of Parliament .. 192 dropped 25 per cent., and yet they receive .. ..08 a partial restoration. Quite correct, but we .. 209 think it only fair that the worker receiving .. .. 163 a 32 per cent, cut is also entitled to some restoration. That is our main point which we hope, you will stress. How can your opponents in the House explain why they think tliat one suffering a 25 per cent, cut should have some restoration, and one suffering a 32 per cent, cut should have none? I have also received a complaint concerning another matter from a man who has now retired from the Navy after completing 22 years' service. He was transferred to HMAS. Penguin to enable h i m to seek civil employment. On the 3rd March he was offered a position in the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, to start on 5th March. As his time of service did not expire u n t i l three weeks later he applied for three weeks leave without pay. This was rejected by Commander of the Rhodes, who was also captain in charge the services. of New South Wales, so that any appeal would have had to be forwarded to the same person. As the result this man lost the offer of a position at the Commonwealth Bank. This treatment of lowerpaid men by brass hats in both the A r m y and the Navy is responsible for the"" great discontent that has been noticeable from time to time, and which manifested itself in the Navy last year. BeforeI conclude my remarks, I wish to correct some of the mis-statements that have been made during this discussion by honourable members who, because of their position, ought to know a great deal better. No country has been more maligned by a section of our press and by certain honourable members than the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. I do not intend to base my opinions on any. report emanating from a Labour source, but shall rely on the words of Lord Marley, who, after having visited Russia, spoke in the House of Lords on the 22nd June, 1932, as follows :We all know that in your Lordships' House the subject of Russia is one which destroys the balance of thought among many noble lords. Yeti t is a fact that while you have unemployment amounting in this country to nearly 3,000,000, in France to 3,000,000, in Germany to 6,000,000, and in the United States to 12,000,000, or 13,000,000, in Russia to-day there is no unemployment, and Russia is a country with growing wealth, whose people aro looking forward year by year to the gradual increase in the standard of life which they are actually receiving, and who have a constructive plan giving hope and belief to millionsa hope and belief whicli is completely absent from the minds of the masses of the workers of Great Britain and other countries to-day. [ had in view the comparison between the two countries, and"" I had the remembrance that, whereas the standard of life in this country has been far higher than in Russia, and is falling, the standard of living in Russia has been far lower and is rising. able member to connect his remarks w it h the vote before the C h a i r . opposite have been allowed to p o in to u t t h a t one of the reasons w h y A u s t r a l i a should a r m to the teeth is t h a t it is threatened by w h a t has been termed "" the red m e n a c e "" . t l i r o u gh the words of L o r d M a r l e y , t h a t the o n ly desire of Russia is to develop it so w n economic s t r u c t u r e , and t h a t it has no dreams of w o r l d d o m in a t i o n . It h in k t h a t I am e n t it l e d to do so. L o r d M a r l ey continuedI would remind the lords that in this country we have a movement for an increase in the hours of work, despite the fact that there are millions aud millions of unemployed, while in Russia the hours of work are being reduced, and now stand at an average of seven hours per day. The aim of the Soviet was not, and never has been, world dominance. Its aim was to overthrow the landed aristocracy and capitalists, and to establish a classless society in Russia. The Russian statesmen would naturally prefer to see socialism established in other countries, just as conservatives prefer conservative administrations abroad, but EO far from aiming at world dominance, one of the first demands of the Soviets when they rose to power was the self determination of all countries great or small, a policy which they followed systematically with regard to the former constituents of the Tzarist Empire. There are other quotations from which I could read, including a speech by Lord Passfield, another member of the House of Lords, but I shall be content to let it go at that. Reference has been made to the alleged endeavour of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) to ridicule the efforts of the League of Nations to maintain world peace. From the latest figures that are available I find that the cost of the League of Nations to Australia alone has been over £500,000, which sum has been expended to send Cabinet Ministers and members of Parliament on what my party characterizes as pleasure jaunts. A committee was appointed by the League of Nations to inquire into the operations of the armament firms of the world, and the following are some of its findings:The armament firms and their working were inquired into by a committee of the League of Nations at Geneva. This is what they found: "" That armament firms haveI ask the honor(1) been active in fomenting war scares and in persuading their own countries to adopt warlike policies; (2) attempted to bribe government members officials, both at home and abroad; (3) disseminated false reports concerning the military and naval programmes of various countries in order to stimulate armament expenditure; (4) sought to influence public opinion I am demonstrating, through the control of newspapers in their own and foreign countries; (5) organized international armament rings through whicli the armament race has been accentuated by playing off one country against another; (6) organized international armament trusts, by which they have increased the price of armaments to governments. These findings were made by the League of Nations Committee. They were published to the world. There are over fifty prominent armament firms. And not one of them has dared to challenge any one of those accusations.",56,Littleton Groom Th E Nations And She Has Persistently Endea

Tlie Vickers-Armstrong's combine has linked up Vickers, Maxim, Armstrong, Whitworth's, Bcardmores, two factories at Genoa, one at Naples, the Hispano works at Ferrol, in Spain, armaments and the personnel of her and the Muroan factory iu Japan. These statements show that armament firms know no patriotism, no flag, and no international barriers. A similar remark applies to those who have spoken here to-night as professional soldiers. Many instances could be cited of men who have made military and naval pursuits their profession, and who have been prepared to sell their services to the highest bidder -suggested to-day is because her financial If the Government of Austraha were not prepared to offer them highly-paid positions, they would just as readily sell their services to another country. I u all these matters their first consideration is profit or individual gain, and their last consideration patriotism or love of country. The men who display the true spirit of patriotism are those who are desirous of elevating the standard of living in this country, so that we may be justly proud to be citizens of it. It is idle for some honourable members to talk about the adequate defence of Australia and about protecting the freedom of the press and of other institutions, as did the honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom). reminded me of the statement made by Mr Bennett, the Prime Minister of Canada, who, at the opening of the recent Ottawa Conference, saidThey must safeguard their established standards of living and be active to defend the free institutions of the .Empire when they found them menaced by organized economic hostility operating through Statecontrolled standards of living, State-controlled labour and State-aided dumping dictated by high State policy. At the same time that he was delivering this warning to the assembled delegates, there was actually a Russian tanker in Canadian waters waiting to land her cargo of oil in exchange for aluminium ware manufactured in the dominion. A contract had already been entered into, proving conclusively that these hypocritical statements are intended only for outside consumption, and are meant to convey the impression that their authors Mr Ward. are intent upon preserving the alleged country. I heard the Assistant Minister( Mr Francis) say that, since the termination of the Great War, Britain had progressively reduced her navy. That may be perfectly true, but it is no indication that Britain is more peace-loving now than she ever was. It is only proof that her finances were so burdened as the result of the last war that she could afford no further expenditure on armaments. That was the only reason why her armaments were reduced. The reason why further armaments are being position has vastly improved, because she has a surplus which must be disposed of, and because in the disposal of that surplus, the arms manufacturers have to be considered. Similarly, the only consideration taken into account when the Commonwealth Goverument reduced its expenditure on armaments was that the financial position of the country did not permit any further expenditure. Then the Government set out upon a plan to reduce the standards of living of the people, and that plan has now reached the stage when the Government claims that it has a surplus. So the mad race of armaments has begun again. If every member of the His remarks Ministry is sincere in his desire to provide an adequate defence for this country, his first consideration should be for the men who fought in ' the last war. To-day, these men, as we shall see when we come to deal with the Estimates for the Repatriation Department, are being denied an opportunity to secure the bare necessities of life. Our unemployed have nothing to defend except their dole tickets, and no nation would declare war on Australia merely because it hoped to take those dole tickets from them. The only incentive to war is the hope of gaining additional trade rights. Knowing that, I am not prepared to assist the Government to increase the expenditure upon defence. I am not prepared to allow one man to leave Australia to participate in a war from which he cannot gain anything of value. The asylums of this country are still filled with men who went mad during the war, and with men who have gone mad since as the result of their continuous search for employment which they have been unable to obtain. By perusing the Estimates, honourable members will see that the Government has, from time to time, provided increased accommodation for returned soldiers in our mental asylums. As a matter of fact, that has recently been done' at Callan Park, Sydney. Whilst we have before us the devastating effects of war, and the price which our people are called upon to pay for it, the Labour party is not prepared to lend its assistance to those who are urging war preparation which can only result in the further destruction of human life. Rather is it prepared to assist the Government to spend the increased amount proposed to be expended on defence, in providing employment for the benefit of mankind and not for its destruction. rise to deal with one or two points which have been mentioned in the course of this debate. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Sir Littleton Groom) has referred to the fact that on previous occasions he has heard me express a certain opinion about the League of Nations. As a matter of fact, I have not expressed any opinion, other than that so far as the League is concerned, it has failed to word for the surplus doctors being turned give effect to its prime duty. I might cite instances of the inability of the League from time to time, to preserve the peace even among the smaller nations. The honourable member for Darling Downs'has always been a very strong supporter of the League, and is, of course, entitled to his opinion. Buti t seems rather peculiar that year after year he can endorse the expenditure of something like £60,000 upon this body, which, up to date, has proved itself utterly unable to carry out its job, while at the same time, voting for an increase in the expenditure upon armaments in Australia. To-night he read an opinion by General Smuts as to the dreadful condition that will be brought about by the next war. He pointed to the dread menace of the competition in armaments, and attempted to justify Australia in increasing her expenditure on armaments to the extent of £1,500,000 as compared with her ex[170] penditure last year, thereby assisting to bring about a competition in armaments and future calamity. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has attacked me because I had a good Word to say for the Russian people. May I remind him that I expressed no opinion either as to their goodness or badness. WhatI did say was, and what I challenge contradiction on is, that at every international meeting of statesmen where the question of disarmament has been in the forefront, Russia has always offered to take the lead with other large nations, not in the direction of partial disarmament, but of total disarmament. There does not appear to be any real reason why the nations of the world, if they are genuinely desirous of disarmament, should not follow the lead set by Russia. The honourable member for Darling Downs said that Australia mu3t bring its defences to a standard which will be compatible with national safety and international obligations. That is precisely what the statesmen of the world were all saying prior to the war in 1914, and we know what it led to. The right honourable member for Cowper rose, I believe, chiefly for the purpose of misrepresenting what I said regarding Russia, and also to put in a out by the universities-me n who have no career before them unless they can be absorbed in the army. The Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis) tried to brush aside what I said regarding the destroyers which are being sent out to Australia; but, though I did not get my information from departmental heads, it is probably just as reliable as his own. The Assistant Minister sought to evade the real issue, and there seems to be a callous disregard, either by the Minister or by the officers who advise him, .regarding the safety of the men who are to man these vessels. member a full reply. Minister deliberately evaded my question, and, even though I made the inquiry a second time, I did not get the information I sought.

188,Mr Rosevear,"The Assistantappeared in the Sydney Morning Herald for the 12th October :The nnvul correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph says tliat the real reason why the fleet exercises were cancelled was that nearly all tlie destroyers were fifteen or sixteen years old, and none too robust. It was feared that driving them into heavy seas at speeds of even 25 knots might have entailed costly damage to these old crocks. I asked the Minister whether the destroyers being brought to Australia were' of the type referred to in the newspaper message. I made the inquiry on two occasions, and the Minister deliberately side-stepped the question. However, when I asked h i m how old were the destroyers which are coming to Australia, I found that, they were built in exactly the same year as the old crocks that could not put to sea to take part in the British naval manoeuvres. They are between fifteen and sixteen years old, and have long been obsolete, though the says that we may get five years' useful work out of them in Australian waters. It is going to cost £1,000,000 for the upkeep of these vessels, which are, in reality, no more than useless hulks. If the Minister disputes what I say, let him make inquiries, and he w ill establish its truth. I make bold to say that the Government has been forced, by outside into additional expenditure During the last few months there has been a deliberate attempt, especially in Sydney, to arouse some enthusiasm for and naval preparedness. associations, in Sydney, have been prominent in this attempt, Denison, a newspaper proprietor, bably actuated by a desire to provide an the system by which appointments of interesting This gentlemen is supported by another are made, and the way in which applicawho was recently restored to the ranks tions are dealt w it h for the admission of of solicitors his character. political colour, it was found necessary to applicants for cadetship at the M i l it a r y obtain a parliamentary the choice fell upon an whose star has been for some waning. eagerly seized the opportunity himself once more before the public, and, for appointment are the only consideraif possible, to restore his prestige. A good tions. Mr Rosevear. deal of money was spent, and attempts were made to work up huge public rallies, though not always w i th conspicuous success. In Melbourne the results were particularly unfortunate. As the result of this combined effort by a newspaper magnate, certain Empire organizations, and a political star already on the wane, the Government became so scared that the Ministerf o r Defence (Senator Pearce) took a most unusual course of action. If any member of this House, even a member of the Government party, had sought information regarding the Government's defence proposals, he would have been politely told that it was not usual for the Government to disclose its policy in answer to questions. Members of Parliament are generally kept in the dark regarding such matters u n t i l the Government makes its pronouncements in the House. On this occasion, however, a fortnight before the meeting, of Parliament, and even before the Government's own Minister supporters had been taken into its confidence, Senator Pearce went out of his way to attend a function at the Millions Club, in Sydney, and there he announced the defence policy of the Government. Probably he was afraid that his position as Minister for Defence was being undermined by the propagandists, and he thought, it necessary to assert himself. A t any rate, the propaganda was successful, influences, and now the Government has sought to on defence. j u s t if y this expenditure by hinting at the possibility of an invasion. The party to which I belong stands for the adequate military defence of Australia, and it is always Certain Empire prepared to state what, in its opinion, with their head-quarters constitutes adequate defence. proI should like the Minister to explain feature for his newspapers. cadets to the M i l it a r y Training College without any stain on cadets to the A i r Eorce.

I hope that the Minister will explain why this unfair practice has, apparently, been adopted. Applications are now being called for cadets for the Air Eorce, and owing to the general depression, no doubt a large number of applications will be received. I should like to be informed as to how the selection will he made. During the present discussion, comment has been made concerning the attitude of the Minister for Defence in the Scullin Government ( Mr A. Green) to certain training establishments. The information which I have before me justifies the action of the Scullin Government in checking the extravagance of the Defence Department. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) was informed in this chamber, some time ago, that 51 scholars at the Jervis Bay Naval College cost £1,322 per annum for each scholar, and that £871,976 had been expended in producing 208 scholars who had graduated through the college. Each of these scholars cost £4,192. Department was nearly as extravagant. It cost £52,75S to educate 69 scholars for one year, each scholar involving the expenditure of £764. The total cost by the time the question by the honourable member for Melbourne was asked, was £1,021,508 to pass 355 graduated scholars, the expenditure for each scholar being £2,S77. Those who have visited Jervis Bay will agree that every convenience was provided there for both the instructors and the scholars, and that the institution generally Avas conducted on very costly, if not extravagant, lines. I consider that the action in that matter taken by the Scullin Government was justified, and me* with the approval of the people generally. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr and the wastage to become non-apparent. Rosevear) referred to the destroyers which are a gift from Great Britain, and arc now on their way to Australia. History seems to be repeating itself. Not many years ago a government of the same political colour as that of the present Ministry brought from Great Britain five am informed or seven submarines of the "" J "" class. I was then employed by the Defence Department as an electrical fitter, and I worked on those submarines. They were Britain, and over £70,000 was spent in reconstructing submarine J.7, whilst large sums have been spent on the other vessels. After all the work had been , done, and the usual trials had been made, these vessels were sent to Geelong. They were practically laid on the inudbanks there, and were never of any value to the community. Finally', they were sold for scrap. The public is entitled to know why a policy of this kind is adopted. What is the object of bringing vessels to Australia when they are sixteen years old? Probably the Australia, which was sunk a few years ago, would not have been of a much greater age than sixteen years if it had been kept, in commission. The only consolation about this amazing practice is that it has .provided, employment for Australians ; but the money could be spent to better purpose, for it is practically thrown away. The honourable member for Dalley remarked' that these destroyers were unfitted for the ordinary manoeuvres of the The Military British Navy, yet the Government has accepted them. No doubt it will be necessary to refit the vessels immediately they reach these shores, and work . will thus be provided for a few dockyard men, though I am sure these men would rather have their energies directed to employment for which the community would receive some value and return. It looks as though those who have spoken on these Estimates from the other side of the chamber are preparing for another war. One would hardly think that, so soon after the last conflict, any person would have the temerity to advocate another war. The usual practice is to allow, a sufficient time to elapse for the memory to grow dim But, .strange though it seems, influential persons in the financial world are issuing propaganda that has for its pur-., pose the embroiling of different countries in a worse struggle than that through which we last passed. One pleasing feature that has been brought out by this",61,Littleton Groom Th E Nations And She Has Persistently Endea
191,Mr Beajsley,"Idebate is the attitude of many prominent. church dignitaries towards the question. I was intensely gratified when I read the drastic resolutions that a recent Anglican conference in Sydney passed, against the war-mongering that has been indulged in and the jingoistic speeches that have been delivered in Australia. Those resolutions indicate that these gentlemen are prepared to adopt a very definite attitude, and that they will cultivate in their congregations a line of thought that will lead to the brushing aside by the people of statesmen who are not able to settle these problems in the way but never reached the point of causin which at the termination of the last war they promised they would be settled. A gentleman in Great Britain said last week that he would advocate the taking of the front line trenches by those persons, particularly politicians, who are so fond of talking about war, because such an experience would probably give them a different outlook on the matter. The best way' to test their sincerity would be to place them in that position. These are encouraging signs, indicating as they do that there is not the measure of hypocrisy about this subject that I . thought existed. in progress, the* people were encouraged to believe that it was a war to end all wars; that, the struggle having been brought to a successful conclusion, the world would settle down and differences would be adjusted by peaceful methods. The men who were responsible for that statement were either hyprocrites or absolutely incapable of discharging the duties entrusted to them. I cannot believe that they were incapable, because they possessed a fairly high degree of intelligence, and sufficient knowledge to understand the meaning of their language. If they are prepared to countenance another war, they have more "" hide"" than I thought they possessed. The women folk, particularly those whose sons and husbands would be. embroiled in such a struggle, I am certain, regard with disgust those who are talking about war to-day. They have, perhaps, suffered the most, and fromconversations that I have had, I know that they are in fear and trembling. If an attempt is made to rush Australia into a struggle similar to that from which it if r . Beasley. has just emerged, I am confident that their voice will be strongly heard. I had the privilege of visiting the Continent ; some years after the termination of the last conflict, and on one occasion was conducted through Krupp's works in Essen, where I discussed the war with a man who was associated with the establishment. I naturally remarked upon the strangeness of their having missed air raids and similar misfortunes, and the reply that I received was "" They came close to our locality, ing us any trouble"". Honourable members will recollect that, following the war, strong references were made in regard to British interests in these enemy works. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has read an enlightening report' of a special committee of the League of Nations,'which recorded in strong language its condemnation of armament firms, and the influence that they are able to wield in quarters where wars are begun. Erom the experience that I gained from mixing with representatives of other countries as the repreWhile the last war was sentative of the Australian workers at the International Labour Office, I am perfectly satisfied that, if there were a little more straightforward discussion, if secret diplomacy were unmasked, and if men would speak their minds freely, greater progress would be made in the cause of peace and humanity. The horrors and miseries of the last struggle must be sufficiently vivid in the minds of all honourable members, irrespective of whatever military associations some may have, to induce them to make every effort to secure the adoption of peaceful methods for the settlement' of international differences. . our political differences without war. some circumstances. Buti f the honourable member, who is blind, needed a hand to guide him across this chamber or elsewhere, that assistance would be forthcoming as an act of humanity, despite our political differences. Our disagreements in regard to policy may be fundamental, but we have the right to apply what we think will",62,Littleton Groom Th E Nations And She Has Persistently Endea

193,Mr Beasley,"That may happen inhave the most beneficial results. We are sincere in our-beliefs, arid shall continue to struggle in the hope that there will be some reward for the sufferings of the past, and that we shall prevent Australia from being led into a worse conflict than that through which it has only recently passed. ciate myself with the protest that has been made against additional provision for the defence of Australia. I daresay that every honourable member has received a communication on this subject from the Society of Friends. The first point that it makes is "" War contravenes the spirit of Christianity"". I s there a member of the committee who does not believe that that is so? Yet, for two days and nights, we have debated provision for arming ourselves to the teeth for the purpose of killing people. MrE . F . HARRISON -Fo r the purpose of .avoiding war. MrE . F . HARRISON is "" Armaments tend to breed suspicion and f e a r "" . government supporters claim to be stalwart champions of private enterprise, which they would have us believe can do everything so much better than a government can, I have heard no one suggesting that in war time we should hand ' over our defence forces to Sir Samuel Hordern or any other captain of industry. No ; they agree that, however good private enterprise may be in control of industrial activities, it must not be entrusted with the armies and the navy of the nation during a war. No one had said that the Government is not capable of controlling the defence forces of this country, yet when we suggest that it should control other activities for tbe nation, we are told that such a course would lead to disaster. The third reason advanced by the Society of Friends against proposals' for increases of armaments isWar is probably the greatest potential enemy of mankind,and unchecked competition in arms leads to war. Yet the honourable member for Bendigo( MrE . F . Harrison) declares that we must arm ourselves to tlie teeth in order, as he says, to prevent war! I have had something to do with the training of dogs, and I know how they strain at the leash when they are in fit condition. My fear is that if we follow the advice of the militarist members of this Parliament, and arm and train our men t ill they become expert in the use of the bayonet on bags of straw, which are used as dummies for the enemy, they w ill eventually become imbued with the spirit of war, and be eager to stick their bayonets in potential enemies. MrE . F . HARRISON -They w ill know how to defend themselves when attacked. attack them? What nation do we fear? I well remember seeing before the war a placard over the business premises of Mr R. B . Orchard, a former member for Nepean, urging Australia to beware of Japan. When war broke out, and when Japan was our remove that placard, because it would It is a true one. have given offence to a friendly power. We all remember the boycott of German goods during the war, and recall also the That is true. Although exaggerated reports that appeared in the capitalist press of German soldiers marching through Belgium on their way to Paris, murdering the Belgian people and carrying Belgian babies on their bayonet points. Then there were the gruesome and circumstantial reports of the manner in which the Germans were treating their enemy dead. Instead of burying them decently, they were, so it was reported, boiling down the bodies for their f a t contents! All these reports of German atrocities, we discovered later, to be a tissue of lies, but they served their purpose. During the conscription campaign in Australia the right honourable the then a member of the Tasmanian Parliament-cam e over to speak at a great anticonscription rally in the Sydney TownH a l l .

I made some notes, and I claim the right to reply to him, because Avhat happened before may occur again. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Bil l returned from the Senate Avith a Hutchin) has suggested that a ballot should be taken of all men from 18 to 40, and that those selected should be called up and be given camp training for three Aveeks in every year. As the honourable member comes from Tasmania, South Wales, turned his I dare say it prompted his suggestion for to Queensland, declara ballot or lottery. In this -that he Avould carry the case it Avould be a lottery of human life. We are opposed to Avar of any description. Because Eugene V.

Because Carl Leibknecbt, a German socialist and a member of the Reichstag, said to the German soldiers Avho Avere starting their march from Berlin through Belgium to Paris, ""Stop; your enemies are in Berlin; they are among the class that has been exploiting the Avorkers during the ages; stay here and fight them"", he .was interned, and aftenvards sentenced to tAvo years' imprisonment.

If the unemployed of the Territory are not the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, who is responsible for their maintenance? 3. Is this embargo to remain on these unfortunate men for the rest of their lives? honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. In view of the large influx into It is the Northern Territory of unemployed men from the States, the Government decided in 1932 to limit the grunting of unemployment relief to men who had been in the Territory for a period of twelve months prior to 31st December, 1931. A t the time, the Government was expending large sums of money in maintaining unemployed men who could not be regarded, in any way, as permanent residents of the Territory. Tho majority of them had recently arrived in the Territory from the States, many as stowaways on boats trading to Darwin. There was no opportunity, whatever, of these men securing employment in the Territory, as neither government nor private funds were available for developmental works. The Government realized its responsibility for maintaining the unemployed who were permanent residents of the Territory, but considered that, in the interests of the men themselves, they should be discouraged from leaving the States and proceeding to the Northern Territory. It was decided, therefore, to fix a period which should be accepted as qualifying for being regarded as a permanent resident, and for unemployment relief. The period of twelve months prior to December, 1931, was adopted. 3. The men who were in the Territory on The answers to the the 31st December, 1931, and did not qualify for unemployment relief, were offered, at the expense of the Government, passages back to the States from whicli they proceeded to the Territory.
