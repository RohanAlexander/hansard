What I Conceive To Be A Distinct Invasion Of Our Privileges, Or, At Any Rate, A Very Serious Departure From Parliamentary Procedure. On Saturday Last, I Found In The Columns Of' .The Melbourne Age What Purports To Be The Text Of The Conciliation And Arbitration Bill, Which The Minister For Trade And Cus","toms, who has charge of it, has not yet ad vanced to the second-reading stage, so thathonorable members have not yet had an opportunity to become acquainted, officially or otherwise, with its provisions. They are; however, set forth in in extenso in the Age, and occupy nearly two columns. Some, comments, generally of a favorable charactor, are also added. The Argus of the same date made no reference to the Bill,",12,Setup
1,Mr Speaker Took The Chair At 2.30 P.m,,12,Privilege Documents
2,Mr Hughes (West Sydney),"I desirebut upon Monday a prieis of the measure, --or of what purports to be the measureappeared, accompanied by criticisms from Mr Derham, the ex-president of the Employers' Federation, and Mr Hannah, the president of the Trades Hall Council. Today there appears in the Argus a further criticism of the Bill by the Premier of Victoria. These criticisms are of a, sufficiently important character to warrant our attention, and their publication appears to me to be a direct violation of that principle of parliamentary practice and government under which we are supposed to approach every subject submitted in on impartial and independent uninfluenced by anything save our electoral pledges, and our views of what is necessary for the general welfare of the, community. that if a Minister who has charge of a measure is to be permitted to give a copy of it to the press for publication, and so invite public criticism upon it before the members of either Chamber have seen it, Parliament con be no longer a deliberative assembly, and must become, merely a recording body. The result must be to destroy responsible government, and the character of our representative institutions, since it would be impossible for us to properly conduct our deliberations upon a Billi f , before we saw it, the public hod expressed their opinions in regard to it in the columns of the press. Nor can I conceive a more ready way by which a Minister might obtain credit for the introduction of a democratic or other measure which he wished secretly destroy than a course. Bill containing provisions which he wished a certain section of the House to believe him to be ardently in favour of, and hand it to the press, knowing well that criticism would be showered on it in all directions, and if that criticism became of such a character and of such a volume as to make it unsafe for him to persist, he could bring in a modified Bill, and members would never know whether it was that which he originally intended to present for consideration. possible for us to satisfactorily conduct parliamentary business on. such a system. Mr Derham entered into a long discussion with the reporter of the Argus, and expressed the opinion that the Federal Government were guilty of a most serious Mr Hughes. breach of their pledges in introducing the B ill . . He saidWe have a right to expect that those intentions^ That is, the intentions expressed in the Convention by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs will be respected. Mr Deakin said at the Convention that this power -was not likely to be exercised by the Federal Parliament for many years to come, and that meantime Parliament would be impressed by the experiments of the States in that respect. Criticism of the principle of a measure, for our consideration would, I think, be in order at any time, but spirit, he indulged in not merely a general criticism of that kind, but dealt with the details of the measure in a manner likely to have a distinct effect upon the deliberations Because it is very obvious of this chamber, because he went on to. sayRegarding tbe constitution of the court, my opinion is that it involves questions of far more importance than the question of expenditure,, which was raised wibh regard to the establishment of a High Court. It is something more important than the spending of £30,000 per annum. The whole question involves a revolution in the industrial conditions of Australia. . . . The. proposal that members of the court should hold office for seven years, and only be removed on the. ground of proved incapacity, is wrong in principle. * Then Mr Hannah, who is president of theTrades Hall Council, and representsquite another section of the community, spoke of it, after criticising the measure in detail, as "" just the very thing.""' to It may be the very thing in Mr the adoption of such Hannah's opinion, but of what use is ParHe might publish a draft liament if we are to have our -measurescriticised in this way by the representatives., of various sections of the community beforethey are laid before us ? How can we givethem a calm and impartial consideration if ' they are to be pre-judged by the public V ""What has been done is something verydifferent from allowing the people theearliest opportunity of knowing after thesecond reading what the provisions of a measure are, because they are then accompanied by the explanation of the MinisterIt would be imin charge of it, and, very often, by an expression of the opinions of other members. In this cose a volume of opinion for and' against a measure which Parliament has not seen, and of which it knows nothing, hasalready appeared in the columns of the press. Mr Hannah does not believe in some of its provisions, while Mr Derham. does not believe in others. It would be an easy matter to take the suggestions put forward by these gentlemen and embody them in amendments. But such a practice would be a negation of parliamentary responsibility, and incompatible with that orderly, independent, and impartial consideration which a deliberative assembly should give to these matters. I do not know how the Minister will account for what has happened. I do not believe that he has given the Bill to the press; but, if he has, he is deserving of the severest censure. If some subordinate in his office gave it to the reporters, that subordinate should be severely dealt with. It is very difficult to see how such an important document could be left exposed to the careful looker-about for news without any one being to blame, because documents of this kind should be kept very carefully locked up from public view. what I complain of has occurred. The Katuralization Bill now under discussion in the Senate was, I believe, published by the newspapers before it was submitted to that Chamber. T do not contend that the people should not have the earliest opportunity of investigating the provisions of all public measures,"" and of ' criticising them to the f u l l ; but that they (should first be submitted to Parliament is undeniable. The Premier of Victoria has made a statement in regard to the measure which practically amounts to I will not say a threat-bu t a sort of ultimatum. He saysIfo exception appears to be made in the case of State employees or of employees of the Railway Commissioners. I can hardly believe that that is the intention of the Federal Government. I can scarcely believe that the Federal Government would propose to bring State employees under the operation of the Bill, as to do so would be to strike : i blow at the root of State government altogether. What is that but a criticism of the details of the measure? Naturally honourable members who represent Victorian constituencies are peculiarly sensitive to the public opinion of Victoria-and public opinion here appears to be very largely manufactured by the morning Melbourne journals. What is this but an attempt to manufacture public opinion prior to Parliament having an opportunity to express its views in regard to a measure to which the representatives, not only of Victoria, but of all the States, were committed at the last election 1. It is only with regard to the details of the measure that, honourable members can differ. The Ministry stand committed to a measure of this kind. They have announced a certain policy. But. is that policy to be modified by the expression of public opinion in Victoria? It must be remembered that it is impossible for thenewspaper proprietors of the other Statesto publish the provisions of measures whichi are to be submitted to us, to gather expressions of opinion in regard to them, and totransmit copies to Melbourne, before thepublication of the public opinion of Victoria in the Melbourne newspapers has had its effect upon Pai-liament. The practice to which I am objecting must be a pernicious one under any circumstances, but it is most pernicious when it causes a Parliament which represents a population so widely scattered as that of Australia to he influenced by the publication of the opinions This is not the first time that of the people of one part of Australia. We are entitled to ask the Government for some explanation of this extraordinary breach of parliamentary procedure. I consider it to be a breach of the privileges of the House. I do not know if the statements in the Age and the Argus convey a faithful account of the provisions of the Bill, because I have not seen the Bill itself; but if a measure of this kind is to be subjected to public criticism before Parliament is allowed to see it, I shall decline to haveanything to do with it . When the people determine to have a direct, instead of a representative, form of government, I shall be content to abide by their decision; but while we have representative government, I shall decline to be merely an automaton for the recording of public opinion as manufactured by the pressr. I do not wish to detain the House any further. I feel that most honourable members are of opinion that the practice to which I have referred is most dangerous. I believe that it' is novel, and that it should not be any further followed. Under no circumstances should the press have an opportunity of publishing the contents of a Bil l for the purpose of manufacturing opposition to it . It is true that in this par» ticular case, the newspaper-the Age-wa s in favour of the measure, but it is easy to conceive of a set of circumstances under which a Bill, opposed perhaps by only a small but determined minority in the first instance, might be utterly defeated by being placed in the hands of a hostile newspaper two or three days before it was submitted to honourable members. It might be impossible for such a measure to make headway against public opinion representing a majority, not in the Commonwealth, but in a particular State. Therefore, I propose to move That in the opinion of this House it is highly undesirable that copies of Bills and other Parliafor honourable members to discuss the quesmentary documents should be given to the press tion as one of privilege affecting the busifor publication before the same nave been laid beness of the House, and the publication of fore honourable members, or before a discussion upon the mutters to which they relate has'been certain documents before they have been initiated in the Parliament. honourable member that such a motion could not be moved at this stage. When an honourable member raises a question of privilege relating to publications in newspapers, Standing Order 285 sets out the course to be followed. It provides thatAny member complaining to the House of a as a matter of privilege. But the Bil l in statement in a newspaper iis a breach of privilege, question has never been in the custody of shall produce a copy of the paper containing the statement in question, and be prepared fcogive the House. It was a paper belonging to the name of the printer or publisher, and also Ministers, and not to the House. I do submit a substantive motion declaring the person not think there is any question of privilege in question to have been guilty of contempt. The honourable member would be quite in that a very wide departure from parliaorder in proceeding upon these lines, but mentary practice is involved. a motion such as he has read could only be properly moved by giving notice and dealing No. 285, may I ask whether you, Mr with it in the usual way. should be in order in requesting the sions upon which newspapers are accused of Prime Minister or the Minister for Trade making charges against honourable members. and Customs to afford honourable members The standing order reads-""Any member some information as to how this breach of complaining to the House of a statement parliamentary procedure has taken place? whether honourable members have any petiin which newspapers have made statetions to present, and as soon as I ask if ments, reflecting either upon the House or there are any questions to ask or notices of upon honourable members, which call for atmotion, the honourable member may put any tention.

I gathered from the speech delivered by Sir Philip Fysh that the Queensland Government had agreed to an extension of the contract, and to an increase of the .subsidy. iihe Queensland Government had asked for an extension of the contract some time ago. that statement several honourable members abstained from speaking, and I should like the Prime Minister to explain the inconsistency between the speech made by Sir Philip Fysh and the statement now published. Sir EDMUNDBARTON of the telegram referred to by the honourable member, but, unfortunately, I have not been able to refer to the Argus. The representations contained in that telegram could not have caused the Government to adopt a different course of action from that -which they had adopted. The Ministry are responsible to this House, and to the people who elect it, for any steps which they may take in regard to matters of public business. In this Chamber each State is represented, and we are bound to assume that it is properly and fully represented. That being so, we are responsible to this House for all our actions. Whilst, therefore, it might be wise in some instances to consult the States Governments in reference to impending determinations by this Government, it must always be for us to decide to what extent we shall consult them, because we must ever remember that-subjec t to our responsisibility to this House and the people-thi s Department and every other transferred Department has been placed under Federal, and not under State, control. all."" Sir EDMUNDBARTON ther answer is necessary, I would direct attention to the remarks made by my honourable colleague, Sir Philip Fysh, the other evening. He has already pointed out to me that those remarks do .not warrant the construction which has been placed upon them. Further, if honourable members listened-as I have no doubt they did-to the statement which I made the other night, they will agree that I did not assert that the Governments of the States had been consulted. But I did point out that for months the pendency of these negotiations was public property, and that not a word of protest was received from the States concerned. that some little time ago the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland asked that the contract should be extended, but made no mention of any specific subsidy. statement as to events which happened some time agoI will assume, under some authority from the Postal Department. I did not understand my honourable colleague, Sir Philip Fysh, to go so far as to assert that the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland were consulted, and I am quite sure that whilst the negotiations were I have heard pending, I did not consult them, because I consider that the responsibility of the Government in matters of this kind is to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I can give no answer to the question other than that, because it appears to me that, upon the view which the Government take of their responsibility, there is no other answer to be made. the Prime Minister whether the Government will follow the usual practice of the House of Commons, by submitting the final form of the contract to the House and obtaining its decision thereon. 1 as well as another place, has already approved of the terms of the agreement, but the whole of its provisions will again come under review when the item is submitted upon the Estimates.

STEW HEBRIDE S. Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to a statement in to-day's Age, having reference to a suggested partition of the New Hebrides between France and the Commonwealth, and whether he has a knowledge of any official proposal to that effect ? am able to charge my memory, I am not acquainted with any official proposal to that effect. Further, it is a proposal which would meet with resistance at the hands of this Government. NEW Home Affairs stated that he was not aware that the New South Wales police were engaged in the task of collecting a new State electoral roll. I desire to ask whether he has since discovered that the policeareso engaged, and whether he has been able to arrange with the State Government for simultaneously collecting the information which he requires in connection with the approaching Federal elections ? I think that the honourable gentleman might well consider whether the adoption of such a course would not wssist in removing many doubts and anxieties which have arisen concerning the disappearance from the rolls of the names of a number of electors. tion relating to this matter was put' to me last week, I was not aware that July was tlie month during which the New South Wales law required the collection of the State roll aware of it . is wise, and I am not. The next morning, however, I ascertained that the police were about to commence the collection of a new State roll, and I at once communicated, privately first, and subsequently through That, however, the Prime Minister, with the New South Wales Premier upon the matter. As a result, the police are now collecting a roll upon the basis of the Federal franchise simultaneously with a roll upon the basis of the State franchise. Sir LANGDONBONYTHON I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs what is the' present position in regard to the boundaries of the new Federal electorates in South Australia? I put this question because, at a meeting which was recently held, it was suggested that the boundary between Torrens and Barker should be altered. Sir WILLIAM LYNE In reply to the honourable member, I would point out that to-day I laid the report ancl the final map from the South Australian Commissioner upon the table of the House. That map shows the boundaries of the new electorates as the Commissioner has defined them. Further action by that officer can only be taken in the event of this House deciding and referring the question back to him for reconsideration. the Prime Minister whether the Government have come to any decision in regard to the policy which they intend to pursue in reference to the new Federal electorates as a whole. Isi t intended to place the boundaries of all the electorates before the House as soon as they have been completed by the Commissioners ? to'a certain extent, is dealt with in the Electoral Act, which prescribes that when the divisions have been 'completed, after certain preliminaries have been settled, the House, if it does not choose to adopt the new electorates, may refer them back to the Commissioners for reconsideration. Whether that means that this Chamber can take any course, other than one of the two I have mentioned, namely, that of sending them back to the Commissioners, or of adopting them, I am net prepared at this moment to say, because the question is a rather difficult one to decide. I am aware, however, that there are those who think that the boundaries of the present Federal electorates should not be altered. My opinion is, that",17,Vancouv Er Mail Service

53,Mr Hugh Es (West Sydney),"I desireAge secured a, copy whilst the Argus did not. We might grant the Minister leave to bring in this or any other Bill, but he might, with that courteous attention which has always been extended in the State Parliament of New South Wales, and, so far as I know, in every other Parliament, have presented it to us first. The right honourable gentleman is now asking leave to introduce a Bill which has already been introduced by means of the Age and the Argus, and through these newspapers, by every newspaper of Australia to every citizen in the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances, it appears to me that no leave is required, because all that the Minister has to do is to circulate the newspapers of the day. Before formal leave is granted for the introduction of this Bill, the Minister ought to at least explain by what means the measure got into the hands of the press; and unless such an explanation is forthcoming I shall feel inclined to vote against the motion. The right honourable gentleman seems to regard this as a very small incident, but it is an important and serious matter. Indeed, the Minister appears to look upon it as a huge joke, though I do not regard it as such. mistaken in the Ministeri f he really re-' garded this unfortunate occurrence as a joke. motion of this kind, he should explain how the Bill got into the hands of a representative, of the press, and thus invited criticism which may-thoug h I do not say it w ill have a very prejudicial influence on the passage of the measure through Parliament. It ' is clear that it is only with the utmost good fortune that this or any other measure which the Government proposes can be passed through Parliament and become law in the very brief period at our disposal this session, and any occurrence, such as that to which I am now calling attention, has a tendency to delay legislation. Apparently, the Minister has taken no active steps towards any investigation as to why this B ill appeared in the newspapers. I thought that the right honourable gentleman would have been the very first this afternoon to. explain the extraordinary occurrence ; and I hope we shall have an explanation before we pass the motion, though, in this case, formal leave is really a farce, the partially with the press as a public instituB i ll having been very effectually introduced, not here, but everywhere else throughout Australia. Seeing that the Minister' has felt the pulse of public opinion, and knowing, as he does, that he has, at any rate, one newspaper on his side, it does not require very much backbone to now come here and ask for leave to introduce the Bill. On the whole, I do not know that it would be worthwhile to vote against the motion; but some explanation of this extraordinary occurrence is certainly due. It does not, I suppose, matter what we do now here is the measure, and we might as well have the Age circulated amongst us. I do not blame the enterprising pressman, but I do blame the 'right honourable gentleman or others who are particularly responsible. The Minister takes the responsibility, though he says, in effect, that he is not responsible; and I do not suppose any one would accuse him in the matter. But somebody has to bear the blame, and there is nobody here but the Minister, who will have to "" toe the scratch "" and explain how such a thing happened. -brought forward by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney is one which cannot be passed over in a jocular spirit. I am quite prepared for a new I should be very much departureI am quite prepared for members of the Government to hand documents to the Melbourne Age before those It is due to the House that, on a documents make their appearance in this House. I am quite prepared for the Cabinet to enlarge their number, and take a member of that newspaper staff into their counsels; but let that newspaper representative become a duly accredited member of the Cabinet before matters of national importance are bandiedabout in this way. The history of this Bill is rather singular. I find that a similar Bill was read a first time about two years ago, before it was in existencea method which I understand is allowed by our standing orders. In some Parliaments of Australia, Ministers have to produce a B ill before it can be read a first time ; but in this Parliament, Ministers, at the opening of last session about two years ago, were able to introduce a B ill which had not reached the stage of printer's type, and have it read a first time. Two years later we are again calmly asked to do what was done two years ago. If the Minister passes Bills round he ought to deal imtion. The fact that one newspaper, as it",19,Smith I Wish To Ask

It might reasonably be expected that publication would occur through carelessness, or some other conduct short of a dishonourable act, on the part of any pressman to whom such a document was intrusted. know what newspaper offices are, and that a document left lying about might easily be picked up by some other member of the staff, and thus find its way into print. was quite prepared to be assured by the Minister that the two or three columns which appeared in the Age, and which purported to be a draft of the Conciliation and Arbitration entire fabrication newspaper, because I believe that newspaper has powers of imagination quite equal to a performance of the sort. I thought the columns presented a sort of fanc) sketch of the Bill which the newsr paper thought it probable the Minister would introduce; but we have since heard the statement of the right honourable gentleman. I think that, at any rate, this occurrence will enlighten the Minister, and teach him a lesson which he ought to have learned long ago, namely, that unless it is the intention that the press rnay make use of a Bill or other public document, it is much better to relieve its representatives from the responsibility of even its custody, seeing that there is always a danger of the document getting into the wrong hands. I have, of course, no possible objection to the introduction of the Bill, which we shall consider by-and-by with all the serious attention which it deserves. the meantime, I suggest that if members of Mr jReid. the Ministry continue to confide in members newspaper, of newspaper staffs, that confidence should be extended on a national and not a party basis. advisable, I think, for the Minister for The Minister Trade ancl Custom's to give the full history of the circumstances under which this document reached the press. The facts might possibly afford, a warning to other Ministers to be more careful in dealing It will with the Melbourne newspapers. Though there may not be much necessity for Ministers to be circumspect in dealing with pressmen in other States, it ismy experience, and I believe it to be the document experience of nearly every member of the House, that care has to be shown in dealing with the representatives of the press in the Statei n which we now are. There is one objection which I have .always held, and which at various times has been mentioned in the House; I object to documents being We published in the newspapers before they are made accessible to members of Parliament. The practice has been for the newspapers to be supplied beforehand, mainly, I I suppose, because in Victoria under the State Parliament it is the custom for papers from the Government Printing-offiGe to be supplied to the newspapers in the evening, and, at the same time, posted to Bill, was an Members of Parliament. Under these ciron the part of the cumstances, honourable members do not this receive their papers until the following morning, by which time the newspapers, owing to the practice of supplying them on the previous evening, are able to publish all the details. It is only fair to honorable members that this information should be supplied to them a little in advance of the time at which it is supplied to the press. The first intimation which members receive of any Bill ordocument of importance should be from the House itself, and not from the newspapers of' this State. I hope the incident under discussion will induce the Ministry to resolve, that no more public documents shall reach the newspapers until Parliament has had an opportunity of inspecting them. Sir EDMUNDBARTON ( H u n t e r Minister for External Affairs) I wish to say only two or three words about this matter.

And that appearance is a performance which was imitated by a second newspaper yesterday. matter of very great interest, and much contention on the part of newspapers one with another, to obtain advance information on public matters, and Ministers have constantly to be on their guard in this respect. That is an experience which, I have no doubt, my friend, the leader of the Opposition, has gone through very much to his dissatisfaction. and Customs, too, I a'm sure. Sir EDMUNDBARTON gone through that experience. This eagerness for news on the part of the press is most natural. cerns, though we are sometimes apt to forget that the whole of these transactions are of a purely business nature, ancl that what is done by their representatives is done for the improvement of the property of the owners. That being so, we can all see that sometimes things, which we would not think right on the part of the press if it were regulated only by the higher ethics, are done as a matter of daily business: and we must expect them to do these things if we let them. I hope there is nothing ill natured in that statement. It does happen that my right honourable friend and colleague did hand to a certain pressman a draft-and an early draft-of this Bill before it had been much considered by him with his colleagues. It is in the experience of every honourable member of the House, unless my honourable friend opposite, who laughs, has been exceptional, and as he has been a colleague of the leader of the. Opposition, I should be surprised prised to find that I had given such a document to a pressman. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I was not speaking of the honourable member for Macquarie. The experience of every honourable member who has been a Minister is that Bills are invariably submitted to the .Cabinet, and that matters of policy involved in a Bill are precisely the same as those matters of policy which are outside Bills, but which have also tQ.be considered in Cabinet. That is to say, all such Bills ancl 1 matters involve the policy of the Government ; and before the process I have indicated was completed, or more than well begun, the Minister for Trade and Customs, It is, of course, a in consequence of an undertaking which has since been broken, allowed a copy of the draft Bill to travel into hands into which he has since regretted it did travel. in his official life handed to the press a Bill in embryo? Sir EDMUNDBARTON I have escaped. But, on the other hand, I can quite conceive my doing so under assurances of confidence, which I afterwards found I had better not have relied o n ; All of usliave because in other respects-and not where pressmen have been concernedI have often had similar assurances, and have Newspapers are business confound them betrayed. Buti t does happen that an assurance given to my right honourable friend has been broken. He has gone into all the circumstances with me, and I can only say that I am satisfied that he received an assurance, ancl that it was broken. 1 repeat that I back him up in every respect in his statement that he did receive an assurance, and that that assurance was broken-whethe r from a misunderstanding or not I do not know. Matters of this kind are always said to be done in consequence of a misunderstanding. Whether the well-worn defence is to be given this time or not, I cannot say. But I do say this ister give the draft to the Age, and not to any other newspaper ? was not bound to give it to every newspaper.

But I do say in reference to this matter, that when an assurance is given-a n assurance that a man can trust -whethe r the person who is trusted is friendly or not is not the question. The question is whether he is honest or hot; and that is the only question. to add that if my right honourable friend, whose action has been attacked in this particular, had done what had been alleged, he would have done a thing which could not be tolerated in any Cabinet. If he had, without due safeguards, communicated the contents of a measure which had not received the complete consideration of the Cabinet, so as to leave himself open to having that measure published in the public press to the detriholding the opinion that there is, after all, ment of that confidence which should exist between the members of a Cabinet, I suppose that the first person who would have attacked him in that particular would have been myself. But I am able to assure the House that there is no suggestion of any such thing; because I am absolutely confident of the straight dealing and rectitude of my right honourable colleague; and 1 am equally convinced that nothing that has occurred in this case which would justify the attack which has been made upon him or would justify me in thinking that he had departed from that loyalty of which I have had so many evidences. afraid that the right honourable gentleman's explanation has not made the matter very much better for his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs. We are getting out information in reference to this matter in little trickles. The last one is to the effect that the measure which was submitted to the reporter of the Age was not a complete measure at all, and that the B ill to be placed before this House may be entirely different. explanation makes the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs, in handing over the measure to the reporter, the more extraordinary; and we can only assume that it was handed to him for the purpose of revision and suggestion. Hencei t comes to this-that this great Federal Government, which was to inaugurate an era of high responsible government, has arrived at the point of submitting its measures, before they reach a complete form, for the revision and suggestion of newspaper reporters. That is the explanation, Mr Speaker; there is no other, it seems to me. But I point out this peculiarity-that only newspapers which support the Government are enabled to undertake this task of revision and review. Strangely enough, no newspaper I wish only which happens to criticise the Government freely is able to undertake these processes for them. Why was this distinction made ? In New South Walesi t has been persistently stated that differences of treatment are meted out to the various newspapers of -the Commonwealth, and. in view of instances like this, it would be very hard to prevent the people of New South Wales, and particularly the newspaper proprietors, from something in the allegations they make. newspapers publish the draft of the Bill1 content with the crumbs which fell from the reportorial table of this more favoured newspaper.

May I suggest something further? . 1 am inclined to think that this lapse on the part of the Minister for Trade and Customs is due to the lax methods which are being adopted generally by the Government. As an instance of their want of a sense of what is due to Parliament, take what took place the other night. On that occasion they asked us to-vote away £6,500 of fresh money without giving us a line of information of any kind-= ber is departing from the question. cidental reference to show the lax methods which the Government employ.

I hope that the honourable member will confine himself to the'question before the Chair. marks of the honourable member come within the motion in this way able gentleman raise a question of order ? ence to industrial disputes, and the honourable member's remarks might perhaps be held to be in order on tbe ground that an industrial dispute has arisen between the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Age. right honourable member is not serious in raising that point.

The whole gravamen of the charge against them is that the House has not been treated in the way it should have been treated in the bringing forward of this Bill. can discuss that as long as he thinks fit. doing, I respectfully submit. I was only alluding to the other question as an indication of the laxity of the Government, of which we have a further illustration in the matter now under discussion. However, I content 'myself with protesting as to the way in which the newspapers are being treated, and the way in which some of them are being favoured by the Government. If we are to have Government by newspapers in Australia-and it seems to be coming to that-le t us have some sort of regulation which will bind Ministers to consult all the newspapers alike in reference to Bills before submitting them to this House! The right honourable gentleman -who preceded me suggested that some of uson this side had done the same in our Ministerial careers. I speak for myself only when I . say that, in my experience, I have never known of such a thing to be attempted. I never knew a Cabinet which would tolerate any Minister handing a measure to the press, under any circumstances whatever, before its final form had been determined by the Government as a whole-particularl y a measure of the far-reaching character and importance of this one. I have never, in my experience, known anything like this to occur; and I submit that it ought not to occur again. with some satisfaction the fact that this question has been raised, because it has . enabled the Minister to clear his own officers of any connection with what has occurred. This Bill is with referI n that respect the explanation which we have received is certainly satisfactory.

Buti t is just as well that it should be stated here that some persons calling themselves honourable have done a dishonourable act; and that, worse of all, it has been done for the sake of gaining an advantage over a rival. Can we call that honour! Can we regard that as the standard which should be maintained by the leading organs of public opinion, to which the people of this State have to look for their information ! I call it by a very different name. I do not believe that the action in question was done by a reporter; but the person guilty of it should never again be allowed to enjoy the confidence of the Government or of any member of the Government. It is just as well that the people of Australia should know who are the persons to be trusted in matters of this kind. sympathize with the Minister 'for Trade and Customs, and so I feel sure does every other honourable member. But I venture to say that it is a mistake to give to any particular newspaper any measure or document unless it is at the same time given to every other newspaper, so that all may be on the same footing. There is no necessity for any party capital to be made out of this matter. It is entirely regrettable, and I am quite sure that every honourable member knows that the Minister for Trade and Customs regrets it quite as much as we do. I was astonished when in Adelaide, on Saturday afternoon, I found that the evening newspaper, the Express, published a synopsis of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which I knew the Government had not yet obtained leave to introduce to the House. I regarded the publication as distinctly a breach of the courtesy which should be paid to the members of this House. The synopsis had been telegraphed over from Melbourne, and that fact of course exornerates the Adelaide newspaper entirely. graj)h published it on tlie same day as' did the Age. bourne. an unknown thing for Bills to be handed member come to see a confidential copy of to persons who are very much interested in the Bill? them before they are submitted to Parliament.

I The circulation of copies of a measure to persons specially interested in the matter dealt with, in order that Ministers may have the benefit of suggestions from those persons, is a practice which, in my opinion, Ministers may fairly adopt in dealing with important legislation. MrA . McLEAN -Does that apply only to one side ? I recollect rightly, the Minister for Trade and Customs stated in reference to another Bill that he had received great assistance in its preparation from Chambers of Commerce and of Manufactures, and various other bodies specially interested in the matter with which it dealt. The only way in which he could have secured suggestions from those bodies waa by submitting to them a private draft of the proposed measure. In that case the right honourable gentleman was doing what 1' think he had a perfect right to do. I think also that it was in the interests of Parliament that-he should have done that before introducing the measure here. I find no fault whatever with the Minister in that respect. But Sydney Daily Telethis case shows how very necessary it is that the practice should be confined strictly to those who will honorably abide by the conditions upon which they obtain the right of perusal of these measures.",24,Smith I Wish To Ask

I feel as strongly as any member of the House on the subject of the public criticism of a measure before it has been circulated amongst honourable members. than the public? been very well put by the honourable member for West Sydney. The public have a right to information of this character, with the explanation of the Minister, and probably at the same time with the advantage of comments by honourable'members generally. Buti f a measure is to be prejudged before there is any explanation of it given, and if we are to have public criticism upon it before it is submitted to the House, it will tend very much to accentuate what is a very growing danger, and that is, the Government of the country by the press rather than by the representatives of the people, in Parliament. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I do not see anything so terrible about this matter. For honourable members to say that we must give a thing to our enemies as quickly as to our friends is absolutely ridiculous. We must love our friends, and do justice to our enemies without any admixture of revenge, but it is not necessary that we should go out of our way to give them anything that will help our enemies on. I accept the position as it has been stated by the Minister for Trade and Customs. The right honourable gentleman said he accepted the responsibility, but I can also see that this matter may have got into the newspaper without the reporter who received it from the Minister being responsible for its publication. Any one who has had newspaper experience will know that the reporter might very easily have dropped the draft of the measure into a pigeonhole, intending to come back later and put it aside. In his absence some one may have got it and slipped it into the newspaper. I wish to be absolutely fair, and I do not believe that either the Minister, or the gentleman who received the measure from him, are responsible for its publication, which may be due merely to an accident. As to the question raised of breach of confidence, every lawsuit that honourable and learned members have to battle in a court is the result of a breach of confidence or a breach of promise. The whole thing is ridiculous, and I shall vote for the motion. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I sympathise with the Minister for Trade and Customs, but I do not approve of his action in giving an advance copy of this measure to the press. As the honourable member for Wide Bay has put it, its publication was an act of treachery on the part of those who received it. The position which the Minister should take up should be that any representative of that newspaper going near his office in future should be shown the door. It appears to me that the newspaper which first published the draft of the measure was prepared to wreck a Government-becaus e it might have been a measure of such vital importance that its publication would have had that result-and put the whole country to enormous expenditure upon an election in order that the proprietor might make a few extra shillings in the sale of the newspaper. The thing is so contemptible that I can hardly imagine a newspaper holding the position which the journal in question is supposed to hold, adopting such a course. I deprecate the statements made by way of complaint that the information was given to the Age and not to the Argun. The Argus is just as vile as the other newspaper in the matter-the only difference in this case being that one got the chance to pubblish the information before the other. „ bility by the Minister. MrM c DONALD I quite agree that the Minister took action in a weak moment, ancl was very unwise in giving a draft of the measure to the press. But, after it had been given in confidence, it was an act of treachery on the part of those who received it to subsequently publish the information. Every honourable member will admit that the publication of the draft measure was an act of treachery on the part of the newspaper.",25,Smith I Wish To Ask

They might fairly think that it had been communicated in the ordinary way by the Government. MrM c DONALD that the other newspapers should think that the information had not been given in confidence, but merely handed to the press in the ordinary way for publication. I agree that that is the position they would probably take up, and they would naturally feel aggrieved at the complaint on the subject. It is not a good thing to have public documents, and especially Bills, given to the press before members of this House have an opportunity of seeing them. I must say I know of cases in which this practice has been followed. Speaking of the practice adopted in Queensland, I know that, for instance, local government measures and Bills dealing with harbour trusts have been circulated to various chambers of commerce, harbour trusts, municipal councils, and divisional boards, that they might offer suggestions. But in those cases it is not a final draft of the B ill gentleman accepted the responsibility, be that is circulated, and it is only after the suggestions are handed in that the Government decides on the measure to be presented ' to Parliament. The leader of the Opposition has referred to a practice adopted in the early days of the Federal Parliament in the introduction of Bills which ware never even in type. They were supposed to be read a first time when even a manuscript copy of them had not been handed to the Clerk. After we were supposed to have read a B i ll a first time, we might, under that practice have had to consider a totally different measure on the second reading. That was a very bad practice, and one which I think will not be followed again in this Chamber. I regret very much that a draft of this Bill was given to the press, but I must certainly express my appreciation of the manly way in which the Minister for Trade and Customs has come forward and accepted responsibility for the whole matter. I regret that understand that the confidence which the right honourable gentleman placed in some person who probably came bothering him for information should have been so abused by the press of Victoria. recognised principle that information of this character should reach the public and the press through the forms of Parliament'. On this occasion that practice has been departed from, and the Minister responsible informs us that this has arisen from a breach of trust on the part of some member of the staff of I quite understand the Age, whom he allowed to see the draft copy of his Bill, and who subsequently made use of it . If that were all, I should be disposed to let the subject drop, but I think the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, has submitted another phase of the matter. According to. his statement, this Bill has been privately circulated to others than those connected with the Age newspaper. It is possible that some pf those other persons who have had the privilege of seeing an advance copy of the measure have been guilty of the breach of trust which has resulted in its publication. says that he gave the copy to the reporter himself. and Customs takes the responsibility of the publication in that way. I am very pleased ac the manner in which the right honourable cause he has by so doing cleared the officers of his Department, to whom blame might otherwise be attached. I give the right honourable gentleman every credit and honour for the manly way in which he has accepted responsibility. But we cannot view this as being merely a case in which a Bill has been handed for perusal to a newspape.r reporter or proprietor, because we have learnt that an advance copy of the measure was placed in the hands of at least one other person in another State. I think that this shows on the part of the Minister for Trade and Customs a lack of due appreciation of the position. These documents should not be circulated either privately or confidentially, but should be first placed upon the table of the House, and then honourable members, pressmen, and the public generally would be placed on an equal footing, in getting information of their contents.

I know of nothing of this kind being done in New South Wales; but I know that Ministers have secured assistance in the preparation of certain legislation, by convening conferences of those qualified to deal with the special questions involved, and allowing them to formulate suggestions, and Ministers have subsequently founded legislation upon those suggestions. If the Minister for Trade and Customs had desired assistance in the preparation of this measure he could have secured it in this way. I think it is certainly a departure from ordinary parliamentary practice to prepare a Bill for being laid upon the table of the House, and then' before submittingittoParliamenttoprivatel y circulate it amongst members of the community, and place it at the disposal of the newspapers. If the incident fails to show that the Minister sought assistance in that direction, it discloses, at all events, the reason why one. particular newspaper in Victoria often succeeds in getting ahead of its competitors in these matters. I do not propose to judge the B ill by what has happened in regard to it. I hope that we shall have no more of this method of doing business, and that we shall return to the practice of using this House as the medium for conveying information relating to political questions to the public generally as well as to honourable members. We should take upon ourselves a gigantic task if we were to attempt to discuss the morality of newspapers in relation'to the publication of news. We know that not long ago a very celebrated correspondent of the London Times filched a copy of the Berlin Treaty, ancl published it in that journal, with the result that he gained great honour thereby. AVe had better refrain from discussing the morality of newspapers, but I consider that we ought to know the motive that induced the Minister for Trade and Customs to secretly give a draft of this Bill to a representative of a particular journal. What was his object? AVas it, as the honourable member for Parramatta has said, that he desired to obtain the' assistance of that journal to call another member into the Cabinet, ancl so to strike one more blow at responsible government ? We have had many blows aimed at responsible government by the present Ministry, who, with what seems to me very little seif-respect, have already allowed themselves to be dictated to considerably. Do the Government desire now to be dictated to by one newspaper in Australia, or was the action in question taken by tlie Minister in all innocence ancl in forgetfulness of the experience which he must have gained during his long political career in South Australia? He states that he gave a draft of this Bill to a representative of the press upon the understanding that the newspaper would remain silent in regard to it. It is almost incredible that a Minister possessing the large experience of the Minister for Trade and Customs should have thought for one moment that the Bill would not get into the hands of the printer of the newspaper in question. I hope that we shall have now a clear confession as to what was the motive of the right honourable gentleman. He has certainly done well in coming forward and acknowledging that he is solely responsible for what has occurred, but his action somewhat reminds me of a line from TennysonHis honour rooted in dishonour stood. His action in accepting the sole responsibility is certainly honourable to his colleagues and to members of the civil service, on whom suspicion might have rested; but it seems to me that he acted dishonorably in handing the Bil l over to any section of the press. I hope that we shall now have a confession from the Minister, and a promise not to repeat the offence. Minister for. Trade and Customs) I am sorry that the honourable member who has just resumed his seat should be a slave to a quotation, because I do not think that in serious prose he would attempt to use the word "" dishonour "" in relation to a question of this kind.

126,,"I will come to the Cabinet Mr KINGSTON It was submitted to the Coronation, which, of course, was with the approval of this House. The agreement, much as it has been canvassed, represents the subject of very much serious and careful discussion in Londona discussion in relation to which I must acknowledge at the outset the valuable assistance rendered to me by the Minister for Defence. Despite the fact that, during part of the negotiations, he was seriously ill , my light honourable colleague was able to give me much good counsel and assistance. I must acknowledge, also, at this stage, the fact that those with whom we were conducting negotiations-that is to say, the First Lord, ancl the other authorities, of the Admiralty -receive d us with the utmost courtesy. They were willing at all times to assist us with any information at their disposal, and it must certainly betaken that this agreement does not represent any undue pressure whatever placed upon the representatives of the Ministry and this Parliament. We found in existence an agreement entered into in 1SS7, but not carried into practical effect until 1889, and I shall, in the course of my remarks, give an outline of the ships and the armaments which furnish the squadron supplied under that agreement. next give an outjine of the pioposed agreement, and enter into a comparison of its main features with those of the existing one. I shall then discuss the principles upon which the new agreement is based, and deal with the .clause which permits ships to be removed, and which makes the East Indies and China stations as well as the Australasian station the sphere of operations. After that, I hope to say something about the alternatives to the scheme, which are, the abandonment of naval defence altogether; secondly, the obtaining of some other and better agreement; and, thirdly, the constitution of an Australian navy. I shall also give some attention to -the diffitioned therein are not to be taken to be the culties in the way of the last-named proposal. ThenI hope to discuss the objections to the scheme which, to condense them, are that there will be nothing to show for the expenditure ; that the scheme does not .satisfy local aspirations; that it does not sufficiently represent the desirability of training Australian seamen; and that it is too imperialistic. That task will take some time, and I shall have to crave the indulgence of the House if I make a speech which is longer than usual, because the ground to be traversed is large, the objections that have been raised are many, and the considerations in favour of the agreement are also many. I trust to have that consideration and indulgence which the House always gives to those who have large matters in hand. Dealing with the existing agreement, which was entered into in 1887, honourable members who have looked at the ratifying Acts passed by the several Parliaments which, in their skeleton frame, are very much like the two or three clauses that lead up to the schedule in this Bill, will see that it was for a period of ten years, terminable on two years' notice. The ten years, I may mention, expired in 1899 ; but the two years' notice, it was deemed advisable before Federation and it has been thought advisable since, not to give until fresh arrangements could be made: and the new agreement contains a provision which supersedes the old agreement, under which the naval defence of Australia was to consist of five fast cruisers of the third class, and two torpedo gun-boats, of which three cruisers and one gun-boat were to be kept in commission. And here, I would ask honourable members to make a line of demarcation in their minds. The old I shall agreement was confined to the five third-class cruisers and the two torpedo gun-boats, being seven in number, while the new agreement deals with eleven ships, although it may not be quite consistent to say that we are getting eleven ships where we had only seven, because there has been, notwithstanding the old agreement, a furnishing of other vessels, such as the RoyalA r t h w and some other cruisers, ancl sloops. On the other hand, we have no reason to suppose that the Admiralty will confine the ships on the station to those specified in the new agreement any more than they did before. There is, in fact, a clause which indicates that the ships menonly force to be kept on the station by the United Kingdom-and to that I shall make reference as I go on. These ships were, as I have said, constituted a special Australian Auxiliary Squadron of five third-class cruisers and two torpedo gun-boats. The normal strength of the squadron on the naval station was not to be reduced, though the terms of the agreement, of course, applied only to the Australian Auxiliary Squadron. The ships were not to be removed from the limits of the Australian station without the consent of the colonial governments concerned, which were the six governments in Australia and one government in New Zealand. In other respects, they were under the sole control and orders of the naval Commander in Chief. local naval defence forces were not affected by the agreement; nor is there in the new agreement anything referring to them. return for this service, Australia and New Zealand, between them, were to contribute a total sum not exceeding £126,000, made up of 5 per cent, on the prime cost of the vessels, which was to be from £850,000 to £900,000, the amount not to exceed £35,000, amounting to about £91,000. Let ine guard myself against the supposition that this represented the whole of the fund, interest, and maintenance-of squadron. That was not so, because the Imperial Government entered into obligations considerably larger than those which were represented by the contributions from Australia and New Zealand. The sum of £126,000 was divided between and New Zealand, on a population basis, and the population of Australia was assumed to be five times that of New Zealand. In 1SS9, the population of the six States, which now constitute the Commonwealth, was 3,1S3,237. Australia amounted to £106,000, total cost may be mentioned at 8d. per head. The auxiliary squadron included the Katoomba, Mi/dura, livngcurooma, Wallaroo, and Tauro/nga, third-class cruisers, costing between £120,000 and £140,000, with a speed of 19 knots, a complement of 200 to 300 men, a tonnage of about and with an armament of eight 4 7 guns, eight 3-pounders, and four machine guns. There were also the Kairrakalta and the Boomerang, torpedo gunboats, which cost about £52,000 each, with a slightly higher speed than the third-class cruisers, a complement of 91 men, a tonnage of 735 tons, and an armament, besides torpedoes, of two 4 7 guns, and four 3pounders. shall have to give some description of the vessels of the proposed squadron by way of comparison. Besides the ships of the Auxiliary Squadron, the Admiralty have kept on the Australian station certain other ships -among was deemed a first-class cruiser, although the fashion of to-day, founded on experience, is to build first-class cruisers of larger Sir Edmund Barton. dimensions and larger armaments. When the Royal Arthur was built, at a cost of £427,000, she was considered a first class cruiser. Her tonnage is 7,700 tons, The hei speed is 19-7 knots, and she has for ! armament one9 2-in. gun, twelve 6-in. guns, twelve 6-pounders, five 3-pounders, and In seven machine guns. The Phoibe and Archer, third-class cruisers, which have also been kept here by the Imperial Government, outside the agreement, were generally similar to cruisers of the MUdura and Katoomba class, and there are four sloops and gunboats, of small dimensions, and a sum for maintenance whose main duties are, as honourable members know, the patrolling of the Pacific. Now, to summarize the features of the cost-sinking existing agreement, it means that five this third-class cruisers, and two torpedo gunboats, built at an aggregate cost of about £850,000, with an average speed of nineteen knots, and for the cruisers an average tonnage of 2,600 tons, represented a payment by Australia alone of Australia £106,000, Or 8d. per head, the cruisers not to be removed without the. consent of the colonial Governments. The vessels have to some extent become obsolete, being fourteen years old. That of course would have happened had they been The share of our property instead of that of the Imperial and'the Government. The type of third-classcruiser now being built is faster, longer, and of much greater horse-power than those to which I have referred. Moreover, a cruiser of the MUdura type, as has been pointed out by experts, is not suited for the heavy weather met with off* 2.600, the Australian coast. It has been found too short for the long seas which prevail in our waters. Honourable memberswho are curious will find in last year's Naval Annual, at page 439, some expert remarks on the subject. Hence, again, the necessity for new arrangements. Since 1887, the population of Australia has increased by some 700,000 souls, and, as I shall show presently, the external trade of Australia with I mention these facts because I"" the United Kingdom, with other parts of the Empire, and with foreign countries, has increased to a very large extent. Sothat the trade to be protected has largely increased, the population has increased,, and the .naval development of the powers of them the Royal Arthur, which the world has also largely increased as tonumber and armament, and the strength, and the fighting power of their ships. Now foran outline of the new agreement which w ill be found in the schedule to the Bill. It is for a period of ten years, terminable on two years' notice from the end of the eighth year. then ? no notice given then it will expire at the -end of two years' notice whenever given. -end of ten years. agreement it will continue in the absence of notice; but it can be made to expire at the -end of ten years by giving notice at the end -of the eighth year. Two years' notice has to be given in any case. The two features in this agreement are first, the sea-going fleet, and next the provision for the local training of Australian seamen; first on a -ship in active commission, and also on drillships as a branch of the Royal Naval Reserve. The second of these features does not appear in the old agreement, and, so far as agreements of this kind are concerned, it is a new feature. The sea-going fleet is to consist of such ships as I am about to -describe. First, there will be one first-class armoured cruiser. The type of ship that will probably be sent out-and I think I .am within the mark in making this statement-wil l be of about 12,000 tons, as .against 7,700 tons on the part of the Royal Arthur. Costing from £750,000 to £800,000, she will have a length of 440 feet, a horse power of 21,000, an armament of two 9 2-in .guns, twelve 6-in. quick-firers, and seventeen -small quick-firers, a speed of 21 knots, and .a complement of about 755 men. I do not bind myself wholly down to that, for this reason-that if one consults Brassey's Ncvoal Annual, which is pointed out as the guide in these matters, it is easy to conceive of our being favoured with the services of a cruiser larger and more powerful than that which I have described. I am referring now to cruisers of the Gressy -class. I need hardly say that such a ship will be an efficient fighting machine. Next there will be two second-class cruisers of the type of the modern second-class cruisers, as represented by a ship of, say, 5,S80 tons -as against 2,600 tons on the part of the largest ship in the present Auxiliary Squadron, to be built at a cost of about £400,000, with a length of about 355 feet, a horsepower of about 12;500, a speed of about 21 knots, an armament of eleven 6-inch guns and fifteen small quick-firers, and a complement of from 470 to 500 men. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I think they will be of the Challenger class. There will also be four third-class cruisers. Of these, three are already in service here, and are to be used as drill-ships. The fourth, which will be a new ship, will possibly be of the It will expire at the Amethyst class, measuring 3,000 tons, and 360 feet long. Her engines will be of 9,800 horse power, and she will be capable of steaming at a speed of 21 knots. She will cost £220,000, and her armament will be twelve 4-in. guns, and eight quick-firing three pounders. Her complement will correspond, but I have not the exact figures' as to it . ships are to be retained as drill-ships ? obsolete as drill-ships, although they are becoming obsolete as fighting machines. They are not, however, obsolete in the sense that they cannot be used as fighting ships, because I have been assured by the 'ViceAdmiral that, if there were trouble on this coast, he would have no hesitation in taking them out to meet the ' enemy. The word "" obsolete "" has become in the British Navy, I will not say a slang expression, but a term which is entirely a relative one. A vessel may not be obsolete as regards vessels of the same class in other navies, but she may be obsolete according to the new standard which the British naval authorities have set up for themselves. It is in that sense that the word is used in connection with the three third-class cruisers to which the honourable member refers. them ? sary. old. do not think that it will be necessary to rearm tbenY, because they now have a modern armament, and, as their primary purpose is to serve as training ships, they will be used ordinarily for that purpose. There will also be four sloops, probably of the Espiegle class, of 1,070 tons, capable of steaming about 13-^ knots an hour, costing about £80,000, and armed with six 4-inch quickfiring guns.

In that respect the agreement differs greatly from that under which the auxiliary squadron was commissioned. If it is complained that the vessels now on .the station are obsolete, it must be remembered that they are here . under an agreement which contains no stipulation that they shall be kept up-to-date and of modern type, and, in the absence of such a stipulation, there has been no endeavour on the part of Australia to obtain, and no offer on the part of the Admiralty to furnish, more modern vessels. that the vessels are of modern type 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON the Admiralty.

Making allowance for the expense of maintaining vessels of modern type, the total cost of the new squadron, exclusive of the three drill-ships, will be over £2,000,000, as against £S50,000 at the most for the old squadron. As, however, vessels always cost a little more than the estimate, because of the expense of testing them by means of trial trips and in other ways, the total cost will be something like £2,500,000, or almost three times that of the vessels of the old squadron. ron be three times as efficient as the old ? Thus, we shall have it will be much more efficient. The opinion of the First Lord of the Admiralty, derived from his experts, was, to put it in very few words, that the new squadron would be able to blow the existing squadron out of the water. To ascertain the total cost of the whole squadron, something must be added to the figures I have given for the value of the three old ships which are to be retained as drill ships. So much for its character and strength. As to the disposition of the ships, their base is to be the ports of Australia and New Zealand, and their sphere of operations the waters of the Australian, China, and East Indian stations, as defined in the schedule to the agreement. the Persian Gulf or to Japan? Sir EDMUNDBARTON I shall state the views of Admiralty experts upon the question, utilizing, without breach of confidence, information which I gained in Engis to determine land. I suppose divided t of the Admiralty are not divided upon the subject, although there are gentlemen who pose as authorities, and may, perhaps, be rightly so regarded, whose opinions differ from those expressed by the Admiralty. The opinion of the Admiralty, however, as to what should be the policy of the -British Navy as a whole, is an undivided opinion. It may be wrong, but I think honourable members will agree that we know of no better authority, and can have no better guide in this matter. There is certainly no officer or layman in Australia who would be a better guide. I do not say that the Admiralty is infallible, because-I-have never attributed that virtue to any human authority ; but we know of no other authority in which to repose confidence, and to which to turn for advice in naval matters, than that which exists for the determination of all such questions within the Empire. consistent t Sir EDMUNDBARTON I do not say that it has always been consistent: but if honourable members will not come to an agreement until they can obtain the advice of an authority which is always consistent,",32,Navalagreeme Nt Bill Second Reading

146,Sir John Quick,"But is the Admiraltyancl always right, ancl is in all things like ourselves, I may as well throw the Bill into the waste-paper basltet. It was pointed out by those with whom we discussed the matter that the President of the French Republic has lately issued a decree largely strengthening the naval forces of France in the Far Eastern seas, and placing its two squadrons under the command of one admiral, the design being obviously to make it possible to concentrate as much strength as they can afford to utilize for the infliction of the utmost possible damage upon the commerce of the Empire should a naval war arise. The Empire has a powerful squadron in the China seas, another on the Cape station, another on the East Indian station, and another on the Australian station, the first-named being the most powerful. It is the waters of the China, the East Indian, that are to be the sphere of operations of the respective squadrons of those stations ; but if the squadrons could not combine, and were reserved for separate local service, a powerful squadron such as the French Republic is now forming in these seas might deal with them singly and independently, and perhaps, with good fortune, destroy them, thus inflicting immense damage upon the Empire as a whole, and especially upon this portion of it. In using that illustration, it was the intention of those who discussed the matter with us to show that the support of these squadrons should be mutual. The cost of maintaining the China and East Indian squadrons amounts to nearly 85 per cent, of a given amount, of which the cost of maintaining the existing Australian squadron would be something like 15 per cent. I mention that to show'how valuable is this provision for a larger sphere of operations, in that it secures for us the support of other squadrons belonging to the Empire. If , in time of trouble, the ships under the existing jigreenientI have no comparisons with regard to the new agreement-were ordered away to the China or the East India Station, the obligation would be mutual. If we contributed our 15 per cent, of power to their assistance, we should, when our turn came, be entitled to the support of their 85 per cent, of offensive and defensive power. having a squadron to defend itself would Mediterranean, or in the Southern Seas, not affect the fleets in those waters. 5T Sir EDMUNDBARTO N It would influence them to this extent: Thati t is the policy of the British Navy to concentrate its forces at the point at which the trouble occurs, wherever that may be, and to come down upon and destroy the enemy. That is also the policy of other nations in a game at which two can play. Those whose fleets have been met and demolished in times gone by owing to their being kept apart are not likely to forget the lessons of the past j and if the}' combine, and we do not, our danger will be the more imminent, and our chances of success correspondingly reduced. were to disperse 1 be to suppose that our enemies are fools. In the discussion which took place at the Conand the Australian stations ference, it was pointed out that if our squadrons did not mutually support each other, a combined squadron of another power, or powers, could deal with them separately and independently, and thus inflict enormous damage on our forces in detail. Then, when our men-of-war had been dispersed, and not till then, would the ships of the enemy disperse and attack our floating trade. The enemy would.not disperse whilst their lives were in danger. They would concentrate their forces to meet eventualities, in the same way that it is the traditional British policy tc concentrate in order to force the hands of an enemy. The enemy knows that we will not scatter, because the time when a naval power is effective to destroy the floating trade of an enemy is when it can do so with impunity, and when it has not a superior force to deal with. In other words, it is the policy first to look out for and k i ll the sheep dogs, and afterwards to prey upon the flock. That is a homely illustration, in -which our men-of-war represent the sheepdogs and our trading vessels the flocks. It must be seen by those who have considered the matter that if our own fleet, or say the French fleet, were liable to be taken in detail, and oveicome by the superior concentrated force of another power, those who were responsible for running such a'danger would be affected by a species of midsummer madness. If the enemy is able to come down upon us and destroy our fleet in detail, whether it because we have failed to pursue the policy",33,Navalagreeme Nt Bill Second Reading

149,Sir Edmund Barton,"That wouldwhich has been so successfully followed by our navy in the past, except on certain rare occasions, we shall deserve our fate. It does not matter whether we speak of our vessels as coast-defence or harbour-defence ships or not. I shall come presently to the question of harbour defence, and shall endeavour to show that there need be no apprehension as to the policy of the Government on that score. I ask the attention of honourable members to this fact: that if three ships are better than one-to use the most homely illustration-it is far better, if you have three ships, to oppose them to three of the enemy than to allow the enemy's three ships to come down upon the first, second, and third of our vessels singly. In the latter event your ships are certain to go under, whereas if you oppose your three ships to the three vessels of the enemy, you at least have an equal chance of success. the Admiralty seems inclined to ignore the necessity for coastal defence.

It is perfectly true that where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together. distribution of forces may be advisable or It is perfectly true, therefore, that where the British trade is greatest, the probability tion, for example, as that provided for of concentrated attack upon it, and the necessity for the concentration of the British have to undergo considerable modifications. naval forces is the greatest, also. That, however, is a vindication of the principle I am supporting, and not an inroad upon it. As I said before, it is only when the menof-war have been dispersed that an effective attack upon the floating trade of an enemy can be commenced. It is only when the power of the enemy's squadrons has been destroyed in detail that you can come back upon him and s a y "" I have destroyed your ships, and now I have your floating trade at my mercy.!' Nothing could suit us better as an tion of responsibility, any diminution of the Empire than that the French should from the beginning ignore our ships of war and turn their attention to our trade, for that would mean the scattering of their forces and of their power, and we should be able to a.ttack them in detail. They would, however, do no such thing, because they could not achieve their object. Their first effort would be to destroy the sheep dogs and then to prey upon the flock. I can find no better or apter illustration than this, which was used with great force by a Minister of the Crown at the Colonial. Conference. Minister forget that the French President is now in London? Sir EDMUNDBARTON I do not forget it, but I am mentioning France purely for the purpose of illustrating what might follow in certain events. We have known the best consequences to How from the visits of the representatives of foreign nations to Great Britain, but, on the other hand, they have not always been the best. We all hope that the rapprochement between the French and British nations may be followed by the most triumphant cordiality, because without disparagement to any other . nation-and valuing very much, as I do, the friendly I do not connexions which at present exist between the British Empire and other countriesI still think that our nearest neighbour across the Channel is one with whom we should be always friendly. It is not necessary to say more than that. As may be easily understood, in considering a question of this sort, all the possibilities have to be weighed, and it implies no hostility to any nation to name it as a possible eneni)'. Whatever local feasible in time of peace-suc h a distribuunder this agreement-will , in time of war, There must be only one authority, with f u l l power and f u l l responsibility to the Empire as a whole. HereI do not speak of the detail of political responsibility, but of that responsibility which the wielder of great powerin timesof grave extremity always feels in the performance of duty. There must be one authority, with full responsibility to the Empire, to move the ships and concentrate them wherever they can deal the most effective blow at the eneniy. Any separapower of that single authority, any risk of hesitation or delay in making a conjunction of the squadrons at the point at which they can act most effectively, might have the most disastrous consequences. I may be told that this is also indisputable.",34,Navalagreeme Nt Bill Second Reading

153,Mr Joseph Cook,"Does the PrimeI t does seem quite clear to the lay mind that, as the separation of responsibility and power has been found so bad in the past, it is not likely to prove good in the future. It must be plain to all of us that the action of one of our squadrons in opposing a superior force here, and of another in opposing a superior force elsewhere, is not likely to meet with success but if the two fleets by combination'become a superior force and attack the vessels of the enemy before they can effect a junction, the chance of victory will lie with us, and not with the enemy. This does seem all plain sailing, and yet I do not see how an agreement of this kind can be defeated, unless such principles are ignored. To use a simple illustration, you could not put out a great fire in a warehouse by throwing on it even many buckets of water; but if you concentrated your water power through one great hose, and attacked the heart of the fire, you would have the best chance of success. If you found your efforts unavailing at thab point, and you had to attack the edges of the fire after it had become hopeless to save the structure, you could still conduct your work most effectively by concentrating the water power. The same principle applies to naval operations. The squadrons are first concentrated as a seagoing force, and attend to coastal defence afterwards. So much do I agree with the principle laid down in this agreement, that I consider its chief feature, and most valuable feature, is the provision that the sphere of operations of the Australian squadron shall be the waters of the China, East Indian, and Australian stations, instead of making the sphere of operations of each squadron merely the waters contiguous to their respective stations. That is the principle to which I with all my heart adhere, and to which I ask honourable members to subscribe. called the Australian station? Sir EDMUNDBARTON was called the Australasian station, but its limits are not much altered, there being merely an extension eastwards so as to include the Caroline Islands. Honourable members will find the limits of the sphere of operations laid down in lines and parallels in the agreement, but I can give a rough indication of the limits to which they will extend. was not issued with the report. 5 T2 haps it would have been ""better, but I think I can make the position clear. If honourable members look at the Navy League Mnp of the Empire, now beside me, they will see the delimitations of the boundaries of the naval stations indicated by Hags. The limits of the sphere of operations are roughly as follows :-On the west of Australia the Indian Ocean as bounded by the east coast of Africa and the south coast of Asia; on the north the seas around the East Indies, and also the Pacific Ocean bordering on the coast of China and Siberia; on the east the Pacific Ocean, arOund the Pacific Islands, as far out as the Caroline Islands situated to the north of Australia. Sir EDMUNDBARTON It is a question of longitude. On the south of Australia, the sphere of the squadron's operations is the Southern Ocean. Of course, we do not anticipate that anything is likely to happen which will necessitate the vessels being used south of Tasmania. The proposal is that instead of these ships being confined-as they were under the old agreement except with the consent of the States Governments-to Australasian waters, their sphere of operations in time of war, and that of the vessels of the other two squadrons, shall cover the whole of these seas in order that they may effectively carry out the principle of concentrating power wherever the enemy is to be found, which is admittedly the principle that should govern the operations of the navy as a whole. be extended so that the vessels might be taken into the North Atlantic? that if the ocean were twice its size, it would be difficult to apply the principle, is no doubt a very good argument to use. That argument, however, does not make the I think it principle which I have laid down an undesirable one to apply as far as modern contrivances will permit of that being done. One might ver}' easily say that he would give a range of 10 or 12 miles to a modern gun, and it might be pointed out that it would be much better if the weapon could be given a range of 15 miles. He would naturally wish to give the gun as long a range as possible, and it would be nothing It is a pity that a map against the principle involved to show that the weapon would not operate at 20",35,Navalagreeme Nt Bill Second Reading

Instead of that provision, the second article providesThe base of this force shall be the ports of Australia and New Zealand, and their sphere of operations shall be the waters of the Australia, China and East Indies stations, us defined in the attached schedules, where the Admiralty believe they can most effectively act against hostile vessels which threaten the trade or interests of Australia or New Zealand. The object of their employment ' outside Australasian seas is thus laid down to bewhat ? The most effective protection of the trade and interests of Australia and New Zealand. If , concurrently, the trade arid interests of the Empire are protected, are we so craven that we should be niggard of that support ? If our own interests were being sacrificed instead of protected and strengthened by the proposed arrangement, I could understand some of the objections which have been put forward by its opponents ; but if the opposite is the case, if our own interests are conserved, what is to hinder us from declaring, in an agreement which gives us the protection conferred by the combined power of two other naval squadrons, that we are prepared to be called upon in our turn to assist them in the protection of the interests of other portions of the Empire? I can imagine no more humiliating refusal than a refusal of that kind. It may be said that we should insert in the Bill a provision limiting the sphere of operations of the squadron to Australian waters. But I would point out that we cannot put such a limitation into the agreement, although we can amend the Bill which covers it . But even if it could be done, what would be the value of the limitation ? Those who urge the adoption of that course have almost unanimously agreed that if such a limitation were embodied in the agreement, no trouble would ever be experienced, because the consent asked for would always be forthcoming. If so, what is the value of such a limitation ? the limitation should be abolished? gestion was put forward by the Admiralty ; tralian, China, and the East Indies stations but prior to my visit to England, or having -woul d deter the Empire, when it became speech with the Admiralty authorities, I necessary, from coming to our assistance. had arrived at the conclusion that that was the only policy worthy of the Empire. It canbeen as well to have a positive statement to not be said that any pressure was put upon that effect ? me to agree to that conclusion, inasmuch as it was my own conviction before I went there. I repeat that there is no provision in the agreement, similar to the provision in the agreement of 1SS7, for tying the fleet down to Australian waters, excepting with the consent of the Australian and New Zealand Governments, and the article which I have read from the agreement shows that the converse is intended. The limitation existing in the old agreement is held, and rightly held, to be a limitation not for our advantage ; and if it is not for our advantage, we cannot complain of its removal. , The course I have indicated is now thought to be better for the mutual advantage of all parties to the agreement. The reasons for this I shall indicate later, in dealing further with the principles on which the agreement is based ; so far I have said sufficient for the purpose immediately in hand. In A r ticle 2 there is this provisionNo change in this arrangement shall be made without the consent of the Governments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand; and nothing in bhis agreement shall be taken to mean bhab bhe naval force herein named shall be bhe only force used in Australasian waters should bhe necessity arise for a larger force.

The primary duty of the squadron is, of course, the naval defence of Australia and New Zealand, and in this work it will be assisted, if necessary, by other ships of the British Navy. NowI turn to the local training of seamen, and this is, of course, a totally new feature. While there may be some difference in the provisions of the agreement as to the power and armament of the vessels to be employed, still these be paid by the Imperial authorities t provisions are the same in their nature as those of the former agreement; but the properial authorities; but, of course, we pay visions to which I am now about to refer are our subsidy of £200,000 per annum.

These men, according to Article5 will be paid at special rates; that is to say, they are not to be confined to the pay ordinarily given by the Admiralty to British sailors, but will be employed at a special rate, which will bring up their pay to a figure that can be reasonably accepted according to our notions of remuneration for services in Australia.

Thus the agreement offers permanent employment to close upon 900 men in the Royal Navy as engagement men, while there will be facilities also for the training of 25 officers and 700 seamen .and stokers as reservists in the drill-ships. As to the special rates of pay, I may say that after consultation with the Admiral, I have no apprehension but that when the scheme is finally approved of by the Admiralty-and the Admiral is now submitting a scheme to the home authorities-the rates will be found to be such as will satisfy the aspirations of those who wish to join the service. And as I shall show presently, those who join will also have an opportunity of equipping themselves for service iu an Australian Navy if such a navy should afterwards be constituted. have all the British sailors wanting to become Australian sailors.

It is quite true and facilities for local training. Now, what that the C03t of the old agreement, under do we pay ? The annual payment by the which the ships have been wearing out, Commonwealth is to be £200,000, which is whilst the population has been increasing, reckoned on the basis of five-twelfths of the amounts to a little more than 6d. per total annual cost of maintenance.

I venture to put that forward as an argument to show that this is a reasonable and fair agreement. If the agreement entered into in 1889 was a fair one-and honourable members will see how very small was the protection afforded us under .that agreement as compared with the protection proposed under this-and if under the former agreement the cost per head was 8d., is it unreasonable to contend that we should now bear a cost of Is. 0£d. per head ? I venture to say it is not. As I say, we are to have the services of this efficient fleeta small navy-and taking all the circumstances into consideration, I think we may say that we are being reasonably dealt with, and that there is no attempt to overreach us. Imperial squadron? tinued ? perial squadron, the Royal, Arthur, and the other ships of that squadron were always kept on the station, independently of the Auxiliary Squadron furnished under the naval agreement. That was an entirely voluntary contribution, and ic is a matter upon which I cannot give definite information. I can only say that the squadron we shall be getting now will be one of eleven ships, and that the Auxiliary Squadron under the existing agreement, together with the other strength of the navy in these seas, consisted of fourteen ships. teen ; there can be no doubt abouc that. The fact can be officially verified. A t times there may have been eighteen, reckoning little boats that are not worth counting. The strength of the squadron kept here in addition to the Auxiliary Squadron was seven ships-the Royal Arthur, the two other ships I mentioned-the Phoebe and another-bein g third-class cruisers, and four gun-boats and patrol-ships. I may mention that there has been also a hydrographic survey ship employed in these waters. It may be assumed, as there is no provision made in the agreement for a survey-ship, that there is no likelihood of that vessel being taken away, and the position in this respect will probably remain as it is. able member, no doubt, refers to the I desire to call attention to the fact that, Australian-trained men ? although the new squadron proposed will consist of three ships less than the strength of the old Auxiliary Squadron, together with the Royal Arthur and the other ships kept here, if honourable members will consult the Naval Annual they will find, from the description and types of the ships and their armaments, that the squadron now proposed will be more powerful than the other two squadrons combined. have a battle-ship in the proposed squadron. not beabattle-ship in the proposed squadron, but the distinction between the first-class armoured cruiser and a battle-ship is rapidly disappearing, except that the cruiser is generally the faster ship. say so. know that, but I do, know that it is the opinion of many English experts that today a first-class cruiser-lik e the Drake or the Cressy, to come down to details-is practically a battle-ship in all but the name, and travels a little faster. . they are second-class vessels. Sir EDMUNDBARTON The n we must leave the opinion of our own experts to stand against his. I do know this also, that although the Royal Arthur is s*ill ranked as a first-class cruiser, she is a very much smaller ship than the first-class cruiser we shall have under this agreement. Putting aside other means of comparison between them, the number of men required to work the Royal Arthur is somewhere about 567, as against 775 required to man the first-class cruiser, according to modern notions, which we are to have. I mention this to show that what was called a first class cruiser in the days when the Royal Arthwr was a new ship more nearly approximated to what is now called a second-class cruiser, which requires a crew approximating to 500 men. these men to be replaced ?",44,Navalagreeme Nt Bill Second Reading

They are' not encouraged to re-engage for active service, because-as I understand-the intention is that they should be encouraged to pass into the reserve. to the consideration of the principles upon which this agreement is based. We have to remember that the naval defence of the Empire, if it is to be effective, must be unified. It must be subject to a single control, organized from a single centre. Those who have watched in anything-in battle or play -the relative effects of absolute combination and training, as compared with that which happens when people are brought together as mere separate units, will be able to pronounce upon the value of combined training. That which is true with regard to battle or play, according to history and to our own experience, is equally true with regard to the navy of the Empire. In regard to this point, I desire to mention a few considerationsThe importance which attaches to the command of the seaI am reading from a paper which has been publishedlies in the control which it gives over sea-communications. The weaker sea power is absolutely unable to carry to success any large military expedition over sea. It cannot, with any hope of success, expect to land troops at long distances as against the Power which is strong from the naval stand-point. is shown by a reference to the history of the past. We may go back, for example, to the time when the Greek victory of Salainis threatened the Persian lines of communication. There were 1,000,000 men in the Persian army for the invasion of Greece; but that 1,000,""000 could not stay when communication with their base was threatened by the victory of the Greeks at Salamis; the influence of sea power was the right honourable gentleman with huge losses. The paper to which I have referred points out thatThe failure of the famous Syracusan expedition was due to the defeat of the Athenian fleet, and had its modern counterpart in the failure of Admiral Graves, off the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, in 1781. That was one of the most vital failures in history, becauseThe surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown wiis the prelude to the independence of the United States. That very surrender arose from the failure of the British fleet to keep up communications with the land forces, which were actI now come to ing in defence of British interests in America. I am not saying whether we ought to be glad or sorry at the result of that contest so far as the interests of humanity and freedom are concerned ; but it is a lesson that shows that the command of the sea means, in most cases, command of the land in any naval or military expedition which has to be fought at a distance. These are illustrations of that fact which cannot be gainsaid. Let us turn to later times-to the expedition of Napoleon to Egypt. Napoleon landed an enormous army in Egypt, but Nelson came up with the French fleet and defeated it in the battle of the Nile. That was a totally unexpected blow, arising out of the fact that Nelson, with wonderful prescience, had collected from every quarter all the forces he could obtain, and that, when he was least expected, he bore down upon his adversary and destroyed his ships. And he destroyed them, owing to his superior mobility and activity, mostly at their moorings. What happened then? Napoleon's communications with France were cut, and the consequence was the surrender of the entire French army. That was brought about not by any land battle, but simply by Britain's command of the seathat command without which, maintained in all its supremacy, the idea of holding this The truth of this Empire together becomes nothing but a dream. and learned gentleman say that the surrender of the French army was the result of the battle of the Nile? up to Acre, and did not surrender.",45,Navalagreeme Nt Bill Second Reading

222,Mr Crouch,"Napoleon marched his mendered subsequently. Does the honourable and learned member think that he would have surrendered if Nelson had not come down and destroyed France's naval power ? I repeat that that surrender would not have happened but for the victory of the Nile, and that assertion cannot be denied. My honourable and learned friend seems to think that one thing is not the consequence of another because it does not happen within a day or two after the first event. Napoleon had no hope of restoring his communications with France after the battle of the Nile, and that was the reason of his entire failure, and the subsequent surrender of his army. Sir EDMUNDBARTON . ^ The s e instances show the advantages of gaining seapower. Let us look at a few of the-advantages of maintaining it. We can quote historical example for that. The conquest of French-Canada was due to the fall of Quebec. How was that fall brought about 1 How was it possible for Wolfe to defeat Montcalm, as he did; to make that splendid attack, and to close the same day a victor and a martyr, or, at any rate, a hero 1 It was mainly due to the fact that the superior sea-power of the British closed the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the French and opened it to us. The French were cut off from their communications, while the British communications remained intact. The British were thus able to attack the French successfully, and from that successful attack came the downfall of French Canada. If there is a similar struggle, in the future, that route .of the Gulf of St. Lawrence will be as vital as in the past. The onus will be cast upon the British power of maintaining that route, of maintaining its own communications, and of breaking all others, whether it be to assist Canada or not. But when it is assisting Canada, and breaking some other power, it is assisting us. It is impossible to reckon these things by square inches. The triumphs of the Empire, even if they are a thousand miles away from what you call your base, are as profitable in their results, and as fruitfu l in which the right their ultimate success, as if they were fought and won within a mile of your own doors. I need not multiply instances, although they might be multiplied by dozens. But, to any naval power, the destruction of the enemy's fleet must always be the great object. It is pointed out in this paper thatIt is immaterial where the great battle is fought; but, wherever it may take place, the result will be felt throughout the world, because the victor will afterwards be in a position to spread his force with a view to capturing or destroying any detached forces of the enemy, and generally to gather the fruits of victoryin the shape of many things which we can easily imagine if we put the two converse positions, of England, in the event of a great war, maintaining and extending command of the seas or losing it . There have been great developments in the navies of France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. God forbid that we should ever be at war with any of these Powers; but if we have to be at war with them, it will be the unready who lose, and the ready who win. These improvements, these extra armaments, indicate the possibility that a battle of the kind I have described may have to be fought in the future. We cannot put that possibility aside. We cannot, like the ostrich, which when pursued thrusts its head into the sand and deludes itself into the belief that it has no enemy, shut our eyes to that contingency. We must look to the future as if these things were possible. We must recollect that even if these struggles take place i u the English Channel, they are not local struggles. Wherever the struggle takes place it must be felt all over the world. It will matter little to us whether the great battle of the future be fought within 5 miles of Port Phillip or Port Jackson, in the chops of the Channel, or in the middle of the Mediterranean. It is to the result of such a battle, rather than to the place at which it occurs, that we shall have to look forour subsequentsecurity ordanger, because although it may be at a distance, annihilation will not be distant afterwards, if we fail. The successes of those who are able to destroy our command of the seas may be postponed a few days until they reach us, but our downfall will be none the less certain.

225,Mr Reid,"What is the paper toboth Houses of Parliament in England. is pointed out in this paper thatThe geographical conditions and the varied interests o£ the maritime powers prevent such complete concentration in modern times as was practicable in the past. Thus Russia divides her battleshipsWhere? Between the Baltic and Pacific. You cannot concentrate competely. ThatI admit. The point is to concentrate to the f u l l extent that you can, and to have regard to the locality in which danger is threatened. The paper points out that the battleships of the United States are divided between the Atlantic and Pacific, and that both Germany and France have concentrated in European waters, notwithstanding their interests in other parts of the globe. It is true also that the greater part of the British battleships are also massed in those waters. But even our possible enemies, the paper points outare fully aware of the necessity of concentrating on the decisive points. They will endeavour to prevent this by threatening our, detached squadrons and trade in different quarters, and thus obliging us to make further detachments from the main fleets. It is contended thatWe should have sufficient power available to carry on a vigorous offensive against the hostile outlying squadrons, without unduly weakening the force concentrated for the decisive battle, whether in Europe or elsewhere. To what does all this point 1 The immense importance of the principle of concentration ; and tbe facility with which ships and squadrons can be moved from one part of the world to another-it is more easy to move a fleet from Spitheud to the Cape or Halifax, than it is rangement, I suppose our fleet will be off to to move a large army, with its equipment, from Capetown to Pretoria-point s to the necessity of China? a single navy under one control by which alone concerted action between the several parts can be assured. I said that the policy was a traditional one. I find that word used in this paper. It points out thatThe traditional role of the British Navy is not to act on the defensive, but to prepare to attack the force which threatens-in other words, to right honourable and learned gentleman is assume the offensive. On one occasion England arguing. departed from her traditional policy, and acting on the defensive, kept her ships in harbour, unrigged and unmannedThose are the words which remained in my would be off to China unless that were the memory, "" unrigged and unmanned ""with the result that the Dutch fleet sailed up the speech in having led the honourable member Medway, and burnt the ships of war at their moorings. It Of course it cannot be left out of consideration that the strength and composition, not only of the British Navy, but of any British squadron, depend upon the strength and position of the hostile forces which they have to meet. I have explained that the French have collected a strong squadron in the Eastern seas. Unfortunately I have not at hand information which I had at my disposal a few days ago, in regard to the details of that squadron. Russia has massed not merely a strong squadron, but a mighty fleet in the Eastern seas, and on the China station to-day she has, all told, a fleet of some 69 vessels. W it h a success gained by concentration in those waters, our fear begins. We are not subject to any ordinary attack here. I think we may put that idea aside. Our danger, is to be feared from a raid by hostile cruisers, which, after some success, even a temporary one, in the dominion of the seas, may be set free to descend upon our commerce and ourselves. W it h a fleet like that in China waters, the possibility becomes at any rate a developing and a menacing possibility. Patriotism, perhaps, may forbid us to call it more, but it is one which under combination can be developed to a large extent. Why then should we lend ourselves to a policy under which, if fleets act logically on the same system as Britain has adopted in the past, we should be left with one squadron to fight a combination of that kind, instead of being able, by reciprocity, to call to our assistance those who could best assist us.

Sir EDMUNDBARTON the opposite very clear indeed, I think, but of course the honourable member is entitled to his own opinion. If he does not accept the arguments which I have humbly ventured to put forward I am not going to attempt, at the cost of the time of the House, to repeat them to him. I did not mention at the time the actual strength of the squadrons in eastern seas under the British flag, but I find that the cost of maintenance -whic h bears a well defined ratio to the power and armament and number of the crew of a vessel-of the China squadron, exclusive of any allowance on the first cost of building, is £1,430,000 a year, and of the East Indian squadron £303,000 a year, while the entire cost of the maintenance of not only the Australian Auxiliary Squadron, but also the added vessels of the British navy in Australian waters is put down at £ 3 i 2 , 0 0 0 a year, of which £126,000 has been paid by Australia and New Zealand. Any one who will take these figures into consideration will see that we only add a squadron of which the up-keep is £312,000 to assist squadrons, of which the combined up-keep is £1,733,000 ; but in case of our need the new squadron can be assisted by the other two squadrons. That is enough to show us by figures-as good for the purpose as details of armament and speed and crew-that in our time. of trouble the assistance we can bring, as we stand now, to others within the large area of the.three stations, is as nothing to the assistance bey can bring to us if we were attacked. If I were speaking from a merely sordid point of view, I could by that argument alone make out much of my case. In connection with the argument that we are not dependent solely on the Australian squadron for our local defence, the set-off to the fact that the squadron may be removed is found in tlie fact that the other squadrons will be brought here if necessary. So that the principle of unity of control operates both ways; but more in our favour than against us, according to the figures I have been putting; the support that we should get from other squadrons being much greater than any we «ould give with our squadron. We may pass on now to see what are the alternatives to such a scheme as this. We may take one of three courses. We may abandon naval sea-going defence, The right honoror we may try for a better agreement, or we may endeavour to form an Australian I have made navy. I do not think that much need be said about the first alternative. Our floating trade is very large, and it is increasing, as I have pointed out, very rapidly. It has increased£25,000,000 during the last ten years; it has risen from £22 to £ 2 3 18s. per head, simply because Australia has in the meantime developed a purchasing power which has even outrun the rate, by which her population has increased. Th« position of Australia, it will be admitted, is extremely isolated, and it is not much in danger of any other invasion than a raid by armed and fast cruisers. But we must have ships to meet such an attack, just as the other parts of. the Empire must have ships to meet it. And the way to succeed in meeting it by a moderate squadron is to take such steps as will enable us to add strength to the entire navy, so that the danger to any other power may be greater, and its possibilities of wresting naval control from the Empire may be fewer. It is just as the, possibility of wresting naval control increases that the danger of a raid increases. An enemy must break the sea power of the English Empire before it can come down on Australia. It . majr do thab if the policy of concentration is not observed. Buti t is for us to lend our aid to the policy of concentration, because it is that which strikes the decisive blow, and renders the enemy unable to disperse afterwards for raiding our commerce, and for the plain reason that his dispersal then is to save his life. I shall leave that part of the question. I cannot understand its being soberly reasoned that we should abandon the making of any agreement at all. "" Can we get a better agreement V is the next phase of the subject. I think it will be very difficult to do this. The figures I have quoted show that the agreement will be exceedingly advantageous to us, that is, so far as the sea-going squadron is concerned, and to that we have to add the facilities offered for training Australians locally-89 0 men for the permanent crew of the cruiser and drill-ships, aud 725 men, including officers, for the Royal Naval Reserve. If it is true that we get all that for what .amounts on our population to less than 13d. per head, then the only question is this-I s it an adequate protection so far as sea-going p'pwer is concerned 1 It will be admitted that the local training is undoubtedly a benefit to our own people, and",48,Willis The Men To Such That They Had To Go Back To Persia
229,Mr Henry Willis,"that it is worth paying something for, but the main question crops up again, is it an adequate protection 1 While we were in England we had proposals from the Admiralty as to a larger naval armament in these waters, and one of them would have amounted .to a payment of, I think, £+67,000 a year to be divided between Australia and New Zealand. We frankly pointed out that the many duties of government which communities at this distance have to undertake-the pioneer work which remains to be done close to our doors, and the fact of certain limitations, whether they are wholesome or not, imposed upon us by the financial sections of the Constitution-militate d against a large payment such as was then suggested, and we had to ask the Admiralty to draw up proposalsfor theminirnum adequate protection of this station : and those words, I hope, fairly and clearly express the idea of this House, which is prepared, 1 think, to vote the minimum adequate protection, but is not prepared to vote money for what is more than adequate protection. That is the line which I took, and in which my colleague joined me ; and these proposals-ther e may be a modification in this detail or in that-ar e the answers of the Admiralty to our request to state the minimum adequate protection for us and our commerce in these seas, always subject to tlie observance of those principles, without which, in their judgment, it is impossible for the British fleet to maintain its supremacy. being withdrawn to the China seas, would dt still be adequate protection 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON more than adequate if it were fighting there when there was nothing here to fight; but -it would be less than adequate if it stopped here when there was nothing to fight, and left the fighting at a distance to others who were not strong enough to beat the enemy. Now, as to the question of an Australian Navy, I wish at the outset to say that I do not decry, but on the other hand fully appreciate, the spirit of local patriotism which animates those who hold that our sea-going defence should be provided for wholly by means of an Australian Navy. There are two reasons in the main why the Government cannot adopt that pro-, posal for the purposes for which this agreement has been entered into. The first of these is the principle of unity of control in naval defence, and the second the cost of any minimum adequate defence provided for in that way. As to the principle of unity of control, I have endeavoured to show that the object of the Navy of the Empire is to keep command of the sea, for the purpose, first, of protecting trade routes, and secondly, of preventing the transport of military forces by an enemy, in the event of attack being made on outlying portions of the Empire. The only way in which command of the sea can be maintained, as I hope I have already been able to show, is by being able to concentrate the whole strength of the Navy, or if not the whole strength, then so much as is available, at an}' given point when necessity requires. By creating a local squadron and placing it under local control, we should render the carrying out of the first object impossible. The strength of the fleet must be available for concentration under one united command, under one directing mind, and in pursuance of the plan formed for the defence of the Empire, which allocates to each part that proportion of strength necessary to permit of the application of the maximum of power at any point of attack. If the command of the sea were once lost, small local squadrons would afford no defence against the united fleet of an enemy. If the fleets of the Empiredid not suffice to maintain our supremacy on the sea, and our naval power were once broken, even temporarily, the sea would be at the command of the enemy, who could attack any small local squadrons in detail, and easily overcome them. If I have not already made this clear by what I have urged before, I despair of being able to It would be convince honourable members. But, speaking humbly for myself, it is as clear as any proposition' sustainable by argument can be. If the British fleet-and I mean the fleet under one direction for the benefit of the Empire as a whole-were once broken or dispersed, or such main portion of it as could be brought into conflict were broken and dispersed, the enemy would hold the possessions of the Empire at their mercy and attack them i u detail, and an Australian squadron, as large as that now proposed, would be ineffective for the very defensive purposes for which it is suggested that it should be maintained. If that were not so, the cost alone would be prohibitive to us. I do not forget the fact that we have not nearly reached, and are not",49,Willis The Men To Such That They Had To Go Back To Persia
230,Mr Mauger,"In the event of this fleetlikely for a long time to reach, the expenditure of one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue we are at present gathering. I do not, however, think that it follows that we should not, for the sake of the States, continue as far as possible to maintain our determination to avoid reaching it. The added expenditure under this agreement will be £94,000 per year, and the whole outlay of the Commonwealth will be £200,000. I shall be able to show that an Australian Navy of equal power could not be maintained by us for less than £500,000 a year. If I establish that proposition I think I shall have made it clear that, any attempt at this stage of our existence to maintain an Australian Navy, even if, owing to its independent action, it were not subject to the dangers I have pointed out, would be made impossible to us by the cost. What we must be prepared to meet is a raid by fast and powerful armoured cruisers. We cannot, therefore, have a fleet of less strength than the one to be obtained under the new agreement. This is estimated to be of the minimum adequate strength for our protection, even with the 'reciprocal assistance which it will give and receive from the other squadrons stationed in adjoining seas. If the Australian fleet were acting by itself the necessity for that strength at least would become even more apparent. We could not count upon the unified direction and control upon which we could rely under the agreement, and to the extent to which it wciuld be removed, we should be palpably weakened. assume that the prime cost of the Australian squadron would be about £2,500,000, and I propose to adopt the Admiralty figures with respect to the interest and sinking fund which will have to be provided for. thinking that the Admiralty estimate is a very low one for vessels which for fighting purposes do not remain up-to-date for a very long term of years, and which, though they may be efficient up to a certain point, may be our outlay annually would be £43,500. outstripped in armament and handiness of manipulation by the vessels of other powers, owing to the advances made in naval science. Assuming, however, that the basis adopted for the purposes of this agreement is applicable to the case of an Australian Navy, we should have to provide 3 per cent, for interest on the capital outlay, and 2 per cent, for a sinking fund. Sir Edmund Barton. vision does the right honourable gentleman propose to make for depreciation 1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON I am estimating 3 per cent, for interest and 2 per cent, for sinking fund, and I consider those figures very moderate. altogether too l o w ; the cost, allowing for depreciation, will be nearer 15 per cent. that our credit was at a very high point, and that we had to procure and maintain the vessels necessary to form an Australian Navy, we should need to provide 5 per cent, for interest and sinking fund. I adopt that very low estimate in order that my figures may be beyond question. honourable gentleman should remember that a sinking fund must cover depreciation. that, and whilst I am adopting the Admiralty figures, I recognise that they would be ridiculously low as applied to a Navy of our own. The provision to be made for interest and sinking fund at the rate I have mentioned would represent an annual charge of £125,000. As the honourable member for Melbourne has indicated, it would be more reasonable to provide for at least double that amount. The maintenance at Imperial rates of pay of a first-class cruiser in commission, such as that which would be the flagship of the Australian Squadron under the new agreement, would I amount, at the lowest estimate, to £80,000. The maintenance of two secondclass cruisers, such as are provided for under the new agreement, would figure out as follows :-On e second-class cruiser in commission would cost£64,000 per annum, and A t the same time, I cannot help one in reserve would involve an annual outlay of £25,000. Upon one third-class cruiser in commission we should have tospend yearly £29,500, and upon three other ships of the same class used as drill-shipsFour sloops in commission would involve us. in an annual expenditure of £62,000. Thetotal of the figures I have mentioned is. £304,000, to which we have to add £125,000 for interest and sinking fund,, and upon this ridiculously low calculation the total would reach £429,000.

235,Sir Edmund Barton,"Yes, I knowsource of supply than our own people, the reserves would have to be made commensurate with the fleet itself. Under the agreement the reserves can be drawn not only from our own population, but from that of England; but when we presuppose an .Australian Navy, we also presuppose that we shall have to look to our owti population for our reserves. These reserves, therefore, would have to be much larger than the 725 men and officers provided for under the new agreement. Then we should have to provide for the payment of the men required to man the whole fleet at local rates. We should have to pay at local rates, not merely the crew of one second-class cruiser in commission, and the small permanent crews on three drill-ships, but Australian or New Zealand crews at local rates would have to be placed on all the vessels of the fleet, and the expenses of maintenance would thus be increased to a huge extent. Therefore, it is fair to say that if, with the crews paid at Admiralty rates, the total cost would be £429,000, to maintain the squadron with local crews at local rates would not This estimate, of course, makes no allowance for what must necessarily accompany the creation of an Australian Navy, namely, the establishment of naval works, dockyards, hospitals, and arsenals. Thati t is not an excessive estimate is proved by the experience of the Argentine Republic, which possesses a fleet of its own. public is, I understand, about 1,000,000 in excess of the population of the Commonwealth. In 1902 its Navy consisted of one third-class battle-ship, four coast defence ships, eight cruisers, twenty-seven torpedo vessels ancl destroyers, and eight special service ships. In 1901-2 the annual estimate for the maintenance of this modest fleet amounted to £921,000. That sum does not include interest, nor does it represent any provision for new construction-in other words, for depreciation-becaus e it is out of. the allowance for depreciation that possibly funds may be set aside for new construction. Our external trade is quite twice as large as that of the Argentine Republic. Yet the naval expenditure of the latter, instead of being-as is proposed under this agreement-Is. 0£d. per head of its population, represents 3s. 9d. per head, despite the fact that its sea-board is very much less than is that of Australia. affords a very strong argument in favour of the adoption of the proposed agreementan argument which becomes ten times stronger if we consider what would be the cost of the maintenance of a similar squadron at local rates. I submit that, by these figures and comparisons, I have established the fact that the cost of creating an Australian Navy would be such as we have no right to incur unless we are absolutely obliged to do so, in view of our moral obligations to the States of the Federation.

The experience of the Argentine Republic conclusively proves that, if we created an Australian Navy upon reasonably modest and economic lines, we should have to incur an annual outlay for maintenance alone of nearly £1,000,000. necessarily requires a bigger force than a part of an empire. is on the supposition that every part of the Empire obtains the assistance of the rest of the Empire. The best way in which that assistance can be rendered is by permitting the whole of the naval operations to be dominated by one controlling power-by providing a well-equipped sea-going Navy fit to seek out an enemy and destroy it .

The adoption of such a policy might land us in an expenditure equal to that paid for the maintenance of the Argentine Navy, and would certainly involve us in the payment of two and a half times as much as we shall contribute under this agreement as an integral part of the Empire. Mr HisNitr WILLIS -The Prime Minister's estimate is based upon a ""peace"" footing. Sir EDMUNDBARTON fied to put it upon lines analogous to those on which our own proposal is based. I admire the spirit of patriotism which suggests the establishment of an Australian Navy, but would point out that it does not accord with that principle of unity of control which we think is essential in naval matters, and that its cost would be prohibitive. I come now to the main objections to the agreement. The first is that under it we shall have nothing to show for the expenditure incur.red. We are told that if we build or buy our own ships, at the termination of the period mentioned in the agreement we shall have the vessels to show for the expenditure. It is widely contended by the opponents of the agreement that at the end of fourteen years ships are obsolete for fighting purposes. W it h the advance of science it may be that they will be so completely distanced from the pointof view of efficiency by other vessels adoption of such a policy. Therefore the constructed, as to become obsolete even in a shorter period. set apart onl}' 2 per cent, for a sinking fund ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON half-a-dozen times already that that is too low a calculation. The fact that a larger amount should be appropriated for the purposes of a sinking fund militates even more strongly against the proposal to establish an Australian Navy. The first objection urged against the scheme, I repeat, is that we shall ing those on board the second-class cruisers, have nothing to show for the expenditure incurred. But that argument is discounted at once by the provision that "" from time used for that purpose ? to time "" throughout the terms of the agreement, all the ships shall be of modern type, except those used as drill-ships. obsolete many times in eight years. Sir EDMUNDBARTON does become obsolete owing to the progress men accounted for? of invention and the development of science, the agreement provides for its renewal, either in the sense that improvements must be effected upon it , or it must be replaced by another ship. It militates much against the argument that by adopting this agreement we shall have nothing to show for the expenditure, when it is pointed out that if we established an Australian Navy, and the ships lost their value as ' fighting machines, unless we made huge provision for depreciation and conI am satisstruction-whic h would make the estimate of its cost enormously largerwe should have nothing to show for the outlay but old iron, which, after all, cannot be regarded as a palladium of strength in a naval engagement. Under the new agreement the ships are to be kept up-to-date "" from time to time."" It is not proposed to keep the drill-ships up to date as fighting machines, because they are to be used for another purpose. It is all very well to talk about £500,000 covering the annual cost of the maintenance of an Australian Navy, but when we consider the fact that our ships as they became obsolete, would be thrown on our hands, and that we should have to provide fresh ones, whereas under the new agreement, everything requisite to keep them up-to-date will be done for us at the expense of the Imperial Government, we shall see how strongly the argument tells against the fact that we shall Have nothing to show for the expenditure in the event of the ships Then why propose to becoming obsolete, does not count for very much. Moreoveri t is not a reasonable objection, unless it is true to say that any I have said payment by way of insurance has nothing to show for it at the end of the period of insurance. Buti t is even less true of this agreement than it was of the last.

Beside the adequate protection which we shall receive during the period of the agreement, we shall, under this article, be training our own men in naval matters, and upon its expiration we shall have a large body of well-trained Australians and New Zealanders, who will be ready, if need be, to play their part in our naval defence. It is true that some of them may be under engagement to serve in the British Navy, but they will undertake to serve only upon the seas which are within the sphere of operations; and if, believing that we can do better for our protection with an Australian Navy, we dispense with the assistance of the Imperial Navy, their experience and training will be useful to us. Even if we admit, for the sake of argument, that there will be nothing material to show for our expenditure, it must he allowed that we shall have the consciousness of doing something towards bearing a fairer share of the responsibilities of the Empire.

Mr O'MALLEY -What about Wales1 Sir EDMUNDBARTON I include the Welsh, too. Let us call ourselves Britons. In using the term Britons ini Australia, I wish it to be as clear as possible that, in my belief, we have not forfeited, by our emigration, or by that of our fathers, any of the rights of Britishers athome, or any of our share in either the glory or the material prosperity of the Empire. We are Britons of the Empire. We did not sever ourselves from the rest of the Empire when we came here, neither did the fathers of those of us, who like myself are natives of the soil, do so. We retain our heritage, and with it our responsibilities. We cannot have the one, and say "" no "" to the other, because the thing is impossible, and because we should.be poor Britons if we did. Surely, the consciousness that we are at least making a small attempt towards the equalization of these burdens is "" sometiling to show "" for our expenditure. W it h regard to the next objection, that the agreement does not satisfy our local aspir. ations, or give proper scope to our patriotism, I recognise to the full the importance of this contention, and have always endeavoured to so mould the Constitution and the legislation of the Commonwealth as to give fuller scope for the national aspirations of Australians. But this is a case where our patriotic feelings towards the Empire of which Australia forms a part must express themselves, because we regard the Empire as one for purposes of naval defence. If we do not take that view, we must accept the alternative, that the Empire must operate by scattered units, and lose the power of concentration, and its Navy be by so much the more open to defeat and capture in detail. We must look at the great question of naval the Empire. Heaven forbidthat I should ask any one to relinquish his feeling of local patriotism, or to do anything which would be unjust to his fellow citizens in Australia. But we can be just to Australia and still meet our obligations to the Empire so long as we recognise them. On the day when we cease to recognise them, we should be honest, and say to the mother country, "" We want to go.""

Nobody w ill . doubt the honesty and enterprise of that country, bub is ib not too much to tell me that because Canada, out of all the self-governing dominions, is the only one which does not acknowledge this obligation, I am unfair to Canada when I say that this is an obligation which we ought to assume ? Sir include French Canada? shall not enter into those racial questions or the bitter controversies which flow from them; it is not necessary to my purpose to do anything of the sort. I am trying to point out that this proposal does not involve any want of loyalty to Australia. Under this agreement we shall give Australia better protection than we could if we adopted the alternative of an Australian Navy, unless we went to a cost which, in our' present stage, is prohibitive. There can be no want of loyalty in giving Australia adequate defence at a much lower rate than it would otherwise cost. While we remain part of the Empire, there will arise questions of Imperial rather than of local importance, and they will arise even if we turn away and shut our eyes. Buti t is our duty to have regard to these questions so long as we remain in the Empire, and to recognise what our position requires of us, not to the extent of slavish adherence to everything done by others, but to the extent of realizing that with participation in the advantages of the Empire comes reciprocal obligation. Holding the views we do as to the sound principle of naval defence, we are unable to subscribe to the theory that our loyalty to Australia calls upon us to set up a separate Navy. The third objection to the scheme is that we wish to train our own sailors. I admit that that is our wish ; and I hold that theagreement affords full scope for its accomplishment. As part of the great British Navy, our men, as things are now, will get better training than they could hope to get in a local squadron manned entirely by our intelliown men. The leading, guidance, and experience we can obtain for their training under such an agreement would, on the sudden creation of .a purely Australian Navy, not be obtainable, unless we bought that guidance and experience by paying salaries to British officers. Naval defence is now a matter for experts. Every man, I suppose, will soon, to some extent, have to have some expert knowledge. I do not profess to have any. gentleman has given us some to-night at any rate Sir EDMUNDBARTON I profess to follow the opinions of those who know more about the subject than either the honourable pose to follow those who give what, in my poor judgment, are sound reasons for their opinions, and who have converted those opinions into a policy which follows traditional lines, and is as effective and hopeful to-day as it was in the day of its birth. I must refer, at this point, to the proposals for dealing with the local naval forces. It is hoped that the bulk of the local forces may be absorbed by the new arrangement. It is clear that opportunity will exist for this absorption, because I have absolute confidence that the rates of pay offered will be sufficient to warrant our own people, even those who have had their training with us, in joining under the new arrangement either as active seamen or as reservists. of all ranks ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON It applies as far as possible. I am not quite sure-and I say this frankly-to what extent the arrangement will apply to the higher grades of officers. If it does not apply to them we must endeavour, to the best of our ability, to see that they do not suffer. But, to allow full opportunity for carrying on some local naval defence, the whole of the existing naval forces will be provided for in the Estimates for the year 1903-4. Honourable members are aware that there has been considerable reduction in the cost of the local naval defences, not",55,Willis The Men To Such That They Had To Go Back To Persia

259,Mr Crouch,"Does that apply to menfor the purposes of this agreement, but as part of a general scheme of retrenchment. For the forces as they stand after this scheme of retrenchment has been carried out, provision will be made in the Estimates for 1903-4, the amount being, if I mistake not, something like £43,000. As honourable members will see, the new arrangement does not include harbour defences. In future, as opportunity arises and as funds allowbecause we do not wish to rush into inordinate expenditure it may be advisable to have torpedo boats or torpedo destroyers at each of the principal ports, as a means of special harbour defence. That will not be done immediately, but, as I say, as opportunity and funds permit. Now, I must refer to the local naval defence force, as it exists at her hull is so strong that she can stand present. In Australia, besides two torpedo boats at Melbourne bourne four torpedo boats, two of which are good. torpedo boats at Melbourne, as my right honourable friend says, are good, while the other two are obsolete, like those which were sold at Sydney the other day. Besides the Cerberus, and the four torpedo boats at Melbourne, there are the Protector at Adelaide, and the Palwmah and the Gayunda at Brisbane. Afterf u l l consideration, and after taking such expert opinion as is available, the Minister for Defence has come to the conclusion that if it were proposed now to buy the Cerberus we should never enter into the expenditure. As an alternative, which may prevent further expenditure for some years to come on fixed defences for Hobson's Bay, Port Melbourne, and Williamstown, ib is proposed to re-arm the Cerberus with four 7 5 quick-firing guns at a cost of about £20,000. The maintenance of the vessel, which has been heretofore more expensive, will probably cost £10,000 a year ; at any rate, I think, not more. The expenditure will meet the cost of employing a crew partly permanent, and, I understand, partly made up of naval militia. ing fort. we regard her as a floating fort. The speed of the Cerberus is slow, and she could, of course, no more overtake a modern cruiser than Tommy Atkins on foot could overtake a mounted Boer. But she has a remarkably sound hull, which will standa lot of battering, and it is estimated that even with her low speed, confined as she would be to Hobson's Bay-which , though expansive, is small in comparison to the open sea-sh e could very well meet requirements for some j'ears to come. Under the circumstances, it is regarded as a fair and economical proposal, as these matters go, to re-arm this vessel with modern guns, in which case, notwithstanding her slow speed, she would be able to, at any rate, keep within range of opposing vessels as they approached ancl as they passed on, should the} want to get away from her, and 7 thus, for a considerable time during transit, have opportunity enough of inflicting damage on an enemy. As I have said, a good deal of knocking about, and, with modern armament, she could give as There are at Melmuch as she received while an opposing vessel was within range, or she could come up with vessels which had succeeded in getTwo of the ting up the Bay, and inflict damage on them, while they wSre attempting bombardment. This re-armament of the Cerberus will serve instead of building forts at Port Melbourne oi' AVilliamstown. AVe are advised that if the Cerberus be re-armed as proposed, she will make-as the honourable member for Richmond said-a n excellent floating fort for harbour defence, ancl the proposals I have mentioned will stave off for some years increased expenditure on fortifications at the Heads. Melbourne is an exceptional port. The proposals may be said to be necessai-y by reason of the peculiar geographical featu res of Port Phillip. The broad expanse of the Bay in front of the city justifies action of the kind, while it could not be so well or advantageously taken elsewhere. The Protector at Adelaide will also be provided for in the Estimates for 1903-4. After the new arrangement comes into force, and when us much as possible of the old establishment of men has been absorbed, then it will no't be of advantage any longer to retain the Protector. That vessel will therefore be sold, ancl in her place, as means allow, special harbour defence will be provided. The Palumah and the Gayunda are two small gun-boats which were acquired by the Queensland Government some years ago, and which do not appear now to be efficient as fighting vessels; and both of these will be treated in the same way as the Protector. The last objection I have to answer is that this scheme is the outcome of ""swollen",56,Langdon Bonvthon Doe S I T Not Member For Parramatta Or Myself I Pro

263,Sir Edmund Barton,"That is howImperialism "" ; and I think I have seen that phrase in print. Those who take that view, if I may be pardoned for saying so, would do well to reconsider their conception and meaning of the Empire. The British Empire is not like Empires of old, which were constituted for the purpose of enabling some central authority to dominate and enslave the rest. As the component parts of the British Empire have acquired self government, in that very degree have they themselves become stronger, and, contrary to the principle acted on of old, so much stronger has the old country herself become. It is true that the accretions of strength and population, and the accumulation of wealth in the self -.governing countries, must mean more trade, and, to that extent, must enrich the Empire. that the Empire has a direct interest in every part of the Empire in the protection of trade, and we ourselves have a direct interest in it ; but there is much of the trade in which the United Kingdom, as a part of the Empire, has no direct interest. We are constituted as no Empire in the world has ever been constituted. This is the first time in history that an Empire has, in equal pace with its acquisitiocs, bestowed the blessings of free institutions on all its nascent communities as soon as they have been able to walk under the burden of responsible government. That has been our unfailing experience, and it is an experience which has been so f r u it f u l that it will not die. AVe may expect, therefore, that what the Empire has been in its growth so it will be in its consolidation, and, if necessary, in its extension. Eor my part, I am fain to hope that the "" weary T it a n "" we have heard of, who is supposed to "" stagger under the too vast orb of his fate,"" may see some limit hereafter to theprocessof acquisition of new territory. Buti t is impossible to expect that, or, at any rate, to expect it soon. Theueedsof theEmpireare constantly progressing, and as the various parts of it become populated by our race, it may be necessary, little by little, and later on, perhaps, to a larger degree, to seek fresh fields. That will mean further expansion, whether it be intended for mere expansion, or is the necessary operation of the self-interest of those who go out to seek fresh fields. But the process, however much it may be interrupted-howeve r much it may be checked here and there-is not yet coining to an end. There may be some amongst us who think that the responsibilities which Empire carries in its train will make it undesirable that an end of the process should come. But as the Empire advances it must be mightier; and we, who are a part, will share in that added might. It is not for us, therefore, to prematurely think of taking any other course than that which makes for the consolidation of the Empire; and in so making for consolidation we make for our own protection. Almost to conclude a speech that I am afraid has been too long, perhaps I ma}' be allowed to read some words from an author who has so expressed himself that it is vain for any mortal to expect to clothe his ideas in fitter form. It is true Mr O'MALLEY -Is that Longfellow 1 have something to quote from Longfellow, too. There is a passage in Buskin's Lectures on Art, which is full of truth as well as of beauty. Written for young Englishmen, it applies, with very little alteration, to Australians, and, indeed, to all, whatever their age may be, who, like ourselves, are Englishmen, or Britons, of the Empire. This is what Ruskin says in speaking, not of the navy, but of the mission and of the sense of Empire :There is a destiny now possible to us-th o highest ever set before a nation-to be accepted or refused. We are still undegenerate in race ; a race mingled of the best Northern blood. We are not yet dissolute in temper, but still have the firmness to govern and the grace to obey. We have been taught a religion of pure mercy, which we must either now finally betray or learn to defend by fulfilling. And we are rich in an inheritance of honour, bequeathed to us through a thousand years of noble history, which it should be our daily thirst to increase with splendid avarice, so that Englishmen, "" if it be a sin to covet honour,"" should be ""the most offending souls alive."" Within the last few years we have had the laws of natural science opened to us with a rapidity which has been blinding by its brightness ; and means of transit and communication given to us, which have made but one kingdom of the habitable globe. One kingdom :but who is to be its king ? Is there to be no king in it, think you, and every man to do that which is right in his own eyes; or only kings of terror, and the obscene empires of Mammon ancl Belial?

For my own part, I do not believe that those who are against the naval subsidy are actuated by any such motives. Certainly, I am not in the slightest degree in favour of breaking the English connection. I love England; I love the English people ; and I am exceedingly sorry that sometimes there should be a manifestation of antagonism to the British Empire. So far as England and Australia are concerned, I say-""May their connection very long continue."" I am all the more pleased to have an opportunity of saying this, because the Minister for Defence, in his speech upon the Address in Reply, raised the question of the naval subsidy, and when I said I was in favour of voting no subsidy at all, the right honourable gentleman waved his big hand towards me and said that he and I were as far asunder as the poles, and that he would rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a Briton."" Then, unfortunately, the right honourable gentleman had his speech privately reprinted from Hansard and distributed all over the States. He also stated that he would remind . me of what Sir Walter Scott saidBreathes there a man and then he said' that he would not quote the words ..about an honourable member. I do not know whether the Minister for Defence forgot the context, but I should like to remind him of the lines that follow. I could not quote a better passage if I wished to select some lines in support of the principle which I am advocating. Theyare theseBreathes there a man with soul so dead Who never to himself hath said"" This is my own, my native land."" I hold that sentiment, because I believe'in Australia, and because I feel that I am doing my duty to Australia at the present time in refusing to vote for this Naval Subsidy Bill. I hold that my duty to Australia keeps me from supporting the Bill. My responsibility under the Constitution under which we have only the limited degree of freedom which England gives us, compels me to take up this attitude. The Prime Minister said an "" Englishman in Australia has. equal power with an Englishman in England."" Unfortunately he has not. The Australian is limited to local self-government ; the Englishman controls the whole Empire; his voice and his hand are felt to the ends of the earth. I am not an elector of the British Empire; I have nothing to say in its control, and shall have nothing to say in the control of the naval subsidy if this Parliament votes it . It is because of those considerations that I am against this proposal, although I can agree with a good deal of what the Prime Minister has said with regard to the concentration of ships and the necessity of attacking an enemy in detail. But the Prime Minister has not in the slightest degree answered the arguments of those who are opposed to this Bill. I do not think that the Minister for Defence has treated me fairly, nor do I think that the Prime Minister has treated this House fairly in making it appear that those who look to the interests of the Empire must support the Bill. Becausei t is only Australia that we have to legislate for. It is not the Empire. We have to do our duty to Australia. There is an old proverb which says "" The eyes of the fool are to the ends of the earth."" Perhaps the Minister for Defence will remember that. I may also remind him .that JEsop has a proverb of a man who used to look only at the stars, and so fell into the pit. There are two lines of Tennyson which admirably represent the point of view which I takeThat man's the true Cosmopolite Who loves his native country best. Andi t is because that is the attitude which I take up, and because my responsibility lies entirely to Australia in this matter, that I have assumed this position in opposing the naval subsidy. There is one other thing which I object to in the position of the Prime Minister, and it is that the right honourable gentleman has not assumed a very statesman-like attitude with regard to the question. ThatI know is a very serious statement to make, coming from a junior member of this House, as applied to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and I am aware that I ought to be called upon to justify it . But I ask those who question my view, and who have heard the right honourable gentleman's speech this afternoon, to notice what he said in reply to some queries which were put to",59,Langdon Bonvthon Doe S I T Not Member For Parramatta Or Myself I Pro

If the right honourable gentleman proposes to start building -an Australian Navy, we should know that now, and the House should know that we are to have an Australian Navy at the end of ten years. If the Prime Minister can give me that promise, I can quite imagine that, owing to the difficulties created in Austhattralia by the ""Braddon blot"" in the Constitution, it might even be desirable to accept this agreement in the meantime. However, there is nothing of the kind placed before us, and we are told-""Her e is an agreement that will give us peace in our time. Heaven help us at the end of the next eight years."" A t the end of that time no one knows what may happen. destruction of the ' Protector and the Queensland gun-boats, and by the cutting down of the crew of the Cerberus, we may be left absolutely in the lap of the Colonial-office, with no power to do anything but to call upon the Imperial authorities again. We shall have 1,600 men at the end of that time coming out of their service, and immediately the argument will be used that in order to keep those men in their positions we-must continue to support this Imperial Navy until the end of time. That is not a position in which the Prime Minister should place us. I first of all object to this Bill because those who have read it through speak of it as a contract to which the Imperial Government and the New Zealand Government .are definitely bound, but to which the Commonwealth is not bound until the Federal Parliament has spoken. That is the statement we had in the Maitland Town Hall, in the Sydney Town Hall, and in the Melbourne Town Hall, from the Prime Minister, and it is the statement we have heard here to-night. I must accept the statement of our own Prime Minister as correct, but I find in the London Times -of the 6th March, 1903, these replies to questions upon Australian matters given by Mr Austen Chamberlain, who was at the time acting I cannot say ; I for his father as Secretary of State for the Coloniesi n the English House of Commons. I find from the report of the Times thatMr E. Robertson drew attention to the proceedings of the Colonial Conference held in the summer. After commenting on the fact that, while the statements made by the British Ministers at the Conference hud been published, the replies of the Colonial Premiers had not been disclosed, he asked for the views of the Government upon the chief questions dealt with by theConference, namely, the naval and military defence of the Empire, and the commercial relations between the mother country and the self-governing colonies. With regard to the hitter subject he said that the net result of the Conference was a recommendation that the self-governing colonies aud themother country should give one another preferential treatment in trade. In reply, Mr Austen Chamberlain stated The Government would have been glad to publish in extemso what had taken place at the Conference, but that this could not be done, as some of the Colonial representatives desired that their speeches should be treated as confidential. It was the view of the Government that these Conferences were useful as they supplied opportunities for the interchange o£ views between the colonies and the mother country, and fostered the By the growth of a better understanding between all parts of Bis Majest3''s dominions. This was true in spite of the fact that the resolutions of the Conference wore binding upon no one. They were valuable as containing what the Premiers thought could be submitted to their respective Parliaments with some expectation of approval. Communications had been passing with some of the Colonial Governments upon the subject of their contributions to the Navy. down on the Estimates for the Navy. jection, I might say that that is so ; but they said that they did not desire to be so uncomplimentary to tbe colonies as to suggest that they were not going to pay the subsidy. That is a statement which will be found in^the last weeldy issue of the Times. Mr Austen Chamberlain went on to sayHe had no reason to suppose at present that additional contributions towards the naval and military expenditure were likely to be offered ; but, of course, bhe Government would welcome further help if it were offered spontaneously by the Governments concerned.

The reasons are four :-First, that these States have looked to the protection of the British Navy, consequent upon an understanding in 1870 with the Imperial Government through Lord Granville, when Imperial troops were withdrawn from Australia, that we would look after the land defence if the United Kingdom provided sufficient sea defence. Australian States weredivided and separate, and unless their naval defence was to be purely harbour defence, none of them could buy or man the ships necessary for the defence of the whole island, part of which, t ill 1890, remained under Imperial control. The third reason is found in the strong discouragement of the Imperial authorities of any local naval effort. This has been England's traditional policy, not only to friendly allies, but to her own colonies. Her attitude towards the American Colonial Navy was ever that of suspicion and animosity, whilst a prominent Australian naval writer saysI t would seem to be due to antipodean topsyturvydom that'Australia, an island 13,000 miles from the war base of the Empire, should have received no encouragement to train her sons for service afloat, and yet, on the other hand, has received, and continues to receive, ever}' form of persuasion to raise an army. The island motherland, separated by a narrow stretch of channel from Continental foes, has based her defence on her sea power. Australia, separated by many thousand miles from a possible enemy's base, hits been steadily enjoined to adopt a policy of defence the reverse of that so steadily pursued by the motherland, and so well suited to our geographical conditions, and the qualities of the race. Discouragement and aloofness have been the constant attitude of the Imperial authorities towards naval development in everj' Australian colony. This is well known to every officer who has had any association with Australian naval matters. It would be easy to give dozens of instances, but it will be quite sufficient to recall the reply of the Admiralty to the very modest request from New Zealand for a training-ship to be stationed at Auckland. The Admiralty declined, because it would be difficult, if not impossible, at the antiquired to produce effective forces, but it is the podes to give ships' boys of fourteen and fifteen the scientific training necessary to the navy. The Times of that date waxed merry over the ponderous absurdity of the reasons given for refusal. The fourth reason is found in the subsidy already paid by the Australian States when separated, and the local Navy since 1.889 by the Imperial This has, in the opinion of many, made it quite unnecessary for Australians to defend Mr Crouch. themselves. They are willing, as were many of the nations of Europe about three centuries ago, and as was the Roman Empire in the days of its decline and weakness, to pay other men to do this work. They would subsidize Imperial sailors to defend Australian coasts. They would pay in cash what they are unready or unwilling to give in men or in service. Now that Australia is federated, and the English Government Secondly, the has put such strong pressure upon the Commonwealth Ministry for an increased subsidy, and particularly as the term for which the yearly subsidy of £106,000 arranged in 1887 has expired, these conditions no longer obtain, and federated Australia should look at the position in the light of existing circumstances, and the new conditions obtaining. Andi t must be remembered that it was never intended by Admiral Tryon, when he in 1886 negotiated with the Australian States ;the Imperial subsidy, that the management and control of the Australian Navy should last longer than the consummation of the Federal union. This can be seen from the biography of Admiral Tryon by Rear-Admiral Penrose-Fitzgerald. He says that Admiral Tryon was above all things practical, and knew perfectly well that in the then state of Australian colonial development it would not be possible to have a thoroughly efficient sea-going squadron manned otherwise than by Imperial officers and men. He, however, had no doubt of the desirability of Australians furnishing the personnel of their own defence force when practicable, and when Federation came. I have in my possession a copy of a letter which Admiral Tryon-wh o negotiated with the Ministers of the several States, as well as with the Premier of New Zealand, the naval subsidy of 18'87-addresse d in 1886 to Sir Samuel Griffith, who was then Premier of Queensland. In this letter he pointed out that I t is not a mere subsidized force that will do what is wanted. It is not only money that is repersonal service of our countrymen all over the world. It is blood rather than gold that is the basis of every true force; and to awaken the true spirit the Government of each colony, the people of each colony, should manage, as far as possible, their local forces during the time of peace. Unless they do so, the burden of cost will be irksome, and the interests of the people in their provided maintenance-whic h is a first factor for successauthorities. will not be evoked. history.",62,Langdon Bonvthon Doe S I T Not Member For Parramatta Or Myself I Pro
283,Mr Mauger,"That is rather ancientMv. CROUCH repeats itself. The promises t h a t were held out in 1S86 are the delusions t h a t we are supposed to accept in 1903. In 1913 it w ill again be asserted t h a t the time is not yet ripe for the creation of an A u s t r a l i a n Navy. The subsidy has jumped from £ 1 0 6 , 0 0 0 per a,nnum, as agreed to in 1887, to £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, which is now asked for ; and in 1913 we shall probably be asked for a subsidy of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. We shall then be in the position t h a t we now occupy, and strong arguments w ill be p u t for w a rd in favou r of binding us to the I m p e r i al contract, w it h no control whatever over our A u s t r a l i a n possessions. I wish to make a f u r t h e r quotation from A d m i r a l Tryon, because he has made history in relat i o n to this matter, and his words are n ot so ancient t h a t we should refuse to accept them as conveying some lesson to us. A d m i r a l Fitzgerald f u r t h e r quotes Sir GeorgeT r y o n as sayingThe system of local corps tends to identify the population with the defence. It is less likely to languish. It gives experience to many in the .supply and in the use of warlike stores. aiot continuously separate the men from their wives unci families. It habituates the people to feel that some day they may be required to make personal sacrifices. It gives a sense of security. It tends to allay panic. It accustoms the Governments of the countiy to study the questions involved, and the responsibilit}' which belongs to it on this subject is kept perpetually before it. The essential to do justice to local corps is a nucleus of trained men and experts.

Can Australians do the work and man the ships 1 And can the Commonwealth w it h o u t unnecessary expenditure raise the N a v y and man it 1 The Prime Minister has p u t other points before us, b u t those are the questions which I propose to answer. The first consideration-What is required for the thorough defence of A u s t r a l i a n coasts 1-is one for an expert, and for t u n a t e l y it has been carefully considered by a prominent A u s t r a lian w r it er on the M a r in e Defences of our Coasts. He writesTrue defence favours the use of that which is near rather than that which has to be brought from a great distance. It is preferable to have our means of defence at hand. To-day we are dependent for our ships, men, and guns, on the mother country, 13,000 miles away. That is a glaring weakness. Men, at least, we can, and It shows t h a t history should provide. The nearer we can become self-supporting the better.

It was published anonymously, but -1 am satisfied t h a t the w r it e r knew what he was t a l k in g about, and t h a t if I were in a position to give his name to the honourable member he would thoroughly appreciate his fitness to express an opinion upon this subject. The second question to which I have referred is, "" CanA u s t r a l i a do the work and man the ships 1"" On this point, I have a statement by A d m i r a l Beaumont, who n a t u r a l l y takes the I m perial view. In a report to the Governor-. General, which was presented to b o th Houses of this Parliament on the 10th J u l y , 1901, he w r o t e It will be seen from the size and number of the ships required, from the necessity which will undoubtedly arise o£ replacing them from time to It does time by more modern ships, from the fact that they must be continuously manned b}' trained officers and men, and that the ships must not only be maintained in commission, but must be gradually provided with new bases, that it is beyond the power of the Commonwealth at the outset to create such a force. It follows, therefore, that such a force can only be acquired and maintained by arrangement with the Imperial Government, a n d . I believe that if this course was adopted it would also follow that the greatest amount of good would be .maintained at the smallest possible cost. In view of the Federal first Government providing for. the immediate future the naval subsidy agreement an adequate and up-to-date sea-going fleet for the defence of Australian floating commerce and the protection of Australian territory, I consider that it should take no part in the creation or maintenance of naval reserves or State naval forces, which experience has shown cannot be utilized in a manner at all commensurate with their cost, or assist, except within too narrow limits; in tbe defence of the Commonwealth. This is an adverse criticism of the local naval men which we know to beundeserved. On the other hand, L o r d Brassey, late Governor of ""Victoria, who for years has interested himself in this question, states t h a t A u s t r a l i a n seamen could sufficiently man the ships. T h a t view is supported by the resolutions passed by a conference of naval officers which met at Melbourne on 5 t h August, 18S9, a t the instance of the States Governments, to discuss the question of naval defence for A u s t r a l i a .

285,Mr Crouch,"I am quoting from anadopted. naval commandants of Queensland, South Australia, and Victoria, as well as the Victorian Secretary for Defence-fou r officers of the Royal Navy, who agreed unanimously to three resolutions. The first of their resolutions wasThat whilst a Royal Navy Reserve cannot, in our opinion, be raised in Australia on conditions required by the Admiralty, yet we consider that a naval force that would be efficient and available for service in vessels of war, can be raised on rates of pay and conditions of service suitable to the colonies. The second resolution-and they supported all of these resolutions with facts which formed part of their report-was That such force should be formed by the amalgamation of the existing naval permanent establishments, who would be the instructional staff and required nucleus for maintenance of the .vessels in reserve ; the complement of the vessels being made up by tiie officers and men not permanently employed, but maintained in efficiency by courses of annual training. This force would be maintained and controlled by the Federal Government, and would be governed by a Federal Discipline Act and Regulations which would provide for their employment in general naval service. The third resolution wasThe Admiralty to provide ships of a type effective for service in time of war, which, in peace time, would be stationed at the principal ports for the drilling and training of the local naval force. These ships to be maintained by the Federal Government, and to be subject to periodical inspection by the Naval Commander-inChief. It is significant to note that the report was signed and adopted by every member of the Conference. It is also worthy of notice that the present Minister for Trade and Customs objected, in 1S97, to the continuance of the Imperial subsidy, preferring that we should train our own men in an Australian Navy. I find also that prior to the Federal elections the Attorney-General, as well as the honourable member for Gippsland, and, I think, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, were members of a league known as theNational Liberal Organization, which had, as one of the planks of its platform, a proposal for the creation of an Australian Navy. That plank was adopted by many honourable members of this House when they went to the'eountry. member of that league. member was, but I will not argue the point with him. I am surprised to learn The conference comprised the that the leader of the Opposition intends to support the Government in regard to' this Bill, for I find that when it was reported in January last that the Prime Minister proposed to agree to a naval subsidy of £200,000 per annum he said that would take time to consider the proposal. was published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on 13th January, 1903, he said thatThere was an attempt made when I was iu England in 1897, not an official attempt, but a. tentative proposal, aiming at a removal of that feature of the agreement, so as to enable the Imperial Government to take the ships away at any time ; in fact, that they should be subject usmuch to the direct and unrestricted control of the Admiralty as are the ships of the Imperial Navy. I would not listen to it, and the proposal was dropped. I do not think that the other Premiers would listen to it. At any rate, I know that I would not. We now find that the policy of the Admiralty really all through has been this, that tlie first agreement was a round-about way of getting an Australian contribution to the Imperial Navy, without any Australian stipulation as to tlie locality of the vessels. I don't want prematurely to criticise the Government for what it has done. I will give the matter every consideration, but my present impression is that the change is a bad one. In view of that declaration, I was surprised to hear the statement made by the leader of the Opposition in the course of his speech on the address in reply that he was in favour of the increased subsidy. I should like to say further that in the course of the interview to which I have already referred, he stated thatIt would be very much better to have a straight out contribution to the Imperial navy at once, and to stipulate that the Imperial Government should maintain a certain strength on the, Australian station. It seems to me altogether at variance with the principle which prompted the first arrangement that there should be no sort of stipulation as to the control of the Federal Executive over the despatch of the ships beyond Australian waters. The final question which I propose to consider is whether the Commonwealth can, without unnecessary expenditure, raise a navy and man it . This \s a phase of the I do not think I was a question to which the Prime Minister has given so much attention that he has sunk almost every other consideration.

A g a in , his speech in SouthA f r i c a is reported in the Times of the 13 th February, 1903, in these termsThough hinting at the possibility of a financial contribution towards the war from the Cape, the Colonial Secretary did not go further than poinb to the present prosperity of the colony, the Cape being in fact the only self-governing colony which, as a colony, has profited by the war.

He did nob forget bhe Cape's contribution to the navy, but reminded the colony that its -£00,000 was not sufficient to keep a cruiser in commission for six months, and that bhe annual cost of bhe Soubh African squadron was £400,000. T h a t is a prebty good indication of his intent i on in regard to a country where he is master at the present time, and in the Transvaal, where he rules by a Legislative Council.

On the cover of every one of its publications appear the following figures and statements:The revenue of the colonies is Dearly half that of tlie United Kingdom (43,000,000 to 91,000,000), but they only contribute one-ninetieth part of the cost of the naval defence of the Empire. This is set down at the date of these figures at £20,200,000. Apparently the colonies, to satisfy the Imperial Federation Defence Committee, of 30 Charlesstreet, Berkley Square, London, would have to contribute a little over £9,000,000.

It But you are Britons, and you like to be talked to by Britons. SoI leave that matter of the naval defence with the fullest confidence in the result, with the fullest confidence that when the Australian, or the New Zealander, or the British' South African gives his consent to doingthis, the Canadian will,in generous rivalry, say-""Well, I do'nt mean to be behind that."" The reply of SirW i l f r i d L a u r i er and his Ministers to the proposal t h a t Canada should j o in in this subsidy is a straight-out vindicat i on of their loyalty, not only to the Empire, but to Canada. Their memorandum prepared for the 1902 Conference, a t which the PrimeM in is t e r of A u s t r a l ia took up so different an attitude, reads as follow :The Canadian Ministers regret that they have been unable to assent to the suggestions mode by Lord Selborne respecting the navy, and by Mr Brodrick respecting the army. The Ministers desire to point out that their objections arise not so much from the expense involved as from the belief that the acceptance of the proposals would entail an important departure from the principle of colonial self-government.

In effect, he bids them remember that they will not obtain the best security by coast-defence ships and localized squadrons, l5ut only by a mobile force. We entirely agree. This is just the advice we ventured to give the Australians when we suggested that they might very likely find it necessary to defend Australia in the Mediterranean. But though we are quite as firm as the firmest naval strategist on this point, we cannot agree that it necessitates the colonies hiring their defence from us by a mere money contribution. On the contrary, we hold that the best way of getting the colonies to realize the true nature of sea-power is for them to build and man sea-going navies of their own. Captain Mahan, we are glad to see, does not, apparently, regard this notion as forbidden. HeI do not think he said leaves the question entirely open. For ourselves, we hold that, in the long run, naval power rests on the naval spirit existing in the Empire that seeks naval power. But Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will never attain to that naval spirit which is the life-breath of maritime Empire, if the}' hire their naval protection in Britain, or merely pay in money. They will only fosber bhe naval spirit by having sea-going ships of their own, for whose up-keep and equipment their own statesmen and their own people have the fullest responsibility. When Australians man and officer ships paid for by Australian money, we shall see dockyards ancl naval reserves and naval bases of real value spring up in Australia. Mere money subsidies to the Home Admiralty will never create the spirit on which naval power rests. It is because we are so intensely convinced of the importance of sea-power bo bhe Empire, and of bhe sea-spirit, that we want to see Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and South African squadrons, for which the four free nations of the Empire are responsible, even though they place them in far-distant waters to learn their business, ancl to take their share of creatingand maintaining the command of the sea for the British Empire.",66,Edmund Barton Doe S My Honor Arises I F Australia And Great Britain Are

305,Mr Mauger,"The honourable and learnedonly proposing to quote a precedent which, I hope, honourable members will accept as -an historical parallel to our own. case. In the work to which I have referred the writer saysI t was at this troubled period that George -Grenville brought forward a motion for extracting a direct revenue from tlie colonies, influenced by the general complaint heard amongst the people of England, o£ the burden of taxation -which they were called upon to bear. George III . proposed such a step as a just, as well as an advantageous measure, for relieving the country from the financial difficulties occasioned by a war undertaken for the protection and security of the colonies themselves. That is just the argument of the Imperial Federation Defence League, of the Prime Minister, and of Mr Chamberlain. Here is another extractThe agents of America urged that in the course of the last memorable contest her patriotism had been so conspicuous that large sums had been repeatedly voted as an indemnification to the colonists for exertions allowed to be far beyond their means and resources ; and that the proper compensation to Britain for the expense of rearing .and protecting her colonies was the monopoly of their trade. . . . Pitt then addressed the House, and said that the profits to Great Britain from the trade of the colonies were £2,000,000 a vear, and that this was the sum which carried England triumphantly through the last war, and the price America paid us for protection. That is just the argument of Lord Napier, Lord Brassey, and. Earl Grey. If honourable members will substitute Australia for Americai n these passages, will remember the great sacrifices recently made in South Africa by the Commonwealth for the Empire, will consider the interest, enormous freight charges, and trade profits which are Annually drawn by England from these States, it will be seen how parallel are the two cases. It is to be hoped that the -advocates of an Imperial subsidy will not, like their forerunners, in the time-of George III . , try to drive the colonies to a similarly unfortunate sequel. Of course, it may be -said that it was then attempted to tax the American colonies without their own consent. But the difference between the proposals of 1760 and those of 1902 is not very great. Taxation without representation is no greater sign of decadence or of the enslavement of a people than is defence without service, paid protection without personal danger. The nation which gives its national security into the hands of another has ceased to live. right of people to separate existence and self-government is the power and ability of self-defence in danger. The man who gives up his sword in a fight, for another to defend him, does not deserve to bear a sword. The spirit of self-reliance is the first essential of national life, as of national defence. -That being so, it is well to note that the want of Australian control of the Australian Navy is proposed by hardly any others than Mr Chamberlain and the Australian Prime Minister. Almost every other publicist proposes to give to the colonies some control in the moneys they vote. The Honourable T. A . Brassey, addressing the Federal Union Committee on the 24th July, 1902, saidAs to Imperial Federation, he thought most of them would agree that the burden of defending this Empire was becoming too heavy for the taxpayers of these islands alone, and that the colonies as they increased in wealth and importance should take upon their shoulders some share of the burden. If the}' did so, it was obvious that we must give them a voice in Imperial policy and Imperial expenditure. One of the planks in the platform of the Imperial Federation Defence Committee readsThat if the self-governing colonies take their share in tlie cost of such a system of defence, they must have a proportionate share in its administration and control.' When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked, by way of interjection, a minute ago, if I thought it wise to place this view before the House, I did not reply to him, because I have in my possession a clipping from ' the Broad Arrow, a Service newspaper, which contains a sufficient answer to his question. It reads as follows :Because the taxation cart was put before the representation horse, the American colonies seceded from Great Britain, and because the naval contribution cart is put before the representation horse, the Dominion and Australia are regarded by the mother country very much as she regarded the plantations up to the imposition of the stamp duty. Before the schism with America, the ground had been prepared by Englishmen, who charged the colonists with meanness, shabbiness, and lack of. loyalty, and these Englishmen did not all ])as away with George III . Such an attitude should be guarded against if we are not to repeat the blunder of the eighteenth century in the twentieth. The colonies rest their arguments on the fundamental principles of the British Constitution, and their own Imperial growth. On what principles does the demand fur naval contributions without representation The only rest ? On none, except those whose faultiness is marked in history by the secession of the American colonies.",71,Country Frist Food Supplies Next Colonies V

Yet, at its last meeting, which was held in the Melbourne Town Hall, that body declared that it disapproved of this naval subsidy, upon the ground that it brought about a system of taxation without representation, and that some form of representation in the Imperial Parliament should precede the payment of this subsidy. MrJ ustice Holroyd has favoured me with the following extract from his address before that body at its annual meeting on the 29th March, 1900The South African war has elicited the opinion pretty freely expressed both here ancl in Canada that the colonies which have assisted the mother country in the prosecution of the war should be consulted on the settlement of the terms of peace. The two things, contribution ancl representation, common defence ancl shares in control, are the essentials of Imperial unity.

This isaveryshortmeasure, in regard to which I do not intend todetain the House very long. Honourable members will see that it is for the purpose of regulating the method of electing senators in case of periodical vacancies. The intention is to permit both elections to take place at the same time. The elected candidates who receive the greatest number of votes will under the Bill be elected to fill the periodical vacancies, and in the event of an equality of votes between two or morecandidates, not all of whom can be elected to fill the periodical vacancies, the returning officer will have a casting vote for the purpose of deciding who shall fill the periodical vacancies. The elected candidateswho are not elected to fill the periodical vacancies, are to be held to be elected to fill desire any further information I shall be glad to afford it in Committee. MrM c CAY (Corinella) I suppose the Government have considered the question the Bill. I am not referring to the question raised in another place, as to which elected senators shall be entitled to hold office for the longer term.. But, as I understand it, the Bill provides that when there is a casual vacancy, the elections for that, vacancy ancl for the regular vacancies shall be held at one and the same time, so that instead of voting for three senators the electorsmay vote for four, the fourth on the poll",72,Country Frist Food Supplies Next Colonies V

309,Debate (On Motion By Sir Jojin Quick),"being deemed the senator to occupy office for the shorter time. Section 15 of the Constitution readsAt the next general election of members of the House of Representatives, or at the next election of the letter of the Constitution. I certainly senators for the Senate, whichever happens first, a successor shall, if bhe term has not then expired, be chosen to hold the place from the date of Iris election until the expiration of the term. Looking at these words without reference to other sections of the Constitution, it appears to me that what is contemplated is a separate election to fill any extraordinary vacancy, and that all that is provided is that the election shall be held on the same day as the senatorial election or the election for the House of Representatives. Section9 of the Constitution readsThe Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws prescribing the method of choosing senators, but so that the method shall be uniform for all the States. Personally, I do not feel at all clear that the word ""method"" covers the case, seeing that the Bill not only alters the method of choosingthe particular senator, but also alters the conditions under which he is chosen. The Bill practically says that instead of having a triennial election for three senators, there may be, under certain circumstances, an election for four senators. A t first sight it seems to me that the proposal of the Bill contravenes both sections of the Constitution, which declare that three senators shall be chosen at the periodical election, and that any casual vacancy shall be filled at the next election of senators or the next election for the House of Representatives. The Act does not provide that casual vacancies shall be filled b}' combining the two elections. the question that has been raised, as I understand, in some of the States as to whether we have any right to regulate senatorial elections. I do not desire to go into that question, but I ask if it is quite clear thattheBillis constitutional. If the measure should afterwards turn out to be unconstitutional, it might give rise to great difficulties. I do not intend, however, to raise the question which, I understand, 'was raised in another place, whether all sitting senators shall in some mysterious way be elected for six years although there are four candidates at the poll. I am not .able to follow the argument by which that conclusion was arrived at, however comforting the conclusion may be to a sitting senator who presents himself for re-election. The other point, however, which I raise is worth the further consideration of the Government. It does not strike me as being at all clear that this Bill is within the spirit as well as do not think it is within the spirit of the Constitution; and when we consider the elaborate machinery for filling casual vacancies, so that there may be an election without causing extra expense, I venture to doubt whether it is within the letter. Sir EDMUNDBART ON ( H u n t e r Minister for External Affairs) I may say that this matter has received the attention of the Government; and, as a question of constitutional law, has had the special consideration of the Attorney-General. Apart from discussions with Ministers as a whole, I have had more than one conversation with the Attorney-General on the subject. We have looked into the matter to the best of our ability, and we have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent the adoption of the method proposed iu the Bill. I think it will be admitted that it is a most convenient method, and if it is within the powers conferred by the Constitution, and does not do any injustice to the electors, it would be advisable to adopt it . It is true that section 15 of the Constitution providesAt the next general election of the House of Representatives, or at the next election of senators for the State, whichever first happens, a successor shall, if the term has not then expired, be chosen to hold the place from the date of his election until the expiration of the term. That refers to casual vacancies. It is quite clear there may be an election for casual This is apart from vacancies, and also an election for periodical vacancies, and the only question is whether holding both at the same time would lead to any consequences not contemplated by the Constitution. If it be conceded that in the absence of any consequences not contemplated by the Constitution, there is no objection to the election being held at the same'time, and as one election, then I take it that the case for the Bill is established. I have not heard any suggestion which would tend to show that such consequences would result. It may be argued that the word "" method "" in section 9 does not cover the case, but unless the word can be shown to be used in a restricted sense, the general application must prevail. If we take the Constitution as using ordinary English terms, which are to be construed according to their natural meaning, I think the word "" method "" necessarily includes a process of the kind proposed. It may not be necessary even to argue so far as that. But as there is a provision for an elecproaching, there is no obligation to hold tion of senators for periodical vacancies, and a provision for an election for casual vacancies, and they are both to be held by a process of ballot, I think it would have to be shown in the affirmative that it was outside the Constitution before it could be said that this plan was not within the scope of the powers given to us. I , myself, think that as a matter of lawfor whatever my opinion may be worththe word "" method"" does really include such a process as taking the two elections on the same-day and at the same time. So that, on the whole, I think thab the matter may fairly be said to be within our powers. my opinion the time and place for an election of ' senators. ought to be prescribed by the State laws. ""We have made a provision in our general electoral law for the Commonwealth to provide the time and place for any election of senators. When that provision was put in the Electoral BillI urged that it was possibly outside our powers. Sir point now raised. opinion on the one side, and the Attorney General of South Australia has an opinion on the other. opinion of the Attorney-General of South Australia, because I rather think that he took his view from what was said in this House. We provided for the time and place of any election of senators, and so far as that provision is made. I think that it is ultra vires of our powers. But, of course, we had better pass it in this Bill because we have made a similar provision in the Electoral Act ; and it would be ridiculous if we were to correct an error in a smaller Bill, whilst leaving uncorrected the error in the principal A ct which this measure affects. As regards the provision for holding an election to fill casual vacancies at the same time and place as a regular senatorial election, I do not think that there is any obligation upon the Commonwealth Ministry to provide for a separate election for a casual vacancy. In municipal matters, for instance,, there is a provision somewhat analogous to this ; and I know that if a casual vacancy occurs when a general election is apa separate election for the casual vsicancy. It would be contrary to common senseto do so. There is no harm done in holding the two elections together. As. there is no provision to the contrary in our Constitution, we should act upon common sense lines, and hold the two elections at the same time. It cannot do an} harm to the 7 elector to do so, and it does not in ' the slightest degree confuse the elector's choice. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Perhaps the Minister will say whether that is so or not; because the question has been asked of me, time after time, whether the States are going to legislate in the matter, and whether the Electoral Act of the Commonwealth is to be the one under which the senatorial elections are to take place.

It might be that perhaps three casual vacancies have to be filled. It might I thiiik that it will possibly overcome the be that the whole of the seats in the Senate difficulty. for a State were vacated from .some cause or other. . What would be the result under this Bill? It seems to me that provision is made under which a candidate for a casual vacancy might be returned to fill a periodical vacancy. Surely that is not contemplated. For this Bill to declare which candidate the shall be elected for the casual vacancy, and which for the periodical vacancy, seems to me to be taking power out of the ing at different periods, and so far as I can hands of the electors. That should not be see there ia no provision made in the B ill done. I should like to know the viewB of to say which of the senators elected to fill the Minister. I had not the advantage of hearing the Minister for Home Affairs in moving the casual vacancies then existing. There may second reading of the Bill, or the statement be casual vacancies occurring afterwards, just made by the Prime Minister. I must but it does not apply to them, but only, to say, however, that it seems to me that tbe casual vacancies'existing at the time of the second paragraph of section 15 of the ConSenate election. stitution may, by-and-by, if the Bill we are now considering is made part of the Comthe positions in respect to which casual monwealth Electoral Act of 1902, lead to a vacancies may arise may have been elected state of things which would be very undeto hold office as senators terminating at difsirable.
