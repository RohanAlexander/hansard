I do not think that immigrants should be allowed to work their passages to Australia. That is prohibited under our navigation law. Vessels leaving here could not take away men to work their passage to some other place. further information regarding the outbreak of measles on board the Irishman/ for Melbourne mentioned the matter yesterday .at question time,, and again last evening, and informed me that he intended to make it tbe subject of a question this morning. In view of his doing so, I have been supplied with the following replyYes. I am informed that over fifty cases of measles have occurred during the voyage. It appears that the first case must have been infected before coming on board, and that the other cases were infected from this or other unrecognised cases. It is stated that there was some' delay in isolating the first case, and tbe quarantine officer at Adelaide reports that at his inspection on arrival of the vessel he discovered among tbe general passengers several cases with the rash already out. It is through such cases that the disease is widely spread through a ship. The vessel is also reported to be not very suitable for the accommodation of a laTge number of passengers, being essentially a cargo and",14,Setup

Home Affairs, upon notice1. Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to the statement made by the Attorney General (in reply to the question of the honourable member for Fremantle on Wednesday last) that no patent has been granted in the Commonwealth to the Powell Wood Process, and that an application for a patent was made as late as the 27th of September, 1912, by the Western Australian Wood Process Limited, that is seven days after the question of the use of treated karri sleepers iwas brought before the House? 2.

Evidently this Government are beginning to pay interest. my right honourable friend on the inauguration of an interest-paying era, and I hope sincerely, for the sake of the pockets of the taxpayers, that we shall pay shortly a little more interest. It is better to pay a little more interest on capital accounts, and so to relieve the taxpayers to some extent from the millions they are paying out of their hard earnings for the purposes of evading legitimate interest payments on the capital accounts of the Commonwealth. Then, again, there is to be another advance to the Commonwealth Bank. I take it that the item of £60.000 in respect of interest and sinking fund, to which I have just referred, is to pay interest on the loan which was floated last year, or, in other words, interest on the inscribed stock which was authorized to be issued. I presume that the Prime Minister expects during this financial year to spend the whole of last year's authorization amounting to about £2,250,000, and the £500,000 authorized this year. member was alluding to invalid and old age pensions.

There is an item here of £5,000 advanced to the Commonwealth Bank. I hope that the Treasurer will not again ask me why I do not "" let the man alone,"" because the Governor of the Bank does not leave us alone, but comes for money, and we have a right to stipulate the conditions, and to make all proper I congratulate inquiries as to how the money is to be expended.",18,Estimates

The Prime Minister has informed the Committee, in reply to the criticism of the honourable member for Flinders, that the extra cost of the Land Tax Department is to be accounted for partly by the permanent appointment of many employees whose positions had been only temporary. For -some time. I have been endeavouring to have some of the men in the New South Wales -office made permanent, but without success. They complain bitterly about being kept in temporary positions, saying that it was -unfair that they should have that status, because their duties require the possession of a good deal of technical knowledge, and -of an acquaintance with conveyancing law, and are of a strictly confidential nature. The final reply to my letters to the Department was that the desires of the men could not be complied with. Temporary hands may have been made permanent employ6s in some of the States, but not in the Sydney office. In my opinion it is ment should have increased from £55,000 to £80,000. Hadi t remained at £55,000 the amount would be very large. When the land tax proposals were before us, it was strongly urged in their favour that the collection of the tax would cost very little, because the returns would be furnished by the land-owners under heavy penalties for false statements, and, therefore, only a very small staff would be needed. It might have been expected, too, that the cost of collection would have been greater in the first year or so before the machinery had been got into full working order than now, and that there would be a decrease instead of an increase in the expense. At first, complications would naturally arise through the staff being new to its duties, and many unforeseen difficulties would crop up. I understand, however, that the cost of collection is increasing by leaps and bounds, and this year will amount to 25 per cent, more than it did last year. I endorse the remarks member for Parramatta about the unwisdom of erecting enormous buildings for banking premises throughout the Commonwealth. We have no warrant for the expenditure of huge sums on sky-scrapers for the accommodation of the Commonwealth Bank, seeing that it has yet no business. The honourable member pointed out, too, that the Act requires the production of a quarterly return, and that no such return has been made. The Commonwealth Bank is going to compete with the private banks throughout Australia, and yet we cannot be told what business it is doing. At the same time, the Governor is making arrangements for the purchase of blocks of land at enormous prices, and the erection of costly premises all over the Commonwealth. It is not sound that this matter should be intrusted wholly to one man. No one would cast any reflection on the Governor, but one man should not have the responsibility of expending huge sums of Government money. Very often the result of throwing temptation in the way is the downfall of the person tempted, and while I think that the Governor is a man of integrity and",21,Estimates

The Prime Minister has explained that the contribution to charitable institutions has been increased in connection with the maintenance of old-age pensioners by those institutions, but I fail to see why there should be an increase from £7,000 to £9,000 a year. granted that under a Labour Government very little charitable expenditure would be needed, but apparently for the maintenance of pensioners in institutions £2,000 more is required this year than last. I do not complain of the expenditure of money on charity of this kind. We should spend all that is needed to alleviate the sufferings of the aged and crease in expenditure is necessary. land) [11.45] -The honourable member for North Sydney has spoken somewhat unfairly of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable gentleman, They have been conducted as a man possessing business knowledge,, must know that it takes time to establish a bank, and that an immense expenditure has been necessary to put the private banks into their present positions. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is The Commonwealth Bank canevidently possessed of one of the essentials to success-confidenc e in the future of the institution that he is managing. If he had not that confidence he would have no right to his position. The private banks may well have nothing good to say of the Commonwealth Rank, because undoubtedly it will compete strongly with them. The Governor has, however, treated the State Savings Banks more than fairly by offering a lower rate of interest than they are offering. This action should 5 inspire confidence. The State SavingsBanks have already enormous sums invested, and their expenses are not so great as they were at the beginning, so that they can perhaps afford to pay interest at the rate of 3 or 4 per cent. But had* 1 the Governor of the Commonwealth Savings Bank offered a big rate of interest,. I should have felt a little alarmed because it would have looked like "" wildcat"" financing. He should be praised* for what he has done. No doubt, when the bank is well established, and the initial' cost of establishing it has been met, he will gradually increase the rate of interest, and begin to compete more largely with the State Savings Banks. He will have every right to the business he gets if the people choose to deposit their money in the Commonwealth instead of in the State Savings Banks. Regarding the complaint that there has been no quarterly return of the business of the bank, I would point out that it is only the Commonwealth Savings Bank that has commenced business, and It was taken for that the general bank will not be open before ist January next. When that bank has been opened, and is in full swing, I shall join with those who demand quarterly statements of its"" business. But the Governor must first be given an opportunity to get things in order.

I am not enthusiastic regarding rthe results of the Land Tax Act. -Undoubtedly it has done some good an breaking up big estates; but I am not satisfied with, its effect in some localities, and local residents admit that it has not been effective there. The --suspicion has entered my mind that the -chief reason for the ineffectiveness of the tax in those districts is that there has been a dodging of proper valuations.

(the matter clear to the honourable member, let me say that sometimes a man who has valued his land at £ 3 per acre for land tax purposes, asks £ 7 an acre for it when he proceeds to subdivide it, the increase representing only £ 1 per acre for improvements. -dodged in all directions.

Like others who have advo-cated this tax, I am tied fast to an exemption of £5,000 unimproved value, and if I altered my mind in that regard I should have to resign my seat in this Parliament. At the same time. I am also pledged to make the tax thoroughly effective. I therefore -urge the Treasurer to stand to his guns, and to see that effective valuations are secured, even if the cost of administration is slightly increased. The honourable member for New England seems to think that the land tax is not effective. localities. honourable member appears to differ from many of his party, who boasted at the beginning of the session that last year, as the result of the operation of this tax, £22,000,000 worth of land had been subdivided. I do not ascribe to the operation of the tax any such beneficial result. My own opinion is that if large estates had been cut. up to the extent suggested by honourable members opposite, we should not have had this year-as the Treasurer estimates to receivea revenue within £5,000 of the amount derived from this source during the first year of the operation of the tax. It seems to me that the increase of £25,000 in the cost of administering the Department is unwarranted. If , as a result of the tax, large estates are being cut up, the cost of administration should be reduced, and if from year to year the revenue from this source is to decrease, there is no reason why the cost of administration should be increased. It is an unbusinesslike procedure to convert a number of temporary assessors into permanent employees of the Department. When the Land Tax Bill was before us, we were told that we were going to avoid a very heavy expenditure by tlie introduction of the self-assessment system. The Bill provided for the most barbarous penalties where land-holders failed I contend that valuations are to send in correct assessments, but the assessment notices were no sooner circulated than a whole army of assessors was sent out to check the assessment made by the Either the self-assessment system is a farce, or there, is no necessity to Such a scheme carried out by a appoint a lot of permanent assessors. In Tasmania we have State assessors as well as Commonwealth assessors, dealing with land valuations, and it seems to me that if this tax is to be as effective as we were told it would be, there should be a lightening of these burdens. As to the suggestion that incorrect valuations are sent in, I believe that people have done their best to put before the Commissioner fair valuations of their property. If that were not so, we should have heard of many prosecutions. have simply increased the assessments made by land-holders.",23,Estimates

On the whole, I think that the land-holders have made out their returns, quite honestly, and as well as could be expected. That being so, it is strange that so many assessors should be appointed to travel round the country checking valuations. In passing the Bill, we believed we should avoid considerable expense by providing for self-assessments. Had we not thought so, I do not think that we should have agreed to the system. New Zealand Government found, after a time, that the self-assessment system was liable to a great deal of abuses-that owners of land far removed from railways arid other means of communication could undervalue their properties with impunity, knowing that there was not much likelihood of the Government ever demanding its surrender, whereas those owning land in favorable localities placed a high valuait is published in the Gazette. The Bank tion on it in the hope that the Government would give them 10 per cent, on their valuations, and take it over. Either the land-owners ought to be relieved of the necessity of furnishing returns to the Commissioner every twelve months, or permanent assessors ought not to be required. If we are to have permanent assessors, let them make the assessments, and let us give the owners the right of appeal. Land-holders would not object to the retention of these officers by the Department if they were relieved of the trouble of making up the annual returns. the increases that have been made in certain assessments, I understand that in some cases a decision has not yet been arrived at, although two years have elapsed since the Act was passed. I am informed that some time ago the Department found it practically impossible to assess certain values in cases where men held interests in land as well as in insurance and other companies. The complications with which the Department were confronted in these cases made it difficult to arrive at a decision, and I understand that where they did come to a determination to make an increase the revenue obtained was barely sufficient to justify the work involved in securing it. It is exceedingly difficult to determine what is the unimproved value of certain land interests. The only other matter to which I desire to refer is the land-holders are Commonwealth Bank. I hope that when it is well established, the quarterly return, which the Governor is required to furnish under the Act, will be promptly presented, so that honourable members wilt be able to see for themselves what progress is being made by the institution. I am rather inclined to agree with the honourable member for New England, that whilst we are all anxious that the provisions of the Commonwealth Bank Act passed last session shall be complied with, it must be recognised that the Governor has been busily engaged in organizing The work since his appointment, and that this is probably the reason why the first quarterly return has not been furnished as promptly as some honourable members would have liked. In view of that fact, I think that some slight margin sliould be allowed. has sent along a tentative report, the form of which has only to be settled before was only opened on the 17th July. on the 15th July, and it is gratifying to know that in Victoria alone deposits amounting to £350,000 have been made with the Savings Bank branch, an interesting feature of the business being that withdrawals are exceptionally small. This fact proves, to my mind, that even those outside the ranks of the workers are placing money on fixed deposit with the Bank. Then, again, in Queensland, where the Savings Bank branch has been in operaAs to tion for less than two months, the deposits amount to, I think, about £1.50,000.

The Victorian branch of the Bank is being carried on in an obscure building in Collins-street; the name is painted in modest letters on the window, and' there is nothing to suggest that deposits will be received there. The Governor is moving along modestly and quietly, and I rather admire him for his action; bpt, notwithstanding that there has been no blare of trumpets, the people are sending along their deposits. are over the interest-bearing limit in the State Savings Bank. They are getting interest on their deposits in both banks. of our Ministers have been cute enough to do that; that they have a certain amount in the State Savings Bank, on which interest is being paid, and that they are also drawing interest on deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I believe that honourable members opposite admire that kind of financing. I do not know how many valuers have been appointed in the various States, but it is only a little over twelve months since they were appointed in Victoria. In the first year of the-Land Tax the owners were called upon to make their own valuations, and then valuers were to be appointed in each State to revise them. In many cases in Victoria considerable increases have been made in the valuations, particularly in the fertile Western District. It is a great pity that we cannot prevent the multiplication of officers in this connection. In New Zealand, where, -of course, they have the advantage of only -one Government, one set of men make the municipal, the Dominion land tax, and the probate valuations; and such an arrangement, of course means considerable -saving. Wales all the municipalities outside Sydney base their rating on unimproved values, and, that being so, I think all the assessments-municipal , :State-migh t be made by one set of men. In Victoria, the Federal and State taxes are imposed on the unimproved value, so one set of officers should carry out both valuations. Unfortunately, however, the jealousy of State Righters continues to cost the taxpayers of the country considerable sums of money. tion of savings banks ! have addressed meetings, some of them in the honourable member's constituency, people have been astonished when they have learned that the Federal Treasurer offered the State Treasurers 75 per cent, of all the new business while leaving the old business undisturbed, and even a proportion of the remaining 25 per cent., while permitting the post-offices and postal officials to be used for the banking business. When the people realize the true position of affairs, they will not be able to understand why such a munificent offer was not accepted by the various State Treasurers. It is true that we looked forward to the expenses of the collection of the land tax being a light burden on the Commonwealth. We find that in Victoria the cost of collecting the State Land Tax on unimproved values in 1911-12 was £24,349, on a revenue of £293,823, and on an estimated revenue for 1912-13 of £290,000, or nearly £4,000 less than in the previous year, the expenses are expected to amount 1 0 £ 3 \ 5 3 The Treasurer has promised C 8 to explain fully how the £80,000 required to collect the Federal Land Tax is made up. The figures quoted in regard to State tax collection would appear to show that there may be several influences at work which would lead to an increase. A very fair comparison can be made between Victoria and the Commonwealth as a whole in this connection, because the State Land Tax and the Federal Land Tax, both on an unimproved value basis, were imposed about the same time. In the State, valuers had to be appointed and, of course, they cost money, but I would like to point out that the cost of collection in the case of fhe State is over 8 per cent., and in the case of the Commonwealth it is less than 4 per cent.

An honourable member to whom I spoke was amazed to learn that he is liable for two years' taxation. It will probably cost more to collect this tax than will be received, because the difficulties in the way of its collection are enormous. I ask the Prime Minister, therefore, to consider whether it is worthwhile to collect it. Although honourable members opposite wish to tax the big estates I do not think that they wish to penalize people. When the tax comes to be collected many persons will be unable to pay it, because they will have spent their incomes not knowing of it Department must deal with that matter. ister might well consider whether the tax will be worth collecting in view of what the collection would cost. Some very able articles are now appearing in the Argus on the subject of finance. be of value. 'T wish to draw attention is, I think, of importance. The writer deals with the question, how to meet a crisis. Banking crises occur periodically, and the proper time for legislating in regard to them is a time of peace and prosperity. In the Old Country it has been customary, when crises arrive, to suspend the bank charter, and make notes legal tender. It is usually not that the depositors are frightened that they will not get their money, but that they fear that others will get in before them,.and that they will have to wait. The Argus writer says that the Government, having control of the note issue, it is not possible to give the relief which is given in England In 1893 Sir George Dibbs made the notes of the banks legal tender in New South Wales. liament, which was in session. see this matter gone into.

261,Mr Archibald,"The Governor would have suggested that he should go through the affairs of the bank and approve of them, but the Prime Minister's suggestion is the better one. The Government would have the protection afforded by the knowledge of an experienced man. This being a time of prosperity, it is desirable to make provision now for emergencies. hope that the Government will seriously consider the suggestion of the honourable member for Darling Downs regarding the sugar industry. In the Moreton division a number of small farmers grow cane as a side crop, and they naturally desire definite information as to what is to be done in hampered rather than benefited by taking order to know whether it will be worthwhile to continue growing cane. The present uncertainty is playing havoc with the sugar industry throughout Australia. I should like the Prime Minister to urge the Commissioners to send him an advance report as early as possible. The relations between this Government and that of Queensland seem to be strained, though I am at a loss to know why, because „they are both interested in the sugar industry, and should try to work harmoniously to settle the important questions affecting it. Unless matters are expedited"", nothing will be done during the present session of this or the Queensland Parliament, in which case there will be another twelve months' delay, much to the detriment of the sugar industry -We have in these Estimates an item reI wish to know what provision is made for reimbursing charitable institutions for the maintenance of old-age pensioners. I know of one or two cases in which old-age pensioners have had their pensions stopped while they have been in hospitals, but what I am referring to is the complaint of the ininsurance laws in Australia. That Comstitutions that they get no assistance from the Government for maintaining old-age pensioners, and I understand that pensioners have been refused admission to some institutions on that ground. In a leaflet circulated on behalf of the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum on Hospital Saturday and Sunday, it is stated that the cost of maintaining the inmates is £ 2 1 3s. gfdper head per annum, an increase on the cost of previous years. The increase was due mainly to the higher prices of provisions, and to the fact that fhe institution has had to take in old-age pensioners, in most instances in a deplorable and dying condition, so that they must be placed in a hospital, where the expense of maintaining I them is more than would have to be spent were they ordinary inmates. The following statement is made :An impression exists that the asylum gains by receiving old-age pensioners; this is a mistake. The fact is the institution does not benefit one penny from their pensions; but, on the other hand, is put to a great expense, not only for maintenance, nursing, and medical attention, but with burial expenses, which is no small item. This institution is almost daily relieving the Melbourne, Alfred, St. Vincent, and other hospitals of cases, so that they can make room for more serious and urgent cases. These cases can obtain all the medical attention and nursing necessary in the asylum that their condition requires. These institutions publish to the people of Victoria the statement that they are in old-age pensioners. I think that in the interests of these sufferers, the amount of the pensions should at least be given td^the institutions so that we may secure for them as much relief as possible. The Minister does not appear to be very much interested in this subject, but I hope that he will see that these public institutions receive the pensions payable to inmates if they do not already obtain some allowance in regard to them. As to the sugar industry, I am very anxious, in the interests of the small growers in my electorate, that the matter to which I have referred shall be settled as quickly as possible. lating to the Royal Commission on insurance, and I wish to ask whether the Government propose to take any action on the report presented by the Royal Commission appointed by the Deakin Government to inquire into the whole question of mission dealt with fire ancl life assurance, and also, I believe, with social insurance. are dealing now with an Insurance Bill. whether the Bill will cover the whole matter of general insurance? will explain the principles of the Bill when he is introducing it. gent action, and it seemed to us when we were in office that we should have a complete inquiry before legislation dealing with the subject was introduced.

It seems to me to be an anomaly that whereas the cost of administering ""the in-valid and old-age pensions system is only .£43,875, the cost of administering the Land Tax Act is nearly twice as much. We were told when the Land Tax Bill was ibefore us that one of the advantages of -such a tax was that it cost very little to collect, and yet, notwithstanding that the returns have to be sent in by land-owners themselves, we are asked this year to vote £80,000 in respect of land tax administration. throughout the Commonwealth regarding the way in which the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is being administered, and the discontent is most marked in relation to the administration of the invalid pensions branch. I have brought several cases of great hardship before the authorities. Sitting suspended from z to 2.30 p.m. [2.30] I think that before we proceed with business we should have a Minister present. I , therefore, call attention to the want of a quorum [Quorum formed]. I regret the absence of the Treasurer, because there are in these Estimates, relating to his Department, two or three items to which I desire to call attention. In the first place there is an item of £800 in respect of note printing. I wish to know when these notes are likely to be put into -circulation, and how many are to be printed. I have seen some of the samples, and the printing, design and general appearance, are certainly excellent. of the designs are most artistic, and will not be a discredit to the Commonwealtli as samples of our first venture into the realms of note printing. In view of the fact that the printing and issue will mark an historical epoch in the progress of the Commonwealth, as well as a distinct departure from the established practice in Australia, I should like the Treasurer to Life assurance companies, which, consider a suggestion that a complete set of cancelled notes be given to each member of the Parliament. They would form an interesting and historical souvenir, and if properly cancelled there could be no In this danger of their getting into circulation. I suggest that the first in notes printed should be cancelled and distributed as sou. venirs amongst members of the Parliament. I am not quite certain, but I think that the notes have been designed and printed in Australia. ing from the Old Country. 0 understand, however, that a plant is being obtained, and that experts are being engaged to do the work in Australia. Although the samples so far available have been executed in the Old Country, the notes to be issued to the public will be printed in Australia. If that be so, then honourable members would certainly appreciate the adoption of the suggestion I Very great dissatisfaction exists have made. There is precedent for it, inasmuch as in connection with the first Commonwealth stamp issue, sets of cancelled stamps were issued to honourable members, whilst on the introduction of the Commonwealth silver coinage the first in shillings struck were distributed amongst members. 1 hope that the Minister temporarily in charge of these Estimates will convey my suggestion to the Treasurer, and that he will endorse it. As to the item "" Additional Clerical and General Division Officers, £ 7 0 0 , "" I wish to know whether these officers are to be employed temporarily or permanently. The growing practice of appointing large staffs of temporary assistants in the Clerical and General Divisions' of the Service is not a good one. Experience has shown it to be a great mistake. Just at a time when labour of the kind becomes most valuable to the Commonwealth is the very time it has to be dispensed with.

The trouble in dispensing with the services of temporary employees in this way is that permanent officers have to be detached from their ordinary duties, and devote much time to instructing the newcomers, and this gives rise to general disorganization. As a matter of fact, the temporary employees, instead of being of assistance in the various Departments, are, for a considerable time, an absolute hindrance. I should like to know whether the additional officers provided for are to be permanent or temporary. As to lending and borrowing, it would be interesting to know whether it is intended by the Government, in their newly-established policies, to borrow the deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank in order to meet some of the commitments for which it is now desired to raise money. The honourable member for Darling Downs endeavoured to elicit some information, but the Treasurer was very reticent and unwilling to impart any. If the Treasurer's purpose is to borrow the people's savings for some of the projects on account of which the Loan Bill was recently passed, it may prove a further cause of stringency in the local money market. Indeed, I am surprised that the Government have launched out with a borrowing policy, because I see that no later than the last general election a great parade was made of the fact that the Labour policy was a non-borrowing one. cannot show that. circular issued by Mr Jelley, a defeated Labour candidate, the public were asked to "" compare the non-borrowing policy "" of the Labour party with the borrowing started by the Liberal party, and were asked to vote for Jelley in order to keep the Commonwealth "" free of debt."" As a matter of fact, however, under a Labour Government we are getting more and more into debt every day. It was not until the present Treasurer took charge of the finances that the Commonwealth was involved in any borrowing. The Liberal Government carried out all public works by means of the ordinary revenue, and when they made a proposal to borrow, even for naval purposes, there was an outcry by honourable members opposite. the Labour party, which is in favour of the ""restriction"" of borrowing. I have read is not in the programme, but is the tale that was told to the people. party told the people to vote for Jelley and his policy. of the most prominent members of the Labour party supported Mr Jelley on the public platform, and not one of them contradicted Mr Jelley's version of what was the policy of the party. Mr Jelley does not merely talk of a non-borrowing policy on the platform, but declares for it in a printed leaflet, which cannot be gainsaid. So far as the Liberal party in this House is concerned, it never did start a borrowing, policy. however, we find the Treasurer accumulating all sorts of Trust Funds, and diverting them from the purposes for which they were voted to other purposes not yet authorized by Parliament. This candidate, Mr Jelley, as I say, declared that the policy of the Labour party was a non-borrowing policy, and that only the wicked Liberal party was responsible for such a policy, although it had never borrowed a single penny. It is just as well that the public should know the truth about these matters-thes e deliberate attempts to mislead the public by throwing dust in their eyes, and misrepresenting the other side. If it were not for this printed publication of Mr Jelley honourable members opposite would have denied that anything of the kind was said. tleman. of the honourable member's leaders' know him, however, and sat with him on the same platform. The leaflet is one continual denunciation of the Liberal party for engaging in a policy of borrowing. It is pointed out in the leaflet that before the advent of the Labour party the States under Liberal Administrations had borrowed £251,773,000, and this was condemned as unsound finance.

One of their first acts, it will be seen, was to throw overboard the whole of their non-borrowing policy, and all their professions on the public platform. Many honourable members opposite secured their seats by appealing to the credulity and lack of knowledge of the people who returned them, and how woefully they have been deceived. We have the Treasurer not only borrowing, but starting as a money lender, and I expect before the close of the session to see three golden balls hanging in the portico of Parliament House with the legend, "" Money lent on good security."" I do not think it is proper for a Government to do work of this kind, which should be left to private enterprise. the Labour Government who are playing tlie part of "" Ikey Mo,"" and what I am concerned about is the depletion of the local gold reserves and the savings of the people, mostly of the wage-earning classes. There is a risk of increased financial tightness if this system, inaugurated by the present Government, is continued. Already, through local borrowing, in New South Wales and elsewhere, the money market has tightened wonderfully, and private investors find it most difficult to obtain advances in order to carry out their enterprises. The Government would have been well advised if they had raised their loans, as previously, from British investors, but British investors, with the present outlook, as a result of Labour administration, are very loth to find the money. New .South Wales had to go to a foreign money-lender, and enjoy the peculiar distinction of being the first Government in Australia to raise a loan in a foreign market. I am certain we are on the wrong track in the management of our Trust Funds and loans from Trust Funds, and we shall presently find ourselves tied in a knot. In the event of a crash we shall find the trouble accentuated, and not relieved, by what is happening now. 1 do not desire to see the Commonwealth of Australia in such a position, but we are fast approaching a crisis, if we follow the lines laid down by the State and Commonwealth Labour. Governments. I see that the Treasurer's The Government started their Advances has been increased from £400,000 last year to £500,000 foi this year. It will be noted that of the £400,000 voted last year none was expended, and I should like some explanation why, under the circumstances, this amount has been increased to enable the Treasurer, according to a note on the Estimates, to make advances to public officers, and to meet expenditure, the particulars of which will afterwards be included in a parliamentary appropriation. We have no information in this connection, and apparently are not going to get any until after the money is spent, or we are pledged to spend it. Apparently it is not supposed to be the function of the Government to take any notice of Opposition criticism, or to afford any information, although we have to represent our constituents even to a greater extent than have honourable members opposite. I understand that all these matters are arranged in another place upstairs, and that Parliament is only a secondary consideration; but from the point of view of courtesy alone, members of the Opposition are entitled to be furnished with information regarding the spending of the money they are called upon to vote. Only the most casual references are made by the Treasurer to the expenditure of his Department, although it amounts to hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Estimates, altogether, represent millions. The same policy of reticence is adopted in regard to all the Departments, and information has to be dragged out piecemeal in a series of questions which ought not to be necessary. We ought to be given full information as to the financial position of the Treasurer's Department-the commitments, the requirements for the current year-and , As a matter of fact, if necessary, there should be memoranda supplying the details. As it is, we have to dig and delve as best we may in order to search out the various items, which in many cases are covered up in such a way as to elude our vigilance. I should like information on some other points, but at present I will leave the matter in the hope that it will be supplied by the Treasurer or by some other Minister.

The Treasurer is not empowered to expend money in excess of the appropriations for particular items, but, it being impossible to foresee a year's transactions, it is necessary to provide a sum out of which to meet emergencies. vances with regard to necessary work, and £500,000, the sum now provided for the purpose, is less proportionately than the £200,000 that was given to Sir George Turner. £400.000 voted last year all spent? never been suggested, during my term of office, that any of this expenditure has had a political purpose, and I should be no party to such expenditure. The Constitution does not permit us to obtain money other than by an appropriation of this kind, and the appropriations of Parliament are not exceeded even when the total Advance is spent. Advance is never exceeded. that honourable members should be given specimen copies of the new note requires consideration. Banks, in this and other countries, have cancelled notes by perforating them, but some of these notes have afterwards been successfully circulated, being accepted by the cleverest tellers, because the perforations have been so cleverly filled up.

Forms have been drawn up to simplify the whole procedure. The officers of the Treasury dealing with the maternity allowance are not confined to that branch of work.

We are making them a small allowance for the work done. The expenditure on the administration of this fund will represent so low a percentage on the actual amount distributed that it is hardly worth mentioning. The desire is to make the payment as expeditious as possible. Where the papers sent in are in order, a money order will be sent out immediately upon their receipt. As the Act came into operation before the whole of the machinery was in readiness, there may be at first some strained cases, but later on the whole procedure will be simplicity itself. There is in this division an item relating to coinage, and in connection with it I should like to refer to a paragraph published in the newspapers some little time ago to the effect that the Commonwealth Government intended to introduce a nickel coin. If any nickel coins be introduced, I trust that the Treasurer will see that they have a hole punched through them. In some countries which I recently visited the nickel coins in use were larger than the silver coinage, although, of course, of less value, and the fact that a hole was punched through them enabled one to distinguish between the two without any difficulty whatever. One of the first statements I read in -the press on reaching the United States of America was that a proposition had been made to adopt the principle followed in Belgium and elsewhere, where a round hole is punched in a nickel coin, so that even if such a coin is of the same size as a silver coin carried in one's pocket, one can distinguish between the two by the touch. It is recognised throughout the world that nickel coins should have a hole in the centre in order that they may be readily distinguished from others. Usually teenths of an inch, and I am told that the Belgian practice is to be adopted in the United States. ister and Treasurer) [3.28] -In the early days of Commonwealth coinage I favoured the use of nickel coins of low denomination, and, in reply to the honourable member for Capricornia, who has since impressed upon the Government the desirableness of their The honourable member adoption, I have said that we favour their use. I do not agree with the honourable member for Fremantle, however, that nickel coins should have a hole punched through them. In Italy, and, I think, in India, the nickel coins in use have a carved flowing edge, beautiful in design, which sufficiently distinguishes them from the silver coinage, with a plain or a milled edge. I think that we should have a more artistic looking nickel coin, if , instead of punching a hole through it, we made it with a round flowing edge. Nickel coins are particularly necessary in hot countries, where people do not wish to carry heavy coppers in light dress. think the Treasurer would acknowledge, if he only saw them, that nickel cobs with! holes in them are very artistic.",35,Estimates

The honourable member for Flinders knows that. I will say this for the Public Service Commissioner: that, whatever other complaints may be made regarding him, he is certainly a diligent student of the work that is being performed by the Commonwealth Departments; and no Department gets an additional officer, and no officer gets an increase in his salary, unless the Public Service Commissioner has examined the case for himself, and ascertained whether what is asked for is warranted or' not. for that reason that I said that the honourable member's attack was virtually an attack on the administration of the Public Service Commissioner. member speaks of the proportionate increases as compared with the year 1909-10.

There is a great deal of employ to the last penny our money in correspondence attached to the note issue, in addition to the work actually done by the clerks in connection with the notes themselves. There are communications with banks regarding the return of notes, and various other matters connected with the issue, and there are communications with banks on questions of currency.

We know that an ordinary man, as years go on, and he becomes more experienced, deals more rapidly with his work and makes fewer blunders, and hence the increased expenditure on the same number of men is justified as an advantage. From my experience of life I would rather have few men who can do the work of a! great many men than a great many men to do the work of few * men, although the same expenditure might be involved, because then there are fewer mistakes, and the work is better done.

As to the matter of responsibility, I can only say for myself, and I think I may speak for my colleagues, that if I thought it necessary to come into conflict with the Commissioner, either as do so, and then let Parliament know the facts. that we ought to have a Committee of Accounts. is shifting ground. An attack has been made by tlie honourable member for Flinders, and has not been sustained; and that honourable member is quite capable of makhonorable member for Parramatta is less frank than is the honourable member for Flinders. Immediately the honourable member for Flinder5 saw that some item had escaped his eye, he admitted the fact have no desire to be responsible for financial statements or financial proposals that cannot bear the keenest scrutiny, and I hope that Parliament will never depart from the course of exercising its full right of criticism. AlthoughI am not in a position to give all the details at the present moment, I think that there are now the minimum number of officers with whom the work of the Treasury can be carried on, in view of the new services. suggest to the Prime Minister that the note issue, as currency, ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth Bank, and that it would be advisable, I think, to have a report from the Governor of the Bank on the point. If this suggestion were acted upon the size of the issue would be governed solely by the public demand for paper money, as it was before, except that through its proper officials, govern the issue. My objection to the Government note issue is solely due to the fact that, under fhe present system, there is a great temptation to any Minister to issue more notes than is necessary, in order to finance various Government enterprises. Every sovereign raised by the issue is a liability which will have to be met sooner or later, and most",41,Estimates

386,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [4.7],"!probably at a time when the country is the least able to meet it. If , on the other hand, my suggestion were adopted, the Bank would, for its own protection, as well as for the protection of the Commonwealth-for the Bank is not interested in what I might call party finance-draw in its horns on approaching financial trouble, and so automatically regulate the issue of paper currency. At any rate, it would be worthwhile the Treasurer asking his highest financial expert to express his opinion on the matter. I have no knowledge of what the Governor's views are, but I am satisfied that if the matter is referred to him, he cannot fail to advise the Treasurer more or less on the lines of my suggestion. We must remember that most of any country's financial difficulties are because of honourable gentleman. the party system. A party in power, with a tenure of three years, will try to carry -out public works, and finance them in such a way as to increase their popularity in the country, and lead to their return for another period of office. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, on the other hand, is responsible solely for the solvency of his institution, and the security of credit generally, with which it is intimately bound up. The result will be that if we put this matter under fere with currency, you interfere with him, we shall still have Commonwealth notes, but they will be paper currency, and will not be the means primarily of raising money from the public of Australia for the pressing necessities of a particular party. I do urge this upon the Prime Minister. has discussed it before. It will not be done this session. the right honourable gentleman should not ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for a report on this question. I think that it would be very educative to honourable members, and could not fail to assist them. That is all that I am asking for now. Governor of the Commonwealth Bank at all. finance, and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, I take it, is the best financier we have in the service qf the Commonwealth. In fact, I think that he is the -only first rank financier in the service of the Commonwealth at present. We have excellent officials, but they have not been in close touch with general finance in the same way as he has been. I am only asking that his opinion should be ascertained. Surely the Government are not going to shut down on expert opinion in dealing with this question? Surely they are not afraid of the verdict of their highest officer? If they are, of course the public will understand the refusal of my very simple and modest request. I do hope to get a simple, affirmative answer from the Prime Minister before I resume my seat. down. shall have no further opportunity to speak on this matter-; for I spoke for a minute last night when the Estimates were introduced contrary to the wish of the right interjecting, and accused of doing so. ask this officer for a report? Air. FISHER -The honourable member says it is a question of currency. That has nothing to do with banking directly. terested in currency. It is the basis of exchange, and a bank's prime operations are dealings with exchange. If you interbills. If you disturb currency, you disturb bill currency, and cheque currengy, which is the biggest currency in the financial world to-day. Exchange is the biggest function of any bank,. State or private, at the present time. The big profits of a bank are not made, when all is said and done, by advancing money, and. receiving interest. rency. lar currency. The currency of the world to-day lies in bills and cheques, and the basis of the credit of these bills and cheques is the ordinary medium of exchange. with. only currency that has an intrinsic value throughout the world is gold. It is, consequently, obviously a matter of vital importance to the Commonwealth Bank that it should be able to be sure of the solvency and the security of a big paper issue of money in the Commonwealth.
