Mr Owen has not raised the subsion in the existing law for the deduction of the amount paid as calls to mining companies, oil companies, and afforestation companies, the act should make provision for a rebate, calculated at one-third of the rate of income tax imposed for the financial year on the amount of calls paid. The recommendation was made unanimously by the members of the committee, and the Government proposes to bring forward during the committee stage of the bill the necessary amendment to implement it . The Government has decided that the committee shall continue to function for the purpose of examining, in the new year, the position in regard to the taxation of dividends received from ex-Australian mining companies.

If they are locked in will the honourable gentleman see that, the employers are suitably dealt with, and if they are on strike will he see that they are provided with suitable recreation while underground, including wireless sets of sufficient power to receive the results of race meetings, the advices of reliable 3tfirting-price bookmakers honourable member make available to the men a copy of the statement he made in the House last week relating to his success in dealing with strikes? member is a little behind the times and a little out of date. I am pleased to announce that the men are no longer underground. As the result of negotiations with the representatives of the men they decided to leave the mine at 11.30 a.m. to-day. There is now no stoppage of production on the coal-fields. In the event of a similar occurrence and of the men being in need of entertainment, I think the best we could do for them would be to give them amplifying equipment so that they could listen to the squabbles in. the United Australia party. Later: Minister for Labour and National Service disclose to the House the terms upon which the coal strike was settled this morning? has not been settled. I said that the stay-in strike had been ended, and.that the men had resumed work. The matters in dispute will be dealt with by Mr D.

WAR CONTRACTS. General) -by leave-On the 6th November the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) asked a question concerning the practices being indulged in in connection with claims for royalties. I then informed him that this matter was giving me some concern, and that I would have an investigation made and inform the House of the result. The investigation is by no moans complete, but I think it is necessary to make an. interim statement.

37,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Attorney.rights.. ,He drew attention to the necessity for seeking legal advice before final arrangements were made for the acquisition or use of patent rights. Later, the Solicitor-General forwarded another memorandum to government departments in '.vhich the nature and extent of patent rights and the incidence thereof on our war activities were explained. Notwithstanding these memoranda, I am not satisfied -.that an adequate appreciation of the position has percolated to those who,.in the first instance, deal with war contracts. In war-time the danger of extravagant payments is so great that the operation of our patent system should be watched carefully with a view to guarding against the payment by a heavily taxed nation of unjustifiable royalty claims. This problem' -has*' received considerable attention in other countries, and the Assistant Attorney-Generali n the United States of America, in dealing with this subject, has seen fit to condemn the "" shrewdly legalistic methods"" which have been adopted by some patent-holding organizations. it is desirable that it should be known to all concerned that no person has any exclusive righ t to make or use any invention in the Commonwealth unless he is the owner of valid letters patent in force in the Commonwealth, or holds a licence from the patentee so to do. ascertained that in some cases which have come under notice letters patent granted in England are represented to have the f u l l force of the law in the Commonwealth. Such representations are not true and not justified. Letters patent do not necessarily remain in force for the f u l l term of sixteen years, because the non-payment of the statutory renewal fees results in the termination of the monopoly. Cases have occurred where claims to royalty have been made against the Commonwealth in respect of Commonwealth letters patent, and it has been found on investigation that such letters patent have long since terminated. If , for any reason whatever, a patent ceases to exist in the Commonwealth respect of any particular invention, invention becomes, in law, the property of the whole community, and no person Dr. Evatt. can thereafter obtain, any exclusive right therein. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that before any arrangement is made for the payment of royalties in respect of any alleged invention in the Commonwealth, either by government departments or their contractors, the first and foremost inquiry should be directed to the question: Is that patent in for w in the Commonwealth? . From a perusal of some of the fileswhich have been brought to my notice it appears that some government departments have not realized the necessity for obtaining this vital' information at the outset from the persons claiming th^ payment of patent royalties. I now refer to an associated matter which also requires a most critical approach by officers concerned in negotiating war contracts. It ' is obvious that patentees, both here and abroad, may be able to render some technical assistance in the initia l stages of the production of their inventions in the Commonwealth. This technical service which such patentees are capable of rendering may take the form of working drawings, information concerned in the technique necessary in the practising of the inventions, and even the assistance of skilled operatives. This technical assistance or service cannot, however, be placed in the same category as patent rights. There appears 1 have to be a common misapprehension that it may properly be treated as an associated factor in determining the moneys payable by the Commonwealth in respect of actual or alleged patent rights. The subject of inventions, designs, drawings or processes which are not patented was elaborately dealt with by the Royal Commission on Awards to In ventors, appointed under Royal Warrant, after the 1914-18 war. That commission, in its first report, made it clear that any remuneration paid for this class of assistance was not based on any statutory right. Cases, however, have recently beroi brought to my notice where attempts have been made to associate such services with the monopoly rights forming the basis of negotiations. As .a result, the patent in royalty claims which are made seem to lx? that most, unjustifiably inflated. I now refer to several cases which nay inquiries have disclosed. In one case claims were made against the Commonwealth for royalty payments in relation to machine-gun carriers being manufactured in the Commonwealth. The matter finally reached my department, as a result of which the claimant corporation was called upon to furnish the numbers of the letters patent in the Commonwealth upon which its claim had been based. It, was not until negotiations had extended for nearly eighteen months that the corporation had to admit that it possessed no relevant patents in force in the Commonwealth. As a result, the department concerned was saved from having to incur expenditure without legal obligation. In another case involving munitions it is patented in the Commonwealth. equipment, it was found on investigation This is a. complete departure from the that, certain payments had been made to normal position in time of peace, and the British patentees i u respect of there is no reason whatever why any Goarrangements for obtaining what, was vernment department, should hold up supeuphimistically called a ""manufacturing plies for war purposes because of the licence"", before any investigation had existence of any' patent monopoly. Under been conducted as to the nature and exthe law the Commonwealth may go tent of any patent monopoly in force in straight ahead and use the invention, and the Commonwealth. In another case an overseas patentee quently settled by agreement or by the had made a claim on a contractor who Attorney-General. From my inquiries it had indemnified the against any claim for patent royalties. a very considerable extent been disAlthough the responsibility for the payregarded. ment in the first, instance devolved upon the contractor, the department concerned instituted precautionary inquiries from to be made up to the present is of n premy department. It was ascertained that a liminary nature, and I am giving close substantial claim had been made by an consideration ro the present legal and American'corporation for a royalty payadministrative position in order to prement, but the Commissioner of Patents vent tlie Common wen I th from being advised that the patent had long since burdened with expenditure in relation ceased to exist in the Commonwealth, and to real or alleged monopoly right?, was the free property of the community. and, what is equally important, extravaThe claim was defeated at the last, gant legal claims which are often moment, and on the advice of the put forward in connection therewith for Attorney-General's Department the cheque was stopped. Even though a patent for an invention These phrase,? are frequently employed may be in force in the Commonwealth, to cloud the fact that, patentroyalties are it is'essential that the scope and meaning not payable at all. of the monopoly shall be most carefully considered whenever it is claimed to relate to any equipment or goods manuof the Auditor-General and his officers to factured by or supplied to Government assist me in seeingdepartments.'' In a recent case a claim for £4,500 was made in respect of a. device supplied by a contractor to one department. It was found on investigation that the device supplied to the department, did not encroach upon the patentee's monopoly. Honourable members will naturally be anxious to learn of the steps which are now being taken in connection with this matter to remedy any shortcomings. In the early stages of the present war regulation 57A of the National Security (General) Regulations was promulgated. This followed closely on the lines of permanent British legislation for controlling the use by Government departments of patented inventions. Under regulation 57A Commonwealth Government departments and their contractors are entitled to use any invention, despite the fact that the terms for such use may be subseCommonwealth appears to me that this regulation has to The investigation which I have caused so-called "" manufacturing r i g h t s "" and "" proprietary processes"" or the like. I am invoking the valuable assistance (1) that no payments for royalties or rights akin thereto are made by the Commonwealth unlaws they are f u l l y justified by the law and the facts; and (2) that so far as possible payments which have been made without sound legal foundation are disgorged. AfterI have had an opportunity of making a more complete investigation of this matter, I shall be in a position to throw further light thereon for the information of the House. -EXCESS PLANTING-STABILIZATIO NPLAN , Commerce) -by leave-Representation s have been made concerning the position of a number of wheat-growers who have planted excess areas and are unable to secure sufficient labour to prevent this excess from maturing to grain. As these growers had broken the'regulations, they were instructed to cut the excess areas for hay or to prevent it from' maturing, but .now we are faced with the fact that rural labour is simply not available to enable this to be done. In the circumstances provision is being made for wheat growers -to harvest the excess wheat. They may apply to the chairman of the local committee of review for their district. The .chairman will make a recommendation to the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board and the wheat may then be harvested by the grower. It should be noted that this is intended to apply only to those who find it impossible to dispose of their surplus. growers who can deal with their surplus wheat must do so. Having made provision for dealing with this wheat, I make it clear that proCLAIM FOB RAIN INSURANCE-JURISDIC vision is also being made to protect the interests of wiheat-growers who have faithfully observed the regulations. They will not suffer because they have complied with the requirements. Although growers are permitted to strip excess areas they will not be allowed to gain as a result, or to injure the interests of their of London of the .claim of the Australian fellow growers. The excess wheat harvested will be delivered to the Australian Wheat Board, but the first advance paid to growers for wheat acquired will not be paid on the excess. The payment whicii will ultimately be made for it, is a matter which will bp determined later, and that payment will certainly riot be sufficient to show a profit to those who have evaded the regulations. Actually, of course, the growers concerned will have a proportion of their crop harvested from the area which they' were licensed to sow, and another portion of Ihe crop will come from the excess area sown. The two -will be treated proportionately-as if the whole of the land concerned 'had shown an -equal yield-and the first advance will be paid on the legitimate crop only. Members may 'be interested to know that reports from the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board show that only a small proportion of excess wheat and a small proportion of growers are concerned. While these include a few flagrant cases which will be dealt with appropriately at a later stage, the wheat growers of Australia .'generally have greatly faciliated tfhe operations 'of the board by the -way in which they lave 'cooperated with it. Action has had to 'be taken 'because labour shortage makes it -impossible to prevent, the grain concerned from maturing. This must wot be <taken as 'showing -a lenien t, view in cases of evasion of the regulations. As the great bulk -of the wheat-growers 'have co-operated in carrying out the wheat -tftabi'liza'tion plan, I intend to see that, their interests shall not be injured by ithe minority who tried to evade requirements. Regulations will be : Wheatmade to control this decision. TION OP SUPREME COURT or THE the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) drew my attention to an article in. the Canberra Times regarding the repudiation by a local agent of Lloyd's Capital Territory patriotic carnival, held nine months ago, for rain insurance, and asked me whether I would look into the matter of having Lloyd's -of London made amenable to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. As Di'omised, I have had inquiries made into the matter and find 'that the",14,Royalties Ok Patents
38,Mr Scully (Gwydirminister For,,17,Australian Capital Territory
39,Dr. Evatt,"^On the 14th November,carnival committee took out an insurance policy with Harvey Trinder (New Limited, Lloyd's insurance brokers, against 10 points of rain falling at the Government Meteorological Bureau on the day of the carnival. There are two meteorological recording stations at Canberra, one at Duntroon, where 12 points of rain were registered, and the other at the Forestry School where only 5 points were registered. The dispute between the parties arose as to' which of these recording stations, was the Government Meteorological. Bureau. After some discussions had proceeded between the legal advisers of the parties, the solicitors' for the carnival committee intimated to the insurance company's solicitors that they had been instructed to issue a writ out of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and they asked who might be regarded as the local defendant appointed by Lloyd's for the purposes of the matter. The solicitors for the insurance company replied that their authority to accept service was limited to process issued out of a New South Wales court,, and did not include process issued out of the SupremeCourt of the Australian Capital Territory. They accordingly advised' the solicitors for the carnival committee that the defendant's address was care of Lloyd's, London. This reply appears to indicatea disinclination on the part of the overseas company concerned to facilitate thedetermination of the question at. issue, by the Supreme Court of the territory in which the carnival had been held. Nevertheless,, on the 19th November, five days after the honourable member brought the matter under my notice, the underwriter's, solicitors telephoned the solicitors to the carnival committee that the claim would be paid, and this advice has been subsequently confirmed in writing. It would appear that the publicity which has followed the asking of the question by the honourable member, and' the publicity in the Canberra Times, have contributed in no small degree to the settlement of this claim. I am informed that, up to the present time, the insurance moneys have not been received. the Prime Minister recently stated that university students in advanced courses of medicine and engineering should continue their courses rather than enlist, is he yet in a position to advise older boys about to leave school whether they should enlist at once or commence university courses, such as medicine and engineering, which may be useful for war purposes ( report in respect of man-power generally before I make any further recommendationon the subject of what university students shoulddo. for Supply and Development yet able to state what progress has been made in making arrangements for the development of the oil-field at Lakes Entrance?

WAR-TIME (COMPANY) TAX In committee: Consideration resumed from the 21st November, 1941 (vide page 751). Clause 4Section, twenty of the principal act is amended by omitting the word ""eight"" and inserting rn its stead the word "" four"". Section proposed to be amended20. Subject to this act the statutory percentage shall be eight per centum. Leader of the Opposition) [3.41]. -On Friday last, an amendment to fix the rate of profit at 6 per cent, instead of 4 per cent, was defeated. I now move That the word "" four"" he omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""five"". I believe that the Government has done The arguments which I advanced in favour of fixing the rate at 6 per cent, apply with equal force to the present amendment. The Government, having regard to the method which it has chosen to finance the war,, should do everything possible to preserve the stability, and, indeed, to promote the expansion, of the public companies of Australia. The Government is committed to raise £137,000,000 between now and the 30th June next in order to bridge the gap between estimated expenditure and estimated revenue, and it proposes to do this by voluntary loans from the public, and by contributions from the banks. addition to this amount of £137,000,000, the Government must find a minimum of £20j.000,000' for State and semi-governmental activities. I was severely attacked in my capacity as Treasurer when, at the last meeting of the Loan Council, I stated that the amount of money available to the States would have to be limited to £20,000,000, with the understanding that the matter would be reviewed at the end of this year. I am now informed that no meeting of the Loan Council is to be held until March of next year.. In the circumstances, I remind the State Premiers, and. particularly the Premier of New South Wales, that this Government has fixed the amount for distribution among the States at exactly the same figure as I proposed, but it does not intend to review the' matter until March next.. Thus,, the Government is committed to raise £157,000,000 before the end of next June. So far, it has raised only £30,000,000,. this being the amount of new money raised during the recent £100,000,000 loan campaign. A further amount of £127,000^000 must be raised before the end of the financial year by the voluntary system. The unjust burden of taxation which is being imposed upon public companies will make the Government's task increasingly difficult. Governments' have always looked to companies, with sound financial reserves to contribute to public loans. If this Government persists in taking, this extra £4,500,000 in taxation from the. companies, it must necessarily eat into the reservoir from which loan funds are ordinarily drawn. a very unwise thing in taxing the companies in this. way. Members of the Government say that they are merely applying their policy of taxing the big; companies ,, but I remind them that the so1 called big companies constitute the basis of Australia's prosperity. Moreover, these same companies have thousands of individual shareholders. They are, in effect, trustees for the investments of thousands of citizens who are content to put their money into such enterprises for a small return,, because they know that it will be safe: We have heard much criticism of the Broken) H ill Proprietary In Company Limited and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited andi other large concerns.. We' would be in a far better position to-day if we bad more big aaid prosperous companies of that kind. Had it not been for the enterprise and foresight of the men who pioneered the BrokenH i ll Proprietary Company Limited, where would Australia's war effort be to-day?: Every Treasurer has known how governments",20,Social Services
67,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"have depended upon companies to contribute to public loans. Now the. Government asks the companies to be satisfied with a return on capital of 4 per cent -are consolidating for the purpo.se of postDespite the difficulties, disabilities and risks that private enterprise encounters in business, the bill imposes a severe tax upon profits exceeding 4 per cent. Yet a fortunate investor in Commonwealth loans receives a return of 3^ per cent., which enjoys 'special concessions regarding taxation, and is .guaranteed by the security of the Commonwealth. Who would persevere with the formation of companies, and submit to all the worries associated therewith, when this field of -investment is available? The Government's proposal to tax companies should be thoroughly .surveyed by a committee representing all parties in this chamber. The original bill, which I introduced last year, was examined, amended and unanimously approved by such a committee, and the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) could with advantage follow that example -analysis, .mean that revenue from this Even in Germany, tlie profits allowable to companies is 6 per cent. But the Commonwealth Government proposes to restrict them to 4 per cent. In my opinion, that as unduly harsh. Honourable members should not overlook the fact that the war-time company tax is not the only imposition that companies have to meet. They pay a flat rate of 3s. in the £1, whilst dividends distributed to shareholders are subject to increased income tax. Such harshness must defeat the purpose for -which the tax was imposed. Finally, persistence with this proposal will be inconsistent with the Government's broad financial policy of voluntary loans. I urge the Treasurer to accept the amendment. ' surer) [3.54] -The Leader of the -Opposition ( MT . Fadden) asserted that companies will not find it worthwhile to carry on if .the Government persists with what he termed ""this harsh taxation"". I remind the honourable gentleman that the bigger companies, such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and ithe Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited are in the position that, regardless of whether they make profits out of -the war, they will be among the first to leave the starting barrier in the postwar era. That is -one of the principal incentives which they have to carry on their operations. Unquestionably, they war activity, a position which they never hoped to gain in peace-time. Their operations have considerably expanded, and they have an opportunity to experiment .at the expense of the community. As a result of the exigencies of war, they have, also, been able to crush small competitors. I appreciate tthe contentions of the Leader of the Opposition regarding severe taxation. His amendment, if adopted, would relieve the Government of revenue Stalling £800,000 a year, but the flow of additional money from the companies into tlie hands of shareholders in the form -of dividends would increase receipts from iacoii'Fie itax and reduce the loss by £200,000. Consequently, acceptance of -the amendment would, in the final source would be reduced by £600,000. When replying to the general debate on the .budget, I intimated the Government's willingness to weigh any submissions for modifying proposals that might cause undue hardship. The Government believes that taxation should be imposed upon every person, .who has the ability to pay it. Appeals to sentiment do not influence me as Treasurer, because I think in terms of ability to pay. But despite the loss of revenue, the Government will accept the amendment in order to meet the criticism that the legislation is extraordinarily harsh. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. -Clause 5Section twenty-four of tbe principal act is amended by omitting from sub-section (0.) the words "" Twelve thousand five hundred .pounds "" (twice .occurring) and inserting in their stead the words "" Twenty-five thousand pounds "".

68,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Treaweek I urged tlie Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to give sympathetic consideration to the claims of companies which have sustained losses of capital. In my opinion, those losses should bo taken into account in the ascertainment of capital for the purpose of this legislation. A company with an original capital of £200,000, which has had to write off £100,000,. will be ""allowed-to make a profit of only 2ri per cent, on the actual subscribed capital before it becomes subject to the war-time company tax. An amendment which has been moved to the Income Tax Assessment R ill 1941 is intended to ensure, in the event of distribution by a liquidator and the application of income tax to the profits arising from the liquidation, that liability for income tax shall not arise until the capital actually subscribed by shareholders has been replaced. The same principle should be applied in this measure. Companies which have had to write off a considerable amount of their capital are entitled to consideration of this sort. Under the existing practice, companies which consider that they have been treated harshly may appeal to the Board of Referees. The adoption of my proposal will obviate, to a large degree, the necessity for that. surer) [4.0] -The honourable member raised this matter last week. Quite a number of anomalies, particularly in relation to the different forms of company tax, has been mentioned to me. It is impossible for me to give lengthy and deliberate consideration to the many suggestions that have been made, but they will be referred to the special committee of members which has already investigated the proposal that calls paid to mining companies shall be allowed as a deduction. I announced this afternoon that this committee will continue to function for the purpose of considering anomalies in regard to company taxation, and such other tax matters as may be regarded as unduly harsh or unfair in operation. I therefore ask the honourable member, and other honourable members who have in mind anomalies to which attention might bo drawn, to withhold comment pending the examination which I promise will be made. assisting the Treasurer) [4.1] 1 move That the word ""twenty-five"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" twenty "". As honourable members are aware, a company is liable to pay war-time company tax on the amount by which the taxable, profit exceeds a certain percentage of the capita.] employed. The law at present provides that, where the capital of the company is less than £12,500, that amount shall be deemed to lie the capital employed. The effect of that provision is that such a company is assured of a standard of £1,000-that is, 8 per cent, of £12,50*"" -and is therefore liable for tax only on the amount by which the taxable profit exceeds £1,000. When the bill, as introduced, prescribed a statutory percentage of 4 per cent., it became necessary to increase the minimum capital to £25,000 so that a company could still receive the benefit of a minimum standard of £1,000. viz., 4 per cent, of £25,000. The statutory percentage having been made 5 per cent., it is necessary that the minimum capita.1 should be £20,000. of the Opposition) [4.3] -As the Minister has stated, this amendment is consequential on the alteration from 4 per cent, to » per cent.; in other words, with the rate at 4 per cent, the amount of capital necessary to earn £1,000 would be £25,000, whereas with the rate at 5 per cent, the amount w ill be only £20,000.

This amendment brings to mind a remark that I made with respect to the duration of this legislation when the motion for the second reading of the bill was before rhe House. I then reminded the Government that in Australia during the last war there was a.war-time profits act, which expressly provided that its operation should be limited to the duration of the war and six months thereafter. Similar legislation has been introduced during the present war in Great Britain and, I believe, in other British dominions and the United States of America. Into all of it has been imported the provision that it shall continue to operate for the term of the war and six months thereafter. time (Company) Tax Assessment B ill . Its purpose is to help to finance the Government. It should, therefore, conrain the provision which governed the duration of similar legislation during the last war. and which is incorporated ro-day in similar legislation in Great Britain and elsewhere. If that be not done, it will be the duty of the Government of the clay at the termination of the war to bring down legislation for the repeal of the act. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has said that repeal would not be difficult. I do not think that he anticipated that the present Government, would then be still in power. Whatever the Government, it will experience difficulty in repealing the legislation. If the matter were viewed in the light, of fairness, it would say, "" The special war conditions having passed, there is no longer need for this taxation; consequently, we now present a bill to repeal the act"". At, times different governments have been influenced, not so much by the requirements of f a i rness, as by the political considerationsffrjvolved. The case for the amendment, has been f u l lv established, and the way to make it is clear. T therefore hope that the Government will sen fit to make it, and ""thus relieve the party now in opposition, which w i ll then be in charge of the government, of the necessity to introduce a measure which will cause embarrassment to it because of the misunderstanding it will cause in the mind of the public. I listened attentively to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) when he spoke on the previous clause, aud I agree with him that companies are entitled to expect not. only to preserve their present stability but also to be in a position to advance their activities in the post-war period. It would, therefore, be wrong to continue to operate this legislation after the war if that, were not the intention of this Parliament or the country. As I explained during my second-reading speech, the last Government intended to impose the limitation I have suggested, but on account of 'thepressure of business immediately prior to the last Christmas recess that was not done. This measure is the Warsurer) [4.11] 1 regret that I cannot accede to th* request of the honourable member.

""Hie ratie of pension payable to a service' pensioner's wife will remain at 18s:, which is the amount payable to the wifeof a W»T pensioner.

Hitherto a reduction of the pension has operated' in cases where the accumulated property of husband and wifff exceeded £25» each. I congratulate the Government upon having liberalized the law in this respect. Clause6 provides that the amount of service pension payable to a pensioner in a public hiospital or institution shall be 7s. 9d. a week as in the case of an old-age pensioner.. In this respect the position of the service pensioner, in comparison with that of an invalid or old-age pensioner will be slightly disadvantaged; but the new provision will make uniform the conditions of the invalid and old1 age pensions legislation and that applying to service pensions. The passing of this bill will' be a further step towards the perfecting of our repatriation legislation. Australia has led the world in the repatriation of its soldiers who served' in the last war, and any criticism that I might utter in regard to our repatriation measures would be directed at the administration and not at the legislation. Since our first repatriation act was passed' in 1920, Australia has paid to pensioners and their dependants to the 30th June last, a sum of £290,000.000. This sum includes the following amounts:War pensions Service pensions Medical treatment . . 10,203,000 Employment and vocational training Soldiers children education scheme .. 2,232,000 War gratuity soldier settlement and war service homes The total number of pensioners was new Dominion within the British Com75,767 and dependants 149,724; total monwealth of Nations. It forestalled 225,491. Clause7 provides that the veterans of the South African War shall be admitted to the benefits of a service pension, and clause 8 extends medical treatment to those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. This is a provision for which I have pressed' for many years. I have joined with other' returned soldier members of this House and the Senate in: deputations to successive Ministers for Hepatization. I thank the former Minister, Senator Collett, for getting Cabinet approval for this long-delayed concession, and the present Minister for so promptly bringing down this bill' to give Parliamentary sanction to the previous Government's decision. The number likely to qualify for this pension is estimated to be less than300, and I have never been able to understand previous reluctance to give to the South African War veterans repatriation benefits. The majority are about 60 years of age, not old enough to qualify for the old-age pension, and they hardly comply with the conditions required for an invalid pension. Most of these men, who cannot earn a constant livelihood, because of advanced age or mental and physical incapacity due to the rigours of active service, have been living on charity and whatever help their more fortunate comrades can give them. The pension will enable them to obtain some of the necessaries of life in the eventide of their days, and will createthe right psychological effect on theyoung' men who are being asked to don the King's uniform in the present world struggle. We should establish in our national life sound principles that those who are prepared to volunteer for the defence of the Commonwealth shall never want, and that, if for any reason, they cannot work, a service pension shall be granted. On the one hand, as no promise was given, these .. 171,569,000 men realize there is no obligation upon .. 1,1)73,000 the nation to give (his assistance to them, and, therefore, they are the more grateful. .. 7,712,000 On the other hand, the Commonwealth does owe to them something for the part they played in that campaign 40 years agoa campaign which ended with .. 91,000,000 magnanimous peace terms, .and created a any attempt by Germany, through the rwo Boer Republics, to extend its innnence in the South as it had already done in West and East Africa. Despite the diehard Afrikander anti-British elements, the campaign brought peace between the two white races and peace between them, and the black population numbering millions. It strengthened the Empire's strategical position during the last war. Had the territories in South Africa not been unified under the British Crown, Germany could take advantage of racial discord, and that could, in ihe present war as in the Great War, cause Australia serious concern. Though the warfare was different from that of the Great War, it was most exacting. Our troop3 had to engage in ceaseless night marches month after month, in a trying climate, to exercise constant vigilance, night and day, and to show the courage and initiative necessary to beat their opponents in guerilla warfare of which the Boers were recognized as the world's greatest exponents. Many of our soldiers carried on though enteric germs weakened their constitutions. The men who endured such privations, and suffered so much will he assisted in their declining years by the has failed in its duty by leaving to the service pension. My criticism of our repatriation legislation is directed against the way in which it is now administered. The Administration is not so sympathetic as it was hitherto. Too many decisions are passed on to the Appeal Boards for settlement. Whereas the applicants for pensions are entitled by law to have doubt resolved in their favour, the trend to-day is to give the benefit of any doubt to the department. This trend should be reversed. In this war medical examination of our soldiers is most thorough. Examination of recruits by local doctors in the country precedes further medical and X-ray examination on arrival in camp, and some weeks later there is the necessity for a further examination by a medical board -This bill is limited to three purposes Tn some instances, if recruits have been in arid to them discussion will need to be camp for any length of time they receive a. final examination before sailing overseas. The soldier who successfully runs the gauntlet of these thorough tests should consider himself as being thoroughly fit. Yet the Repatriation Department is refusing pensions to soldiers who have returned from long overseas service on the ground that their disability is not due to war service. I could cite many examples, but, owing to the need to conserve time, I shall cite only two. I shall identify the first as "" CR . "" of East Ipswich. This ex-soldier had been in camp for several months and was amongst the earliest to leave for Malaya. While there he developed Singapore disease in the earAfter periods of treatment in hospital he was returned to Australia, where it was thought treatment would hasten recovery. His disability after some weeks in hospital has been cured, but he is deaf in the affected ear and because of that has been discharged from, the Australian Imperial Force. His application for a pension was refused because he was a surf life-saver and did have a minor trouble in one ear as the result of sand and salt-water trouble; he had advised the medical authorities of that. This decision is most ridiculous. At least this man is entitled to the benefit of a doubt, or he is entitled to a pension because his ear condition has been aggravated by war service. The department Appeal Board a decision that the Repatriation Commission should have made without any hesitation. Decisions of this character are hindering enlistments, and for that reason alone the Minister should review the attitude of his department to the members of the present Australian Imperial Force. The medical examinations which "" CR."" had to go through, together with his attendance at many special schools of instruction before he was promoted to the rank of sergeant, show that his ear was all right before he went to Singapore, and a pension and future medical treatment should be assured to him without question, delay or irritation. limited. to ratify certain decisions already made and in his second-reading speech the Minister for Repatriation referred to the necessity for that ratification.

83,Mr Francis,"The bill is intendedcertain other aspects of repatriation on which decision should be made. second ca.se is that of a soldier whom I shall identify as "" W. J.A. "" of Windsor. This young man was a first-rate athlete, excelling in every sport he took up. After enlistment he was in camp for some time; he was then vaccinated and inoculated, whereupon he immediately became crippled. His face swelled so much that he could not see out. of his eyes. A f t e r having been treated in hospital for some time, he was given leave in the hope that absence from the camp atmosphere would effect, a cure. That, hope was not realized and this young man has been discharged from the Australian Imperial Force still suffering his disability. He applied for a. pension mainly so that he should be assured of adequate and proper medical treatment. No t only was his claim for a pension refused; but also he is paying from his own pocket for the hospital treatment necessary to undo the effects of his compulsory treatment in camp. I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker, and I appreciate your tolerance. I congratulate the Minister on the promptitude with which he has introduced this bill, and I am confident, that he will rectify anomalies which I have mentioned. dorse the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis). The main purpose of this bill is to bring service pensions into line with the recently increased invalid and old-n.ge pensions, but it contains other amending proposals. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider certain suggestions for improving the lot of returned service men. We should lose no time in providing for the welfare of service men, numbers of whom are returning almost daily from the theatres of war without being accorded the treatment to which, they are entitled under the act. This bill extends a measure of justice to the default or w i l f ul act of the person veterans of the South African war. It is a travesty on justice and decency that we should only now, when it is too late for many of them to receive the benefits proposed, come to the assistance of men who fought for the country 40 years ago. The bill also provides for the payment of The the funeral expenses of returned soldiers by the Repatriation Department. This provision is to be retrospective to the 1st July, 1941, which recalls to mind the fact that the first returned soldier from the present war who died in Australia was not provided with a decent burial. This happened under the regime of the Menzies Government, when Australia was afforded the sorry spectacle of a soldier being buried in a pauper's grave. I am glad that the bill provides that such an occurrence shall not be repeated. My experiences in connection with claims made on behalf of returned soldiers or their dependants have been similar to those related by the honourable member for Moreton. I am disgusted w it h the treatment that has been meted out to them.' According to my experience, in nine cases out of ten, claims that should have been granted by the Repatriation Commission or by the Appeals Tribunal have been rejected. There is a saying, ""Better that ten guilty men go free, than that one innocent man be wrongly convicted "". But the motto of the Repatriation Department seems to be, ""Better that ten innocent persons go without their pensions, than that one person be granted a pension to which he is not entitled "". The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act provides that service pensions are payable only to members of the fighting services who had served in a theatre of war. But the conditions which applied when that provision was inserted in the act are entirely different from those which apply to-day. Men of the fighting forces undergo grave risks not only in theatres of war, but also during their period of training, when they are obliged to handle dangerous munitions and armaments. Incapacity, even death, has often been caused during training. It is now time for the act to be amended in order to provide for such cases. The law also provides that suicide, self-inflicted injuries, or injuries due to concerned, disqualify claims for compensation. The mentality of men who suffer the strain of modern warfare is often so impaired that they are driven to do things that they would not do ordinarily.

EYen.tua.lly he came to me in__such a state of nervous disorder that he threatened to take his own life. I am satisfied that, had he done so, his death -would have been the direct result of war service. Nevertheless, according to the act as it now stands, his dependants would not have been entitled to compensation. Claimants for war pensions are entitled, in certain circumstances, to representation before the Appeals Tribunal, but not bef ore the Repatriation Commission. However, such advocates must not be legal practitioners. This is very unfair to persons whose cases are being supported by members of Parliament who are also legal practitioners. frequently come to their parliamentary representatives in order bo secure assistance, and in these circumstances no honourable member should be debarred from helping them. The act further provides that, if a claimant be represented by an advocate, he must bear the expenses of such representation. The commission, however, employs a regular advocate who has been trained to handle these eases, and who knows all of the principles that are involved.. The Government should provide for the appointment of a public advocate, at the expense of the Repatriation Department, to act on behalf of returned soldiers and their dependants. Claims before the commission, and the Appeals Tribunal can riot be heard in open court at the present time. I do not know why this provision was included in the act, but 1 have no faith in tribunals which base their decisions on evidence taken in camera. I have seen too many abuses of justice under that system to have any confidence in it. Misleading evidence which is heard in public can be properly tested and disregarded, but when it is heard in camera it is frequently accepted without The best provision, in the interests of claimants, would be for cases to be heard in open court at the discretion of the claimants. Female offenders have the privilege, on their first appearance in a police court, to have their cases heard in camera. A similar privilege at least Mr Morgan. should be extended to applicants for war service pensions if, for certain reasons, they do not wish the proceedings to be made public, but it should be left entirely to their discretion. Another provision of the act lays down that no appeal shall be made against any decision of the Entitlement Appeals Tribunal. That should be amended. A t one time, applicants whose claims were rejected by the tribunal were allowed to appeal further to ministerial authority. Doubtless the present provision was inserted in order that Ministers should not be worried with frivolous claims, but claimants who have not received justice should have the right to appeal to the Minister. At the present time, when representations are made to the Minister on behalf of an Claimants applicant, the Minister replies invariably that he cannot take action. I am sure that if a provision, such as I suggest, were included in the act, we should not have the spectacle of the tribunal refusing time and time again to grant deserving claims on behalf of returned soldiers and their dependants. Like the honourable member for Moreton, I should like to quote a few instances to show that, in my experience, claimants do not receive the fair deal to which bhey are entitled. tain specific purposes, and the debate must have some relation to those purposes. It is competent, of course, to suggest further reforms and to make brief references to them, but the present is not a proper occasion for a full-dress discussion of the administration of the Repatriation Department.

The subject is not mentioned in the bill now before the House. the honourable member must not continue his remarks along that line.

Perhaps this House will agree to the appointment of a select committee to investigate the provisions of the act, with a view to liberalizing them and bringing them up to date and also overhauling the administrative machinery. I approve of this measure. The reforms which it will implement will cost the country very little. The few provisions which it contains relate to reforms that have been advocated by many honourable members for a long time past. Like the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), I am especially pleased with clause 7, which provides that the provisions of the act relating to service pensions shall be extended to persons who served in the South African war. That is something which returned soldier members of this Parliament have advocated for many years. The provision will affect only a few people, and the resultant cost will not be great. Obviously, the needs of the South African veterans are as great as those of men who served in the last war. I realize that certain difficulties caused a great deal of delay in the introduction of such a provision. One of these was that there were no recordstt> South African war or not. Fortunately, the authorities have found a means to overcome the trouble. I do not wish* ts> discuss the measure at length, but, in view of criticism, that has been expressed by some honourable members regarding the administration of the act, I wonder whether you, Mr Speaker, will allow me to give my views on this subject. I am not sure whether, under youar ruling, this would be permitted. I do not disagree with the ruling, but it would be only fair to the Repatriation Commis>sioner, and the Deputy Repatriation OommissionerSj if a little latitude were allowed in this respect. I know the Repatriation Commissioner very well, and I also know the Deputy Repatriation Commissioner in Tasmania. Their administration has been wonderfully good. They have done a better job than any other commission I have known in my parliamentary career. Many of the cases with which they have to deal are extraordinarily difficult. A soldier may apply for a pension 25 years after the termination of the war, and in most instances it is beyond the power of any medical man to know whether or not his disability is due to war service. In such cases the commission has gone to a great deal of trouble to obtain the evidence of the applicant's friends in order to find out whether he had suffered from a similar complaint before the war. My experience has been that members of the commission have been generous, efficient, and sensible in the way in which they have dealt with applications. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) suggested that some additional machinery should be provided to hear appeals against decisions of the Entitlement Tribunal. First there is the State tribunal which deals with every application from its area.

Most of .the genuine cases have been dealt with long ago, arid it is not surprising, there-'"" tore, that not many appeals are now allowed. The honourable member for Reid also made the suggestion for the appointment of an advocate at public expense to represent applicants. Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's League in each State has, in fact, appointed a man for that very purpose. claimant for a pension may plead his own case, or he may appoint another to plead for him, but if he does not feel qualified to conduct his case or cannot get a friend to do it for him, the league has a man present who will put his case before the tribunal. In all such instances the case is well put. is proposed in this bill to amend section +5AK of the principal act which relates to soldiers who are, in the opinion of the commission or a board, permanently unemployable. Those words may be taken to correspond to the words "" totally and permanently incapacitated "" in the Old age Pensions Act. We recently prescribed :i standard of incapacity in connection with that act, and I believe that the Repatriation Commission should at least have regard to that standard. There have been cases of men who were unemployable in the sense that no one could be expected to give them a job, and such persons are, 1 think, entitled to a pension, even though there might be some kind of work they could do if it were possible to get them such employment. I was disappointed with the provision in the Pensions Act, and I believe that the interpretation of the provision should be at least as generous as in the Workers Compensation Act, The principle accepted in interpretation of the words "" totally and permanently disabled "" in the New South Wales Workers Compensation Act is that a worker is regarded as being "" totally and permanently incapacitated if he by the in j u r y is rendered incapable of earning his livin g in the competition of the labour market, notwithstanding that he remains physically capable of doing some kind of work which he has not got and is not likely to get. gratulate the Government on having brought in this measure'."" It ""is only right that service pensions should be adjusted in the same way as invalid and old-age pensions have been adjusted. I agree with the provision which makes South African The Returned veterans eligible for repatriation benefits, but T regret that South African veterans who served with the Imperial forces, and A are now resident in Australia, have been omitted. I know some such men who are resident in my own electorate. They have been residents of Australia for more than 30 years, and have become, to all intents and purposes, Australian. Most of them are in somewhat straightened circumstances, but they will not be eligible to receive a pension. I realize that by bringing them under the provisions of the It act, we might be opening the way for similar claims from ex-members of the Imperial forces who served in the last war, and that_the granting of such claims might strain our resources, but this difficulty could be overcome by imposing a residential qualification of, say, 25 years, which would lining in the older men. We have a somewhat similar provision in regard to invalid and old-age pensions. I regard this bill as an interim measure pending a thorough investigation of repatriation legislation. It is clear that the time has come to replan the whole of our repatriation policy. Men who are discharged from the forces after having served overseas in this war are entitled to receive a pension for a period of three months. In the case of a. man with a wife and two children, the pension amounts to £4 2s. 6d. a week. I regard that as quite reasonable, though I have heard it argued that the rate should be raised to the level of the basic wage. I do not agree that it should be so high, because the effect would be to discourage men from seeking employment,' I believe, however, that the period during which the pension is payable might be extended from three months to six months. It is quite possible that, at a. later time, when employment is more difficult to obtain, a man might take more than three months to find a job.",30,Chairman Mb Pbowse Frost
96,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [ 5 . 5 ],,31,Chairman Mb Pbowse Frost
97,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [ 5 . 7 ],"I conI know that the department and the Minister have given careful consideration to the rate of pension paid to soldiers' widows, but it seems to me that something in the nature of an injustice is being perpetrated. Recently, a woman with two children lost her husband, who was killed in action in Tobruk. Before her husband's death she was receiving £4 10s. a week, l>nt now she receives, as a widow, only £2 19s. 6d. a week. She had lived up to her former income, but now, on the death of her husband, which in itself was naturally a great blow to her, she has suffered a reduction of income to just below £3 a week. The present rate of pension for widows, irrespective of allowances to children, corresponds very nearly to that laid down in 1920, and its buying value is practically the same as it was then. However, since then we have raised the soldiers' pay by a small, but, at any rate, appreciable amount, and in these times we are rather more thoughtful of the dependants of soldiers than we were, perhaps, in 1920. In the circumstances, there is a reasonable case for a small increase of widows' pensions. I do not say that it ought to be large, but an increase of a few shillings a week is warranted. I hope that, when repatriation matters are again under consideration, some attention will be given to vocational training. side the scope of the bill. It is proposed to amend certain sections of the act relating to the provision of medical treatment for men suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. I see no reason why persons suffering from other forms of tuberculosis should not enjoy similar benefits. I could never understand why sufferers from this particular dread disease sliould be accorded special benefits denied to other sufferers. I believe that persons suffering from asthma, bronchitis and the effects of gas should be placed on the same footing as those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Sir can be shown that their condition is due to war service. and not as a right, Some patients who suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis have recovered. The improvements that medical science has effected in the treatment of this disease in recent years have enabled a number of those who,.,in, the past, might have succumbed,to it , to.be restored to health. Although soldiers who were gassed in the last war may be affected in many ways in after life, the Repatriation Commission declares that their death or suffering is not necessarily due to war service. Soldiers who were gassed may develop complaints of the lungs or stomach; gassing may even lead to cancer. But persons who suffer indirectly from their war service and who cannot themselves prove, or whose relatives cannot prove, that the injuries or sufferings were due to war service, cannot secure, under the Repatriation Act, as they should be entitled to secure, benefits similar to those obtained by persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. In fact, a person suffering ' from pulmonary tuberculosis is not required to show that the disease was caused by war service. The very fact that he is suffering from that disease is, ipso facto, accepted as being directly due to war service. of the act indicates that it is. 'n provided for a person suffering from tuberculosis. A pension under this section shall not he grunted to a member of the forces unless the member, in the opinion of the comnnissiou or u board, is permanently unemployable and. in the case of a man, has served iu a theatre of war or, in the case of a woman, has served abroad or embarked for service abroad or is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. The act does not provide that such persons must be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of the outbreak of war. Furthermore, it does not state that they have to relate their suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis to war service. The mere fact that they losis when they apply for a pension is sufficient ground. ber is incorrect.",31,Chairman Mb Pbowse Frost

When ing from bronchitis, but. the authorities decided that that illness was not sufficiently serious to warrant his admission to hospital. He was also suffering from another complaint, but as that was not traceable to war service, hecould not be admitted to a repatriation hospital. The Repatriation Commission, with all the sympathy that it could expend upon this case, could not find for him accommodation in any public hospital,. Finally, I approached the chairman of the committee of an old men's home for the purpo?e of securing the admission of Mr sion to a repatriation hospital. I am Rooney to the institution. for a service pension. small pension because he was suffering from bronchitis, but. he had developed another ailment which, the authorities deof Australia and the Empire they perclared, was not due to war service. Consequently, he could not be admitted to a 1 repatriation hospital. The ailment from which he was suffering, and not the bronchitis, was that which was causing his illness. did he receive? ceiving the old-age pension. My contention is that this man, because he was receiving a service pension when he took ill, should have been admitted to a repatriation hospital. Under the existing act, he could not be admitted. In my opinion, every soldier who takes ill should be eligible for admission to a repatriation hospital and the obligation should not be cast upon the community to provide treatment for him in a public hospital. Eveni f the patient desires to enter a public hospital, as Mr Rooney did, he cannot always secure admission. Melbourne is poorly supplied with public hospitals compared with Brisbane and Sydney. The two daughters of Mr Rooney were employed in munitions factories, and one had to leave her position in order to care for her father. Eventually, the attention that he required became too much for her, but, despite intensive efforts, she could not secure his admission to a hospital. The Repatriation Commission also the Minister proposes to make further amendments of the act, he should liberalize this section, because a grateful country should continue to show its gratitude until the death of a former soldier, and should not expend, it all within the space of a few years after his return. We should not content ourselves with waving flags and promising to him all kind of assistance.

Next session, .the Government should liberalize this provision, and I ask the Minister to take a favorable view of my representations to him. If necessary, let it cost money! If we are able to find £200,000,000 a year for the purpose of fighting the war, surely we can find a few more million pounds for the veterans of other wars. If in the picturesque phrase of a former Treasurer, the Right Honourable R. G. Casey, "" The sky is the l i m it regarding war expenditure"", why should not a ceiling slightly lower than the sky be the limit-muc h higher than the present l i m it for men who are suffering from war injuries? I also notice that we are prepared, in a burst of generosity, to increase funeral expenses. If we were to expend a little more money on people when they were alive, we would not feel that we have to be generous about them when they die. We should not be under the obligation, as it were, to .salve our consciences with the recollection that, even if we did not treat -them very well while .they were living, we at least gave to them a decent burial.

Many other people are in a similar plight. A t the conclusion of this war all of the magnificent hospitals which have been erected in the suburbs of our capital cities w ill ultimately pass to the civil authorities. In the course of I see no 40 years few soldiers w ill remain to occupy them, and the State authorities will assume control of them. will occur before then. that if the capitalistic system of society remains we shall have recurring wars.

I support the bill, and commend the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) upon its introduction. It proposes to raise the maximum rates of service pensions, to extend the pensions to veterans of the South African war, to make medical treatment available to those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and to give statutory sanction to other liberalizing measures adopted by previous administrations. Whilst we should aim at perfection, we can never hope to attain it, but this bill will be welcomed by thousands of returned soldiers. The South African veterans have too long been ostracized and neglected. I congratulate the Minister upon having made provision for their inclusion within the scope of the act, and I hope that the bill will receive the unanimous support of the House. the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), I am pleased that the South African veterans are to receive the benefits of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, but I hope that this bill is but a. forerunner of a complete revision of the repatriation law. Those of us who have been dealing with repatriation matters generally for many years consider that an overhaul of the act is long overdue. During the last Parliament the service pension was granted to returned soldiers who were unemployable. A l though the right honourable member was temporarily absent from the Ministry when that measure was introduced, I believe that he was responsible for it, and may be given credit for that valuable recognition of the claims of the soldiers who fought in the last war. I believe that if he had his way the act would be a much better instrument than it is to-day. I am satisfied that the Repatriation Commission has done excellent work, but the scope of the act has .probably not enabled it to do all that it would have liked to do in the interests of the returned men. I could cite many individual cases to show the need for amendments of the act, but those matters can best be dealt with later when the Estimates are under consideration. I suggest to the Minister that before the present sittings are concluded a select committee should be appointed to investigate anomalies in connection with repatriation. Many amendments might well be made to the existing law, in order to do justice to soldiers who have returned from the last war. I believe that, within a few weeks, a select committee could furnish ample proof of the need for amendments of the act, with a view to eliminating anomalies with regard to returned soldiers generally. Men who are now coming back from the war apparently suffer from the effects of their experiences, but they are not entitled to the benefits of the act. I hope that some steps will be taken to do justice to those who have made sacrifices on behalf of the Empire in both this and the last war. Full recognition of the services of the veterans of the South African War was long overdue. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Lawson), other honourable members and I have frequently drawn attention to their claims, and I am glad that justice is now to be done to them. When a soldier has applied for a pension, and his application has been refused, he may appeal against the decision ; but months may elapse before the appeal is heard. In the meantime he may be in need of medical attention, and I claim that he should immediately receive it, in order to prevent him from becoming permanently incapacitated. I have brought under notice of the Minister the case of a returned soldier who is suffering from spondylitis. If he is required to wait until his appeal is heard he may become a charge on the country for the rest of his life. nine. medical attention immediately, quite probably he would be prevented from becoming a permanent charge on the community.

I consider the present Minister should see that cases such as this receive medical attention. -Every Minister for Repatriation since the passage of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act has endeavoured to eliminate anomalies that have been revealed from time to time, but, in doing that, further anomalies have been created. suggestion of the honourable member for Lang( Mr Mulcahy) that a select committee be appointed to investigate repatriation matters generally, with a view to submitting to the Government recommendations anomalies could be eliminated. At present we have a patch-work act due to the efforts of successive governments and parliaments to improve it. Sometimes concessions of a purely political nature have been made to returned soldiers, and at other times governments have earnestly endeavoured to rectify anomalies. In the main, the act is approved by all reputable organizations of returned soldiers, because it is recognized proposals put forward by the previous that, in many cases of disability arising out of war service, relief has been given to applicants. Yet there are border-line cases that should have received the attention of successive governments, but unfortunately have not had the backing necessary to influence those governments. Owing to the altered conditions of warfare to-day, new repatriation problems will arise, and it will be impossible to deal satisfactorily with all applications reasonable doubt whether on enlistment for service pensions under the present law without creating further anomalies. Therefore, in my opinion, the act needs a complete revision, with a view to bringing it up to date. The committee that I visualize would relied upon to furnish unchallengeable have to direct its attention to a matter of evidence of the condition of the soldier primary importance which has been stated at the time of enlistment. In some inclearly by successive Ministers for Repastances, it has been necessary to take triation.

I know of men who suffered disabilities in the line, but, rather than leave their units and thereby jeopardize the friendships so formed, they accepted medical treatment on the spot instead of being evacuated to a base hospital. Consequently they contracted disabilities which had Therefore, I welcome the had a detrimental effect upon them in after years, and, being unable to produce sufficient proof of the origin of their disability, they were deprived of the benefits of the act. In my opinion a man who goes overseas and as to how endures the rigours of heavy campaigning and the other hardships of a soldier's life, becomes liable to physical disabilities that will take their toll in future years. One matter that will have to be considered by any committee or government that seeks to bring the Repatriation Act up to date is that relating to the onus of proof. I commend the Government for having adopted some of the Administration. The Government of which I was a member took a long-sighted view of repatriation problems generally, and established an X-ray test for men enlisting for service overseas. It was possible to find out whether on enlistment a soldier suffered from any physical disability. If the X-ray examination be sufficiently intensive it is possible to establish beyond all a man is in a sound physical condition. I have it on expert authority that the miniature X-ray sets that were being used do not give complete information to the experts who study the results; consequently, tbe earlier records cannot be",35,Geobqe Bell S O They Are I F It Are Suffering F R O M Pulmonary Tubercu

While I was Minister for Repatriation I had to deal with many instances in which the Army authorities had accepted diggers for active service abroad without consulting the .Repatriation Commission as to whether or not they were suffering from disabilities. A previous Minister for the Army, the late Mr G. A. Street, was greatly concerned at the failure of the Army authorities to -accept the co-operation in this connection freely offered by the excellent officers of the Repatriation Commission. Many diggers, upon enlistment, were found to be pensioners or pensionable subjects.; consequently, in due course, quite a crop of cases will be harvested from bhat ifield by the Repatriarevenue needied for war purposes, by tion Commission. Service pensions are ""paid in cash. Recently, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Department has adopted the more up-to-date method of optional payment by cheque. The Minister might well adopt this method of payment to widows and others who request it in order to obviate lengthy journeys to the centres in which payment is made, and the physical strain imposed by the long period of waiting which frequently occurs. On a previous occasion, I made this suggestion to the Minister; and subsequently, as Minister, I.directed that the alteration be made. The Minister would be commended by quite a number of service pensioners if he were to make the change. I support the bill, and commend the Minister for its early introduction.

From time to .time, complaint has been made of the diversion of revenues raised by this department. It is an easy channel for the collection of funds to swell the consoLidated revenue account. The history of postal rates is .rather extraordinary. The House will remember that in 1908 there was penny postage, which ^extended to Ibhe United States of America. That was the rate throughout Australia ia 1911, wiuen it was declared to be sufficient to reimburse the Postal Department for -the services which it rendered.. At that time, the revenue of the department was buoyant, and the Government did not need to contemplate an increase -of the rate. The profits derived from the 'operations iof ithe department could not be applied ifco an expansion -of services, but have Ibeen .used purely *to buttress consolidated nevenue.

During the depression, the rate, was again increased; and the Government now, proposes to raise it still further, in. an endeavour to obtain the revenue that, ifl needsfor war purposes. I have no quarrel, with that objective; but I ask the Government to embody in the bill a provision, which willensure the restoration off the existing rate at the termination of the war. No person who uses: postal services would object to an increase in postal rates in order that the revenue needed for war purposes may be raised; but the Government is not entitled to use essential services merely as taxing authorities, by continuing such imposts-, after the war. Had the Gor vernment,, of which I was a member, introduced a bill to increase postal rates, it would have incorporated in it the provision) that the increase should apply only for the duration of the war and a short subsequent period. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Ckulrns),,, the then Postmaster General,, would have had sufficient consideration, for postal, subscribers to make that suggestion to his colleagues. If the Minister is prepared to move the suggested amendment we shall give the bill a. speedy passage; if not, we shall strive to impose the limitation. [6-.0] -In the interests of the taxpayers generallyi t would be a good thing if the Parliament were to focusi public ait ten tionon tli-is: bill, which fixes the rates may press unfairly om some land-holders of postage on letters and other articles handled, by the-.

The same, rate is to apply to each copy of Hansard, irrespective, of the size of the number., yet newspapers weighing 20 oz., if posted: at one' time by the same person,, are. to bear exactly the same additional impost.. There is no justification for perpetuating in war-time the anomalies and inconsistencies in the existing legislation. Unless the additional impost is to apply all round,, the taxpayers should be apprised' of the variation between the charges to be levied on letters and post cards and therates' at which newspapers and periodicals are to be conveyed through the post. Such differential treatment, is inequitable.. The publicshould know of the generous, concessions granted to the proprietors of newspapers, such as press, rates for telegrams, teleprinter facilities, andbulk rates, for newspapers. I realize that the Minister assisting the Postmaster-General( Mr Lawson) has not hadimuch tame to consider-these, problems, but these are matters which should not be allowed, to. pass unnoticed when postage rates generally are being increased.. The amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), is worthy of support..

The bill does not provide for equality of sacrifice. I suggest that each newspaper should boar an additional halfpenny stamp if each letter must do so. Since the war started, the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner has authorized an increase by 33:V per cent, of the prices charged for newspapers, notwithstanding that they have been reduced considerably in size and that, consequently the cost of production must be less than it was previously. It would appear that the owners of newspapers are able to convince the authorities that they really perform some useful public service in the dissemination of news, notwithstanding that frequently they do not tell the truth, and indeed are more a menace rather than an instrument for good in the community. I ask the Government not to be too tenderhearted when dealing with newspaper proprietors, or too solicitous of their welfare, Sydney and Melbourne. The charge for but to call upon them to share the increased burdens which are being placed on the community generally under this bill. the increased charges. the degree to which that can be done. I have heard it suggested from the Opposition benches that a tax should be imposed on newspaper advertisements. IndeedI have advocated such a tax myself as a means of disciplining the people concerned and making them contribute towards the cost of the war. I should prefer a tax on advertisements in newspapers to a tax on letters which people generally are sending to their friends more frequently now than in normal times. AlthoughI am not enthusiastic about the bill, I shall support it, but I hope that we shall have an assurance from the Minister that there will be no further increases of postal rates. I fear that this budget, bad as it is, is not the worse which will be presented to this Parliament, but that subsequent budgets may provide for still higher postal rates. is the evil thereof. the Treasurer should adopt catch-ascatch-can methods, and I trust that something better will be found in the future. This additional tax will not be popular among the workers, and, therefore, I ask the Minister to give an assurance that the rates set out in the schedule will not be further increased, and that the operation of the bill will be confined to the war and a definite period thereafter. wish to be clear about some points in connection with this bill. I desire, first, to know why there is no reference in it to telephone rates. On the 12th November a regulation varying the charges for telephone calls was promulgated. For what reason was that matter dealt with by regulation, whilst the introduction of a bill was deemed necessary before additional postal rates could be levied ? Under the regulation to which I have referred there will be a general reduction of telephone charges in conversations of three minutes over distances exceeding 15 miles, but not exceeding 25 miles, is to be reduced by 2d., whereas in respect of conversations over country telephone lines, not exceeding 50 miles, there is to be an increase of 3d.; in respect of calls over a distance exceeding 50 miles, but not exceeding 100 miles, the increased charge will be 6d.; and for conversations beyond 100 miles, but not exceeding 500 miles, the increased rate will amount to 9d. In Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart, telephone conversations over distances exceeding 10 miles, but not more than 20 miles, will cost 2d. less, whilst for distances exceeding 20 miles, but not, exceeding 25 miles, the reduction will be Id. Those rates indicate a distinct discrimination between telephone subscribers in the metropolitan area and those connected to country exchanges. able member is referring to matters not included in the bill.

142,Mr Mcdonald (Corangamite) [6.13].,"ctiB honourable member for Melbourne (. Mr Calwell) pointed out, newspapers weighing up to 20 oz. are to be called upon to pay only the same additional charge as applies to a letter or a postcard. That is manifestly unfair. The honourable member also complained that . these additional postal rates would impose a tax on the workers. There is not much ground for objection on that score, because it is practically the only tax that that class of the community is to be called upon to bear. I am, however, more concerned with the reduction of postal facilities in the country, mainly because of the war. In some country districts the available man-power has been depleted through enlistments, and in consequence the telephonic services have been reduced, 'fhis is not the time to reduce such services. On the contrary, people living in country districts should be given more of the amenities which are enjoyed by the people of the cities. During recent weeks a good deal has been said regarding the decentralization of industiy. If we are to do anything effective in that direction, we should encourage people to remain in the country. That can be done only by giving to them a larger share of the benefits which hitherto have been almost exclusively the privilege of citizens in the more populous areas of the Commonwealth. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m. to big cities where employment is offerpension of the sitting, Mr Speaker, you intimated tactfully, but none the less firmly, that you could not continue to port the remarks of the honourable member some members in the debating of matters creased postal, telegraphic and telephonic not covered by the bill.

At a time like this, when tion, while he was Postmaster-General? that big public utility, the Postmaster General's Department, is returning able move, but unfortunately insufficient huge profits, and when the Governtime was available in which to carry out ment proposes to increase charges in certain respects, it would not be proper, in my opinion, for us to approve of the reduction of any of the services now being given in country districts. The tendency should be to increase, and not to reduce, services. People who live at a distance from the large centres of population should be given additional facilities. Only a fortnight ago notice was received in a town which I could name to the effect that the annual revenue through the telephone service had fallen £9 below the stipulated figure to justify a continuance of the service at the existing standard, and the residents were advised that unless they contributed, among them, the £9 required the service would be reduced. That was a most unfair attitude for the department to adopt. Not only is the Postmaster-General's Department admittedly a money-making enterprise, but we have been told frankly that the increased charges proposed in this bill are intended to swell the revenue available to the Government. I , therefore, appeal to the Government to review its attitude in this connection, and at least protect the residents of country districts from a curtailment of their postal, telegraphic and telephonic services because their localities have suffered a reduction of population, partly through enlistments in the Australian Imperial Force and partly through the attraction of their residents country districts. There is a sustained request to-day for the de-centralization of many public activities.

147,Mr Collins,"I made a considerthe programme that I had envisaged. The Postmaster-General's Department is one of the important revenue-producing agencies of the Commonwealth, but unfortunately its profits may not be applied for the expansion of the department's activities. New works and buildings have to be provided through the Department of ihe Interior which, because of war exigencies, is not able to keep pace with the building programme which it is expected to carry out. For a number of years requests have been made for the establishment of a trust fund within the Postmaster-General's Department, into which moneys could be paid and from which they would be available for the enlargement of the department's services as required. This variation of procedure was suggested during the period when the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr for extensions of the services. In my Harrison) was Postmaster-General, and also in the periods during which the honourable member for Barker( Mr to delay the imposition of the proposed Archie Cameron), Senator McLeay and I administered the department. Throughout that time the Department of the Interior was unable to provide the new buildings and services desired by the Postmaster-Gen eral'3 Department. My view is that work of this nature should be let by contract to private firms. I believe I can see nothing wrong with calling that if that policy were applied, the Postmaster-General's Department would be able to render a much better service than at present to the general community, and especially to people living in country districts. realize that this amendment has been proposed as a political stunt. Governments supported by honourable gentlemen opposite could have done a great deal to improve the services of the Postmaster General's Department in country districts during the long period they held office, But they failed to take advantage of the opportunity to do so. We all know that for many years requests by correspondence and otherwise for extensions of the services of the Postmaster-General's Department have been met with the reply that such extensions could be granted only if sufficient revenue were guaranteed. I know of centres in my own electorate which need additional postal, telegraphic and telephonic facilities, but every request of that nature has been met with the reply that extensions could be granted only if a certain specified revenue were guaranteed. Two inspectors in one area that I have in mind reported favourably upon a request for additional facilities, but the request, was rejected on revenue grounds. I have never before heard the honourable member for Hume make tbe excuse that extensions of postal services could not be granted because of the limitations of the Department of the Interior. Requests for these extensions were being made regularly long before the war. Each year the Postmaster-General's Department returns a large sum in profits to Consolidated Revenue, and it is time that a proportion of those profits was earmarked opinion, this amendment has been moved merely to embarrass the Government and increase of postal charges. I do not agree with the view that these increased charges will seriously affect the workers. They will fall chiefly upon commission agents and business houses which make large demands on the services of the Postmaster-General's Department, and upon these interests to pay a little more in postal charges in order to help the Government to finance the war effort. I hope, however, that before very long the Government will be able to give close attention to ways and means of relieving the present unsatisfactory position in respect of postal, telegraphic and telephonic services in country districts. There is ample scope for improvements which the anti-Labour governments, supported by honourable gentlemen opposite, failed to effect in the long period in which they were in office. strongly object to the statement of the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) that this amendment has been moved as a ""political stunt"". It has been moved as the result of an objection I raised this afternoon to the imposition of increased telephonic rates by regulaition.

As the time in which action would have to be taken in this House for the disallowance of these regulations will expire two days hence I consider that this action is well justified, for it will give us an opportunity to discuss the subject. I strongly object to government by regulation. man supported a government which practically introduced government by regulation. M""r. MARWICK I have always protested against government by regulation. I offer no objection to the proposal to reduce telephonic charges within a 25-mile radius of the general post offices at Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth or Hobart, and within a 30-mile radius of the general post offices of Sydney and Melbourne, but I strongly object to the proposed increases of telephonic charges to persons living in country districts. This, in my opinion, is discrimination of the worse kind. I direct attention to the following proviso to the newly issued regulation 13S of the Telephone Regulations:Provided further that for trunk-line calls between exchanges or offices situated outside the boundaries of a State capital city network but within 80 miles of tlie general post oflice, Sydney or Melbourne, or within 25 miles of the general post office, Brisbane, Adelaide, I'erili or Hobaxt, and exchanges or offices filuutcd within .a radius of 10 miles of the Gfeneral post office in each sucb Slate capital tjity, the charges specified in the above table shall be reduced as follows:Calls to and from cwhaiuccs ur offices within a 10-mlle radius of the General 1'ost Otlice. f Exceeding 1:5 but not Sydney or Melbourne J exceeding! 25 miles.. j Exceeding 25 'but uot (. exceeding; SO miles.. f 'Exceeding l'O but 'not Brisbane, Adelaide, J execcdim; 20 miles..

163,Mr Archie Cameron,"Anyfigures-I had thern when I was Postmaster-General-bu t I think that in Sydney there are about 250,000 individual telephone subscribers, each of whom, had the right under the old rates to ring any other subscriber in the network for I d . a call and will have the right under the proposed rates to ring for 1-id. a call. In the country districts calls over distances no greater than from one city suburb to another have to be made on trunk lines and are, as I am reminded by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick), limited to three minutes, whereas the city subscriber can speak for any length of time. I know many exchanges in my electorate which have ten subscribers or less. Mount Gambier exchange would be the biggest, exchange in my electorate, and I doubt whether more than 1,000 subscribers are connected to it. Lots of small exchanges are located at points a few miles distant from Mount Gambier und the result is that, if people desire to .«peak to comparatively near neighbours, they have to make trunk line calls at the higher trunk line charges, whereas, if they were in Sydney all would be on the one network. I welcome some of the things that the Postmaster-General is doing under the regulations, for instance, the increase of the number of telephones on the exchange from 600 to 1,000 is very good. But that does not get away from the fact that other increases, which are wrong, are to be made. For instance, what is the necessity to increase the fee for making a, personal call to Is. if the distance is more than 500 miles? The cost of making a personal call does not vary according to distance. Taken one by one, the proposals would be hard for any Government to defend. Another instance of discrimination against country telephone subscribers is the fact that the annual telephone rental where the exchange has 300 subscribers is £3 5s. for both business and private users. On an exchange of 10,000 subscribers the rental is £6 5s. for a business user and £5 for a private user. In addition to that the cost, of certain classes of calls in Sydney and Melbourne is to be reduced. metropolitan telephonic business makes it possible for the post office to grant concessions to rural telephone subscribers. amazed that an honourable member representing a country constituency should say that. I expected that the honourable member for Ballarat would speak the truth and say able member for Barker implying that I do not speak the truth and I ask him to withdraw that remark. member for Barker wish to imply that? not finished what I was about to say, which was that I was amazed that he was not one who would speak the truth that but for the country areas the cities would not be in existence. The constituents of the honourable member should be plainly told what he said, and J think that it is time. I did so. We must get down to the fundamental fact that, if it were not for country production and the squatters, the farmers, the fruit growers and the dairymen and the miners, who conduct their operations in the country, Melbourne and Sydney would not, be in existence to need telephone services. When I was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly the vexed question raised in the honourable member's interjection was often discussed in respect of railway freights and fares, the principle involved then being the same as that I am now emphasizing in regard to telephone charges. So long as it is made easier and more attractive for people to go to the metropolitan areas, so long shall we have towns like some in my electorate and the electorates of the honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) beset by difficulties brought about by the trend towards centralization. Examined as a matter of principle and fact these telephone regulations contain certain bad elements. I strongly and sincerely advise the Minister assisting the Postmaster General( Mr Lawson) to agree to the amendment and allow the increased telephone charges to be considered in conjunction with the increased postal charges.

The less we do by regulations the better. Regulations are not a good way of dealing with the country or of imposing burdens on the people. There are too many hurdles in the Acts Interpretation Act to allow of proper government in that way. If the Attorney-General went into this question, he would be one of the first to admit that the proper, correct, parliamentary and democratic way would be to produce a bill to increase the telephone charges instead of doing it by the sticky process of regulations. adjourned. 1941.

173,Mr Spooner,"Yes, they may havemake the effect of this clause retrospective. If it does so, hardship will be imposed upon the people who have received the class of dividends affected during the year which ended on the 30th June last. The transactions which gave rise to such dividends may have been carried out in perfectly good faith by people who had invested their money on the understanding that dividends would not be taxable in Australia; but now they become aware for the first time-sixtee n months after the transactions took place-that between now and June, 1942, income tax assessments will be issued in respect of those dividends or profits. For that reason the Opposition asks the Government to accept the amendment, which proposes to remove the retrospectivity from this clause. The amendment that I propose to move later, on the assumption that the committee will agree to this one, will provide that the amendments proposed to be effected to the act by the clause as it now stands, shall not armly to any dividend paid, credited, or distributed, if the dividends were declared prior to the 30th October, 1941. I repeat that no issue is raised concerning the policy of the Government's amendments. The Opposition accepts that as the policy of tlie Government, and does not contest the nature of the change that the Government desires to make. It merely asks the Government to accept this amendment for the purposes of removing the retrospectivity of the clause and making the profits or dividends taxable only if they become income in the hands of the taxpayers subsequent to the 30th October, 1941, which was the approximate date of delivery of the budget. assisting the Treasurer) [8.38] -The Government assures the committee that its new proposals are not intended to be retrospective beyond the 30th October, but the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) has raised another issue in i-.hjs amendment. He proposes to omit subparagraph ( i i ) of clause 6 and to exempt from tax any profits arising from the sale, or compulsory resumption for public purposes, of assets not acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit. The Government has contended all along that profits derived from the resale of property of companies-no t the return of capital, but profits over and above that-and distributed to the shareholders as dividends, should be taxable as ordinary dividends. It appears that the honourable member wishes to submit two amendments as one. The Government cannot accept the first, which propose to omit the words "" subparagraphs (i) and (ii) "", and to insert the words ""sub-paragraph ( i ) "". However, the Government is agreeable to the proposal regarding the retrospectivity of the tax. Leader of the Opposition) [8.40] -The Opposition has submitted the amendment for the very reason which the Minister has just outlined-that it is opposed to this new principle which the Government proposes to introduce into federal taxation practice, namely, the taxing of capital profits. The Opposition is definitely opposed to the taxation of capital profits in this way, whether the proceeds of the profits find their way, as dividends, into the pockets of the shareholders or not. The principle is bad, because the profit is capital profit, and the Government's proposal involves a definite departure from the principles of income taxation as practised by the Commonwealth since federation. The Opposition will oppose the passage of clause 6 as it stands in the bill. Question putagreed to. The committee divided. (THE CHAIEMAN-MB . PBOWSE.) Ayes. -.. 23 Noes 27 Miajority AXES. Abbott, J.

[.9.10] -The :commdttee should carefully examine the effects ;of this proposal oipon the gold-mining industry in particular, upon the mining industry generally, the oil industry, and afforestation, because three important activities are -affected by the operation oi the 'new compromise. I .use the term ""-compromise "" in 1 the -strict .sense of the word.. What the committee of members has produced' as the result of its (deliberations over the week-end, 'and what the Gov-ennment has agreed to accept, centainily improves the bill; but I -cannot 'allow this opportunity rto pass without directing attention to the inevitable 'results if the Government persists with 1ih>is legislation. At the outset, I inform honourable members .that I hold -no interests whatever in companies. There is in Australia an urgent .necessity to discover oil, and an urgent demand for gold. In addition, there is an 'equally urgent demand for many kinds of minerals, including copper, zinc, asbestos, rutile, zirconium and other metals which are essential to the munitions industry. This bill affects their future. I -propose to survey 'briefly the effect of Conomonwealth legislation upon the goldmining industry. You, Mr Chairman, who represent a Western Australian constituency, will understand fully the implications-of any comments upon this matter. Before the outbreak -of war, it was the practice to exempt the gold-fining industry from making contributions to revenue. After September, 1939, one of the first actions of Parliament, which I opposed strenuously at the time,, which I then believed to be wrong, -which is wrong now, and which will be wrong -.so long as it operates, was to -impose a tax upon the increment of the price of gold, arising out of the war. If the Government had been (consistent at that time, it would have imposed a tax upon every otherinea-ement, especially on respect of metals, which arose -out of .the increase of prices as ithe result of *the twar. But nothing of the sort was done. .Gold is a peculiar commodity. Like all other minerals, once it is --extracted from the ea.r'th, it can never he replaced. When .the price of gold increased, Iflie 'opportunity to work the poorer shows, (the marginal shows, was/greater than lever .before. AH that .the Government succeeded -in -doing, by introducing -the special gold increment tax, was to prevent some -of the -poorer shows from being worked at a time when they could have been more profitably operated than a.t any other ,period. Surveying the .gold-mining industry as a whole, we have to relate to it the matter of the .exemption of calls on gold-mining companies, partial allowance for which is now aaade under the compromise. As a rule, the big companies which are paying dividends do not make calls. That would be a most unusual procedure. The calls are being made by companies which are struggling to remain, on their feet. It may be contended that a .good deal of roguery goes on in the gold-mining industry I should not be surprised if that were .true. 'So far as I am aware, there are only two places in the world where that has not occurred. One is Virginia, in the United States of America, the .birthplace of George Washington, who always told the truth, and the other is this House of Representatives, where honourable members are not permitted to tell anything but the truth. The effect of the compromise will be to reduce the amount of capital that will be invested in the gold-mining industry. Definitely, that is bad for the 'Commonwealth in time of war. Problems associated with dollar exchange, the maintenance of our exchange rate .with the United Kingdom, and .the purchase of our requirements in the United States of",48,Chairman Mb Pbowse Clause 12 B Of The Bill The Deduction Of
187,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"America can be dealt with most easily and most economically by the greatest possible production of gold. In the desert we think of the millions of pounds exareas of Western Australia, and in the still unexplored interior, even in the old shows in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, the production of gold is going on apace. Where labour can be obtained for this purpose, the Government should encourage rather than discourage the production of gold. When the legislation was introduced in 1939, I should have taken no objection to it if the Government of the day had decided to subject gold to the same rates of income tax as apply to other metals. If this Government were to introduce proposals to place gold-mining on the same income tax basis as other mining, it would be consistent and I should not oppose such action. But, in this instance, the industry is struck by the increment tax, and its development, expansion and capacity to win gold from the marginal shows will be seriously affected by the compromise. To date,, oil has not been found in payable quantities in Australia. For the purpose of waging this war, the discovery of flow oil in Australia would be of infinitely greater importance than even the discovery of another Kalgoorlie or Ballarat. Almost without exception, every investor who has put money into oil shows in Australia has lost it. He had as much chance of reward) as has the man who supports the Golden Casket or Tattersall's. I am not defending the operations of companies which I have criticized in the past, but I am stating a case for Australia's need of oil supplies in time of war. The Commonwealth has gone to the length of subsidizing companies,, and has passed special measures, in order to promote the discovery of oil in New Guinea. Experts from the United States of America have been sent to the electorate of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr 50' years or more. Large areas, were Paterson) in order to-determine what are the prospects there. Therefore, instead of discouraging investment in shows of this description, the Government ought to be rather thankful that there are in Australia people who are prepared to risk their money in prospecting for flow oil. The history of the discovery of oil in other countries is very interesting. When pended by Weetman Pearson, in Mexico, before the discovery of the flow oil which was so largely responsible for the maintenance of oil supplies to the United Kingdom in the period from 1914 to1918, we realizewhat risk there is in the matter. If we compare the expenditure in Mexico with what has taken place in Australia, we must admit that we have made very little, progress. It would be a very fine thing if an even more liberal idea were held by the Government in regard toexpenditure by taxpayers in endeavours to find flow oil in this country. I come now to minerals, of which a great variety is required by the munitions industry of Australia. Some of them are very difficult to obtain; they have to bediscovered. Some are in great demand, and very short supply. The world production of tantalitea mineral found"" in Northern Australia-befor e the outbreak of the present war was 110 lb., the production; of Australia being 108 lb. Thismineral is one of the greatest agenciesfor the toughening and hardening of steel, and its production in large quantities is urgently desired by Great Britain and the United States of America. One could name many other minerals which probably are more familiar to some other honourable members than they are to me. Every one of them should be mined, and stored against the day when it may be required; for at this stage none of us can say how long the present con.flict may last. The last subject with which I shall deal is afforestation; this, in conjunction with the discovery of oil,, affects my electorate.. In the southern portion of the division of Barker there are considerable forests of pine, planted mostly by Government enterprise over' the last 40or planted also by private enterprise. The wood' is now being used for purposes for which, only two yearsago, experts declared it was utterly impossible to use it ; ifc has been found suitable for the-manufacture of ma-tGhes, munition boxes, and certain other things which I shall not mention. Those who put' their money into that kind of plantation knew that they could not expect a return from it until the pines were ready to cut 35 years after planting. By and large, men who put money into a venture of' that description do not expect a great reward in this world, because the average age of such investors is above 35 years. In all too many cases, no reward has been reaped. The value of the pine in my district is 5s. 3d. per 100 super feet; that is what the merchant is willing to pay for it. But under the system of prices fixation adopted by the Commonwealth, with which the private forest owners do not quarrel, the price has been determined at 3s. 6d. per 100 super feet. In that respect alone, one-third of the income which those who are selling to-day would have derived is denied to them by Commonwealth legislation designed to benefit Australia as a whole. The important problem confronts us of replanting areas which are being cut out to-day. Usually, the land is left out of plantation for five years after the pine has been taken of f . Then a further 35 years must elapse before a dividend is received. If the Government says to potential investors, "" From now on, only to the extent of one-third of your actual investments will we regard you as benefactors "" that will not be to the ultimate welfare of this country. Australia is more deficient in policy is to be one of abandoning timber than is any other continent. Only l£ per cent, of the total area of South Australia contained natural forests at the advent of the white man, and the area which is to-day covered by natural and plantation forests is very little greater. That is indicative of the conditions generally throughout Australia. It was a part of my job last summer to knock around the Otway ranges, and the Strzelecki ranges on the other side of Port Phillip Bay. Huge areas of native timber have been destroyed, in some instances by pure vandalism and in many places as the result of short-sighted Government policy. Perfectly good forest land has been turned into dairying country in the Strzelecki ranges, where the hills are so steep that a crow could not descend them unless it wore breeching. These natural forest lands are worthless for dairying purposes. The immediate, and to a greater extent the ultimate, Mr Archie Cameron. future of this country, depend on the re-afforestation of these areas. The growing period for Pinus insign is, or Remarkable pine, which has the.shortest period of growth of any timber, is 35 years. The growing period of the hardwoods that have been destroyed in the Otway and Strzelecki ranges must be anything up to 200 or 300 years. Reafforestation in respect of hardwoods cannot be undertaken except by a government instrumentality; I am not so foolish as to believe that investors would engage in hardwood cultivation with the prospects such as they are. But in the southern States of Victoria and South Australia, and the southern portion of Western Australia and Tasmania, the planting of pine of various sorts could be undertaken privately. The Government should therefore give every encouragement to the re-afforestation of certain areas, and the extension of forests to what is to-day swampy and sandy country, with a high rainfall. The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) may retort that, with high rates of tax, aiding a man in a high income group would practically mean subsidizing him in respect of afforestation or the opening up of mines. Nevertheless, these points have to be considered. Sooner or later, the Government must tell this Parliament whether the all hope of future advancement, with minimum planting of timber, development of mineral resources, and prospecting for petrol and oil, in order to help that which is urgently necessary for the prosecution of the war, or of looking only to the immediate effect on the budget of this country. The Treasurer may not have had the time to give to this matter the attention which I feel sure he will admit that it deserves. 1 am not in any sense criticizing the Government. My sole desire is to evoke some thought on the subject. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) understands the gold-mining industry, and, I have no doubt, the valuable timber industry of Western Australia, much better than I do. He knows how long it has taken for the great jarrah and karri forests to grow, and realizes that, unless tended and preserved, these great natural assets will deteriorate. I merely ask that during the recess the Treasurer and those associated pointed from both sides of the House to with him shall go carefully into this consider this bill. The decision was that aspect of the matter, and weigh against tax concessions on calls for mining and the immediate requirements of revenue afforestation should not exceed the prethe ultimate welfare of this country; the war rate. I hope that I shall not be encouragement which is or is not to be regarded as presuming, if I pay my given to the investor; the development tribute to each member of the committee which is or is not to take place; and the for his approach to the subject and for assets which are to be drawn upon in time the broad, impartial, and fair manner of war, or are to be increased even at such in which he faced the facts. a time for the ultimate welfare of this country. There is, too, the protection of the surface of the soil; for whether we that we should encourage compauies to are at war or not, the matter of soil erouse their money for mining and afforession has to be considered in the denuded tation purposes. I agree with the honorareas which I observed last summer, parable gentleman, but it is one thing to ticularly in southern Victoria. This is encourage a private company to use its one of the most important matters that own money, and quite another to subwe have to consider. I believe that it sidize it in respect of the great bulk of its can be effectively tackled only by some investment. That is what the honourable method of re-afforestation. If a person gentleman's proposal would amount to. or company is prepared to expend money We must look at this subject in proper in planting such areas with timber, the perspective in order to consider what may Commonwealth Government in the long best be done. Ever since income taxes run, upon complete consideration, must have been imposed, provision has existed recognize the wisdom of giving every for the deduction from taxable income of encouragement possible to such enterprise, calls paid to mining companies. Conbecause what is done will be for the ultisequently no taxes have hitherto been paid mate as well as the immediate benefit of upon this purely capital expenditure. In this country. Government does not require to be contion. This factor was carefully reviewed vinced of the importance of the mining by the committee which considered the industry, and of afforestation^""' I agree Government's taxation proposals, and with what the honourable rjjfember for figures presented to it convinced it that Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has just the country could not continue to allow said. He has made a very valuable conthe deduction which has so far been pertribution to the debate, in stressing the mitted. The following table compares importance of these industries. The the amount of tax deductions allowed latter part of his speech, particularly in under pre-war rates and the amount regard to forestry, struck a responsive which would have been allowed under chord in my heart. I agree, and so does present rates if no amendment were made. the Government, that both mining and The figures, I believe, will convince honafforestation are important. But the orable members of the soundness of the Government is faced with the problem committee's view:of financing a war. It has inherited high taxation, and has increased it, solely for the purpose of fighting a war. The question arises, whether the concession in respect of taxation which has been granted to the mining and forestry industries over the years that have gone, should continue at the same rate, or should be stepped up in the same abnormal pro1,000 portion that taxation for war purposes has 2,000 been increased.

If the Government encouraged the investment in mining and afforestation enterprises of the amounts represented, by caLls, it would be contributing S3 per cent, of the capital so invested. We may therefore pertinently ask: If the Government is to contribute 83 per cent, of the investment, why should it not contribute the whole of it? If it is to contribute five-sixths, why not also the extra one-sixth? If it can afford to contribute £83 of every £100 invested in afforestation under such conditions, I suggest that it could afford to contribute the total amount and take over the undertaking. £S3in every £100 it would still get none of the profits. would it own any of the assets. all' of the investors would be on the £2,500-a-year mark. Mr .SCULLIN -If the honourable gentleman will refer to the table which I gave he will see that I dealt with income cases of from £500 a year to £5,000 a year. I then took the middle income of £2,500 ayear in order to get at my percentage of 83 per cent. Let me give an instance of the kind of thing that is happening. I have not been given the exact, figures, but those I shall use will be in true ratio. It would not do to give the exact figures, for that would identify the company. honourable gentleman's figures will be relative? pany was formed to explore leases and to prospect. The £1 shares were issued on the basis of 2s. on application and 2s. on allotment. The remaining 16s. was obtained' by calls and the whole of it was exempt from taxation. The company, in the course of its exploration, discovered gold-bearing quartz. A new company was floated,, probably of the members of the old company, which took over, or bought, the rights of the old company. The whole, of the 16s. in the £1 called up by the old company was exempt from tax, and the whole of the capital represented in the £1 shares in the new company was paid by calls and was also exempt from taxation. While it might be all right in times of low, or moderate, taxes to grant full exemptions on mining calls, it would be quite improper^ in my opinion, to continue that policy in a time such as the present, when the results would be as stated in my table. In present circumstances no one could justify a continuation of these-exemptions. The honourable member for Barker criticized the gold tax. That tax was not imposed, originally, by this Government. I do not desire to criticize the' tax, which provides that when the price of gold exceeds £9 an oz., half of the excess shall be taken in taxation-. In other words, with gold as it is to-day at £10 14s. a-n oz., the tax is 17s. an oz. I point out that the price of everything except gold is controlled. The price of gold, alone, is allowed to soar. It is a goodthing forAustralia that the 1 price of gold has increased . I agree that 1 gold is important in relation to our overseasfunds, but as a means: to. conduct the war in the physical sense, it is: not nearly so important as copper. not put another gun on the battlefield overseas,, even if we had amountain of gold in Australia. We are getting from America all the war material that country can send. It is true that we can pay for munitions from America with, gold, but gold is not a physical instrumentality for' the conduct of the war. It is, after all, merely a means of finance in these days.. Metals, such as copper, are infinitely more precious for warpurposes. We need finance,, and if we could get more finance by getting more gold, it. would be a good thing;. Goldmining is not a factor to-day as an industry for absorbing labour. Thebig gold-producing State of Western Australia is short of labour for the goldmines which arealready in operation. Sufficient men Gannot. be obtained to develop these mines. Wood-cutters cannot be obtained to provide timber for the mines.

The committee which investigated the taxation proposals of the Government considered the whole subject with a ful l sense of responsibility and it came to the conclusion that under the present abnormal rates of taxation, complete exemption of calls by mining companies could not be tolerated. In support of that decision I again refer honourable members to the table which I cited earlier in my speech. Such an exemption, whilst justifiable in periods of low or even moderate taxation, becomes entirely unjustifiable in days when the Government is charged with the grim responsibility of finding money with which to conduct the war.

I02B. This Division operation so long as the National Security Act 1939-1940 continues in operation and no longer."". On this very controversial question the Government has carefully weighed the merits of the proposal against its demerits, and has recognized that, if effect were given to the proposal in the bill, some, injustices and inconsistencies would result. In furtherance of the Government's .desire to avoid injustice, the right honourable member for Yarra Scullin) and I conferred with th.p Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) and the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), and it, has been agreed that proposed new section 102A should be replaced by the proposed new sections which have been circulated amongst honourable members. It is realized on all sides that some check must be placed upon the avoidance of income tax that occurs when income-producing assets are transferred by a. taxpayer to his wife. This principle is expressed in the provisions now circulated and they will have the effect, of causing the same amount of tax to be payable on the income from any propertv transferred after the 29th Mr Chifley. October of this year as would have been payable if the husband had retained the property. For example, if a taxpayer transfers to his wife property from which a net income of £500 is derived and the taxpayer himself derives an income of the taxpayer is £2,000, tax will be payable by the husband on £2,000 and by the wife on the £500, at the rate appropriate to a taxable income of £2,500. If the wife defives income from sources other than the property transferred to her by her husband, she will be assessed on that income at the rate of tax applicable to that income. To extend the example which I have already cited, if the wife receives, say, £400 from sources outside the property transferred to her by her husband, she will be taxed on that £400 at the rate applicable to £400. This, of course, will be in addition to the tax on the £500 from the transferred property. It is not proposed that this new law sliould have auy application to transactions which occurred prior to the 30th October last. There is little doubt shall continue in that the higher rates of tax which are likely to prevail for some years will provide the incentive to a taxpayer to divide his income-producing assets between his wife and himself. The new provisions will prevent the loss of revenue which would result from future transfers of this nature. The Government does not desire to interfere in those cases where a taxpayer quite legitimately and with no purpose of avoiding income tax desires to provide his wife with an independent ( Mr income in order to give her some security for her future. To meet these cases it is proposed that the provision shall not apply where the taxable income of the wife does not exceed £200, irrespective of the source of the income. No doubt, cases will arise in which the Transferred property will consist of a business in the conduct of which the wife will take an active part. There is every justification, in cases of this character, in determining the net income of the business for the purpose of applying the provision, for making due allowance for the value of the services of the wife in carrying on the business. The value of these services will be determined by the Commissioner of Taxation, having regard to the facts and circumstances of each particular case. As wartime taxation has prompted this proposal, it is provided that the clause shall cease to he operative when the National Security Act is repealed. Some of the arguments advanced warranted the action proposed in the amendment. The force ->f the argument advanced by the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) about a wife's personal exertion income could not be denied. Similarly, it was recognized that it would be a hardship to treat in the way originally intended the income of a wife who had helped her husband in developing a business or some other enterprise. Those arguments were pertinent, and they demanded action, but other arguments scarcely influenced me. Por instance, die argument about morality passed me by. It was suggested that the original proposals would discourage marriage. I scorn to take that argument seriously, because I know that no woman who wants a marriage certificate will let such little things as this stand in the way. I do concede that some men might try to use the proposal as a means whereby to avoid carrying out. promises made in the moonlight. arfn.iii.ient than I did of the argument that the proposal made the wife a chattel. T say quite frankly that many of the people who talk in that strain have evaded taxation by transferring property to their wives and have made slaves of domestic servants. admit that the clause strikes .at the roots of the Married Women's Property Actanswer that interjection. Cases have been brought to my notice of husbands who have transferred property to their wives and made with their wives agreements of which the Commissioner of Taxation knows nothing, whereby the whole of the income from that, property goi s to the husbands' accounts and j whereby, if the wives die, the property is bequeathed back to the husbands. agree that in seeking ro catch people who anomalies are likely to occur, but we are engaged in war and many more things are at stake than sentiment and platitudes. One of the important things that has to be done is to tax people who have the ability to pay taxes. A dark picture has been painted of my part in this matter, but agreement has been reached, largely as the result of the f a i r approach of the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Kooyong. They agreed that there must be no further evasion. They were not preparedand I. appreciate their attitude-to dig into the past in. order to find out how wives had acquired certain property. In any case, administrative difficulties would arise, in doing that. I heartily concur with the proposal emanating from the committee which is expressed in the amendment. I direct the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) to the drafting of the .'iniendnient. There is doubt whether the obvious intention of the committee is expressed. The words in question areWhere after the twenty-ninth day of October, flic thousand nine hundred and forty-one, the wife of a tax-jiayer has acquired or acquires any property, whether directly or indirectly, as a. result of any gift, by the taxpayer or any transfer iby him without bi= I took no more notice of that receiving fully adequate consideration The amendment then goes on to state what the. Commissioner shall do. ' It . is quite conceivable that a man may have transferred, say, 1,000 shares to his wife at some time prior to the 29th October. 1941. and that after that date there has been ;i distribution of profit by way of shares which has been received by the wife. Mr Ciiii'i.Kv -The produce of gifts is I almost scorn to not .limed at by this proposal. I shall -ict-cpt the honourable gentleman's suggestion. the words "" any g if t or transfer made by the taxpayer after that date "" should be included.

The Treasurer has acted wisely and I am obliged to him for the opportunity that will thus be afforded to make a complete examination of the whole subject.

' "" . On Wednesday last I circulated to honourable members a copy of an amendment to clause 22 of the Income Tax Assessment Bill, which I proposed to move in order to give effect, to the Government's decision to provide for an abatement of income tax in any case where the effective combined rates of Commonwealth and State taxes exceed 18s. in the £1. It has been found, however, that the amendment as drafted does not correctly express the Government's decision, and it has been replaced by the amendment now circulated to honorable members. The Government's proposal is that in those cases where the combined weight of Commonwealth and State taxes on the taxpayer's income of the year exceeded 18s. in the £1 relief should be given to the taxpayer concerned according to the proportionate weight of tax imposed respectively by the Commonwealth and the State. example, if the combined weight of the tax on each £1 of income is 21s., composed of 14s. Commonwealth tax and 7s. State tax, the relief to be given by the Commonwealth will be 2s. in the £1. As State income taxes paid during the year of income are allowed as a deduction in arriving at the Commonwealth taxable income, it is necessary that these taxes should be added back to the taxable income in order to determine whether the total weight of Commonwealth and State taxes is more than ISs. in the £1. The only difference between the amendment now circulated and the amendment previously circulated is the provision which is being made for the adding back to taxable income of the taxes paid that have been allowed as deductions in arriving at the taxable income. The rebate will be allowed where the combined Commonwealth and State taxes payable on income of the year of income exceed 90 per cent, of the taxable income before deduction of State income taxes paidduring the year is allowed. The proposed rebate will be applicable to companies as well as to individuals. It rests with the States to contribute their proportion of the tax abatement so that the Commonwealth and State taxes on income shall not exceed 18s. in the £1. When dealing with clause 12b of the bill, I explained to the committee that the omission of paragraph d' of subsection 1 of section 78 of the principal aot, and the insertion of new section 160A, implemented the recommendation of the committee of members on the subject of calls in mining companies. The type of calls specified in section 78(1) d of the principal act are repeated in the proposed section 160A. The new section provides for a rebate of tax of the amount obtained by applying to the amount of the calls one-third of the rate of tax payableon an amount of taxable income equal to the taxable income of the taxpayer. Where the taxable income is derived from personal exertion only, the rebate is calculated at personal exertion rates. Where the income consists of property income, or partly of personal exertion and partly of property income, the rebate is calculated at property rates. In the case of a company, For the rebate is one-third of the flat rate of normal tax payableby companies. Thus, under the proposed 1941-42 rates, the rate of company rebate would be one-third of 3s., which equals Is. in the £1 on the amount of calls paid to mining companies in the income year. Subsection 2 of new section 160A makes it clear that the rate of company tax referred to is the rate of normal tax, not rlif rate applicable to other taxes which may be assessed to a company, such as sit per tax and tax assessed under Part I. 11A of the act. The j>roposed section provides that the amount of the calls on which rebate is to be granted is not to exceed the amount of taxable income. In section 7S(l)d of the principal act, there was a limitation by which the deduction for calls could not exceed the amount of income remaining after deducting from the assessable income other allowable deductions. The new section will apply to assessments made for the financial year 1941-42 (based on income derived during the income year ended the 30th June, 1941) and succeeding years, and this will be provided in clause 28 of the bill. der of the Opposition) [10.0] -What steps does the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) intend to take to induce the States to meet this position? It seems that although the Commonwealth is prepared to grant a rebate, the taxpayer will be left at the mercy of the State Governments.

How much revenue will the Government be giving away through this and other concessions that are provided for in the bill ? I should also like to know what will ask him to endeavour to relieve the cirbe the position of an individual who earns about £2,000 this year, but who will retire I have referred. If they are to be imat the age of 65 years next year, when his income will diminish to about one-quarter of its previous level. Under the provisions of this measure, the man whom I have in mind will be required to pay about £1,300 of tax in respect of the money which he earned this year. He will be obliged, if he is to discharge his ing his officials to deal reasonably with liabilities, to sell a house in which he has invested his money. Is any provision made for a rebate to him in these special circumstances, or will he be obliged to submit to the equivalent of a capital levy in order that he may satisfy his obligation to the State? If he will bt obliged to submit to a capital levy, in that he will have to sell some property in order to pay his Commonwealth and State taxes, will the Treasurer adopt, generally, the principle of a capital levy? In my view a. man who is placed in this position as the result of taxes having increased steeply in the last couple of years, should be allowed a long time in which to pay his tax or given the benefit of some adjustment over this year and next year. At any rate, he should not be placed at a grave disadvantage in comparison with what would be his position if he were to continue earning £2,000 a year. I ask the Treasurer to mitigate the severity of taxation upon persons whose incomes drop considerably because they reach the retiring age. and who are compelled to live on what they have managed to save while they have been in employment. The income of the man whose case I have cited if high, but. he has not always earned that amount, and, because he happens to retire during a war, he should not b<treated so severely. ship provision in the act. payer may appeal to departmental officials, who may grant some remission. As the committee has made provision to help people who are interested in companies, it might also consider the position of individuals such as the man I have mentioned. I appeal to the good sense and spirit of decency inherent in the Treasurer, and cumstances of such individuals to whom poverished by means of this heavy tax, they will have no course open to them but to apply for the old-age pension, and that will mean added burdens for the Treasury.
