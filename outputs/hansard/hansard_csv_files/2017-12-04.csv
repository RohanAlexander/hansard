Petitions Committee Report Committee for the 45th Parliament, together with 58 petitions and 13 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. This report includes 18 petitions requesting action on climate change and 12 requesting reform for online gambling. These are two well-coordinated and passionate national campaigns seeking the ear of local members on matters of concern to them. The committee is impressed with the level of coordination and community engagement that these campaigns have achieved. As a result of this hard work, these petitions continue to engage members and the communities they represent. There are 28 other petitions in this report on a diverse range of matters. A total of 19,444 people have signed these petitions. That's a fantastic level of engagement with the parliament that we are seeing come from our local communities. In keeping with the high engagement in our petitions process, I will take the opportunity to report on a single e-petition that has closed for signatures in this past week, with 48,985 signatures. This is by far the largest e-petition to date, and it's a clear indication that our epetitions system is working as intended. Nonetheless, the committee is still looking at ways to improve the system. We are wrapping up our inquiry into the e-petitions system this week by talking to a group of primary school students, by video link, who have recently been engaged in petitioning the House. The committee looks forward to receiving a fresh perspective from these students, and we are excited about their interest in the petitioning process. I will continue to provide updates to the House on the work of the Petitions Committee and the inquiry into e-petitions.",21,Order

3,Mrs Wicks (Robertson) (10:03,"TodayI present the 18th report of the PetitionsBanks This petition of the Citizens Electoral Council draws to the attention of the House that even such institutions as the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, and the US. Federal Reserve are now warning of a new, far more severe financial crash than that of 2008. Transatlantic and Commonwealth governments have bailed out the Too-Big-to-Fail (TBTF) banks with US$19 trillion since 2008, virtually all of which has been used for speculation; the banks are now 40 per cent larger; and the derivatives exposure of Australia's own banks has soared from $14 trillion in 2008 to $38 trillion now. Moreover, these TBTF banks have repeatedly been caught in criminal activity like drug-money laundering, terrorism financing, mortgage fraud, interest rate and exchange rate rigging, and more. The world must replace this disastrous, corrupt system now, before the next crash. We the undersigned therefore call on the House to do Australia's part, and legislate the following: 1) a full Glass-Steagall separation of Australia's banks to protect normal commercial banking and deposits from the wild speculation of today's TBTF banks; 2) a national bank modelled on the original Commonwealth Bank to create massive new credits to revive our manufacturing, agricultural and other productive industries; 3) a program of major water, power and transportation infrastructure projects, in Australia and in our region, cooperating with China's ""One Belt, One Road"" program-in which 100 nations are already participating-to spur global economic recovery and provide for an enduring peace. from 3,803 citizens Social Media More than 50% of children under the age of 15 are sitting in their households, unsupervised by an adult, on social media platforms. This is a substantial issue being taken place in almost every household throughout Australia. Young children could be facing major cyber bullying without their parents knowing. Some forms of social media include: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and Whatsapp. Young children could be getting forced or bullied into doing horrible things and they might not know what to do at that stage of time. Their mind would not be mature enough to cope with it. Based on a study at the Oxford University, 25% of children are not capable of dealing with issues on social media under the age of 15. They could be physically or mentally hurt by people on social media platforms who interact with them online. Children must be appropriate age and be mature enough before they are allowed to use social media websites on their own. We, therefore, ask the House to: Change the limit of the age from when children are allowed to use social media. We request you to change the age limit from 13+, to 15+ to allow more time for the children to fully mature and learn the correct use of social media. Based on facts and evidence we believe the minimum age for social media is 15. from 24 citizens Gender Pay Gap This petition of young student citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the House: The pay gap between genders when working the same job across all fields. We understand that this problem does not occur across jobs supported by the government but jobs of smaller businesses. The gender pay gap is influenced by a number of factors, including: discrimination and bias in hiring and pay decision, women and men working in different industries and different jobs and with female-dominated industries and jobs attracting lower wages. Among full-time workers, women earn 84% of a man's pay on average, resulting in a full-time gender pay gap of 16% . But this is an increased effort as twenty years ago, the full-time gender pay gap was 17%. Research shows a male barrister gets an average income of",23,Committees
4,Mrs Wicks (Robertson) (10:05,"I present the following petitions:$168,766 whereas women earn an average of $59,436 for the same job. This is a difference of $109,330. We therefore ask the House to: Address this issue by creating a new law seeing women and men paid the same across all fields of work. This will eliminate a wage difference between men and women. We ask that if working at the same: experience, quality and for the same hours that they be paid equally. We feel that this is to your utmost importance and would help to stop gender discrimination across Australia. from 34 citizens Climate Change This petition of concerned people of the electorate of Boothby, draws to the attention of the House the severe and urgent threat that climate change poses to the health, well-being and security of all people around the world, particularly our poorest and most vulnerable neighbours. We remind the House that Australia's greenhouse emissions are the highest per person among wealthy nations while our emissions reduction targets are among the weakest. We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to protect communities in Australia and our region from the harmful impacts of climate change – such as more severe heat, extreme and unpredictable weather and rising seas – by: committing to deeper and more urgent reductions of our greenhouse emissions; developing a plan to ensure Australia achieves zero net greenhouse emissions well before 2050, and supporting families and communities affected by the transition towards renewable energy and more sustainable land use; providing additional assistance to help our poorest neighbours adapt to the harmful impacts of climate change. from 206 citizens Asylum Seekers This petition of Ringwood Uniting Church members and concerned citizens, draws to the attention of the House: Our concern about the welfare of Asylum Seekers in the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation centre (MITA}. We are aware that certain items are not allowed into the MITA as listed on the Department of Immigration and Border control website https://www.border.gov.au/Busi/Comp/lmmigrationdetention/visiting-a-facility/items-not-permitted-inimmigration-detention However, on a number of occasions visiting detainees, items such as flowers for a birthday, commercially packaged Easter eggs or other forms of celebratory packaged food (which are allowed under the terms with permission} and personal gifts such as books, that pose no danger to the detainee or the MITA, have been denied entry. These items provide a way of showing dignity and compassion to people in detention and form part of acknowledging the personal value of each individual. It is uncertain why these items that nourish a detainee's pleasure for living would be denied or considered contraband. We are further aware that upon a visit, detainees are not allowed bac� to the visitor's room after leaving for a toilet break. This measure denies the basic needs of a human being and punishes them for the natural functions of the body. We the undersigned therefore ask the House to: Conduct an urgent review of the gift policy for the MIT A in line with the stated 'permitted items' from visitors. We further ask the House to investigate the reasons for why a toilet break for detainees prevents them from re-uniting with their visitor. from 237 citizens Gambling This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Gambling operators are permitting betting on the outcome of lotteries, with these synthetic lottery operators making no contribution to State lotteries taxes. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 so as to ban betting on the outcome of lotteries and thereby prohibit the operation of synthetic lotteries in Australia. from 65 citizens Gambling This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Gambling operators are permitting betting on the outcome of lotteries, with these synthetic lottery operators making no contribution to State lotteries taxes. We therefore ask the House to: Amend the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 so as to ban betting on the outcome of lotteries and thereby prohibit the operation of synthetic lotteries in Australia. from 97 citizens Gambling This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: Gambling operators are permitting betting on the outcome of lotteries, with these synthetic lottery operators making no contribution to State lotteries taxes.

We therefore ask the House to: Amend the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 so as to ban betting on the outcome of lotteries and thereby prohibit the operation of synthetic lotteries in Australia. from 260 citizens.

The human mind will be more developed and be able to produce wiser decisions about smoking and how it will affect their future. Australia may be at a high risk of losing population of young citizens due to young people under the age of 18. Every 28 minutes in Australia, one young person dies from smoking and every week one youth citizen of Australia dies from the same cause. This calculated up to at 52 young Australian citizens dying from smoking each year. The young adults (18 years old) are getting depressed over getting separated from family and friends. As a result they can get stressed and even more addicted. We therefore ask the House to: Change the age limit of smoking and buying cigarettes from the age of 18 to 21. When they are 21, they will be more mature and make well informed decisions about smoking. At the age of 18 their life is in danger to die, thus Australia's population will be decreasing slowly just because of smoking and second hand smoke. The lives of the young citizens of Australia, rest in your hands. from 34 citizens Public Infrastructure Investment Extending the jurisdiction of the ACT government to represent South East/West and Tablelands (NSW). For a long time Regional/rural NSW has been neglected by the NSW Government with very little investment in public infrastructure, jobs and education, especially the Southern East and Tablelands. There needs to be a change as people who live there deserve more from their government. The borders of the ACT should be greatly expanded to include the area (draw a line linking) from Batemans Bay, to Goulburn, to Young, then to Wentworth. The area within to the border with Victoria would belong to the ACT. The NSW government has done nothing to improve the lives of those living in the Southern Tablelands, maybe it is time for the Regional Capital (Canberra) to represent the people of South East/West and Tablelands! Regional NSW deserve much more from their government. from one citizen Toxins in Perfumes This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that too many people are being forced out of workplaces due to the unregulated, unnecessary toxins in perfumes, colognes, deodorants and other scented, or de-scented products designed to disguise human odours. The need to wear breathing apparatus has increased dramatically, as has True Allergies to petroleum-based substances. 38% of the population is debilitated when in contact with second-hand fumes of petroleumbased substances, such as Propylene Glycol, in personal hygiene products, which are also a known carcinogen. People cannot speak, at workplaces, wearing facial masks and be heard clearly! We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister and the Attorney General place a ban on the sale and production of Propylene Glycol and other petroleum-based substances in personal products, that can be worn into workplaces and cause fumes to accumulate in hazard quantities, as well as a ban on the use of petroleum-based cleaning products in closed workspaces that do not supply adequate breathing apparatus, or give notice that such apparatus should be used. from 17 citizens Medications The Australian government intends to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, in 2017. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has stated: "" … forced administration of neuroleptics and other mind-altering drugs is a form of torture."" The Human Rights Committee found ""psychiatric experiments and forced injection of tranquilizers … to constitute inhuman treatment."" Patients and witnesses confirm this. Adverse effects of (misnamed) ""antidepressants"" and ""antipsychotics,"" imprudently prescribed, include akinesia, metabolic, serotonin and neuroleptic malignant syndromes, dyskinesia, death, substance/medicationinduced disorders mimicking mental illnesses, brain shrinkage, akathisia, inner tension, torment or torture, feeling of impending doom, restlessness with worsening depression, toxic hallucinations, suicide, aggression, and homicide. Genetically compromised metabolizers who experience adverse drug reactions receive forced injections. Prescribers are educated by ghostwritten guidelines to prescribe multiple drugs in large doses when their makers cannot promote them legally because safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Federal government's $73,000,000 proposal ""to support the mental health of Australian children"" further enmeshes Mental Health services/drug treatment with education, undermining the right to give or withhold informed consent. We ask for:moratorium on the proposal: Policymakers consider forwarded information from Principal Petitioner: An Inquiry with Royal Commission powers into forced medication, informed consent, prescribing practices, medications' adverse impacts: Establishment of psychiatric drug detox/rehabilitation facilities: Revision of Mental Health policy and practice to abate harm, acknowledge UN findings regarding involuntary treatment and meet obligations under International Treaties UNCRPD, UNCAT, UNICCPR. from 181 citizens Communities Funding On behalf of the NRRT Association and Tweed Shire CouncilI am petitioning the house to convince the Federal Government to match the $6.5 million in NSW Government funding for the first Tweed Shire section of the Northern Rivers Rail Trail. This project will see an increase in regional jobs centred around services and tourism, conserve a public asset, help create better connected communities around an active transport network, and help increase forest cover, wildlife links, biodiversity and remove atmospheric carbon with the fast growing indigenous rainforest species we have in the Northern Rivers. We ask that the House commend to the Government that it matches the NSW contribution to this highly worthwhile project in order to see the first section built. from 154 citizens Kokoda Campaign On January 22 1943 Australian troops with only the aid of New Guinea natives and no military combatants from other countries, achieved the final victory of the six month long Kokoda Campaign. Australian soldiers both black and white fought side by side in the defence of Australia from foreign invasion. It was a monumental event in Australian history which is not properly recognised or celebrated. We already celebrate a National Day when the British sent Australian troops to the slaughterhouse of Gallipoli, so why not also celebrate our greatest victory. It is a day that all Australians, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal can proudly celebrate together as a day of unity and nationhood. It is therefore requested that the House declare January 22 of each year as a National Day, in recognition of the final victory achieved on Kokoda on January 22 1943 from 37 citizens Australian Constitution The Australian Constitution is a sterile document that says nothing about who we are as a people and a culture or our common values. There is no statement of basic principles that bind us together. Two principles are required. First, citizen equality within a plural society with parliamentary democracy under the rule of law and second, prior Aboriginal sovereignty, A statement on citizen equality would obviate the need for a Bill of Rights, because all human rights flow from citizen equality. Acknowledgement of prior sovereignty would finally bury the rancid corpse of Terra Nullius. It would then also allow a process of agreement making with our First People and truth-telling in our history as called for in the Uluru Statement. The House is therefore requested to propose a Bill to the Parliament that a referendum be held to out the following two questions: 1. Should the Australian Constitution be amended to state that Australia is a plural democratic society in which all citizens are equal and remain equal subject to the Rule of Law, and that all provisions in the Constitution should be consistent with these four interrelated elements of citizen equality, social pluralism, parliamentary democracy and the rule of law? 2. Should the Australian Constitution be amended to recognise the prior sovereignty of Australia's First People, commit to an ongoing process of truth-telling in our history and agreement making with them, and to the continued sharing of our rich Aboriginal cultural heritage as an integral part of our national identity? from 44 citizens Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Alpha -1 antitrypsin deficiency (Alpha-1) is a hereditary condition that can lead to early onset emphysema & liver disease. Emphysema in an Alpha -1 patient can begin as early as in their 20s. A cure for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency remains elusive but there is a treatment option for the associated lung disease. Currently, therapeutic augmentation through intravenous transfusion of Alpha-1 PI (protease inhibitor) is the only available treatment for Alpha-1 lung disease. The US has made augmentation therapy available to patients for over 30 years. Canada and a number of EU Countries alongside the US offer patients Alpha-1 Protease Inhibitor augmentation and they typically experience significant reductions in the rate of decline of lung function towards normal. The long-term quality of life and the lifespan of those with lung disease is improved. In Australia organ transplant intervention is currently the only chance of survival for many. The TGA has recently added two plasma products to the Register for patients in Australia treatment is now tantalisingly close. Alpha-1 antitrypsin patients, families and carers request that the House will with minimal delay approve funding and make this treatment available through the National Blood Authority. We ask you to act in our interests because, as with other sufferers of orphan diseases we are a small group and our treatment needs are currently not being met in Australia002E from 490 citizens Privacy So many countries have given people the right to know if a sex offender is living on their street, while in Australia they're hiding behind the Privacy Act. We want to see if there is a pedophile living on the street that some children, often alone, walk to school. The victims/survivor's never got any privacy so the offender shouldn't just because they're scared. There's such a thing as re-offending, and children live everywhere. We want to know if we need to take that extra step in protecting our families. So therefore, we ask that you approve and provide addresses of known sex offenders to the public eye. from 16 citizens Customs Regulations The Sport of Airsoft is enjoyed worldwide with limited regulatory restrictions. The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 controls importation of Airsoft (soft air) devices to Australia. The Regulations require only the Police Certification Test to be satisfied to import paintball markers or imitation firearms. However, the Regulations impose stricter, disproportionate, non-evidence based controls (i.e. official purposes / specified person test, etc.) on Airsoft devices, based on their appearance, even though they are no more 'real' looking than imitation firearms. Furthermore, Airsoft devices shoot plastic pellets that hurt a lot less than paintballs, having an average kinetic energy of ten times lower. However, the Regulations impose stricter controls on fully automatic firing Airsoft devices, in comparison to paintball markers capable of producing more damage. The Regulations also require Airsoft devices to satisfy Safety Tests. The tests are aimed at preventing accidental discharge of firearms causing serious injury. The tests are disproportionate to be applied to Airsoft devices based on the flimsy materials of construction, limited energy of an Airsoft pellet, and the higher forces created by the test than the energy of a shooting Airsoft pellet. Amendment of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 as follows: Importation of Airsoft devices of any appearance should only require the Police Certification Test to be satisfied; Importation of Airsoft devices of fully automatic firing capability should only require the Police Certification Test to be satisfied; Airsoft devices of all types of propulsion should be exempt from the Safety Tests; Airsoft devices should be exempted from having a unique serial number. from 3,414 citizens Exports To ban the private exportation of Baby formula products overseas. I would like to see a legislation brought forward where it would make it illegal to send Via private parcel/courier/shipment of Baby formula products to any overseas countries from Australia. from 14 citizens Family Law Family court is an emotive issue that ties up courts for up to three years it impedes relationships with children from broken families, children often having to go long periods of time without contact with the other biological parent. Solicitors cost upwards of $350 per hour which is a cost many struggle with if the custodial parent is difficult. we therefore ask the house to introduce the following measures to ensure that time is adequately spent with BOTH biological parents during the time of family law conflict: A) That family resolution centres be presented with more power in the mediation process (so it stays in resolution centres without the need for court and solicitors.) That fines are imposed for people who repeatedly don't show, an agreement that defaults to 50/50 custody if failure to show, court should be avoided, and that any agreements that are made be legally enforceable. B) That mediation services remain a fixed price for all parties. One capped price. not dependant on income. C) That any allegations made after the separation be somewhat scrutinised. That police reports be made available to verify incidents. D) In the event of a breakdown of a relationship a ""show cause"" application to relocate more then 2 hours away apply prior to relocating, as recovery orders are often difficult to enforce, once children are settled at new location. E) child maintenance to have a stay order applied until custody is resolved to incentivise quick resolution. from 712 citizens Marriage Law Reform Despite the Commonwealth passing anti-discrimination laws for same-sex couples since 2008, these Acts do not provide the same protections, rights, entitlements as ""married"" couples. The legislative power to pass laws relating to domestic relationships, civil unions, de facto partnerships is vested only in the States, rather than the Commonwealth so non-marriage couples are subject to the laws governing civil unions, de facto partnerships, relationships of their respective State, so there will be inconsistencies from State to State, on a question of law, across Australia. The Commonwealth is only able to legislate on ""marriage"". The legislative powers under s.51 of the Constitution of Australia should include ""domestic relationships, civil unions, de facto partnerships"". Although the Australian Bureau of Statistics is conducting a survey on whether the law should change to allow same sex marriage, the result of the survey will not bind the Commonwealth Government to amend the definition of ""marriage"" under the Act, therefore couples in non-marriage relationships will not benefit at all from this survey, regardless of its outcome. Even if the definition of ""marriage"" under the Marriage Act is amended to allow same sex marriage, it will still not provide for domestic relationships, civil unions, de facto partnerships. We therefore ask the House to pass a referendum bill to amend s.51 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act to include, in the Legislative Powers of the Parliament, a sub-section for, ""domestic relationships, civil unions, de facto partnerships"". from three citizens Suicide Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged 15 to 44 and has been described as a global epidemic by various international organisations. Despite the Government's efforts in addressing this issue through the National Suicide Prevention Strategy, Australian citizens suffering from mental health issues are entitled to less support through Medicare than they were five years ago. The current limit of 10 individual allied mental health services per year is not enough to treat most mental illnesses and puts many Australians at risk while discouraging others from seeking help early on. The requirement for a patient to have a severe mental health condition before receiving substantial assistance (under Item 319) is a reactive approach that costs Australia more than it would to provide greater mental health support from the beginning. We therefore ask the House to illustrate Australia's commitment to supporting its citizens' mental health by increasing the number of individual allied mental health services to the previous 18 session maximum with discretion for this to be further increased depending on the patient's needs. from 81 citizens Disability Support Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients on partnered payment rates are financially penalised due to relationship status being married/defacto despite unique health, pharmaceutical and mobility needs. Welfare reports and news articles demonstrate how DSP recipients are forced to skip/stop: medications, professional medical engagement, dental care, meals, social inclusion; utilities (water, gas, electricity); and accept homelessness as normal. Equitable parity in relationship context amongst those with disability is essential for their household to function harmoniously without disadvantage compared to single DSP recipients. Government has conveniently taken the Biblical belief that 'two can live more frugally than one' however, those with disability, impaired mobility, chronic health or mental health issues require welfare support to reduce societal burden. DSP partnered relationships incur debt through desperation from bank or predatory loans, family, friends and advanced payments cycles that increases duress. Such debts are contrary to the Commonwealth Consolidated Acts, SOCIAL SECURITY (ADMINISTRATION) ACT 1999 SECT 60, Protection of social security payment, (1) A social security payment is absolutely inalienable, whether by way of, or in consequence of, sale, assignment, charge, execution, bankruptcy or otherwise. Financial discrimination must stop. DSP recipients fully remunerated. That ""Partnered Rate"" is raised equal to the Single Rate of Disability Support Pension payment. The terms ""Partnered "" and ""Single"" Rates of DSP be discontinued. That DSP recipients are not discriminated against financially based on relationship or co-habitation status. That DSP recipients affected in the past, current and future by this ""Partnered Rate"" discrimination be full remunerated. from 16 citizens Medical Care People impacted by disease/injury from workplace incident, motor vehicle accident, public liability, genetic disorders, birth defect, degenerative or slow onset disease receive a diverse range of medical interventions and outcomes through no fault of their own. These patients receive inadequate work-up when symptoms exceed a doctor's ten-point diagnostic criteria defaulting to psychosomatic disorders of the WHO, ICD rubrics. Subsequently, the patient's condition deteriorates into chronic complex disease, permanent disablement with inflated costs to tax payers. Often on low incomes with negligible financial resources, these debts balloon within months of injury/disease onset from delayed medical diagnostic criteria sabotaging critical diagnostic work-up and treatment. Once financial resources are gone, family/friends are sought to support diagnoses/treatments inducing relationships duress from unrealistic reimbursement promises upon recovery. Hence, deterioration, debts, relationship decay, homelessness and social exclusion increases. Affected individuals have absolute inalienable right to medical diagnostics, mobility aids and financial remuneration to navigate disease and permanent disablement. That all diseases/symptoms are given full patient work-up, not defaulting to psychosomatic WHO, ICD rubrics. That diagnostic procedures, subsequent treatments for all conditions that may result in disablement are prompt, without cost to patient or their family. That people whom are permanently disabled from whatever circumstances who are forced to live on a social wage such as Disability Support Pension have an absolutely inalienable right to equally supportive medical, mobility aids and financial remuneration as those who access TAC, WorkCover, Public Liability and any other financial and medical compensatory interventions in Australia. from 10 citizens Health Disparity between diagnosis/treatment of co-morbid chronic diseases and associated disabilities compared to single human diseases results in diverse patient outcomes. Conditions of complex symptomatology known as ""medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS)"", individuals affected by Chemical Sensitivity, Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia Syndromes, a patient can waste decades seeking treatable diagnoses other than misdiagnosis and psychosomatic aetiologies leading to iatrogenic harm, advanced disease, premature death the longer a patient remains misdiagnosed inducing duress for families/friends resulting in debt and homelessness as relationships decay. Research indicates complex MUPS patients visit 12 medical doctors to achieve diagnosis yet fail to manage their conditions due to insufficient financial resource. Current diagnostic pathways for MUPS is inefficient, ineffective and detrimental for individuals. Chemically sensitive individuals viewed as MUPS are unable to access medical professionals due to symptom aggravation from fragrance, cleaning/hygiene products, plants, construction and finishing materials in medical practices and hospitals. Individuals suffering with MUPS be promptly diagnosed including aetiologies, excluding all psychosomatic components of differential diagnosis, that prolonged treatments be withheld until all symptoms are identified, accounted for and appropriately diagnosed to reduce contraindicated treatments for MUPS. That doctors, health care plans, allied health, pathology, imaging, are fully Medicare covered to maximise recovery. The Medicare Safety Net threshold be set to zero permanently for MUPS patients. That FRACGP are informed of peers/specialists regularly diagnosing and treating MUPS patients. That medical clinics be set to accommodate patients with MUPS to minimise chemical exposures throughout the patient's life. from nine citizens Sleep Apnoea Sleep apnea affects many individuals and especially exacerbates those with at least one disability. Besides Queensland, Disability Support Pension recipients have no access to funding for any CPAP machine and related equipment. Subsequently, most DSP recipients endure the symptoms of sleep apnea including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and find the price sufficient deterrent to not bother monitored testing and treatment. That all Disability Support Pension recipients have defined pathways at a Commonwealth level to access medically appropriate testing and funding for all sleep apnea equipment at no cost to themselves and that regardless of disabilities, all testing accommodates full medical and accessibility needs of each individual. from 20 citizens Media Classifications We want the National classification for Media and the Arts applied to school education programs like ""Safe Schools"". We want the content of the individual units of programs such as Safe School be schools introduced sexually explicit content they should be held to the same standards that we trust of our commercial communication suppliers and not be able to breach that trust without accountability to a national organisation or ombudsman. Further the Education system regardless of which state must be held accountable for the content they transmit to students to a standard that is trusted by our Australian society-as whole. The National classification for Media and the Arts is such a system. We therefore ask the House to apply the viewer safety rating system of the The National classification for Media and the Arts to education program units in particular the ""Safe Schools"" program. We ask that any content deemed to be PG be only shown or administered when a parent is present. That ""M"" rated content is only delivered to students over 15 and that ""X "" rated content be delivered only to students over 18. We ask that this be a National system that individual education bodies must comply with and be accountable to a national regulator, complete with a system of penalties in place in order to regulate state and private educators to comply. from 352 citizens Insurance Premiums To the Hon. Speaker of the House of Representatives and Members of the House of Representatives, Property owners and Residents of the Pilbara in Northern Australia, seek urgent action from the Federal government to reduce the Insurance Premiums available for Home& Contents insurance and Landlord insurance. We believe the findings of the Northern Australia Insurance Premiums Taskforce did not correctly reflect the impact of the high insurance premiums being offered to Pilbara property owners and residents, or did the findings justify the high insurance price hikes that are still affecting policy holders and the Pilbara area does not have a high claim rate. Some insurance premiums now are higher than home loan repayments paid each month, with a quote of $19,000 received for a fibro 3 x 1 rental. We are being unfairly treated as Australian citizens and believe that insurance premiums could be charged at an affordable capped rate for properties that are built and have met the Australian building codes and regulations required for cyclone regions. Your petitioner's citizens of Australia therefore respectfully request that the House of Representatives urgently cap insurance premiums to an affordable amount and consider base premiums are offered upon building standards met. Request that an insurance watchdog is formed to watch over the insurance industry and their practices of offering unjustifiable insurance premiums and unexplained price hikes to regional areas. Request that the Pilbara Region be separated from other RegionC areas that are not built to sustain cyclonic weather. from 96 citizens Child Support The child support agency is based on legislation that is somewhat complex, it applies differently in each circumstance and variable on peoples incomes this leads to people conducting business that is non compliant and subsequently leads to conflict. Family court recognises that child support and custody are not matters that are related however restriction of access increases payments to the custodial parent. The signees of this petition request that child support becomes a fixed amount yearly with the amount to be contributed equally by both parents, that the contribution is not variable amounts based on income, that child support be paid onto a basics card with online portal to view spending. we request all children have the same ""worth"" so as not to disadvantage lower socioeconomic groups. we ask for the government to consider changing the bracket for how much per dollar is lost for Family tax benefit so that child support does not exceed this amount. we request that overtime and second jobs be excluded from assessments. we also ask that the nights of care percentage be inclusive of days and weeks, reducing assessment on the basis of actual care by the daily rate for days and weeks in the non custodial care. four weeks of care should result in a reduction of the annual amount by four weeks and That capacity to earn not apply in any circumstance as securing full time employment in current job market is difficult. from 651 citizens Medical Services To Hon. Speaker of the House of Representatives and Members of the House of Representatives, It has come to our attention that the Federal Government is not fairly funding enough WA medical services such as MRI services per km and capita as it does on the eastern side of Australia. This is grossly unfair to residents in regional Western Australia who are already isolated from affordable medical services. A MRI is a type of Medical service that could save lives and should be taken seriously and supported. At present there is no MRI services available north of Geraldton, up and across to Darwin, or inland to Alice Springs a massive area of Australia that has been left under resourced. Global Diagnostics, medical service provider of a mobile MRI scanner in Port Hedland had to shut their doors after 4 months as they were denied an approved Medicare subsidy under the Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme. Local residents wanting to use their $800 services could not claim a Medicare subsidy. Public patients from Hedland hospital get sent to Perth through the State Government's PATS service to have an MRI scan carried out in Perth, some 1800kms away spending unnecessary costs on flights. Certain citizens of Australia request the House of Representatives to support the urgent increase of Medicare funded medical services available to Pilbara residents, and approve for a Global Diagnostics mobile MRI scanner to be granted Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme status, save unnecessary costs and give urgent imagery to patients. from 28 citizens Palfreeman, Mr Jock For the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs the Hon.

Julie Bishop MP, to act and represent Jock Palfreeman. He has been imprisoned since 2008 from 363 citizens Shipping Suggesting that the House act to ban the shipping of baby formula and other items of necessity to overseas addresses We therefore ask for the House to act to ban the shipping of baby formula and other items of necessity to overseas addresses from 435 citizens Petitions received. Responses petitions previously presented: Parliamentary Expenditure Dear Mr Vasta, Thank you for your correspondence concerning petition EN0103. Australians are entitled to expect parliamentarians spend taxpayers' money wisely, appropriately and accountably. That is why the Turnbull Government is undertaking the most comprehensive reforms to federal parliamentarians' work expenses in a generation, In February 2017, new laws were passed requiring parliamentarians to pay back any work expense claims they receive that were found to be outside the rules. Any amount paid by the Commonwealth that breaches the rules is now a debt owed to the Commonwealth by the parliamentarian. Where an amount is payable by a parliamentarian as a debt to the Commonwealth, the outstanding amount may be recovered from the parliamentarian by action in a court, or deducted from future work expenses that a parliamentarian is eligible to receive (for example a future travelling allowance claim). If the debt relates to a prescribed travel benefit, in most cases, a 25 per cent penalty may be applied to the amount that is recoverable from the parliamentarian. Once the Parliamentary Business Resources Framework is established, the 25 per cent penalty will extend to all work expenses. On3 April 2017, the Government established the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (IPEA) that has compliance, reporting and auditing responsibilities for parliamentarians' expenses. The independent authority will monitor and adjudicate expense claims by all parliamentarians to ensure taxpayers' funds are being spent appropriately. Parliamentarians' expenses will also be publicly reported more frequently to create a more transparent system. I trust that this information will be of assistance in your consideration of this matter. Yours sincerely from the Special Minister of State, Senator Ryan",24,Petitions
5,Mrs Wicks (Robertson) (10:05,"I present the following ministerial responses toIslam Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter of 16 August 2017 regarding Petition EN0185 on the situation of ethnic, indigenous and religious minorities in the Middle East. Australia is committed to the protection and promotion of human rights for all persons, including religious and ethnic minorities, regardless of their location around the world. All individuals are entitled to respect, dignity and protection from discrimination and violence. The Australian Government deplores the horrific persecution of minority groups at the hands of ISIL, including Christians, Yazidis, Shi'a Muslims and others. We are a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIL, making a significant military contribution and working to counter ISIL financing, flow of foreign fighters and its pernicious ideology. We have committed over $613 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria and Iraq crises since 2011. Since 2015, Australia has welcomed 12,000 Syrian and Iraqi refugees, over and above our usual humanitarian intake, with priority going to the most vulnerable. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) prepares reports on the underlying conditions that are used by decision-makers in protection status determinations. These reports are available on DFAT's website (www.dfat.gov.au). DFAT made a significant contribution to the parliamentary inquiry into the Status of the Human Right to Freedom of Religion or Belief. The submission may include information of interest, and can he read here: http://www.aph.gov.au/ Parliamentary Business/ Committees / Joint/ Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/ FreedomofReligion (Submission 333). Yours sincerely from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop Australian Citizenship Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your correspondence of 16 August 2017 enclosing Petition ENO 224 concerning the Australian Government's reforms to strengthen the requirements for Australian citizenship. The package of reforms announced by the Prime Minister on 20 April 2017 is the Australian Government's response to the National Consultation on Citizenship, which indicated strong support for strengthening the requirements for Australian citizenship. The package of reforms includes: increasing the general residence requirement introducing an English language test strengthening the Australian values statement strengthening the test for Australian citizenship introducing a requirement for applicants to demonstrate their integration into the Australian community, and strengthening the pledge. I note the petitioners' concerns about the reforms, particularly increasing the general residence requirement and that the reforms will impact all applications received on or after 20 April 2017. The date of commencement was informed by experiences of previous governments announcing reforms to programmes in the portfolio including the citizenship programme. When new policy is announced this can result in significant increases in the number of applications, and consequential delays in the processing of these applications. Applicants will need to be a permanent resident in Australia for a period of four years immediately prior to their application for citizenship, during which time applicants may be absent from Australia for no more than 12 months in total. This requirement is a key component of the reforms to strengthen integrity in the citizenship programme, and to increase public confidence in the programme. The Australian public expects aspiring citizens to commit to Australia and Australian values, and the Government has determined that four years is an appropriate period over which to measure this commitment. Further information on Australian citizenship, including details on the reforms, can be found at: http.//www.bordergov.au/Trav/Citi. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Mr Dutton Climate Change Dear Mrs WicksI refer to your letter of 16 August 2017 to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, the Hon Steven Ciobo MP, regarding a petition calling for Australia to consider trade sanctions on the United States following the US announcement on withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change (petition number EN0254). As the matter falls within my portfolio responsibility, your letter has been passed to me for reply. The Australian Government is committed to the Paris Agreement and to tackling t he global challenge of climate change. The United States remains a Party to the Agreement until it withdraws formally, which at the earliest could occur in November 2020. The United States has said it will continue to participate in Paris Agreement Negotiations while it is a Party, which we welcome. Australia will work through the Paris Agreement and with all countries, including the United States, to find economically sound solutions to transition to a lower emissions global economy. Sanctions, as defined in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010, are imposed in situations of international concern', including `the grave repression of the human rights or democratic freedoms of a population by a government, or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery, or internal or international armed conflict.' Sanctions are not appropriate in this case. I trust this information is of assistance. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop Welfare Reform Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter of 16 August 2017 regarding petition number EN0256 and the drug testing trial announced in the 2016-17 Budget. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention. It is not in line with community expectations that someone receiving taxpayer-funded welfare payments is using that money to buy illicit substances. This directly impacts on their ability to find and maintain sustainable work and become self-reliant. The Government has announced a suite of measures to prevent welfare payments being used to fund drug and alcohol addictions and help people to overcome their substance abuse issues and increase their chances of gaining employment. As part of this suite of measures, the Government will trial a new approach to identifying job seekers with drug abuse issues and facilitating their referral to appropriate treatment. From1 January 2018, 5,000 new recipients of Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) in the Local Government Areas of Canterbury-Bankstown in New South Wales, Logan in Queensland and Mandurah in Western Australia will be selected for random drug testing. These locations have been selected based on careful consideration of data available on drug usage, crime and health statistics, income support utilisation and the availability of appropriate treatment and supports for drug abuse. Job seekers who test positive will be placed on Income Management to help them to manage their finances and limit their ability to use their welfare payments to fund further drug use. Income Management includes assessment of an individual's priority needs (such as rent and utilities) and the establishment of automatic payment deductions to meet these expenses. The specific measure of Income Management used for the drug testing trial will be based on the Supporting People at Risk measure of Income Management. This measure is designed to support at risk individuals on a case by case basis. This form of Income Management is particularly suitable in relation to the drug testing trial which is designed to support individuals with drug abuse issues to overcome their barriers to work. These job seekers will also be required to undergo further drug testing. Those who test positive to a subsequent test will be referred to a medical professional who will assess their particular circumstances and identify appropriate treatment options. If this assessment recommends treatment, the job seeker would be required to have this included as an activity in their Job Plan. This recognises that job seekers who have been identified as having drug-related barriers to work should be taking steps to address those barriers through appropriate treatment. Participation in recommended drug treatment will also help. either in part or wholly, to meet a job seeker's mutual obligation requirements. Treatment could include, but is not limited to: further assessment services, support and case management, counselling, information and education programs, detoxification or withdrawal management, non-residential or residential care or rehabilitation or pharmacotherapy. This model of drug testing welfare recipients and assisting them to access appropriate treatment is unique compared to what has been conducted anywhere else. Many of the drug testing programs in the US for example, have a different central purpose whereby all of the 14 states with drug testing remove benefits from people who test positive. This is not what we are trialling here. No one gets cut off by a positive test under our system. The trial is underpinned by two fundamental principles: if you mandate treatment, tailored to individual people's needs, it will improve employment outcomes; and if you limit the amount of cash available to someone with a drug abuse problem, it will reduce their ability to underwrite their illicit drug use. The data and evidence shows that this approach of not waiting until people get themselves motivated to seek treatment works, with recent evaluations of drug court mandated treatment in Australia showing a reduction in recidivism and better employment outcomes for participants. The Government will also be committing up to $10 million for a dedicated treatment fund to provide support to job seekers in the trial where existing state and Commonwealth funded services are not able to meet any increased demand as a result of the trial. The details of the treatment fund will be determined in consultation with Primary Health Networks and the drug and alcohol service providers in the trial locations before the trial starts in 2018. The trial will be subject to a comprehensive evaluation to build an evidence base regarding the effectiveness of this kind of intervention in the Australian welfare system. This approach will capture any possible unintended consequences in real time, allowing them to be handled promptly. This measure is designed to help people overcome their substance abuse issues and improve their lives. This trial is not about penalising job seekers who are drug dependent, it is about ensuring taxpayers' money isn't being used to fund illicit lifestyles and testing new ways of helping people with substance abuse issues to overcome them and re-enter the workforce. Supporting job seekers to overcome their substance abuse will improve their chances of finding a job and reduce the risk of ongoing welfare dependency. This will benefit job seekers and the broader community. Thank you again for bringing this petition and the concerns it raises to my attention. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Social Services, Mr Porter Member Interests Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter of 16 August 2017 requesting a response to petition EN0261 relating to the Register of Members' Interests. The requirements in relation to the Register of Members' Interests are set out in a resolution of the House, as amended from time to time (first adopted 9 October 1984 am). The Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests has a role in relation to oversight of the Register and in considering certain proposals in relation to it (SO 216). Given this role I have sought, and received, advice from the committee in relation to the requests contained in the petition. In relation to the request for members to declare whether any investment property held (by them and their spouses) is negatively geared the committee notes that the resolution of the House requires members to declare all real property held and the purpose for which it is owned, whether for personal use or investment purposes (paragraph 2(c)). The resolution requires also that members register all assets and liabilities of their own and of their immediate family members, and further requires members to include any interest which, in the opinion of the individual member, holds the potential for a real or apparent conflict of interest with a member's public duties to arise (paragraph 2(n)).The committee does not support a change in the requirements such as to require an express declaration in relation to negative gearing. In relation to the request for members to declare if they (or their spouses) are guarantor for a mortgage for a family member, paragraph 2(f) requires that a member's statement of interests must include 'liabilities indicating the nature of the liability and the creditor concerned'. The committee has determined that paragraph 2(f) includes all liabilities, for example, mortgages. Given the specific terms of paragraph 2, that a member 'shall include the registrable interests of which the Member is aware (1) of the Member's spouse and (2) of any children who are wholly or mainly dependent on the Member for support', a member's immediate family is already captured by existing requirements. The committee considers it is not necessary to amend the resolution as this proposal is already covered in existing provisions. I trust this information will be of assistance to you. Yours sincerely from the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Smith Parliament House: Procedures Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter of 11 September 2017. requesting a response to petition EN0272 relating to the removal of the daily prayer from Parliament's procedures. The requirement for a prayer to commence proceedings, and the exact form of the words used, are set out in standing orders and therefore open to amendment by the House if it wishes. The issue of commencement with prayers has been examined on a number of occasions and changes have not been supported, perhaps reflecting the tendency of Parliaments to be traditional institutions. The form of prayers has not changed since 1901 except for some additional words that were introduced in 1918 for the duration of the rest of the war. In 2010 the House agreed to add an acknowledgement of country at the start of sitting days, but did not change the form of the prayer. Ultimately, as you know, responsibility for the operations of the House rests with the Members themselves, and any changes to the standing orders can only be approved with the support of a majority of Members. Yours sincerely from the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Smith Parliamentary Terms Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter dated 11 September 2017, referring a petition (EN0274) submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding parliamentary terms. I am responding as the Minister responsible for electoral matters. The petition requests a referendum be held to extend the current term of the Federal Parliament to a fixed four year cycle which is in line with most Australian State, Territory and local council elections. Historically, changes to Australia's electoral system have occurred in response to the recommendations of bi-partisan inquiries by JSCEM. The Australian Government is committed to improving electoral processes wherever possible. As you are aware any change to parliamentary terms requires a referendum, that if held requires a 'yes' vote from a majority of voters nationally and a majority of °yes' votes in a majority of states to succeed. In 188 this matter was tested with the Australian people. The referendum was defeated with less than a third of the population voting in favour and no states voting in favour. In my personal view, longer parliamentary terms will not necessarily give the Australian people better Government. There is always a risk that governments would be locked into longer terms than they should. Current arrangements maintain pressure on parliamentarians to perform at a high level and constantly explain the policies they are implementing and generate consent and support for them. Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention. Yours sincerely from the Special Minister of State, Senator Ryan Family Law Reform Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter dated 11 September 2017, in relation to petition number EN0306. The petitioners request that the Family Law Act 1975 be amended to support the immediate removal of children from a parent known or alleged to be committing family violence, or preventing a child from having a meaningful relationship with another parent or sibling. The Australian Government is committed to taking action to prevent family violence and abuse. and to improve the protections offered through the family law system to those affected by violence and abuse. Effectively responding to family violence and child abuse is a responsibility shared by federal, state and territory governments. The states and territories have responsibility for investigating and responding to child protection issues, as well as for the majority of laws relating to family violence. The Australian Government acknowledges that the separation of the federal family law and state and territory child protection and family violence systems can place children and families at increased risk of harm. On 27 September 2017, 1 commissioned the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to conduct the first comprehensive review of the family law system since it came into operation on 1 July 1976 and released its terms of reference. The review will be conducted with a view to making necessary reforms to ensure the family law system meets the contemporary needs of families and effectively addresses family violence and child abuse. The ALRC will conduct consultations with stakeholders over the course of its review, and I would encourage the petitioners to make submissions to the ALRC about their experiences. A copy of the media release, including the terms of reference, can be found at https://www.attorney_general.gov.aulMediareleases/Pages/2017/ThirdOuarter/First-cornprehensivereview-of-the-family-law-act-27-September-2017.aspx The Family Law Act establishes the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration in parenting disputes. To reinforce this principle, the Act focuses on the rights of children and the responsibilities that each parent has towards their children, rather than on parental rights. In 2006, the Howard Government introduced significant reforms to the Act which reinforced that the best interests of children arc to be the priority in family law matters. The reforms also placed an increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility after separation, where possible, and ensuring that children live in an environment where they are safe from violence or abuse. In particular, a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility was included in the Act to ensure that, in the absence of factors such as violence or abuse, children can enjoy a meaningful relationship with each of their parents, and are protected from harm. In 2012, the Family Law Act was amended to further prioritise the safety of children in parenting matters by giving greater weight to the protection from harm when determining what is in a child's best interests. These amendments included changed definitions of family violence and abuse, to reflect a contemporary understanding of what family violence and abuse is, including physical and emotional abuse and the exposure of children to family violence. The Family Violence Best Practice Principles, developed by the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, apply in all cases involving family violence or child abuse (or the risk of either). The Best Practice Principles recognise: the harmful effects of family violence and abuse on victims the prominence given to the issue of family violence in the Family Law Act, and the principles guiding the case management of cases involving allegations of child abuse. The Best Practice Principles can be found at http://www.filmilvcourt.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/fcoaweb/reports-andpublications/publications/family+violence/fainily-violence-best-practice-principles. This year, I asked the house of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs to conduct an inquiry into a better family law system to support and protect those affected by family violence. The Committee adopted the inquiry on 16 March 2017. The inquiry will make recommendations about how the system might be improved. More information, including the inquiry's terms of reference, can be found at www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary Business/Committees/House/Social_Policy_and_Legal_Affairs/FVlawreform. In the 2017-18 Budget, the Australian Government announced an additional $10.7 million for the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia and the Family Court of Western Australia to engage more family consultants. Family consultants are qualified social workers and psychologists who specialise in child and family issues after separation or divorce. This will give courts greater access to independent assessments of: family issues, including the best interests of children. This new funding also includes $180 000 to improve the training available to family consultants. The training will focus on equipping family consultants to provide sound independent assessments to assist the family courts, including about the dynamics and risks of family violence. As1 mentioned above, effectively responding to family violence and child abuse is a responsibility shared by federal, state and territory governments, and the Australian Government is working cooperatively with our state and territory level counterparts on these important issues. That is why, on 19 May 2017, the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council, in its support of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), established a family violence working group of justice officials to develop measures to improve the interaction between the federal family law, and state child protection and family violence systems. Topics for the family violence working group's consideration include: information sharing between the family law, family violence, and child protection systems risk identification and assessment in the justice system proposed amendments to the Family Law Act contained in the Exposure Draft of the Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2017 legislative and other protections for vulnerable witnesses in family law and family violence matters, and improving family violence competency for professionals working in the family law and family violence systems. The family violence working group is co-led by the Commonwealth and Victoria. On 28 October 2016, 1 announced the allocation of $30 million for legal assistance and family law services to support the Third Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022. Under the Third Action Plan, the Australian Government has allocated $18.5 million over three years to fund legal aid commissions in each state and territory to expand duty lawyer services in family law court registries, integrated with family violence support services. Through these Family Advocacy and Support Services, duty lawyers will provide expert legal assistance alongside family violence support workers delivering trauma-informed services to families. The integrated services will assist families moving between the Commonwealth family law, state child protection and state family violence systems. Additionally, a number of other initiatives are being progressed by this Government across the family law system, including: $12.7 million in the 2017-18 Budget to establish Parenting Management Hearings, to relieve the burden on family law courts by diverting less complex matters into a non-adversarial, less formal forum $15 million under the Women's Safety Package to support twelve specialist domestic violence units and five health justice partnerships, delivering wrap-around legal and social support services an additional $3.4 million in the 2017-18 Budget to expand the specialist domestic violence units pilot program $39 million over three years for community legal centres as part of the 2017-18 Budget, to be directed to front-line family law and family violence services. This additional funding will alleviate pressure across the legal assistance sector while directing Commonwealth funding to the highest priority issues the National Domestic and Family Violence Bench Book, a resource for judges in all Australian jurisdictions to improve understanding of family violence. This includes guidelines for court room management to minimise secondary abuse through court processes for those who have experienced family violence. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I hope that the petitioners find the information in this letter helpful. I encourage then to engage with the Australian Law Reform Commission in the conduct of its family law reference. Yours faithfully from the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis Asylum Seekers Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your correspondence of 15 August 2017 enclosing Petition PN0069, concerning the Australian Government's asylum seeker policies. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention. As a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (the Refugees Convention), Australia takes its international obligations seriously. Australia is committed to providing protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the Refugees Convention and other relevant international treaties to which Australia is a party. With the establishment of Operation Sovereign Borders on 18 September 2013, the Government has focused on disrupting and deterring people smugglers, detecting and intercepting illegal maritime arrivals (IMAs), and supporting regional processing and resettlement of refugees, as well as returns of those transferees not found to be owed protection. Anyone who comes to Australia illegally by boat will be subject to regional processing arrangements and will not be eligible for permanent residency in Australia. The Government's Operation Sovereign Borders policies are designed to safeguard vulnerable people from exploitation by people smugglers, prevent the loss of life at sea and restore the integrity of Australia's borders. Restoration of Australia's border integrity has enabled the Government to increase the annual refugee intake. As a result, the Humanitarian Programme has increased from 13,750 in 201617 to 16,250 in 2017-18 and will reach 18,750 in 2018-19. The 2018-19 Programme will represent the largest offshore humanitarian intake in more than 30 years. Focusing on persecuted minorities, Australia has also welcomed 12,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict zone. The ongoing success of these strong border control policies has enabled the closure of 17 immigration detention facilities. The application of regional processing arrangements has meant that, in some cases, family members arriving at different times or who are not defined as immediate family members may be subject to different arrangements and situated in different locations. The Government is committed to regional processing and regional resettlement and will not facilitate reunion of family members in Australia. It remains open to any regional processing country to permit reunion of family members. This is a matter for the regional processing country to decide and will not be determined by Australia. Where Australia's immigration detention population previously comprised mainly IMAs, the current profile indicates that visa over-stayers and those who have had their visas cancelled under the character test of section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 predominate. Of the last group, many have been found guilty of serious criminal offences. The Migration Act 1958 requires applicants to establish a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion in all areas of their home country. People who are found to be refugees must also satisfy health, character and security checks before they can be granted a visa. People who are found not to be refugees in Australia have been appropriately assessed to determine whether they engage Australia's protection obligations. Where an asylum seeker is found not to engage Australia's protection obligations and has exhausted all administrative and judicial avenues for appeal, they have no lawful basis for remaining in Australia and are therefore expected to depart. Those who do not depart voluntarily will be subject to removal from Australia. Removals occur only after all processing has been completed and do not occur where this would place Australia in breach of its international obligations relating to the return of non-citizens. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Mr Dutton Regional Processing Centres Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your correspondence of 15 August 2017 enclosing Petition PN0070, concerning the Australian Government's regional processing and settlement arrangements. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention. As a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (the Refugees Convention), Australia takes its international obligations seriously. Australia is committed to providing protection to refugees consistent with the obligations set out in the Refugees Convention and other relevant international treaties to which Australia is a party.

The 2018-19 Programme will represent Australia's largest offshore humanitarian intake in more than 30 years. Focusing on persecuted minorities, Australia has also welcomed 12,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict zone on top of this. The ongoing success of these strong border control policies has enabled the closure of 17 immigration detention facilities. The Governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea (PNG) continue to progress refugee status determinations for people transferred to those countries under the regional processing arrangements. Refugees in Nauru and PNG have various resettlement options: refugees in PNG may settle in PNG; refugees in Nauru may choose to stay in Nauru for up to 20 years or settle permanently in Cambodia; additionally, all refugees can express interest in resettlement in the United States (US). US authorities will apply their own rigorous assessment and vetting processes to decide which refugees are eligible for resettlement in the US, and how and when this will take place. Australia assists PNG, Nauru and Cambodia to provide refugees with settlement support to assist with integration into the local community. Services are delivered through a needs-based case management model and may include cultural and language orientation, employment, education and health linking, income support and accommodation assistance. Settlement services focus on building independence and self-sufficiency. Those found not to be in need of protection by the Governments of PNG or Nauru are expected to return to their country of origin. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Mr Dutton Freight Costs Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letter of 4 September 2017 regarding Petition PN0073 on funding to travellers across Bass Strait. I regret the delay in responding. The Australian Government currently operates two schemes to address the additional costs involved in transporting goods and people across Bass Strait: the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES), and the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme (BSPVES). Both schemes involve a substantial commitment of Government funding in recognition of the unique geographical challenges faced by Tasmania. In 2016-17, the Government provided $185.4 million under the two schemes. The Government has been providing assistance to alleviate the sea freight cost disadvantage incurred when certain categories of eligible non-bulk goods are moved by sea between mainland Australia and Tasmania since 1976 when TFES was introduced. In 2016-17, the Government provided $137.6 million under TFES to offer Tasmanian industries equal opportunities to compete in mainland markets, recognising that, unlike their mainland counterparts, Tasmanian shippers do not have the option of transporting goods by road or rail. Sea travel to and from Tasmania is equally important and is supported by the BSPVES, which subsidises the cost of the accompanied eligible passenger vehicle and provides support to Tasmanians travelling to the mainland and to southbound travellers, who are largely visitors. In 2016-17, the Government provided approximately $47.8 million under the BSPVES, assisting approximately 190,600 eligible passenger vehicles. Rebates under the BSPVES are reviewed annually to reflect the change to the Consumer Price Index. The latest annual increase took effect from 1 July 2017. The aim of the BSPVES, which is to reduce the cost of seagoing travel for eligible passengers, has been in place under successive governments since 2002. On 13 March 2015, as part of its Response to the Productivity Commission Inquiry on Tasmanian Shipping and Freight, the Government reconfirmed its commitment to the Scheme. In so doing, the Government reiterated that the aim of the Scheme does not extend to equalising the cost of inbound and outbound travel across Bass Strait. The Government has and is addressing recommendations made by the Productivity Commission Inquiry on Tasmanian Shipping and Freight. A recent decision was to extend the TEES to goods going to markets not currently covered by the Scheme if the goods are trans-shipped through a port on the mainland. This latest decision provides an additional $202.9 million over four years from 2015-16 to 2018-19 for the TFES. It confirms that the Government is firmly committed to addressing the unique challenges faced by Tasmania and strengthening Tasmanian business. Thank you again for taking the time to write to me on this matter. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Chester Falun Gong Dear Mrs Wicks Thank you for your letters of 11 September 2017 referencing petitions PN0082 and PN0091 submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions, both calling for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong. The Australian Government has long held concerns about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. We are aware of claims of illegal organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners. Those claims, if true, would be deeply disturbing. While we believe that there is insufficient credible evidence to support the Falun Gong-specific allegations, there is little doubt that organs have been harvested from executed prisoners for use in medical transplants, at least prior to 2015. Australia strongly opposes this practice. In 2015 China announced that only voluntarily donated organs from civilians could be used in transplants. We recognise the reforms will make little difference if not properly enforced and we have raised our concerns directly with China on numerous occasions. The Government considers that China's ban on Falun Gong and its treatment of practitioners are in breach of international human rights standards. We will continue to raise these concerns with Chinese authorities. I trust this information is of assistance. Yours sincerely from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop Citizenship leave-I move: That this House require all Members to provide statements in relation to citizenship in the following terms: Members' statements in relation to citizenship (1) By not later than 9 am, 5 December 2017 (and otherwise within 21 days of making and subscribing an oath or affirmation as a Member of the House of Representatives) each Member shall provide to the Registrar of Members' Interests a statement containing the following: (a) a declaration by the Member that, at the time the Member nominated for election to the House of Representatives in this 45th Parliament, he or she was an Australian citizen; (b) a declaration that the Member is not a citizen of any country other than Australia; (c) a declaration stating: (i) the place and date of the Member's birth; (ii) the citizenship that the Member held at the time of birth; and (iii) if he or she did not obtain Australian citizenship at birth, the date he or she was naturalised as an Australian citizen; (d) so far as the Member is aware the place and date of birth of the Member's parents, grandparents and spouse (if applicable); (e) whether the Member has ever been a citizen of another country and, if so, which country or countries; (f) what steps the Member has taken to assure him or herself that the Member has not acquired citizenship of another country by descent, marriage or other means;",41,Petitions
6,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (10:05): by(g) if the Member has answered the question in (e) in the affirmative, details and evidence of the date and manner in which the Member's citizenship of that other country was renounced (if it was renounced) and/or the date and manner in which it came to an end in accordance with the laws of that other country; (h) if the Member's citizenship of that other country had not come to an end at the date of his or her nomination for the House of Representatives, details and evidence of any steps the Member has taken to renounce the citizenship of that other country prior to the date of nomination; and (i) if the Member has declared that he or she was at the time of nomination or is now a citizen of a country other than Australia, on what basis the Member contends that he or she is, nonetheless, not disqualified under section 44(i) of the Constitution. (2) if at any time the Member becomes aware that information provided in the statement is no longer accurate he or she shall update the statement as soon as practicable but by no later than 21 days of being so aware; Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests (3) Statements shall be made in accordance with this resolution and in a form determined by the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. The Registrar shall, in accordance with procedures determined by the committee, maintain a Citizenship Register comprising statements provided under this resolution. Other than as specifically provided for in this resolution, the committee has the same powers and functions in relation to the citizenship register as it does in relation to the Register of Members' Interests. Citizenship Register published on website (4) The Registrar shall, upon the expiry of the time for providing statements under this resolution, and at other times determined by the committee, publish the register and any alterations or additions to the register on the Parliament's website. False statements or omissions regarded as contempt (5) Any Member who: (a) knowingly fails to provide the statement required by this resolution to the Registrar of Members' Interests by the due date; or (b) knowingly fails to correct an inaccuracy in his or her statement within the required timeframe; or (c) knowingly provides false or misleading information to the Registrar of Members' Interests; shall be guilty of a serious contempt of the House of Representatives and shall be dealt with by the House accordingly; a question of whether any Member has committed such a serious contempt shall first be referred to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests for inquiry and report. Referrals to the Court of Disputed Returns (6) Notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders or any other resolution, referral of a Member to the Court of Disputed Returns may be moved without notice by a Minister or the Manager of Opposition Business. I won't delay the House at great length debating the citizenship register. It's been well and truly debated in the public domain, and today is not the day for debates about the referral of members of the House to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. But I will explain the elements of the motion to the House. The first clause of the motion establishes a register of citizenship, asks members to make statements in relation to their citizenship and requires them to do so once the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests has finalised the terms of a form which I understand has been written and circulated. The Privileges Committee will make a decision about that directly after this debate, and then the form will be circulated to all members to be returned to the clerks by 9 am tomorrow morning, so 9 am Tuesday, 5 December. We have been working through the terms of this register and this motion with the opposition and with the crossbenches, and we settled on nine o'clock on Tuesday morning because we made, I think, the fair assumption that most members by now will have checked out their citizenship and any steps they might have taken to renounce citizenship of another country, and we want to give the Speaker and the clerks ample time to be able to get that information up onto the internet to enable people who are interested to examine the evidence as presented by members and then to give us ample time in the House of Representatives this week to refer any members to the High Court if that is in fact necessary. In the case of at least three members, the government believes it will be necessary, but that's not a debate we have to make today. So members will be asked to make a declaration concerning their citizenship. They'll be asked to provide evidence of their parents', grandparents' and spouses', if applicable, citizenship. If it's found in any of those cases that there is a reason why they may be a dual citizen of another country, what steps did they take to renounce that citizenship and when was it so renounced? The second aspect of the motion places it under the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, which, of course, is where the Register of Interests is held by the House, and gives the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interest the power over this particular aspect of the standing orders. The next aspect shows when the citizenship register will be published on the website. We haven't put a hard time on the publication on the website, out of courtesy, really, to the clerks and to the Speaker's office, where we felt that potentially it would be difficult to meet a particular deadline, but I think we're all fully understanding and cognisant of the need to get that information out into the public domain as quickly as possible. I'm sure there'll be no delays in trying to do that, but we didn't put a hard time for that to happen. Element5 is that, of course, false statements or deliberate omissions will be regarded as a contempt of the parliament and the necessary sanctions would be applied after a reference to the Privileges Committee of anyone who does give false information in the register and that the referrals to the Court of Disputed Returns would not only be able to be made by a minister but also by the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. Clearly, that is a departure from the current standing orders, but the view has been taken that, of course, a majority is required to refer any member to the Court of Disputed Returns in any event. We have been working with the opposition on the register of citizenship because I think it's in all of our interests to ensure that everybody sitting in the House is legitimately elected, and, of course, the government has taken its steps. We had a by-election in New England which we spectacularly won on the weekend. We had a spectacular win on Saturday, a record-breaking win-the biggest win for a government in a by-election, by the way, since 1911. A government member: The swing was bigger than the Labor vote. points out. And we will have a by-election in Bennelong, as you referred to this morning, Mr Speaker.

7,Mr Pyne,"The swing was bigger than the Labor vote, as the Deputy Leader of the Housethat's why we move this motion. I look forward to the support of the opposition and the crossbenches. over the weekend that I was planning to move a number of amendments to this motion when it was moved. I hate to disappoint, but the amendments I was going to move are now already part of the motion, so Labor will simply be supporting the motion that's before us. The change to having the deadline moved to 9 am Tuesday is of critical importance. It guarantees that there is time for the register to be up and for it to be public, and it is early enough for members to engage in proper scrutiny of whatever the register brings forward. I urge all members on both sides, once the form is made available, to get the information in as quickly as possible and not to use the deadline as the start time, for the very simple reason that that would take a lot of pressure off the clerks and off the Speaker's office in the work that they have to do. And it guarantees that we will get closer to a 24-hour turnaround for the information to be able to become public, which is in everybody's interests. I also note that the concept which there's been much discussion about over the last 24 hours, about whether only a minister would be able to move a motion of referral, has now been rectified, and it now can also be moved by the Manager of Opposition Business-a job held by me. I say to the crossbench: if there are referrals of any kind that they would seek, I am certainly very happy to have those conversations if the crossbench wish something like that to take place. I thank the government for the way this has worked its way through. There have been times in the public debate when it probably hasn't been ideal. I was bemused, after the Leader of the Opposition had called for this and the government then came forward and said they'd do it, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs said Labor had finally relented to the government's position. It is true: we were dragged to agreeing with our own position, and we thank the government for those glorious comments which were made.

Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill received from the Senate and read a first time. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, as I'm sure you are well aware, I've been a long-time advocate for changes in this area and initially I found the journey to be very lonely, but it was something that I was absolutely determined to do. In 2004, when the parliament changed the definition of 'marriage' to exclude LGBTI Australians, I stood in the Liberal party room and questioned the",54,Motions

10,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (10:13,"I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill anddecision. I didn't understand why we needed to do this. Hadn't LGBTI Australians been through enough? Why did we have to kick them on the way out the door? To me, it didn't make any sense. Denying any Australian equal status and the same level of dignity is in my mind completely un-Australian. For me it was really quite simple. I don't understand how one section of our community should be treated any differently to any other. Life is tough enough and sometimes very hard, and if you're lucky enough to find someone to join you in the good and the bad, well, in my mind it's fantastic. I strongly believe that couples seeking wedlock are strengthening the institution of marriage. There has been a lot of commentary about the length of my advocacy and some very flattering remarks. In the media, I was labelled a 'fiercely heterosexual Far North Queensland crocodile-and bull-catching Liberal'. However, the 12 or 13 years I have been raising this issue and seeking to remove legal and financial discrimination within the gay and transgender community, and also advocating for the right to marry for same-sex couples, has been relatively short compared to those Australians who have had to endure these inequalities for their entire life. In 2007, I worked tirelessly to remove the financial and legal discrimination that gay and lesbian Australians faced. In 2010, I came back from retirement because I felt that I had unfinished business. I hope that some of that business can be dealt with this week, because a clear majority of Australians back this because they believe in a fair go. They are sick of politicians playing games with real people and real lives. In endorsing this legislation, I would like to dedicate my advocacy to a number of very special people who have come forward, shared their life stories with me and helped to reinforce my commitment to why these changes are so necessary. The first person I'd like to dedicate this to is Alana-and Alana: you know who you are. When my interest in dealing with discrimination in the same-sex community was first reported in the mid-2000s, there were a number of news articles that focused on the motives behind my advocacy. One, by Glenn Milne, ran: 'MP Warren Entsch tells why he supports gay rights. ""How my mate became a woman.""' While I didn't actually participate in that interview, he clearly made assumptions and had an interesting description of me, and made reference to the friendship that I'd made many years before when I was living in western Queensland. Imagine my surprise when I received an email. I'd like to quote comments from that email: I was humbled to hear your/our story in today's Sunday Mail. Later in the email Alana states: For the sake of those families that differ in composition to the Prime Minister's ideal I hope you are successful in your campaign. As you and I know, there is absolutely no family in the country that can assume it will be immune to having a child/grandchild/relative that is gay or transgender. There was certainly never a straighter family/community than the one I was born into. Hopefully, these families would then want that person to have the same rights in their relationships that other Australian's take for granted. In closingshe saidI will just give you an update on my life since we last saw each other. I went back to school and university, graduating from medicine at The University of Melbourne and am now working as a doctor in Victoria. A great success. I have to say, Alana, it was very inspirational and moving for me, and many times when I felt pretty lonely on this journey in this place I would often pull out your email and read it, and that reinforced my commitment to what I was doing. I say thank you to Alana. I'd like to also acknowledge two others, possibly the oldest gay couple in Australia, according to media reports-John Challis and Arthur Cheeseman. John was another of those who reached out to me in the early days to share his story with me. John and Arthur have been together for more than 50 years in a totally committed relationship. They reinforced the question in my mind-why shouldn't two people who have shared a life together in a strong and committed relationship have the right to choose how they express their commitment to each other? I want to thank John and Arthur for sharing their story and inspiring me, and I dedicate my advocacy to you both. I understand that wedding plans are on the way, possibly in January. John, you actually look like you're going to be married before your 90th birthday! My heartfelt congratulations to you both. Finally, I dedicate my advocacy to another very special person, Kate Doak. Kate came to me as a journalist trying to understand my advocacy in this arena and over an extended period of time in my office she eventually shared with me her own personal story, a story that I had the privilege of being the first person to hear. Subsequently, both myself and my staff-in particular, Heather Beck in my office-have been there for Kate. I thank you, Kate, for your inspiration and again I dedicate my advocacy to you. I'd also like to mention Rodney Croome and David Scammell. When the media articles first appeared about my advocacy, I received many responses from family and friends of the gay community saying they wanted to come out and support me as well. But Rodney Croome and David Scammell travelled to Canberra, sat down with me, and, for the first time in my life, provided me with an insight into the inequalities and discrimination that gay people faced. I thank them for the opportunity, because without their contribution I may never have been aware of the issues and I may not have started on this journey. I'm not going to go into the technicalities of the bill, other than to say there has been a huge amount of effort put into it. The bill, which the Senate passed, is a robust bill. A whole range of religious protections are already in place. As Senator Dean Smith said when he was tabling it: this bill reflects the most fundamental liberal and conservative values which our party stands for: 'liberal' because it delivers freedoms for couples to marry and 'conservative' because it strengthens the social fabric and the vital institution of marriage. This bill is about marriage and only about marriage. Nothing in this bill takes away existing rights or freedoms; it doesn't create different classes of marriage. What it does is give same-sex couples the same legal rights as other couples. We have made sure that we have removed any element of discrimination in this bill while ensuring that religious freedoms are protected. LGBTI couples will be free to marry the person that they love in a civil marriage; the freedom of ministers of religion and religious marriage celebrants to only perform religious marriages in accordance with their religious beliefs remains unchanged. There may be amendments proposed on free speech, discrimination law, education, charity law, tax law. These are all worthy causes and important debates, but they don't need to form part of this bill today. Australians are sick of excuses and they're sick of delays. The majority of Australians voted yes on same-sex couples being able to marry in front of friends and family who love them in this country that they call home. They did not vote for a new form of discrimination. Amendments about unrelated issues, amendments that seek to delay same-sex marriage for the 61.6 per cent of Australians who made their preferences clear or amendments that seek to unwind or remove any legal rights or discrimination protections will be opposed. Australians did not vote for fairness and equality only to see other legal protections peeled away in this bill. I announced my intention to introduce a bill back in 2015, but, unfortunately, that didn't occur because of decisions that were made to commit the coalition to a plebiscite. I didn't agree with the plebiscite and I was disappointed that I didn't have the opportunity to introduce my bill to the floor of the parliament. However, rather than focusing on the process, I did everything I could to focus on an outcome. That plebiscite was taken to the 2016 election. It was during this period that there were a number of very special individuals who entered the parliament, providing an opportunity for us to work as a collective determined to get a vote on marriage equality in the 45th Parliament. I would like to acknowledge my good friend and colleague here beside me Trent Zimmerman. The last time. I wore this rainbow tie was at Trent's maiden speech. He's the member for North Sydney. In front of me here I've got Tim Wilson, the member for Goldstein. And of course fellow Queenslander Trevor Evans, the member for Brisbane, is also here-all kindred spirits in this advocacy. Together we committed ourselves to making sure same-sex marriage was on the agenda and that we'd have the opportunity to vote for it in this place. Special mention to my friend Senator Dean Smith, who was a member of the Senate Select Committee on the Exposure Draft of the Marriage Amendment (Same-Sex Marriage Bill). He did outstanding work in incorporating the findings of the consenting report from the committee into the bill that we are now debating, which has already passed the Senate. I have to say I was not happy with the postal survey, and I expressed that view, but I have to congratulate Peter Dutton for this initiative. When he approached me, I suggested to him that it would never work, and I honestly didn't think it would. However, there's always-always!-a benefit in hindsight. It probably was the best thing that we did in so much as the participation rate was extraordinary: almost 80 per cent of registered Australian voters, and the fact we got a vote of almost 62 per cent shows that an absolute majority of Australians have come along with us on this journey. It certainly provides us with the opportunity to celebrate inclusion and diversity, and is one of the biggest political mandates in the history of our nation. While there were great celebrations in Australia, when the result came through I was in New York. Let me assure you that this result wasn't just celebrated in Australia: it was celebrated around the world. I remember driving home after a function in lower Manhattan not long after the results were announced and seeing the Empire State Building lit up in rainbow colours to acknowledge this historic event. I'd like to acknowledge the team from the Equality Campaign who've been invaluable in their assistance. I value their support and their friendship. They are Alex Greenwich, Tom Snow, Anna Brown, Janine Middleton, Tiernan Brady, Clint McGilvray, Lee Carnie, Corey Irlam and, last but not least, Claire Dawson. There were so many others, too numerous to mention, who made the 'yes' campaign such a success: I thank them for that. In this place we all come here to make a difference, and we do in so many ways through our electorate work and in assisting national policy. However, it is rare that we have the opportunity to make a change such as we have achieved through this legislation and the profound, positive impact it will have on so many lives, not only those within the same-sex community but also on their family and their friends. We have a responsibility to the Australian people this week: we must do what we believe is right. Who is it to say that another person should be denied equal rights or that their love is in some way lesser because of who they love? This bill will take from no-one; it simply makes our nation a kinder and a fairer place. Delaying equality for every Australian, whether they be from Bundaberg or Fremantle, simply is not good enough. At the end of day, life is too short: we must vote on this and get on with it. I know that there are many weddings planned in the near future, once this legislation is carried through. I wish all of those brides and all of those grooms the very, very best in their marriage in the future. Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately. speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. On 15 November 2017, just past 10 am local time, celebration erupted on the streets of Brisbane as the Australian Statistician announced that the vast majority of Australians had said yes to allowing same-sex couples to marry. At a large gathering in Queen's Park in the CBD, and in cafes and workplaces across Brisbane, people clapped and cheered. They hugged complete strangers, and people cried with a mixture of relief and joy. My partner, Roger, and I shared in that emotion. The 'yes' vote in Brisbane was almost 80 per cent. It was 79.5 per cent, meaning that Brisbane recorded the highest support of any government seat across the country except for the Prime Minister's seat of Wentworth. When the Statistician was giving his speech that day he also announced in passing that the ABS later that day would be releasing Australia's labour force statistics. Now, it is thought provoking to imagine a nation tuning in and erupting with the same level of celebration at the release of our employment statistics. They were pretty good job figures after all! But that comparison does reveal the importance of the postal survey results and the significance of marriage equality to so many Australians. It underlines the responsibility that this parliament now has in front of it to respect the clear will of the Australian people by passing this bill this week in a business-like fashion. That comparison between the postal survey and other statistical releases reveals another serious point: that in the hustle and bustle of life there's possibly too few occasions when Australia stops and pays attention to the operations, the decisions and the news of government. When a national moment like this occurs, there are lessons to be learned for those of us who ponder things like the operation of our democracy, policy-making processes and concepts of good governance.",55,Bills

12,Mr Evans (Brisbane) (10:27,"It is with pride and joy that I second the motion. I rise toWhy did it take so long for this reform to be achieved when public opinion had shown that the majority of Australians have supported marriage equality for almost a decade? What precedent did the postal survey set for our parliamentary democracy? And what has the postal survey taught us about how Australians can engage with each other and our parliament? I wouldn't be the first to observe that reform has been difficult for Australia in this decade. About a year ago, I was on my feet here speaking of my sadness and disappointment that yet another Australian parliament looked set to fail to achieve marriage equality. Despite these years of national debate, this government's plebiscite bill was actually the first time in history there was a government-endorsed bill sitting on that table in front of me. We were the first government ever elected with a mandate containing a path to achieving marriage equality, and we had our Prime Minister-the first in Australia to be consistently in favour of it. And yet, despite all those firsts, that bill was headed for defeat by the usual blockade in the Senate. And those who voted against it had no plan for what would happen next. Essentially, they were content to run the risk that this reform would stall for a long time-possibly, for many years. And of course that was after some of them had done nothing to achieve marriage equality when they had their chance in government. Now, history, not I, will be the judge of that. As for me, I'm proud to stand up here today and say that I've played a small role in ending the stalemate on same-sex marriage. It was a path that contained some risks, and, for their strength and their courage on this topic, I want to pay tribute to some of my colleagues: to Senator Dean Smith; to the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson; to the member for North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman; the member for La Trobe, Jason Wood; and to the irrepressible and legendary member for Leichhardt, fellow Queenslander Warren Entsch. Those members. I just named and I didn't come to this place to focus on same-sex marriage. I came here with a background in small business, with experience in economics and industry, to focus on many of the other important challenges and opportunities that lie ahead of us today. But sometimes one could have been forgiven for thinking otherwise. I can't count the number of times that news stories introduced me as 'the gay MP' before even referring to my seat or my party or my achievements or other attributes. It's true that this topic does have a deeply personal aspect and I feel very, very strongly about it. But this isn't about me, and it's not about any of us in this parliament. This is about a million other people out there around Australia. For them, we have just created a national watershed moment. Every person out there who might have been questioning themselves or their value, or feeling isolated, lonely and vulnerable, knows now, without any doubt, that the majority of Australians support them and they want them to be equal. Equally, any person out there who might be inclined in the future to say something hurtful or offensive or derogatory to someone in the gay community also now knows that a majority of Australians do not support those views. That's what this means. Australia has just said yes to the inherent worth of every human being who shares our wide brown land. So every Australian who completed their postal survey, and all of us voting here, should know that their vote has contributed and is contributing to a national watershed moment. In this moment, our votes probably do more to beat stigma, homophobia and vulnerability in our society than any rally or any debate we could possibly have contributed to. That's the power of a vote. I want to specifically thank all Australians-and, in particular, the people of Brisbane-for their strong support of this process. I couldn't be more humbled by or grateful for the support of Brisbane. It's important to note-and it's a point I want to make very strongly-that the postal survey result was so comprehensive because Liberals and Nationals around the country voted yes. I've always maintained confidence that Australians would be responsible about exercising their freedom. And that faith in Australians was rewarded. I believe it's one of the salient lessons about our democracy to draw from this process. The vast majority of Australians wanted to have their say, clearly, yet it was a subject that only directly impacted a minority, and the majority of Australians wished to express their support for them. Almost all Australians did express their support. They engaged in debates and they discussed the topic of marriage in their workplaces and in their homes freely and constructively. And it was only a very small and atypical minority who didn't appreciate that their freedom of speech came with responsibilities and who crossed some lines with their individual conduct. Our free speech doesn't force you to listen to other people or force other people to listen to you or agree with you. Freedom of speech isn't a shield from criticism and it's not a shield from other views. Reasonable people can disagree. And in this debate the power of liberal democracy and the disinfecting nature of transparency have proved once again their enduring strength. Also, very importantly, democracy doesn't mean that we always get what we want. It means that we respect the result. I profess to holding mixed views about the process of the postal survey, yet I must admit that it surprised me along the way, and credit must be given to the ABS and to the Acting Special Minister of State, Mathias Cormann, for their management of the process. Many fears were not realised, and the result was beyond question. AndI do look forward to a future opportunity to outline my thoughts on how a plebiscite or a postal process might sit alongside our parliamentary democratic traditions. I note Menzies's eloquent words on his views on parliamentary democracy in some of his less-well-read speeches that he gave in the 'forgotten people' series. In particular I think it's important for all of us to reflect on how such a mechanism might be used sparingly and in exceptional circumstances only into the future. I want to make the point that thousands of young people around Australia enrolled to vote for the first time because of this postal survey. This was their first brush with democracy, and for some of them it might have been a confronting lesson. YetI hope some younger people who haven't witnessed much of the alternative approaches to democracy around the world have had cause to pause and reflect about what this episode can teach us. It may have been a frustrating process for the time and the context that we find ourselves in, yet it was a process that unquestionably landed with the right outcome. I want to make a point for those young people who are growing up in a world where self-gratification is instant and we have iPhones, social media and credit cards to buy the latest fashion trends. Democracy is slow. Reform is sometimes frustrating. Democracy is a messy process. And yet, if you involve yourself in the process of democracy, as you have in this process, our democracy will be a stronger one. This is a good bill, and I was pleased to contribute to its drafting alongside some of my colleagues and its principal architect, Senator Dean Smith. My signature has been on this bill since it was circulated to colleagues back in early August. This is a bill that started with an exposure draft prepared by our Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, last year. It faithfully implements the findings of a Senate review and the unanimous findings by senators right across the political spectrum following the consultation they performed with the input and the agreement of a long list of religious and community organisations across Australia. This is a bill that finds a good balance between the need to protect important religious freedoms and still implement the clear will of the Australian people to change the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry. This bill contains specific protections for religious organisations. It contains protections for individual ministers of religion even if they're acting outside the tenets of their organised religion. It contains protections for civil celebrants; for chaplains; and for businesses, organisations and other bodies if they're set up predominantly for a religious purpose. I accept that not all religious organisations agree with this bill and neither do all the gay advocacy groups, but this bill does have the blessing of many of the religious organisations and gay advocacy groups that are capable of reaching agreement on this matter. This bill has that support because it does not open any new forms of discrimination and, equally, it does not remove any religious freedoms or protections. In conclusion, it's with pride, joy and love that I second this motion. It's a good bill. It strikes a good balance. And it enjoys wide support across our community. Now that the Brisbane community and the broader Australian community have voiced their strong support for same-sex marriage, it's time for us in this parliament to do our bit this week in a business like fashion. Opposition Business, is leave granted to continue the debate? granted. Looking at the speakers list, we have in the order of 15 hours of debate ahead of us. There is an offer from the opposition to agree to additional sitting times-if at any point it is the wish of the House-in particular for tomorrow night, so we can finish the second reading debate speeches and vote on the second reading on Wednesday morning. And, secondly, the opposition is also willing to offer for speeches to be shortened to 10 minutes, rather than 15, to make sure we can get this legislation through this week. So that's put there as an offer. I've got a suspension of standing orders motion; it would be silly to move it now. Hopefully, we can reach accommodation within the chamber to make sure that we do get this done. straightforward task, and it is a great privilege. With this legislation, with our voices and our votes, we will make marriage equality a reality in Australia. This is a chance for our parliament to demonstrate that we are worthy of the people we serve. It's a chance to honour the courage of LBGTIQ Australians, to recognise their rights and to celebrate their love. It's a chance to atone for the inaction and failures of the past. After years of discrimination, disappointment and delay, it's a chance to write into law a truth that we know in our hearts: marriage is defined by love and loyalty, not gender. And whilst this final legal change depends on the overdue vote of our parliament, today is not actually about the parliamentarians. For me, today is about the teenager in the country town who stood in front of his footy club and asked his teammates to support him for the person that he's always been.

15,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Leader of the Opposition) (10:41): Today we have acolleagues to put aside their old thoughtless prejudices and respect her right to equality. Today is about tens of thousands of loving same-sex couples who prove every day that they're wonderful parents and they're raising great kids. Today belongs to all the LBGTIQ Australians who have borne the burden of the long battle for equality-some of whom could deservedly be described as proud warriors who remember when their very existence was considered to be a criminal offence but always knew it was the law that needed to change, not their love. The labour movement was born believing there can be no progress without struggle. The labour movement believes that equality is both natural and fundamental. But we understand that equality is never inevitable. To Australians for Marriage Equality, to all of the advocacy groups and campaigners, to the union movement and to the corporate leaders, to everyday Australians who live in the suburbs and in the country towns who knocked on doors, made phone calls, had conversations, rallied support, raised awareness and played their part in driving this overdue change, we say thank you. In particular, I want to acknowledge young Australians. Young Australians sometimes don't get the credit they deserve in our public discourse. Hundreds of thousands of young people corrected their enrolment addresses or enrolled. They spoke to their parents and their grandparents. When we vote for this bill, and when it is successful, we should recognise that young Australians have shown Australia the sort of nation we want to see in the mirror-a generous, inclusive and tolerant Australia. For that, our young Australians are demonstrating that they very much deserve to have the best future possible because they are gifting it to all of us. In particular, though, I salute LGBTIQ Australians for all that you have done and for all that you have endured. Despite the strong polls and the confident predictions, I know that, on the eve of this survey result and in the morning when they woke up, many were consumed by anxiety-and it wasn't just the prospect of a 'no' vote and it wasn't the unpleasantness of features of the campaign; it was something deeper. I cannot imagine what it is like to submit your relationships and your identity to an opinion poll of strangers across the country. For many of my friends, they all of a sudden had to question how welcome they were in their own society. It was a reminder and a reawakening of old fears: the dread of coming out and being shunned by friends and family who just didn't get it, and the fear of being rejected, targeted and humiliated because of something as basic and natural and human as who you are and who you love. Even at the wonderful celebrations that Chloe and I attended in Lygon Street on the night of the 'yes' result, I spoke to so many couples whose joy was matched by relief. You saw the weight come off their shoulders. Unfortunately, the bitter truth of hard experience has taught the LGBTIQ community to sometimes have to expect the worse. What a glorious day it was when the people of Australia did not let their friends and their families and their neighbours down. And now, the parliament will not let you down. I think this is an uplifting moment in our nation, but we need to be mindful to match our joy with our humility-the humility to acknowledge that, for too long on marriage equality, Australia has trailed the world and, for too long, this parliament has trailed the people of Australia; and the humility to seek forgiveness from LGBTIQ Australians. The forgiveness I speak of is for the long delay and for the injustices and the indignities, both great and small; forgiveness for subjecting you and your relationships to public judgement; and forgiveness for the hurt and harm that you and your families have suffered. We seek your forgiveness. We salute your courage. We thank you for including us in your historic moment. Let me be clear, for me in voting for marriage equality, the campaigners for marriage equality have not just delivered equality for them; they have actually made the Australian identity better. The gift of this legislation is not just in allowing people to get married. The gift of this legislation is that it says that Australia can be a better place, a more inclusive place. To all those LGBTIQ Australians who found themselves in subsequent days examining the result, seeing it as some kind of reflection on them in percentage terms, let me declare this: you are not 61 per cent anything. You are 100 per cent equal, you are 100 per cent loved and you are 100 per cent right to live your life the way you want, and we are lucky to count each and every one of you as our fellow Australians. This legislation will bear Senator Smith's signature, and that is a worthy tribute to his patience and hard work down the years. To his Liberal and conservative colleagues who stood up to be counted, you know who you are and you know the value of what you did and have accomplished. There are, of course, many members of all parties who fought long and hard for this change. From our side, I acknowledge the member for Sydney, Senator Louise Pratt, the member for Grayndler and the member for Whitlam, whose marriage equality legislation I was proud to be one of 42 in the House of Representatives to vote for in 2012. AndI look forward to that number being far higher on this occasion. I want to acknowledge all my colleagues who have offered me counsel on this question as leader. I'm proud of the decisions that we've made together. I'm proud we went to the last election promising a free vote within 100 days. I'm proud that we opposed the principle of a plebiscite, the idea of a lawmaking process for LGBTI Australians separate to all other Australians. And I'm proud of how energetically and effectively our party and our movement campaigned for the 'yes' case. But in particular today I want to pay special tribute to Senator Penny Wong. Penny, yours has often been a lonely road and a hard road. It's the merging of the personal and political in ways that some of us who vote here will never have to contemplate. But I do know this: in 2011, your advocacy, along with others', changed our platform. And, whilst you're too modest to say it yourself, in years to come Sophie will be able to tell your children about the time that their mum helped change Australia. Many more will make valuable contributions to this debate. I did want to address briefly religious freedom. The Labor Party believes in religious freedom. We understand it is central to our democracy and our society. It is a most important issue and one that we must all treat with respect. Australia is a remarkable country full of decent and generous people of good conscience drawn from all faiths and none. And the greatness of our nation is that every person is free to be proud of what they believe. We recognise that, for Australians of faith, religion is a base to build upon in public life even if it is also a destination for contemplation, solace and sustenance in private life. In our society, under our laws, whether we be Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists or atheists, we're all Australians and we're all equal-first, last and always equal under the law. Respect for sincerely held views of people of faith and respect for the rights of religious institutions to practice according to their own tenets is proper. And it is right and proper for the parliament to take the time to consider what protections are required as a separate question to this legislation. We look forward to the recommendations put forward by Philip Ruddock's panel and we will consider them carefully in the new year. And it is also important to note that nothing in this legislation limits the right of any person to lawfully worship, practice or observe, or teach according to their religion. This bill is about extending equality, not reducing liberty, because enhancing the rights of one group of people does not diminish the freedoms of another. Fairness is not a finite resource. Equality has never been a zero-sum game. The whole history of Australia tells us the truth of this. Every time this nation expanded the definition of the fair go, we have all gained from its deeper meaning. Every time we have enlarged the circle of Australian fairness, we've all gained new allies in our national success and the telling of the Australian story. Every time we have faced the failures of our past, it has helped us build a better future. It is why marriage equality is not the trading away of our traditions; it is about living up to them. It is not about breaking with our values; it's building upon them. This law is not the end of the ancient institution of marriage; it is a new beginning for a more equal world. I hope and imagine that, in a generation to come, Australians will look back to these days and this debate and most will wonder: what was the fuss all about? My children will attend the weddings of their friends and not give a moment's thought to whether they are gay or straight, whether it's in a church or a park. All that will matter is: does the couple love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together? All that will matter is that they are people like us: our friends, our neighbours, our family members, our loved ones, our fellow Australians. This moment of this debate this week belongs to all those who have waited. This moment belongs to all those who have fought. It belongs to all those who did not live to see their dream realised. It belongs to all those who have felt that the inequality in the law has meant that they are unequal in our eyes. We have come too late to this moment, but we are here at last. Today is an outstanding day. When we vote on this bill, it will be an outstanding moment. It will be, I predict, an uplifting moment. So it is with joy, with humility, with privilege, with love for our brothers and sisters and with hope in our future that I commend this bill to the House. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:56): It is with great pleasure and a real sense of history that I rise to speak today. In 1999, when speaking in support of the superannuation entitlements bill of the member for Grayndler, I described that law as a law which: … does not provide for special rights for gay and lesbian couples. It provides universal rights, equal rights, for those people. And so is the case today. The bill before us is about universal rights, about human rights and about an inclusive and a fair Australia. During the 2004 debate, when the Howard government rushed through laws amending the Marriage Act, I said: Some time in the not too distant future, people will look back on this desperate attempt at wedge politics and treat it with the contempt it deserves. Some time in the not too distant future, there will be formal recognition of same-sex couples, and the sky will not fall in, and we will not be destroyed … and life will continue. The main difference will be fewer violent or abusive attacks on gay men and lesbians, and fewer teenagers suiciding, because they will not be taught to feel shame about their sexuality as many are now. How privileged I am, how proud I am, to be able to stand today and speak in support of this bill. My regret is that it has taken so many years to get here. I wish that debate on a bill like this could have happened without an unnecessary, divisive and expensive postal survey. But Australians proved themselves better, braver and more decent than their government, and worlds away from the hate and the fear that was being pushed by some elements of the 'no' campaign. I wish that the Prime Minister had assisted in bringing this bill to the parliament without putting Australia through the expense and division of this survey. It required his leadership and the courage of his convictions, but these were sadly missing. Instead of the debate happening here, as it should've, it was pushed into, shoved into, lounge rooms across Australia, where children were asking their parents for support, for basic acknowledgement, and some parents were saying no. I don't know if any of us can imagine, really, what a hard thing it is to hear that from your own parents-that they wouldn't be voting to recognise you and your relationship. That could've been avoided if the debate had happened in here, as it is now. I wish this parliament had done its job and legislated earlier. I'm proud of the fact that I was one of those 42 who voted in favour of the Jones bill in 2012. And I'm sorry it has taken until 2017 for this law to be in this place with the likelihood that it will pass this week. I'm sorry for all the pain that the LGBTIQ community has faced in having themselves and their relationships debated in this way in recent months-in having their relationships put on trial. But love won in the end, and the opponents of marriage equality could not defeat it. The democratic tradition runs deep in our country. Even though many disagreed, as I did, with this postal survey, the democratic impulses of our people were strong, and about 80 per cent of voters turned out. And they overwhelmingly voted yes. My electorate of Sydney shared the highest yes response in the country, with 83.7 per cent of my electorate voting yes. It's not surprising: in many ways, my electorate is the cultural heart of LGBTIQ Australia. It has a long history of activism and political engagement that emerged around Oxford Street, Darlinghurst and Kings Cross. While there are LGBTIQ Australians in every community, in every city, in every suburb and in every town right across Australia, so many have chosen to make their home in my electorate. It is a tolerant, safe, welcoming and diverse community and I'm proud to say that I've got two very special constituents here with me today, Izzy Perko and Collin Lyon, who exemplify for me this sort of activism and relationship. Izzy and Collin have been together for decades and just want to be treated like everybody else in my community-allowed to marry legally and share their commitment with their friends and family. Earlier this year, after a detailed inquiry, a Senate committee agreed on draft marriage equality legislation. This legislation was backed by Labor, the Liberals, the Nationals, the Nick Xenophon Team and the Greens. This is the consensus bill that is before us today. It's very simple. Firstly, it allows same-sex couples to marry. Secondly, it protects religious freedom by allowing clergy and a new category of religious celebrants to choose who they will and will not marry. It isn't complicated and I'm disappointed that some are seeking to make it complicated. There is talk by the Prime Minister and others of substantive amendments to this bill on the grounds of protecting religious freedoms. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, Labor is absolutely committed to religious freedoms. We are absolutely supportive of Australians having the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their religious practice or observance in this country. But I would say to those people who are concerned that there is no attack on freedom of religion in this bill. Indeed, the bill strengthens religious protections; it does not weaken them. Of course, we have no difficulty with further discussion about religious protections-indeed, about protection of human rights right across the spectrum of human rights, including religious freedom-but that is best done next year, noting that the government's newly established panel, led by the Hon. Philip Ruddock, is yet to report. I'd also say that, just as there are those who are concerned that religious protections don't go far enough in this bill, there are others who are concerned that they go too far. This shows that this bill hits the right balance. There are some concerned that there shouldn't be a new category of religious celebrants, for example. So there is a time to discuss these issues of religious freedom, but we shouldn't complicate the bill that's before us today, which has already achieved a cross-party consensus. There are so many people whose work needs to be acknowledged in the long fight for this next step in equality for LGBTIQ Australians. Of course, most of the big steps forward have occurred over the years under Labor governments, from Bill Hayden leading the charge on decriminalisation of homosexuality to Don Dunstan being the first Premier to legalise homosexuality 42 years ago; from Neville Wran banning discrimination on the grounds of sexuality to Kevin Rudd's government legislating to remove discrimination against same-sex couples from 85 federal laws in areas as diverse as tax, veterans affairs, social security and health. I want to acknowledge the member for Maribyrnong and our Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who has pursued this issue as a priority and committed Labor to legislating for marriage equality within the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government. I thank all of my colleagues who've been long-time advocates for LGBTI Australians and for marriage equality: my friend Senator Penny Wong, of course; my friend Senator Louise Pratt; the shadow Attorney General, the member for Isaacs; the shadow minister for equality, the member for Griffith; the member for Grayndler, my neighbour in inner-city Sydney and a long-time ally of the those opposite. We've worked so cooperatively in recent times. Senator Dean Smith, I know that this has taken a personal toll on you, and I'm proud to be able to congratulate you today for your leadership. For those opposite who have spoken today and will speak later in this debate, I know that it is a brave thing to do to stand up in the face of not overwhelming support from your own side. It's gutsy, and it's appreciated. I want to acknowledge Rainbow Labor. Rainbow Labor is a group of ordinary members of the Labor Party who have put their faith and their trust in Labor and have said that they know it will be Labor who can deliver on their aspirations. They have campaigned so hard for this win, and they have been part of changing history. I also want to acknowledge the many other campaigners who've devoted years of their lives to the pursuit of equality: all of those involved with the AME campaign-Anna Brown, Tom Snow, Brooke Horne, Alex Greenwich, Janine Middleton, Tim Gartrell, Paddy Batchelor and many, many more; the community groups who have been fighting for this equality for years, including the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, Twenty10, ACON, Wear it Purple, Community Action Against Homophobia, Inner City Legal Centre, Rainbow Families and so many, many others; and the union movement, who, once again in our nation's history, swung behind the fight for equality. I can tell you it makes such a difference having the human resources of those unions backing a campaign like this-people out on the streets early in the morning and late at night, phoning, door knocking, standing at train stations and convincing their colleagues, their friends and their family members to vote yes. Individuals like Magda Szubanski, Kerryn Phelps and Jackie Stricker-Phelps, Rodney Croome, Father Frank Brennan-so many have stood up and joined their voices to the chorus of calls for equality. Every person, every individual, who has had a difficult conversation with a friend or a family member or a complete strange at a train station in the morning, at a bus stop or during a door knock-this really would not have happened without this massive mobilisation of ordinary Australians committed to equality. I know that many people over the course of this debate have actually changed their minds. They started out thinking that this wasn't an important issue or that marriage equality would somehow change our society in a bad way. Over the years, they've listened to their friends or family members or colleagues, and they've changed their minds. It takes a lot of bravery to change your mind. It takes intellectual openness and emotional openness to change your mind. It's a really big thing to do, and I particularly thank those people today. There are so many people for whom this change means so much. I know the reason they stood up to speak out was not just for their own personal benefit but to help make the sort of country they want to live in. People like Eddie Blewett and his mums, Neroli Dickson and Claire Blewett, from Tathra on the New South Wales South Coast. Eddie is only 14 years old, but he is one of the bravest kids you could ever meet. It takes real guts for families like his, rainbow families, to have made this case and in the public eye. I think of the young Indigenous woman in Armidale who quietly took me aside when I was there last year to let me know the struggle she faces every day and to urge me not to give up. I say to her today, 'I didn't, and I'll never give up.' I think about the teenage boy I met in Bathurst this year who told me how hard it was to come out in the country town if your friends and family aren't supportive. I think about the teenagers I met at headspace in Sunshine, Melbourne, who told me how many young people were suffering because they were being made to feel second rate by their government. This change would not have been possible without the trailblazers in the community. This is a victory for my friends in Elizabeth Bay John Challis, 89, and Arthur Cheeseman, 85, who have fought for 50 years to have their relationship recognised and who will marry in January. Arthur said recently of seeing marriage equality become a reality: It gives us a new dignity, a new status, a new place in society. We are the same as everyone else. This is a victory for the 78ers who marched down Oxford Street into a wall of police brutality in the pursuit of equality. It is their struggle that this parliament honours today by passing this legislation. I want to send a very special message to those people for whom this has been a decadeslong struggle, people who lost relationships, lost connection with family and lost their jobs because they took a stand all those years ago. Important issues like this capture the public's imagination because they go to something fundamental within us: the kind of society that we want for each other and for our kids-fairer, kinder, less judgemental and more accepting, a society in which we live and let live and in which we recognise that love makes a marriage and love makes a family. parliament is given a choice to end centuries of marginalisation of some Australians and make them full citizens for the first time. It is a day when we can choose to reaffirm the voluntary bond of marriage for the 21st century and encourage the commitment it provides to take individuals to form families as the foundation for community and nationhood. It is the day in this place when my party properly returns to its traditions and allows a free vote on a matter of conscience. I will be supporting the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, and I do so wholly acknowledging that the bill is not my first preference. My preference is, has been and always will be a bill that could only be delivered when those opposed recognised that public sentiment shifted against them over a decade ago and when those who advocated change respected that some people's views would never change, and both were accommodated in law. The former Prime Minister John Howard reminded me of my words from May 2014: The primacy of the human right to freedom of worship should not be simply dismissed in pursuit of advancing the civil right to non-discrimination. I still agree with that statement. It is one of the critical reasons the postal survey was not my first preference. Some took a 'stop change at all costs' approach, and the full costs now come with it. That was their choice, not that of those seeking change and not mine. My conscience is clear. The bill is a compromise on the political situation before us. My hope is that my party will reflect on this debate and learn from it. In an effort by some to prevent this parliament from confronting this issue, they have been prepared to discard numerous principles: parliamentary supremacy, representative democracy, our party's tradition of a free vote, fiscal prudence and free speech. I take great pride in being able to say that at every single occasion I stood up to defend our institutions, traditions and freedoms ahead of the politics of the day. My focus has been and always will be on how we take our country forward together. Some of us are Liberals, real Liberals, living Menzies's address to his 1965 federal council that we are 'not the party of the past, not the conservative party dying hard on the last barricade', but one with 'a lively mind and a forward-looking heart'. We believe in conserving our culture and our institutions by shaping the future and bringing them forward to give life to one of our most important institutions and its relevance in the 21st century. I take all people's freedoms seriously-very seriously. A free society does not seek to homogenise belief or conscience but instead affirms individuality and diversity and fosters tolerance and mutual respect. The choice that has always faced our country is whether we are a social democracy or a liberal democracy. Social democracies empower government and legislate permissible conduct. In a liberal democracy, we remove barriers to freedom, just as the bill before us today is doing. We are expanding the freedom to marry. The unlimited freedom of conscience is the freedom to hold and form opinions, religious or otherwise, and that is not inhibited by this bill. Freedom of speech is the freedom to express and communicate ideas and your conscience, and that is not inhibited by this bill. As all members know, I will always stand up against laws that make it unlawful to offend, when they arise. Religious freedom is the freedom to manifest your conscience. A person's faith does not end",62,Bills
16,Mr Tim Wilson (Goldstein) (11:11,"Today is a historic day. It is a day that thisat the church door any more than sexual orientation ends at the bedroom door. They inform the fullness of a life, our character and our choices. Free speech and religious freedom have always been tempered by law to respect the rights and freedoms of others. They are not an unlimited licence. If you care about everyone's freedom, not just your own, the objective should be to enlarge the space for these freedoms-I always will and do. The bill before us today is the answer to a simple question: should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry? This bill honours those who fought harder before us for less and those today who've had to fight for their equal place at this nation's table. It represents the opportunities of generations to come-to mature in adolescence without unnecessary doubt, like Edward Crossland, who grew up in the Goldstein electorate, who wrote to me saying, 'The recent debate has really made me question my validity as a person.' Edward, question no longer. Hayley, Katie and Ada, from Sandringham, wrote, 'I know you will understand when I say it has been hard, but it was particularly heartening to know that an overwhelming majority of our neighbours support us.' Yes, they do, Hayley, Katie and Ada. Dale Hardy and Steve Humphreys were going to get married in March at the UK consulate in Melbourne, but now they can be married in the nation they love-congratulations. It also affects families. I was reminded of this when I popped into netball in Hampton last Saturday when Kris Pierce told me lovingly of her uncle Kevin and his partner of 44 years, John, and how much she was looking forward to the ending of the silence of their relationship-the silence will end. There's no point pretending that this isn't deeply personal. It is a journey that I started when I was 12 years old; it was referenced in my first speech. Like so many others at 18, I confronted the choice before me about whether I should live my life honestly or not at all. I still remember my thoughts at that crucial moment: if you give in, they win. That moment followed years of self-inspired haunting doubt that was externally reinforced by the legacy of social, cultural and legal stigmatisation. I suspect many people find understanding these journeys difficult. It's so paralysing because you can't seek help from others. The people you should be able to turn to are the ones you fear speaking to the most because the cost of rejection is so high. As the Attorney-General remarked in the other place, it can sometimes overcome. This bill rams a stake into the heart of that stigma and its legacy. IfI could go back and tell that scared 18-year-old kid he'd be speaking here-surrounded by Trevor Evans and Trent Zimmerman, and also representing the party of his values with his partner, Ryan, in the gallery-on this bill, he wouldn't have believed me. Ryan, I still remember the day all those years ago when we rose before the sun to watch a new day on One Tree Hill on Hamilton Island and I gave you the ring on our left hand and said, 'I don't know what this ring represents or means, but will you take it as a sign of my commitment?' Thankfully, the answer was yes. I also remember the bittersweetness of the days that followed. Anyone who has been engaged will know that moment in life: the joy amplified by the mutual celebration of others. Our friends were happy for us and with us. Always with an eye to the future, the member for Kooyong and his wife, Amie, sent flowers. But, when we told others, many simply didn't know how to react. Many SMSs were not responded to. In conversation, some people politely changed the topic or fell silent entirely. For a while, Ryan kept pushing for an engagement party. The truth was, I kept delaying it, perhaps wrongly, because the strong message I took from so many people's silence was that no-one would come. On informing one person of our news, they responded, 'Why bother?' At the time. I fell silent, and I've never had an answer to that question, but the Australian people have now answered it for me. Our society doesn't have a tradition that communicates the seriousness and commitment of a relationship, except for marriage. It is a commitment between two people and held together by the love and expectation of families, friends and community. It is the foundation of our nation. And as my dear friend Paul Ritchie wrote in his book Faith, Love& Australia: The Conservative Case for Same-Sex Marriage: Marriage strengthens society, mutual responsibility strengthens the social fabric and interdependence is the core of every community, the law should support and affirm the most important of human relationships the person we choose to share our life with. And he's right. My uncle recently asked whether, without a bride, my parents would still have to chip in for the wedding. Look on the bright side, Mum and Dad; you get to start a new tradition. To the people of Australia: this debate was always about the type of country we want to be, and you own this moment. To the second love of my life, the people of Goldstein: when you charged me with your trust, you knew we would solve this debate together. You delivered the highest per capita participation rate in the nation and delivered a 76.3 per cent 'yes' response. Thank you for your tolerance, because now we can move on, together. To Tiernan Brady, Anna Brown, Janine Middleton, Tom Snow, Clint McGilvray and the many others who have worked tirelessly: thank you so much. To those in it for the long haul, particularly the staffers who worked for the government through this difficult process, such as Ben Bartlett and Luke Barnes as well as many others; to the Liberals and Nationals For Yes team, led nationally by Andrew Bragg, fronted by my dear friends Christine Forster and Virginia Edwards, and organised in the great state of Victoria by Rory Grant and David Kitchen: thank you so much. To the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull: you found a pathway through the obstruction of those on both sides of this debate-and it was on both sides of this debate. This is a marker in your legacy, and that of the Attorney-General, the immigration minister and the finance minister: thank you. To my trusted confidante Alex Greenwich, who I'm very happy to see in the gallery today: Alex, we fought through and together on this debate when the public and so many of our contemporaries were against us, so no-one deserves more credit for this outcome than you-no-one. I suspect the term was originally developed as a means to demonise, but the members for Brisbane, North Sydney and Leichhardt, who I'm very proud to have surround me today, as well as Senator Smith, can reclaim the title of 'rainbow rebel' as an exclusive moniker of courage and conviction. A heavy burden fell to us, and you have all lived lives of consequence, particularly you, Warren. Trev, Trent, Deano and I fought with our hearts because this debate chose us; you chose this debate because justice rests in your heart. With the indulgence of the Speaker, the person I have to thank most is my partner, Ryan. You've had to tolerate more than most because you had to put up with me. Government members interjectingWe both know this issue isn't the reason we got involved in politics-give us tax reform any day-but in my first speech I defined our bond by the rings that sit on both of our left hands,",69,Lgbtiq Community In This Place My State Colleague Penny Sharpe Mlc And Of Course
17,Mr Tim Wilson,"Trust me! This debate has been the soundtrack to our relationship.and that they are the answer to the question we cannot ask. So there's only one thing left to do: Ryan Patrick Bolger, will you marry me? A response having been received from the gallerywas a yes, a resounding yes. Congratulations; well done mate. congratulations to the member for Goldstein. Last week this House did not sit but I came to Canberra to support our senators in the historic work they were doing to pass the bill that is now before us. And pass it they did, with a thumping majority of 43 in favour to 12 against. I've now been a member of this parliament for 10 years. Last Wednesday, when the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 passed the other place, it was one of the most momentous days I can remember in a decade of parliamentary work. In the third reading debate on this bill last Wednesday, Labor's leader in the Senate-a courageous and tireless advocate for marriage equality-declared: Every day it is a great privilege to stand in this place, but there are some days which are of great moment, which change our country for the better. This is such a day. This week, in this place, it is my sincere hope and intention that we will reaffirm the momentous decision taken by our Senate colleagues last week and pass this bill, unamended, to make marriage equality a reality. It is easy to understand why so many Australians have found federal politics so difficult to engage with over recent years. The hyperpartisanship that has infected our national debate in so many areas is dispiriting for many Australians who do not want to see partisan scrapping but want to see the national parliament as a venue for a genuine contest of ideas, a place in which the elected members look at what needs to be done and then work out how to best bring that change about, a place in which we engage in debate with sincerity, authenticity and passion to determine how best to-as Senator Wong said-change our country for the better. There's no doubt in my mind, or in my heart, that this bill will make our country better. It does this by ending a significant form of discrimination against a great many Australians and transforming what has been a source of ongoing pain into a source of joy for all those Fundamentally, this bill is about expanding freedom in our nation by granting to all Australians the freedom to marry the person they love. I have no doubt that this government's marriage law survey was conceived as a delaying tactic by those opposed to marriage equality. But, as wasteful, divisive and destructive as that survey was, it has shown, indisputably, that the large majority of Australians, in every state and in every territory, support marriage equality.

21,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (11:24): I start withthrough those bills without meaningful debate, without the people directly impacted by those laws or the wider Australian public having a chance to even read them. An example that leaps to mind for me are the changes to native title law, which were rammed through this House by the government against Labor opposition in February this year. Fortunately, the government does not control the Senate, so the opposition and the crossbench senators are often able to demand public consultation on laws that this government would rather pass without scrutiny. This bill, which was introduced in the Senate on Wednesday, 15 November-but which was made public months earlier-is not such a bill; in fact it is the opposite. What this bill does is embody in law the unanimous recommendations of a Senate multiparty committee report on the appropriate form of legislation for marriage equality. That committee comprised members from the government, from Labor, from the Greens and from the crossbench. It consulted extensively with the Australian community over a number of months. And, then, the members of that committee worked hard to hammer out a unanimous, consensus position. Cross-party agreement on a contentious manner is a rare event in our politics, but that committee achieved it, and this bill honours that unanimous position. We should not fracture that rare consensus now. This bill is not perfect, but consensus is built through compromise. The point is that the compromises made in this bill are acceptable compromises. There are some who argued passionately against any kind of exemptions from our antidiscrimination laws. Those advocates argued, among other things, that to allow religious bodies and individuals to continue to discriminate against LGBTIQ Australians wanting to marry, despite the passage of laws for marriage equality, undermines the very principles of nondiscrimination that this bill is founded on. But they compromised. It was painful for many, but the majority of those advocates came to accept that a competing value, that of freedom of religion, would also have to be accommodated in giving effect to marriage equality. On the other side, too, compromises were made. Many religious groups and individuals who subscribe to religious doctrines which hold that LGBTIQ people cannot marry came to accept that their religious faith was not affected by the fact that other people might have a different view of marriage. They did, however, insist that, given the deep spiritual significance of marriage ceremony, ministers and religious celebrants should not be obliged to solemnise marriages for LGBTIQ Australians if to do so was contrary to their religious beliefs. Protection for ministers of religion is provided for in explicit and extensive terms by this bill and will become law if this bill is passed. I will read the relevant part, section 47(3), because, from some of the commentary we have heard about this bill, you might think that it contained no protection for freedom of religion at all. A minister of religion may refuse to solemnise a marriage despite anything in this Part, if any of the following applies: (a) the refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the religion of the minister's religious body or religious organisation; (b) the refusal is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents to that religion; (c) the minister's religious beliefs do not allow the minister to solemnise the marriage. And then there's an additional subsection (4): This section does not limit the grounds on which a minister of religion may refuse to solemnise a marriage. The bill also provides comparable protections for the religious freedoms of an entirely new category of marriage celebrant-a religious marriage celebrant. This new category is created by the bill to cover marriage celebrants who are not ministers of a recognised religion but who nevertheless claim a religious objection to solemnising same-sex weddings. Again, to allow celebrants, who are empowered to solemnise marriages by the civil law of Australia, to be able to discriminate against LGBTIQ Australians, despite the passage of civil laws allowing for marriage equality, involved a major compromise on the part of many advocates of marriage equality. This is what section 47A of the bill states: (1) A religious marriage celebrant may refuse to solemnise a marriage despite anything in this Part, if the celebrant's religious beliefs do not allow the celebrant to solemnise the marriage. And I'll go on to mention section 47B, which provides further protection for religious bodies in these terms: (1) A body established for religious purposes may refuse to make a facility available, or to provide goods or services, for the purposes of the solemnisation of a marriage, or for purposes reasonably incidental to the solemnisation of a marriage, if the refusal: (a) conforms to the doctrines, tenets of beliefs of the religion of the body; or (b) is necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion. I've read out all these provisions because I want to make clear the extent to which this bill protects the freedom of those with religious views opposed to same-sex marriage. It protects them to enable them to continue to live their lives in accordance with those views. Labor supports religious freedom and Labor respects the fact that there are a range of views on the question of marriage equality and on how religious freedoms should be protected. This bill provides appropriate protections for freedom of religion in relation to marriage while also implementing the clearly expressed will of the Australian people to make marriage equality law. There is no need for further amendments. The issue of how best to balance competing human rights is a perennial one and I, and my Labor colleagues, welcome debate on how best to protect religious freedoms in our nation while, at the same time, protecting other human rights such as the right to freedom from discrimination. But the debate on this bill is not the right time or place to engage in such a wide and far-ranging debate. Debates about how better to protect human rights, including freedom of religion, are vitally important for healthy democratic nations such as ours. It's precisely because of the importance of these debates that they should not be rushed but be open, considered debates that involve the entire Australian community. In recognition of the complex nature of new legislative measures to protect religious freedoms, the Prime Minister has established an expert panel tasked with conducting a broader view of protections for religious freedom. The panel will be chaired by Philip Ruddock, a former Attorney-General, and includes Australian Human Rights Commission president Rosalind Croucher, former Federal Court judge Annabelle Bennett and Jesuit priest and human rights lawyer Frank Brennan. If people and organisations want to engage in a wider discussion about the protection of freedom of religion in our nation, that discussion should occur under the auspices of the Philip Ruddock panel. In closing, I want to return to the historic significance of the bill now before us and to thank some of the many people who have been instrumental in fighting to make marriage equality a reality in our nation, a reality we are now on the cusp of delivering. The changes to our nation that will be made by this bill have been hard fought for over many years. A number of members of this parliament from all parties have worked tirelessly to bring us to this historic moment. Senator Penny Wong, Senator Louise Pratt, Senator Dean Smith and Senator Janet Rice have all played a vital role. In this House there are too many to name, but the leadership of the member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition, and of the member for Sydney, the deputy leader, in the fight for marriage equality has been outstanding. And they have been enthusiastically supported by many members of our caucus, including, in particular, the member for Whitlam and the member for Griffith. Across the aisle I want to acknowledge the courageous stance of the member for Leichardt, the member for North Sydney, the member for Brisbane and the member for Goldstein, who have had to swim very hard indeed against the current in their own party. But, of course, the greatest thanks must go to the many members of the Australian laws. I want to thank everyone in rainbow Labor. There are so many people I could name and thank for their involvement in this campaign, but a few of those I've worked closely with and whose contribution has been extraordinary, are Anna Brown and Lee Carnie from the Human Rights Law Centre, Rodney Croome, Corey Irlam, Tom Snow, Tim Gartrell recently, and Alex Greenwich throughout. This is a great moment for our country. At long last, after too long a delay, we have a bill to achieve marriage equality before the House of Representatives-a bill which has already passed the Senate. It will be a greater moment when, as I sincerely hope, this bill passes this House and marriage equality is finally a reality. It will be a moment which makes Australia a better place. few weeks ago. He's lived in his apartment in Greenwich, in my electorate, overlooking our glittering harbour for much of his life. During the course of those 98 years, Neville has borne witness to many of the events that have shaped our nation. He's lived through the terms of 23 prime ministers and the reign of four monarchs. The Great Depression, a world war and the Cold War, the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the advent of the computer age and the growth of Sydney to become one of the world's great multicultural cities have all been part of his life story. And, as someone who happened to be born gay, he has been part of the incredible transformation in the way in which our society has regarded homosexuality. For two-thirds of Neville's life, simply being gay was effectively a crime in New South Wales. As a young man, it would have been beyond his wildest imagination to dream of an Australia in which his sexuality was accepted without shame or ostracisation, where his rights were protected and not prosecuted, an Australia that's parliament included openly gay members, including his own representative, and an Australia in which he could choose to marry the person he loves. Yet all of these things will be achieved in his lifetime. Thirty-nine years ago-in fact, on an anniversary celebrated just yesterday-Neville met the person who was to become his lifelong partner. He and Ian Fenwicke have shared their lives together since that day. They have loved, honoured, comforted and protected each other and will do so as long as they both shall live. Yet, for those 39 years, they have not been able to proclaim and share their commitment in love in the same way as every other Australian. Our laws have treated them differently. This week, in this parliament and with the",72,Lgbtiq Australians Who Want To Express Their Love Through The Institution Of Marriage
22,Mr Zimmerman (North Sydney) (11:38,"Neville Wills celebrated his 98th birthday aoverwhelming support of our fellow Australians, we have the opportunity to change that. And, early next year, once we have done so, Neville and Ian will marry. I reflect on their story because it encapsulates the reasons marriage equality is at long last being debated in this House and why I have been a co-signatory to the bill before it. Their hopes and aspirations reflect the importance of marriage in our society for so many people yet denied to some simply because of their sexuality. This legislation and the outcome of the postal survey which preceded it are an important part of our nation's journey towards acceptance and respect for those of us who are gay, lesbian, transgender or intersex. The significance of both cannot be understated, not just for members of the LBGTI community and their families and friends but for those millions of Australians who hold, as our birth right, the nation of a fair go, where our laws treat all Australians equally and fairly. These are principles that are not revolutionary. They are part and parcel of our liberal democracy and the promise that extends to all its citizens-the right to live their lives according to their own hopes, values, talents and ambitions. They are at the core of the belief structure which makes me a Liberal. Marriage equality is simply a logical extension of those ideals. Despite our own progress, in so many parts of the world gay and lesbian people remain persecuted. We have seen, for example, gay men publicly flogged in the name of sharia law in one of our nearest neighbours. In the troubled Middle East, the mad men of ISIS have taken pleasure in executing homosexuals, often in the most barbaric of ways. In Chechnya, members of the gay and lesbian community have been systematically rounded up and arrested, tortured and often killed by their own government. In so many countries, being gay is still considered a crime. We as a nation, therefore, should be proud of our liberal democracy, our commitment to individual rights and all we have achieved. So, for me, marriage equality should be regarded not, as some have asserted, as a threat to the values of Western civilisation but as rather their triumph. For much of human history, marriage has been a stabilising and important bedrock for relationships and for families. While not every Australian in a relationship will choose to marry, for many it remains a powerful affirmation of love, commitment and shared responsibility. It is an act of devotion sanctioned by the law and proclaimed through wedding ceremonies witnessed by families and friends. For many years, support for marriage as an institution took something of a battering. Yet, today, we have a part of our community knocking on the door and seeking to be admitted. For me, as a Liberal, today's debate is about ensuring our law treats each other equally. For those who come to this debate from the conservative tradition, I want to say that marriage equality should be seen as a victory for this ancient institution. Who would have thought we would see the day when the Socialist Alliance and Lee Rhiannon would be marching on the streets for marriage? It will grow stronger and more popular as more have the opportunity to join its ranks. I know there are some who have typified this debate as fundamentally altering an institution which has been immutable since ancient times. This has certainly been the tenor of the correspondence of some of those who have emailed and written to me arguing against marriage equality. Yet the reality is that, like all strong and continuing institutions, marriage has changed and adapted over the centuries. It is simply wrong to say that marriage is the same today as it was 50 years, 100 years or even longer ago. My friend Paul Ritchie chartered some of those changes in his outstanding book, Faith, Love and Australia: The Conservative Case for Same-Sex Marriage. In its long history, the concept that marriage is about two people who come together through love is a relatively new one. Paul Ritchie quoted in his book the significant 18th century jurist, Lord Blackstone, who said of marriage, 'By marriage, husband and wife are one person in law', and that person is the husband. That does not sound like a concept of marriage which would resonate in Australia today, thankfully. And for so long, interfaith and interracial marriages were regarded as taboo, often with the enforcement of the law, as Aboriginal Australians experienced in parts of our own nation as late as the mid-20th century. No institution survives and flourishes without change, but the irony of this debate is that gay and lesbian Australians don't actually want to change marriage; they simply want to be allowed to join it. They want to marry to partake in the same benefits and happiness that other Australians enjoy and which the advocates of marriage so rightly extol. During the course of the last 18 months, I've received some beautiful letters and emails from couples longing to marry and I want to quote one of those today, which to me summarises why gay and lesbian Australians have been fighting so hard for this week to come. The email came from a Western Australian who I do not personally know. He wrote: We have been together for seven years. I am truly blessed to have him in my life. We are more in love today than ever before. He is a saint in my eyes-he completes me and he makes me a better person. He is my rock, my best friend, my wisest counsel and my confidant. So thank you for fighting for us to be recognised as being as good as anyone else, and thank you for fighting to affirm that our love-our great great love affair-is as valuable and worthy of being cherished and affirmed like anyone else's. It is this love, this commitment and this union of minds that so many parents, brothers and sisters, friends, relatives and work colleagues see in the lives of gay people they know which led them to vote yes for marriage equality in such overwhelming numbers. This bill will deliver the marriage equality Australians voted for when they gave the parliament not just a mandate greater than any government has received in our nation's history, but, in effect, a direction to get it done. It has its genesis in the unanimous cross-party findings of the Senate select committee, and the bill was released by Senator Smith, the members for Leichhardt, Goldstone and Brisbane and I in August. Importantly, the bill protects those religious freedoms we hold dear and which properly relate to the functions of the Marriage Act. This has been a key consideration for us, and in this bill we protect the rights of religious organisations and their ministers. We ensure that religious bodies may refuse to make facilities available or to provide goods and services for marriages that do not conform with their own religious beliefs and we offer similar protections to existing celebrants who choose to register as religious marriage celebrants. These will sit alongside existing Commonwealth laws which make clear that our schools can hire and teach according to their own religious values and that no person can be discriminated against in the workplace because of their religious beliefs. Not one clause or one word of this bill will change the existing rights of any Australian in relation to their religious freedoms. And nowhere does this bill seek to restrict the right of any Australian or organisation to hold beliefs or present the case for a traditional marriage. This bill restricts itself to issues relating to marriage, not an unreasonable proposition for a bill that actually seeks to amend the Marriage Act. But I know that many have argued the need for a broader discussion about religious freedoms in Australia and this is a call that I support. I welcome the Prime Minister's decision to bring together an expert panel led by our esteemed former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock to consider and report on these issues. Its deliberations will allow us to determine whether broader reforms are needed. The Marriage Act is not the legislation for achieving that goal, it's not the place for a partial bill of rights, it's not the place for the Commonwealth to assert new legislative powers over the states in relation to our schools and it's certainly not the place to respond to Australia's vote for a greater equality by winding back existing antidiscrimination laws. We have a good bill, now endorsed by the Senate, and I hope that this chamber will lend it its support. In the coming week, we will bring to a close an issue which has been discussed in the Australian community for over a decade. We would not be able to do so without the leadership provided by many in this parliament, on both sides of the House, and in the broader community. In this chamber I want to acknowledge particularly the member for Leichardt, whose tenacity and leadership have just been extraordinary. Who would have thought a crocodile farmer from Far North Queensland would become a gay icon, although he does occasionally look like a member of the Village People! I also recognise the members for Goldstein and Brisbane. As new members in this place, the last 12 months have, on occasion, taken their toll and tested our mettle. I don't think we have been found wanting in standing by our convictions. To my friend in the Senate, Dean Smith, your determination and very senatorial attention to detail and process have brought us here today. We've known each other for 25 years, and it's fair to say that, when we first knew each other, there wasn't much love, because of the divide in the Young Liberals, but I'm glad that is no longer the case. I thank the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet for providing a pathway where none seemed possible. I thank the thousands of Liberal Party members and supporters who joined together under the banner of Libs and Nats for Yes, led so ably by Andrew Bragg and Luke Barnes and supported so eloquently by many others. I particularly acknowledge Christine Forster in this regard for her powerful advocacy, and I'm so pleased that she and Virginia will no longer require the British consulate for their own wedding early next year. Outside this place I record my appreciation for the work of the Equality Campaign and people like Alex Greenwich; Tom Snow; Anna Brown; the mum from Mosman, Janine Middleton; and of course the face and voice of the 'yes' campaign, Tiernan Brady. How could anyone say no to that Irish lilt? I also acknowledge my own community in North Sydney, 72 per cent of whom voted yes. Almost every conversation I had with members of the community, both those voting yes and those voting no, was conducted respectfully and genuinely. I cannot describe how much it meant, during some of the darkest moments, when complete strangers would approach me and simply say, 'Good on you for standing up for what you believe.' Most importantly of all I thank Carlos, the man I love, for being the best example I could have as to why we all aspire to find the person who will unconditionally love us and be at our side. Finally, I recognise the role of young Australians. The outcome of the postal survey was, more than anything else, a victory for the new generation of Australians who have grown up beside gay and lesbian friends or family members, who know their dreams and ordeals are no different to their own and who wondered why marriage equality should even be an issue at all. They enrolled to vote like never before, they formed the core of the campaign teams that fanned out across the nation, and they convinced so many of their parents and grandparents that it was time for change. At shopping centres and at train stations I saw their excitement and enthusiasm at the thought that they could make history and change Australia for the better. I say to them: 'You have done just that.' Those young Australians, along with yes voters of all ages, have helped ensure that every loving relationship is valued and treated equally. They have sent the message that our community embraces each of its citizens, no matter what their sexuality. Too many Australians have lived a life of denial and too many of us have experienced that great debilitating shadow that comes from the fear of discovery or rejection. Many still do today, but Australians, through their vote, have helped bring about change. They have said every Australian should be able to be simply who they are. For that, I thank them. I commend the bill to the House. Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (11:53): I'm delighted to be here finally debating a marriage equality bill that has a chance of passing the Australian parliament. I'm even more delighted to be doing so in a week when we hope that we will be voting on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I'm particularly delighted, because I have spent so much time working with the LBGTI community, both publicly and within the Labor Party, for marriage equality to be made a reality. The commitment that Labor has to marriage equality was demonstrated very well by the fact that Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, took to the 2016 federal election a commitment to legislate for marriage equality in the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government in the event that we were elected. It's a shame that we as a parliament have taken so long to get to a point where we're even allowed to have a vote on marriage equality. Were it not for the work of Labor over many years, including the work of the member for Whitlam, Senator Louise Pratt, Senator Penny Wong and the members for Sydney and Maribyrnong, it's absolutely the case that we wouldn't be in a position to pass a marriage equality bill through this parliament. It is because of the work of Labor over many years that we now have a situation where it can be passed through the parliament. In the midst our delight, gratitude and relief for the imminent passage of marriage equality, I think it is important to recognise that there's also distress. Harm has been caused not just by the fact that there has been so much delay in relation to marriage equality and not just by the fact that we have had a situation where we weren't even allowed to have a vote in the House of Representatives until now. It is the fifth year of this Liberal government. That is how long it has taken for us to even be allowed to vote on a bill to have a free vote on marriage equality. But it's not just about that delay; new and creative processes for delay were created-like the plebiscite, which was defeated, and then the postal survey, which couldn't be defeated because it was a creature of administrative government. It's not just those things; it's the hurt that was felt during that postal survey. I don't want to gloss over it. I've had enough of hearing from people about the hurt that they felt when their kids came home from school and talked about what had been said to them about whether their family was normal. I heard from the Victorian AIDS Council about middle aged men who were feeling like they were being judged. I went to the candlelight vigil for World AIDS Day on Friday night in Brisbane. As I looked around me at the men in their 60s and 70s, and women, from the 1980s was being brought up for them again in this situation where we had a national opinion poll about their relationships, their families, their identities. In speaking on this bill, predominantly I want to celebrate it. But I can't brush past that, and nor should anyone else. Every member of this House would have received information from the mental health group ReachOut, who said that they'd had a 40 per cent spike in demand for their mental health services from LGBTI people through the survey process. And they were particularly concerned about that because LGBTI people who use their service were shown by research to be 40 per cent more likely to be at risk of suicide. These are not minor issues. They're issues that should be acknowledged. I think it is important to say to my LGBTI friends who are in the gallery, or listening somewhere else, that I acknowledge the price that you have been asked to pay to have the same right to marry as everyone else. It's been a high price. But, as I said, I predominantly want to celebrate the fact that we look like we're on the cusp of achieving marriage equality in this country. So many people have talked about the personal stories they've heard-whether it's from close friends, family members or complete strangers. As I said, I was at the World AIDS Day vigil on Friday night, and I ran into my friend Phil Carswell. I won't say his age because that would not be polite. He is now planning a wedding-between bouts of dialysis. I had a party on the weekend. Some friends of mine, John and John, came along-again, I won't say their ages but they're very distinguished gentlemen. AndI thought: how long they have had to wait just for this acceptance of their relationship, this acknowledgement that their relationship is not any more or less equal than anyone else's. We've heard the personal stories from our friends, from our families and from complete strangers. Those people deserve to know that this parliament will rectify the discrimination that is presently entrenched against them in our marriage laws. I want to congratulate everyone in this parliament who is doing that. To those who do not support this change in our marriage laws: I of course respect your right to disagree but I don't accept as legitimate those who sought to create fear in relation to marriage equality, those who sought to make us fear this change. If you are afraid of what the consequences might be-as much of my incoming correspondence from people who voted 'no' in this survey would suggest-I hope you will take heart not from me as a Labor Party member but from the compelling conservative case that has been made for marriage equality by many people. For example, it has been made in Cameron's Britain but also by my friend Senator Smith, who is a deeply conservative, genuine Liberal in the Senate. He has made a strong, conservative and compelling case for marriage equality. I think my politics could not be more different to Senator Smith's. I hope that those who voted no in good faith will take heart from the conservative case that has been made in respect of marriage equality. I also want to acknowledge that this is not the bill that I would have wanted had I been able to wave a magic wand and change the law myself. I know it's got concessions in it, and they are significant concessions. I know that this bill creates a new class of religious marriage celebrant and that the bill grandfathers existing civil celebrants so that they can move into that class within a short period so that they can continue to discriminate if they wish to do so. I acknowledge that that is the creation of a new right to discriminate. That is an additional carve-out from our anti-discrimination legislation, above and beyond the existing carve-outs that already exist in anti-discrimination law. I acknowledge also that this bill creates rights for others based on religious belief. Of course I acknowledge that it is hurtful that we will have a form of service provider who's entitled to discriminate against you because you're in a same-sex couple. I know it's a significant concession, and I hope that those who feel hurt by the concession will agree with us that this is an acceptable compromise-not the bill that we necessarily would have wanted but an acceptable compromise in the circumstances. This bill will allow two people to marry. That's what it'll do. It won't detract from anyone's rights; it will increase people's rights. It will make us a more equal society. It will seek to remove discrimination to a large extent. It's something that should be celebrated. It's a bill that I think Senator Smith can, rightly, be very proud of. I acknowledge his colleagues who have worked so hard for it: the member for Goldstein-and congratulations on your engagementthe member for Brisbane; the member for North Sydney; the former member for Brisbane, Teresa Gambaro; and, of course, my very good friend the member for Leichhardt, who has done an excellent job, and it's a wonderful thing to see you back here today in the chamber. Mr Snowdon interjectingMs BUTLER: It is-it's wonderful. I also want to acknowledge the strong leadership that's been shown over many years on the Labor side of this House by the Leader of the Opposition; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, who has borne a much more personal and heavy burden than anyone else with her leadership role; and the Shadow Attorney General, who has undertaken a great deal of detailed technical work in respect of this bill and previous bills. Like many other speakers, I want to thank Rainbow Labor, including my friend Sean Leader from Queensland, who worked for so long to change our platform. I remember, just over six years ago, our national conference, where Sean, despite having some terrible things going at home with family members' health, still made it all the way to the conference, went to Sydney and argued for us to change our platform. It's because of the work of people like him, hundreds of rank and file members of the Labor Party, and the leadership of members of parliament that the platform was duly changed. I want to thank my colleagues on the parliamentary 'yes committee'-there's a committee for you: Senator Louise Pratt, the member for Bruce and Senator Sam Dastyari. I also want to thank Penny Sharpe MLC, who did so much work coordinating volunteers to go and observe the postal survey process-an important part-but also for her leadership over many years in relation to marriage equality. I want to thank just.equal. I see that Rodney Croome is here. I'm not sure whether Ivan Hinton-Teoh has made it, but they have been excellent advocates. Shelley Argent from PFLAG is here-someone who has worked so hard over decades for marriage equality. I want to thank Sally Rugg from GetUp!, who is here-she has made it in. Sally has worked incredibly hard over a very long period of time. I also acknowledge A4E and AME, and all the people who have already been acknowledged who are in gallery. I feel like I could recite Tiernan Brady's stump speech to you, I've heard it that many times-but I couldn't do the accent! But also I thank Shirleene Robinson, who is not here, and my local Queenslanders from AME and A4E; Pete Black; Nita Green, who ran such a hard and strong campaign; and, of course, Brisbane Pride and Deeje Hancock; and all of the local LGBTI campaigners and their families and friends, who just made thousands and thousands of telephone calls and who doorknocked, went to public events and held public events. I had amazing groups in my electorate, like the Bulimba marriage equality group who would be out on the roundabout with amazing colourful signs. It was really something special. I also want to thank Rainbow Families, and all parents who sought to protect their kids from being hurt when the nation was asked to pass judgement on their lives. I want to thank mental health organisations like drummond street, Qlife and Switchboard-excellent LGBTI-led organisations of the community that helped people through the difficult process-and, of course, mainstream organisations like Orygen, ReachOut and headspace. I thank The LGBTI Legal Service in Queensland, which bore a lot of the brunt of receiving information about some of the worse aspects of the public campaigning against a marriage equality 'yes' vote. AndI particularly want to thank-and it's important that I do so-the assistant national secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Paul Erickson, and his team in our national secretariat. Of course it was a very broad campaign, and people from across different parties were brought together to work together. I acknowledge the work of Andrew Bragg and Luke Barnes and Liberals and Nationals for Yes. But when you want a massive grassroots campaign, you want the ALP national secretariat and the labour movement of this country behind you. And between Paul Erickson and his team and the work of all of those labour movement campaigners, they really mobilised a lot of people to make phone calls and knock on doors and produce materials; they really got a lot of grassroots campaigning done. If it had not been for all of those people, I think that we would not necessarily have seen the result that we did see. So thank you to everyone: to everyone who has campaigned, and I mean not just in the survey but for years; to everyone who has worked; to everyone who has taken really annoying phone calls from me, demanding answers at short notice-Anna Brown is smiling at me! And thank you to everyone who has stood up and fought for a fairer nation, a nation with less discrimination and with greater access to human rights, and to everyone who has not necessarily been part of an organised campaign or up the front but who has stood up for marriage equality on every possible occasion. Thank you very much. You've done your nation proud. And there will be many, many weddings that you'll be attending in the near future, so I hope you've got a lot of money for gifts organised! Thanks very much. I commend the bill. The Australian people have said yes to marriage equality, yes to fairness, yes to commitment, yes to love. The time has now come to make that equality a reality. This is momentous social reform, and the road to this day has been long and arduous. It is littered with injustice dealt out to men and women who dared to confess their love. Not so long ago, homosexuality was a crime in this country. Slowly-too slowly-parliaments and the people have changed their attitudes to gay men and women and extended basic rights. Homosexuality was decriminalised. Gay Australians were allowed to serve in the military. It",75,Lgbtiq Community Who For Years Have Campaigned For This Momentous Change To Our
23,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth,"Prime Minister) (12:08): It's time for us to get on with it.was 47 years ago that Lucy's father, Attorney-General Tom Hughes, created a scandal which saw his preselection challenged in Berowra when he argued that homosexual acts should no longer be crimes. How times have changed. Throughout my time in public life, whether in government or in opposition, I have sought to ensure that same-sex couples are not discriminated against and that their entitlements, be they in respect of medical benefits, taxation, superannuation or employment, are no different to those accorded to heterosexual couples. I remember in 2007 persuading John Howard's cabinet, on the eve of the election, that we should give partners in same-sex relationships rights to Commonwealth and Defence superannuation-the same rights as those in heterosexual relationships. I remember the Department of Finance had a few reservations, but they were purely financial. Then, in 2008, the HREOC reforms effectively eliminated all legal discrimination, at least at the federal level, but the issue of marriage remained. The message today to every gay person in this nation is clear: we love you and we respect you. Your relationship is recognised by the Commonwealth as being as legitimate and honourable as anyone else's. You belong. I'm the first Prime Minister of Australia to be unequivocally and consistently in support of legalising same-sex marriage. It will be forever to the credit of the coalition that this momentous social change occurred with the overwhelming mandate of the Australian people under a coalition government. I am very firmly of the view that families are the foundation of our society, and we would be a stronger society if more people were married-and by that I mean formally, legally married-and fewer were divorced. If consulted by friends about marital dramas, I always encourage the singles to marry, the married to stick together, the neglectful and wayward to renew their loving commitment and the wronged to forgive. I have to say that I'm utterly unpersuaded by the proposition that my marriage to Lucy or indeed any marriage is undermined by two gay men or women setting up house down the road, whether it is called a marriage or not. Let's be honest with each other: the threat to traditional marriage is not from gay people; it is from a lack of loving commitment, whether it is found in the form of neglect, indifference, cruelty or adultery-to name just a few manifestations of that loveless desert in which too many marriages come to grief. If the threat to marriage today is lack of commitment, then surely other couples making and maintaining that commitment set a good example rather than a bad one. Are not gay people who seek the right to marry, to formalise their commitment to each other, holding up a mirror to heterosexuals who-regrettably, in my view at least-are marrying less frequently and divorcing more often? Commitment, loyalty, responsibility. John Howard was most definitely not thinking of gay couples when he said in 1995 that 'a stable, functioning family provides the best welfare support system yet devised'. But the point is well made. Co-dependency is a good thing. If we believe two gay people are better off together than living alone comforted only by their respective cats, then why should we deprive that relationship of equal recognition? And, for those who see this as an ideological issue, recall British Prime Minister David Cameron, as he spoke for marriage equality six years ago: And to anyone who has reservations, I say: Yes, it's about equality, but it's also about something else: commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. SoI don't support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I'm a Conservative. As I said at the start of the marriage survey, this is an issue of fundamental fairness. A society which promotes freedom and equality under the law should accord gay men and women the right to marry. We now recognise same-sex couples in every other aspect of the lawfinancial, medical, adoption-but we have not yet given them the right to call their relationship a marriage. This distinction will end with the passage of this bill. And, of course, it ends with the emphatic endorsement of an enormous majority of Australians. The postal survey was one of the most remarkable political events in my lifetime, and I believe in the lifetime of many Australians. It was a voluntary postal vote for an allegedly apathetic nation, where anyone under 40 apparently did not know what a letterbox was, let alone where it could be found. And of course it had no prospects in the High Court either. Well, we won seven-nil there, Mr Speaker. My prediction rate for High Court cases is down to fifty-fifty, so I don't want to lower the average any more, but we did very well there. All of those assumptions were shot to ribbons. The survey was brilliantly designed, managed and executed, and great credit is due to the ABS, to the AEC and of course to Senator Cormann, who was the Acting Special Minister of State. But, above all, the credit is due to the Australian people, 80 per cent of whom cast a vote. That was remarkable. Nobody predicted that or expected that. In a general election, where we actually fine you if you don't vote, the participation rate is only a little bit above 90 per cent. This was a remarkable turnout and it proved what we always said: that Australians wanted to have their say. The survey had many opponents, most notably on the other side of this chamber. In fact, this moment would have come far sooner if the opposition had supported our original plebiscite proposal in this parliament. It was an exercise both in good planning and execution, and also in legal ingenuity, to find a way to deliver on our election promise to give everyone their say and do so without legislation, which of course the Senate had denied us. So we delivered on our promise. We promised the Australian people their say. We said, 'If you say yes, then we will have a free vote in the parliament,' and that is precisely what we are delivering. It is, I must say, a matter of great regret that the Labor Party is denying its members a free vote on the amendments, both in the Senate and in this House. The best thing about the result has been the tremendous affirmation of same-sex couplesindeed all gay Australians-in the result. In voting yes, Australians have thrown their arms around fellow Australians who are gay and said clearly, 'We accept you. We accept your relationship.' I hope that in that positive affirmation, the most positive you could have in a democracy, same-sex couples take comfort in the acceptance and the love of their fellow Australians. There were many who voted against change, but I know that they will accept and respect the democratic outcome of the process. They voted no for many different reasons. Some believe homosexuality itself is sinful. Others simply wanted to keep the legal definition of marriage as it has been for thousands of years. I respect the vote of every Australian, both 'yes' and 'no'-we made sure they could be heard-and I recognise the fundamental importance of ensuring that freedom of religion and speech are protected. The bill has been designed, as Senator Smith said in the Senate when he moved it, to ensure religious freedom is protected. I do not believe that the bill threatens our cherished religious freedoms-there is nothing in the bill, for example, which prevents anyone from maintaining or adhering to the teaching of their church on marriage or morality-but we must not fail to recognise that there is sincere, heartfelt anxiety about the bill's impact on religious freedom. That is why I will support several amendments to the bill which will provide that additional reassurance in respect of these fundamental rights and freedoms. This is a historic moment of inclusion, of recognition, of respect. It has been talked about for many years. Previous governments have failed to take it on. The Labor Party did nothing about it for six years in power. But now with this strong message from the Australian people, which my government enabled, the way is clear. We are united in our diversity. Our values of mutual respect have made Australia the most harmonious and the most successful multicultural society on the planet. Australians have shown by the enormous turnout that they're deeply engaged with this issue. They voted overwhelmingly for a country built on equality, where the law does not discriminate against you on the basis of your sexual orientation any more than on the basis of your race, religion or gender. Today is a day of which every Australian should be proud, proud that we can conduct and did conduct-despite all the naysayers-a very civil debate and proud that, given the opportunity to vote, far from being apathetic as the naysayers predicted, we participated in such enormous numbers. This is a day to be especially proud that all of our friends, our colleagues, our neighbours, our brothers and our sisters can marry the people they love. For those who voted no and remain disappointed with the result, it is a day to be proud that your voices were heard and that you have a government that ensured your voices were heard, as you wanted. They were counted and, ultimately, as you acknowledged, the majority was decisive. The postal survey gave the ultimate democratic seal to this historic change. I commend all the men and women who fought for decades to bring this reform about-so many of them, indeed, in my electorate of Wentworth. This is a cause I understand and have been close to for many years. It is a long list, but surely in this place at the head of the line of advocates stands perhaps the most unlikely but in many ways the most patiently persistent: the member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch. Most of all, I say to same-sex couples in Australia: you are equal, you are respected, you are loved. I commend the bill to the House. contribution on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. When same-sex marriage was last debated in this place, in 2012, as the result of a private member's bill, I opposed the measure in support of retaining the traditional definition of marriage. From the outset, I should declare that I am a Catholic. I grew up in a religious household, which probably accounts for some measure of my social conservativism. I also felt it was better for children to grow up with a mother and father. However, as a long standing member of parliament, I'm only too familiar with the levels of domestic violence, child abuse and neglect that are occurring in some of our nuclear families. I've certainly refined my views in this regard and now believe that children simply need unconditional love, care and support from parents, and to live in a safe environment. Having said that, I consider the situation before the House today markedly different to when we last debated same-sex marriage in 2012. Given the efforts to establish a national consensus and now having the result of the nationwide survey, the question of same-sex marriage has effectively been taken out of the hands of parliamentarians. Therefore, as I see",82,Lgbti Community It Was Impossible Not To Think About How The Shame And Stigma Of The
24,Mr Hayes (Fowler,"Chief Opposition Whip) (12:20): I also wish to make ait, our obligation is to bring about the legislative measures necessary to give effect to the expressed will of the Australian people. The simple fact is that the Australian people overwhelmingly decided in favour of marriage equality. Prior to the national survey I publicly stated that, despite my personal views in favour of the retention of the traditional definition of marriage, should the nationwide survey on same-sex marriage result in a 'yes' vote I would not frustrate or delay the passage of the legislation to give effect to the nation's decision. The same-sex marriage survey was commissioned as a national exercise to produce a national result. Now, while I voted no-as, I hasten to add, did the majority of my electorate-I believe it would be hypocritical and disingenuous to have participated in that democratic process and then not accept the outcome. For me, the debate is no longer about whether the definition of marriage should be amended to allow same-sex marriage but rather the manner now in which we should move forward. We must ensure that the issue of same-sex marriage is dealt with effectively, whilst making provisions for appropriate safeguards. In saying that, I find the title of this bill a little misleading-particularly its reference to religious freedom. From my reading, that's certainly not the purpose or the actual design of the amendment to the federal Marriage Act. It is appropriate that we have a respectful discussion, first to identify the religious freedoms that may be impacted by the introduction of same-sex marriage and then to determine the level of protection required in the context of Australia's legal framework. Echoing some common ground in this regard, Anna Brown, the Director of Legal Advocacy of the Human Rights Law Centre, and more recently spokeswoman for the Equality Campaign, indicated that she believed religious freedom should be protected in law. A similar view was also expressed by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, who, in their concluding observations on Australia, expressed concern about the lack of direct protection against discrimination on the basis of religion at a federal level. I appreciate the fears held by various religious institutions that enacting same-sex marriage could impact on religious freedoms, particularly in respect of the teaching of doctrine and the functioning of various faith based organisations, including schools and aged care and those responsible for the provision of welfare. While the issue of same-sex marriage has placed a particular focus on religious liberty, we should be clear that this legislation before us is but one area of federal law that could impinge on religious freedom. Nevertheless, I regard these as legitimate concerns and matters that need to be addressed in order that our laws do not unintentionally act to violate one's genuinely held beliefs. Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, which have already recognised same-sex marriage, we do not have a bill of rights, which in those countries accords a measure of protection to the rights of freedom of belief, freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. Now, I'm certainly not advocating for a bill of rights, but I do consider it far from ideal that religious freedom in this country is solely protected by exemptions and exceptions in various state and federal antidiscrimination laws. I note that freedom of religion is specifically provided for in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The covenant is an international legal instrument to which Australia is a signatory and effectively defines many of those rights and privileges that reflect our democratic values. However, to date, we have not attempted to introduce the tenets of article 18 into Australia's domestic law. I do think this is an area that warrants some further consideration. Nevertheless, it's important that any legislative protection for religious freedom only places limitations that are reasonable, necessary and proportionate. I'm convinced it would not be prudent to attempt to address the complex matters of religious freedom solely in the context of this bill, other than addressing those matters directly relating to the actual performance of marriage ceremonies. This bill should not be a legislative attempt to cover the field or an opportunity to use religious freedom as a means to frustrate the passage of this legislation. Father Frank Brennan, the CEO of Catholic Social Services and a prominent human rights lawyer, alluded to this when he said: The Marriage Act amendments need to include adequate protection for freedom of religion in the conduct of marriage ceremonies. Other issues of religious freedom should be dealt with by the tweaking of existing legislation … However, he did go on to say that we may need to specifically address issues of religious freedom in federal legislation and possibly reflect the protections that currently exist in both Victorian and ACT legislation. I believe we will need to address the shortfalls in Australia's legal architecture to provide specific protection for religious freedom. However, this is a complex area requiring detailed consideration, and therefore I'm pleased with the establishment of the expert panel led by Philip Ruddock to examine the human right to religious freedom and to do that exercise independent of the marriage amendment bill. I would expect that those with a genuine interest in religious freedom, and not simply as a means to frustrate the passage of legislation, will engage with the expert panel during their deliberation. I note that the expert panel are required to report back on 31 March next year. Therefore, I think the responsible course is to await their recommendations before attempting to legislatively address the issue of religious freedom. If we are to respect the will of the Australian people, I believe it is important that we separate the complex questions of religious freedom from the issue of marriage equality. Fiona McLeod, the President of the Law Council of Australia, emphasised this point when she said: Australians were not asked to vote on the complex intersection between religious freedom and antidiscrimination protection, so it is appropriate that any major changes are not bundled with amendments to the … Bill. Nevertheless, I remain committed to working positively with the Ambrose Centre for Religious Liberty and those who hold a genuine interest in protecting religious freedom in this country. However, for the reasons that I have outlined, I support the passage of this bill, confident that it reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Australians. Australia has been settled. Australians were rightly given an opportunity by this government to have their say. They have spoken, and it's time to get on with it. As one of the principal proponents of the original plebiscite, I wanted to ensure that, whatever the outcome was, the country would reconcile itself to it. I was among the 39 per cent who voted for the traditional view of marriage to be maintained. As a nation, we must now move forward in grace and in love, as my Christian faith teaches us. I will respect the democratic outcome of this Australian",85,Lgbti Community It Was Impossible Not To Think About How The Shame And Stigma Of The
25,Mr Morrison (Cook,"Treasurer) (12:30): The debate regarding same-sex marriage inmarriage survey, both nationally and in my own electorate, by not standing in the way of this bill. However, with the closure of one debate, a new debate does commence. This debate is not that new. It's not about opposing same-sex marriage at all or delaying the passage of this bill. It is about simply protecting religious freedoms in this country. There are almost five million Australians who voted no in this survey who are now coming to terms with the fact that they are in the minority. That did not used to be the case in this country for most, if not all, of their lives. They have concerns that their broader views and beliefs are also now in the minority and therefore under threat. They are seeking assurances from this House and this parliament at this time-whether one agrees or disagrees and whether rightly or wrongly-that the things they hold dear are not under threat because of this change. On the night of the first referendum to establish our Federation, in June 1898, Alfred Deakin prayed: Thy blessing has rested upon us here yesterday and we pray that it may be the means of creating and fostering throughout all Australia a Christlike citizenship. In an earlier speech campaigning for the Federation in Bendigo, quoting a local poet, he defined the true goal of Federation as being for us to 'arise united, penitent, and be one people, mighty, serving God'. Our Constitution went on to proclaim: … the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, humbling relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth … with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal… And, at section 116, our Constitution deliberately afforded the protection that 'the Commonwealth shall not make any law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion'. This is the religious inheritance of our Federation-our Constitution, from more than a century ago. If we ever act in dissonance with these founding principles, I believe it will be to our nation's great peril. This is not to say that Australia is a nation with an established state religion. Thankfully, it is not. We are, thankfully, free of such a restriction on our liberty. Such freedom should not be used, though, as a weapon against the importance of faith, belief and religion in our society or as a justification to drive faith and religion from our public square. At the same time, protection of religious freedoms cannot be used as a cloak for religious extremism that undermines our very freedoms. We may be a secular state but we are not a godless people to whom faith, belief and religion are not important. Quite the contrary: it is deeply central to the lives of millions of Australians. In my own church, we refer to Australia as 'the great south land of the Holy Spirit'. Whether you raise your hands, bow to your knees, face the Holy City, light incense, light a candle or light the menorah, faith matters in this country-and we cannot allow its grace and peace to be diminished, muffled or again driven from the public square. Separation of church and state does not mean the inoculation of the influence of faith on the state. The state shouldn't run the church and the church shouldn't run the state. In fact, the separation of church and state was set up to protect the church from the state-not the other way aroundto protect religious freedoms. As I argued in my maiden speech in this place 10 years ago, secularism, secular humanism, is no more our established state religion than any other. It is one of the many free views held by Australians. It holds no special place of authority in our Commonwealth or in this place. For millions of Australians, faith is the unshakeable cornerstone of their lives. It informs their identity and provides a genuine sense of well-being. It is the reason why people can look beyond their own circumstances and see a greater purpose. For countless Australians, faith is life. In my maiden speech I spoke of the two influences on my life-my faith and my familyand how my faith in Jesus Christ was inherently personal, not political. As Christians we do not lay claim to perfection or moral precedence; in fact it is the opposite: conscious of our own frailties and vanities, of our human condition, Christians should be more conscious of the same in those around us. That is why faith encourages social responsibility, the bedrock of faith in action. I quoted Abraham Lincoln in that speech, stating that our task is not to claim whether God is on our side, but to pray earnestly that we are on his. I pointed to my two heroes of faith, William Wilberforce and Desmond Tutu, the latter of whom supports samesex marriage, men of courage and conviction who fought valiantly against the prevalent evils that had become a stain on society and who delivered immeasurable social gains: freedom from slavery, the unravelling of apartheid and the coming together of a deeply divided nation. Countless lives were saved or improved, because two men were compelled to act by their faith. As a guide and an empowerment, faith can change nations and the course of history. In the formative stages of the Free Mandela campaign, Bishop Tutu told the BBC that Mandela would be Prime Minister within five to 10 years. The reporter mocked this pronouncement as hopelessly optimistic. His response highlighted the anchor on which his faith was based: Brother, the Christian faith is hopelessly optimistic because it's based on the faith of a guy who died on a Friday and everybody said it was utterly and completely hopeless–ignominious defeat. And Sunday He rose. The fragrance of faith has washed over our society for centuries and helped to shape and mould it for the better. Our own nation was founded, built, and undeniably shaped by Christian values, morals and traditions that helped to unite a fledgling country-a nation blessed by and formed on Christian conviction. These issues of faith are gifted to us not only by our Federation fathers but also by the many generations of Australians who have come to us since, including those from non-Christian faiths and experiences, who share the deep seated conviction and positive influence of faith in their lives. A few years ago I had the honour of visiting Lebanon for the ordination of our Maronite bishop in Australia, Antoine Tarabay. There, in the striking Maronite patriarchate above the bay of Jounieh, this generous and kind-hearted Sydney bishop committed himself to the sacrifice of ministry as the leader of his Australian flock. It was a deeply moving experience, in surreal surroundings, that resonated within me the importance of a life lived in the pursuit of God and the service of others. But it was the tour later, with my dear friend, Joseph Assaf, of the Holy Valley and the ancient villages in the north of the country, such as Hardine, Bsharri, Ehden, Hasroun, Kousba and concluding in Tannourine, the bishop's home village, where we had the final service to commemorate his ordination-a very special time-that truly reinforced to me once again the potency, persistence and importance of faith in society and our individual lives. These villages had been ravaged for centuries by one bitter war after the next, a constant cycle of upheaval, violence and heartache, but there was one thing that could never be stripped away through the millennia of struggles, one thing that sustained these stoic communities. It wasn't the governments that came and went with the wind and it wasn't the leaders that so promised peace; it was their faith, a faith that routinely stared adversity in the face and prevailed, a faith that held families together. When everything else was a struggle, their faith stood strong. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese Maronite Australians brought that faith with them to Australia from as early as the 1860s, but so too did many Greek Orthodox migrants, Coptic Christians from Egypt still being persecuted to this day in their home country because of their faith, Syrian Christians from both Orthodox and Catholic faiths, Armenians, and many Chinese, Korean and Filipino Australians of Catholic, Baptist, Anglican, Presbyterian and Pentecostal faiths. Some brought their faith with them; some found their faith here in Australia. When most of the migrants came to Australia, it was not the government they turned to to assist them to adjust to their new life in Australia. It was their local church; it was their local parish priest; it was their imam; it was whoever in their faith community to whom they turned to support them and their family-it was their religious community. If you want to understand the strong opposition in Western Sydney and elsewhere to changing the Marriage Act, you must understand the central nature of faith and community to the lives of these and so many other Australians. Nine out of ten of the electorates that voted no are indeed represented by members opposite. They comprise the vibrant faith communities I've just spoken of. I urge all members in this place, but particularly those opposite, to be freed up, to be released from any possible constraint that would enable them to stand with their constituents now in supporting amendments that deliver the protections of religious freedoms that are not currently present in this bill. To pretend this bill is whole and satisfies their concerns is to confirm a lack of understanding and empathy for those who hold them. These Australians are looking for acknowledgement and understanding from this parliament and their representatives. They are seeking assurance that changes being made to our marriage laws will not undermine the stability and freedom of their faith and religious expression, what they teach their children, what their children are taught in our schools, and the values they share and foster with their families and community and within and without the walls of their churches. This is a reasonable request that should be supported by members. I commend the Prime Minister for initiating the Ruddock review into protecting religious freedoms. Few people understand these communities, and their concerns and the issues and the risks, as well as our former Attorney, the former Father of the House. But that process is not, nor was it designed to be, a substitute for sensible action now in passing amendments to this bill. To fail to make improvements to this bill now would demonstrate a failure to appreciate not only the underpinnings of our very liberal democracy and federation but the nature of modern multicultural Australia. I commend my colleagues both in the Senate and in this House for standing firm on their convictions and beliefs, and I stand with them-both representing their faith and those in their communities that share those beliefs and values. I will be joining many of my colleagues in supporting amendments to be moved by the members for Deakin, Mitchell, Canning and Mallee, and I'll be joining them in moving amendments also to ensure that no organisation can have their public funding or charitable status threatened as a result of holding views that are consistent with the traditional definition of marriage between a man and a woman. The test of faith is the fruit that it produces. That is what Jesus taught in his parable of the fig tree. The fruit of faith based organisations has been extraordinary in this country: Mission Australia, Wesley Mission, Caritas, Angliss, Anglicare, BaptistCare, our religious schools, and the many Christian organisations involved in providing pastoral support under that excellent program. Their funding through grants and other programs and support through our tax system through deductible gift status must continue to be about what they achieve, not what they consider to be the definition of marriage, and nor should they be discriminated against for holding those views. We need to ensure these protections are put in place in this bill. It is now time to pass a truly inclusive bill, one that recognises the views of 100 per cent of Australians, not just 61 per cent. I urge the House to not miss that opportunity. debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 and to once more, as I will, vote for marriage equality in this country, as I did in September 2012, when this matter last came to be voted on in this chamber. I, along with 41 colleagues, supported a similar bill then and I assuredly will be voting for this bill today. I indicated well before the marriage survey was undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that I would be voting that way in this chamber, should we be given the opportunity. I have not changed my view and I will be voting for this legislation. I want to make a few comments and I'll just, in short, express my disappointment at some of the ways in which the Prime Minister characterised this debate, as if it were somehow or another a creature of the government. It is not a creature of the government. It is a creature of the parliament. I think the Prime Minister and the way he expressed himself about this being a force from the coalition, effectively, was very ungracious. I don't think it properly accounted for the way in which this parliament is seeking to deal with this legislation. I want to commend my mate sitting over there-gruff old bugger that he is, the member for Leichhardt-for steadfastly advocating for this position for many years against the forces within his own party. And it's not because of the party; it's because of him and others like him in his party and people across the parliament with similar views that we have this legislation. This is a cross-parliamentary piece of legislation. It does not reside with the government. SoI say to the Prime Minister: think again about the way you're portraying this debate. It is not fair, it is not reasonable and it's unacceptable. AndI would say to those who have, as the member for Cook has just done, spoken to us about people of faith and how, in his description of people of faith, they need to be supported by seeking amendments to this legislation to ensure religious freedom: there are many people of faith in this parliament who oppose that view. I am one of them. I'm a Catholic. I was raised a Catholic. I still go to church-not as regularly as I perhaps should but often. AndI accept the proposition that it's okay to have different views. I note the words that have been in the public domain by Frank Brennan, referred to earlier by the member for Fowler. It is possible to see this as an issue of equality, not faith. It is a matter of equality, not faith. It's a matter of recognising the rights of every single person to share the same rights as every other person regardless of whether they are straight or a member of the LGBTIQ community. This has been a tortuous discussion which has taken many years to arrive at this point. AndI was actually encouraged yesterday. I shouldn't do it as often as I do, really, but I was flicking through my emails yesterday and I noticed an email from the Anglican bishop for",87,Lgbti Community It Was Impossible Not To Think About How The Shame And Stigma Of The
26,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (12:43,"It gives me great pleasure to be participating in thisWangaratta, in Victoria, the Right ReverendA John Parkes AM, who authored a letter cosigned by six other Anglican bishops from across Australia in which they pointed out why it was important for us to support this legislation. If you'll bear with me, I want to read just two paragraphs of this letter. It was addressed to the Prime Minister. 'Given the magnitude of this task in the wake of the marriage proposal survey result, we commend the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 to the parliament for the following reasons. First, it has been available for many months, providing opportunity for scrutiny by all those concerned. Second, it responds directly to a detailed cross-party Senate report from February 2017. We observe that the Senate committee received extensive submissions from all stakeholders. Third, the bill has strong cross-party support. This is vitally important after a testing public debate. Fourth, the bill was passed by the Senate with an overwhelming majority.' The next paragraph reads: 'The bill also confirms substantive benefits. It preserves the fabric of our antidiscrimination laws, which have been developed over half a century. These give expression to democratic values of equality and fairness. It also accords fulsome recognition of the religious rights and freedoms that underpin a democratic, plural and multicultural society.' Hear, hear! That is why, when it comes to proposing the motions to amend this legislation, I can't put it any better than those Anglican bishops. And that is why, when it comes to voting on amendments to this legislation, I'll be opposing those amendments and I encourage others with a similar view to do likewise. As those bishops have reminded us, this bill is about equality and fairness. Another element of this is the survey. I'm on the record as being opposed to the survey from the get-go. I still think it was a very flawed process and I'll explain why in a moment. But the Prime Minister said, 'If we'd gone down the government's route of a proposed plebiscite, we would have had this all done and dusted.' Well, if the government had the guts to bring the legislation to the parliament straight after the last election and if we had done our job as we are paid to do, it would well and truly have been done and dusted without any plebiscite or public survey. We are paid to be here representing the people of this country, debating legislation every day. We don't send other pieces of legislation out as public surveys to find out what people think. We take it upon ourselves to accept the responsibility of having those debates in this parliament, expressing a view and then voting one way or the other-and that's what we should have done here. Nevertheless, the survey was undertaken and, by all accounts, a large number of people participated-but, I have to say, not in my electorate. I made the point prior to this survey being carried out that there would be great difficulty in my electorate. Lingiari is 1.34 million square kilometres and covers all of the Northern Territory except Darwin and most of Palmerston. It includes a large number of Aboriginal communities. Not one of those communities in the bush has household mail delivery. Not one. Most have a mail collection centre. If they're lucky, they might actually get their mail at some point. That assumes, once they get it, that they can read it and understand what's in it. But, of course, we know that a very large number of Aboriginal people in my electorate have English as a second or third language and have a great deal of difficulty reading documents of the type that we would expect them to read in this sort of survey. It's no surprise that the participation rate in Lingiari was only 50.1 per cent. We've heard a lot across the parliament about young Australians participating in this survey. In my own electorate, the participation rate of 20to 24-year-olds was only 39.3 per cent. What does that tell you? Does it tell you that they were engaged? Of course not. Does it tell you that they understood what was happening? Of course not. Did they even know what was happening? Probably not. SoI don't think this is a fair assessment of the views of my community. Those views might have contradicted my own, but that is not the point here. This survey was supposed to elicit responses from all Australians. We've heard about the high levels of the response rate nationally. But, when I pointed out these concerns well before the survey took place, I was just pooh-poohed-'No, that's not going to happen.' Well, we know what happened. We know that in some places there are allegations of people not understanding what the ballot papers were for and not understanding the nature of the debate. In some local communities, I understand from reports, surveys were burned due to a lack of understanding about what was being asked. We also know of one significant report-and I believe this happened-of one family member going to the postal receipt centre and, in front of the postal workers, filling out large numbers of forms for their family members without authorisation. I made those points at the time and I won't say much more about them, but this was not something which was useful to the people of my communities. Of course, there were a number of videos sent out by the bureau in 13 different languages in my electorate-well, there are about 100 different languages spoken in my electorate, so 13 videos are not going to help much. I am very concerned that this was a $122 million price that we needn't have paid in the first place, but, having done it, we've now got what I think is a very good result, considering that so many people have voted yes. I'm pleased that they have done so, and I know it accords with the majority view across this parliament. I want to thank those many members of my communities who have engaged themselves in this debate. In particular, I thank one of my own staff for the work she did and what she and her partner had to put up with. There were very negative aspects to some of this campaigning. There was graffiti saying, 'Gay is not okay,' written on large signs along the Stuart Highway not far from my electorate office. This message hits rainbow families-the loving rainbow families who have young children-and vulnerable LGBTIQ people in our community hard. My electorate officer Kirsty Hunt and her partner of 18 years, Amber Sayers, needed to explain to their six-year-old daughter on the way to school that, in fact, it's okay to be gay. That was unnecessary. I also understand the absolute commitment and love that so many gay couples around this country have for one another that will now be recognised in law, as a result of this. It will allow them to do what every other Australian has got the right to do, should they choose to do it, and that's get married. By the way, I'm not married, but I've been in the same relationship for nearly 34 years and we've got four wonderful children. I've got the right to marry, but we've chosen not to. I want every Australian to have the right that I've got, and that is, if they so choose, to marry. I extend my thanks to the 'yes' campaigners in Lingiari and in the small communities across the Territory, particularly Andrew Addie and Maya Newell in Alice Springs, Pat Honan in the Top End, the gay pride committee and the organisers of the inaugural Darwin gay pride march. I also want to thank two people who I know will see great virtue in, and celebrate, the day we pass this legislation: two Nhulunbuy women, Carley Scott and her partner, Pep Phelan. I've spoken to Carley, and I know how wonderfully important this is to her, as it is to so many people I know and people I have known over generations. They are wonderful people who have gay partners, who are members of the LGBTIQ community and who want to participate and have a loving relationship and be recognised in the law. They should be allowed to do so. This bill will do it. I commend it to the House. of the member for Leichhardt to bring about the change that we debate today. I should also note the passion and the commitment of the members for Brisbane, Goldstein and North Sydney and, indeed, of Senator Smith in the other place. I admire the commitment that they have brought to this long campaign and I accept that what they have fought for for so long should now come about. Yet almost five million Australians voted no in the recent plebiscite and their voices should be heard in this chamber, and their views should also be respected. They are not bigots. They are simply people who are respectful of traditions handed down from time immemorial and slow to change them. It's no secret that I haven't been a supporter of same-sex marriage. I won't be opposing this bill, though, because I respect the verdict of the Australian people as expressed in the postal plebiscite. When it comes to same-sex marriage, some countries have introduced it via the courts, some via the parliament, and others, Ireland and now Australia, by vote of the people-and that is the best way because it resolves this matter beyond doubt or quibble. To have a plebiscite was in fact an Abbott government decision. We opened the door to change but ensured that change would not lightly be made. I'm pleased that the plebiscite has been continued by the Turnbull government, and I'm also pleased that eventually all sides of this parliament participated fully in it. There were strong views expressed in the course of the campaign. Some of those strong views were mine. I'm proud of my fellow 'no' campaigners because they gave marriage the good defence that it deserved, but I do congratulate the 'yes' campaign on their victory. There was a lot said beforehand about how divisive this debate would be, but, from where I stood, there was little rancour, no hysteria and no abuse. Certainly there was none from the 'no' campaign. The overwhelming support for same-sex marriage that the plebiscite showed is a sign of the warm acceptance that Australians have for gay people. There may indeed be a few homophobic individuals lurking amongst us, but no-one should ever again claim that Australia is a bigoted or intolerant country. As the plebiscite abundantly demonstrated, we are as easygoing as any country on Earth, and, whatever your race, your creed, your gender or your sexuality, to be an Australian is well and truly to have won the lottery of life. And, if indeed same-sex marriage does turn out to mean that there are more stable and more lasting relationships in this country, gay as well as straight, then it will have strengthened our social fabric and become something that, once established, a conservative won't just accept but will actually support. So gay people, their parents, their siblings, their children, their wider families and their friends should savour this success, and again I congratulate the 'yes' campaign for its victory. Now, I would like this to be a unifying moment for our country, and the best way to make this a unifying moment for our country would be to acknowledge the continuing concerns that many decent Australians have about freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and parental rights. The best way to make this a unifying moment for our country",91,Lgbti Community It Was Impossible Not To Think About How The Shame And Stigma Of The
27,Mr Abbott (Warringah) (12:58,"I should begin by acknowledging the tireless effortswould be to ensure that the antigay prejudice of the past is not replaced by a new politically correct bigotry. We certainly don't want new forms of division to replace old ones. And we did see, on the fringes of this recent campaign, some worrying signs of a new intolerance. There was the attempted prosecution of the Archbishop of Hobart for a booklet on the traditional Christian teaching. There was the sacking of a Canberra teenager for supporting marriage on her Facebook page, and there was the persecution of Coopers Brewery merely for hosting a Bible Society debate on the nature of marriage. More thought should have been given prior to the plebiscite to protecting rights, and that's why I'll be moving the amendment that's been circulated, not to stop this bill but to assert the principle that people should never be discriminated against because of their conscientious views about the nature of marriage. That's why there should be further amendments in the committee stage to protect freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and parental rights, and I'm pleased that the Prime Minister has indicated that he will support moves to better protect these rights. I hope these amendments will be supported, because surely these are rights and freedoms that all of us in this place believe in. And it should happen now, in the course of passing the same-sex marriage bill, because there should be no gaps in the protections of our fundamental freedoms. AndI believe that the passage of the bill, as amended, will enable our country to go forward together, united in decency and in respect for the rights of all. NowI certainly don't pretend to be an overnight convert supporting same-sex marriage, but I am pledged to respect and to facilitate the verdict of the Australian people. Same-sex marriage should now be recognised. It will now be recognised. There should be a clear distinction between marriage as understood by the church and marriage as recognised by the state. On that basis, I am looking forward to attending the marriage of my sister, Christine, to her partner, Virginia, sometime early in the new year. I move: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that it is vital that individuals and entities are not disadvantaged nor suffer any adverse effects as a result of conscientiously holding a particular view of the nature of marriage"". Mr Andrews: I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 moved by the member for Leichhardt in this parliament today. In June 1990, my courageous friend Paul O'Grady, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, came out as a gay man. He was most certainly not the first gay man elected to the New South Wales parliament, but it took until 1990 for someone to have the confidence to declare their sexuality openly. When I discussed this move with Paul, he said very clearly, 'I am who I am.' It was an act of courage that made it much easier for other people in the same circumstance as Paul to openly declare their sexuality. In 1993, three years later, he and his partner, Murray, were attacked and harassed on William Street. Paul O'Grady, a member of the Legislative Council, dialled triple 0. He tried to convince the person on the other end of the phone that he was being threatened by a gang of youths in what",94,Lgbti Community It Was Impossible Not To Think About How The Shame And Stigma Of The

29,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (13:06,"I'm proud to stand in support of the Marriagewas known colloquially as 'poofter bashing', which occurred then and still occurs today. He was hung up on, a member of the Legislative Council. When we talk about discrimination and the fear in society created by intolerance and hatred, it is important today to recognise the courage of those gay men and lesbian women over decades in which debate was far different to what it is today. People like Paul, I think, couldn't have imagined us having a debate in the parliament with such broad support for marriage equality across the political spectrum. So today I begin by paying tribute to people like Paul; to people like Craig Johnston, a Sydney city councillor; to people like Lex Watson, the academic; to people like Julie McCrossin; to all those people who marched in 1978 in the first Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. They marched not in a parade that was being cheered and shown on national television; they marched in a parade towards a confrontation with police, who locked them up, who assaulted them and who abused them. Part of the reason that today is so important is that today, in supporting this legislation, we are saying that we are a tolerant nation, that we are a respectful nation and that we are a nation that is stronger because of our diversity. I think it is unfortunate that we will be one of the last advanced industrialised nations to recognise marriage equality when this legislation is passed. Nonetheless, catching up with the rest of the world is a good thing. I pay tribute to all those who did the hard yards-the really hard yards-to get us to this place. In 1996, in my first speech in this chamber, I mentioned removing discrimination on the basis of sexuality. In my first term of parliament, after consultation with the gay and lesbian community, I moved the Superannuation (Entitlements of same sex couples) Bill in this chamber. It says something about where the debate was then compared with now that we couldn't even get a debate on that issue; that legislation wasn't even supported by every member of my own party. But what it did was lay some groundwork for a debate within my party about the need to tackle discrimination. And, of course, eventually, under the first term of the Rudd Labor government, we removed some 84 pieces of discrimination that were in legislation. This was discrimination not just in areas like superannuation, but in social security, immigration and health care. When I was first elected, there were very real circumstances of partners of loved ones being denied access to their partners when they were in hospital. There were issues whereby couples who shared houses were thrown out of the house that they had lived in with their partner because of non-acceptance by the family of that partner. The scourge, of course, of HIV-AIDS was still having a massive impact-including, of course, taking the life of Paul O'Grady, who showed his courage once again in openly declaring that he was HIV-positive and therefore being able to lead a campaign for the care that was required. Of course, Neal Blewett, as health minister in the Labor government, led the world in responding to the HIVAIDS epidemic, literally resulting in thousands of lives being saved. So, today, this is unfinished business on that march towards equality, in the march towards respect for each other. It is a reminder that society does move forward, although not always in a straight line. Opponents of progress do fight for the status quo. Reactionaries do seek to turn back the gains of the past. But here in this parliament progress is moving forward. Human rights are moving forward. Parliament is not leading in this case, of course; we're following. We are following the voluntary postal ballot that was held. I am very proud to support this legislation, and I won't be supporting amendments to this legislation. This has been through the process of a Senate committee. This itself is a compromise to this legislation. It's one that will not have an impact on religious freedom. I'm a strong supporter of religious liberty. People would be aware that, unlike many of my colleagues, at ALP national conferences I have strongly argued, even when I've been in a minority, for these issues to be dealt with as a conscience vote. I firmly believe that that's the case. I've consistently argued that on the ALP national executive regardless of what people who I normally agree with have to say on those matters and I will continue to do so. But the fact is that people's religious freedom will not be impacted by this legislation just as marriage won't be undermined by this legislation. Indeed, the institution of marriage will be strengthened by this legislation by more people being able to participate in it. During the postal ballot campaign, with people I had respectful discussions with, I indicated that I would support the Dean Smith bill, that it was the model that was there. Those who insisted on having a postal ballot should, I believe, accept the result. We asked Australians for their views, and they gave us their answer. As a result of this legislation, not much will change. All that will happen is that one group of Australians who currently don't have the same rights that I had to marry my life partner, my wife, and other people have to marry their partner of the opposite sex will have the same right to celebrate their lifelong commitment to their partner in front of their family and friends. Weddings are joyful occasions when people come together to witness the affirmation of love, and won't it be a good thing when more people can participate in it? The issue of religious liberty is one that I take seriously, and I look forward to the deliberations of the committee that has been established under Philip Ruddock and will be reporting next year. I certainly have always been respectful of people who disagree with my position on marriage equality. That is why I've argued for a conscience vote to be the way that this issue and other issues such as this are determined. I don't believe that people should ever be in a circumstance of having to choose between their allegiance to their political party and to their spirituality and their faith. I strongly believe that that's the case. But this legislation will not have any such consequences. Indeed, once this legislation is carried, people will wonder what the fuss was all about, because it won't undermine anyone's existing relationships; it will just strengthen the relationships of people who choose to have their relationships solemnised in a marriage who are in same-sex relationships. I do want to say this about some of this debate though. Some have sought to speak about how every child in the world needs a mother and a father. We've got a bit of a debate at the moment about citizenship in this parliament as well. People would be aware that I was raised by a single mother and in circumstances whereby, every time. I hear that, what I hear is intolerance. WhatI hear is that somehow some families are better than others. What is truthful is that what matters in a family is love and care. I was in a two-person family and I got from my mother all the love in the world that I-that anyone-could have asked for. People in same-sex relationships with children of same-sex relationships are parents who have gone out of their way to have children and to care for them and love them, and what matters in a family is love. It's as simple as that. No family structure is better than any other, and I really believe that one of the important things about the legislation before us today is that that will be formalised by the parliament. In conclusion, can I say that this legislation is a good moment in this parliament. Some of the best moments since I've been here, whether I've been on the majority or minority side, have been conscience votes. I think we should have more of them, not less, frankly, whereby parliamentarians can make their contribution. I want to say that it's particularly good to be with people like the member for Sydney, the member for Melbourne Ports and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Penny Wong, in particular, who has shown such courage over a long period of time, in internal and external debates, to get us to the position we're in today. The member for Leichhardt has also shown great courage in advancing this issue within his party, and I pay tribute to him and others who have been prepared to really push this issue and ensure this reform happens. It is, however, of course, the Australian people who have led the parliament on this issue. I've been convinced for some time that a majority of Australians had shifted their view to favour marriage equality some time ago. I hear many Australians say: 'I didn't used to support marriage equality. I do now.' I don't know of anyone who has said it to me the other way around-who has changed their mind from 'yes' to 'no'. Australians want us to live and let live. They've decided that as individuals we have no right to cast judgements on love as it is felt by others. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired) was strongly opposed to same-sex marriage. I did not agree with it, would not support it, and never believed that it would occur in Australia. My views were very much based on my religious views that marriage is simply between a man and a woman. Over the years, right up to 2015, I continued to hold that strong view, and I brushed aside the abusive emails, the phone calls and even the protests outside my office and stood very proudly in firm opposition. I even ignored the views of my former police colleagues that I had to move on with the times, and they regarded me as a dinosaur. This is very interesting, because when I was first a police officer, there were offences for loitering for the purpose of homosexuality, and all police members. I knew were firmly opposed to same-sex marriage. There were three events which occurred which changed my view. The first was a chance meeting with Chris Tanti, the former CEO of headspace, a foundation that is dedicated to improving the mental health and well-being of young Australians. We met in the foyer of parliament, where we were having a discussion about the sad loss of lives in La Trobe due to youth suicide. As part of the conversation, Chris pointed out to me that far more young homosexual males take their own lives than any other demographic group. When I asked why, he told me it was about acceptance. If they felt that they were not accepted, this often led to depression, drugs and finally the loss of life, as they believed they could no longer go on. Very sad indeed. The second was a brief conversation over the phone with a long-term friend, Claire Rimmer, who lives with her partner, Anna. When I casually mentioned that I had another wedding to go to, Claire quietly said-and this was on the phone-'I would love to get married.' She did not ask me to change the law, she did not try to pursue the matter, but just left it at that. However, I was a bit shocked, so I asked her why. Claire simply said, 'I love Anna and want to marry her.' They will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of their relationship in April next year and fervently hope to marry on that date. That was the end of the conversation, but it started to make me think, 'Why shouldn't same-sex couples be allowed",95,Lgbti Community It Was Impossible Not To Think About How The Shame And Stigma Of The
30,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (13:21,"Back in 2004 when I was first elected to parliament, Ito marry?' However, I kept on going back to my original thought that marriage is between a man and a woman. Finally, when I was out and about in my electorate of La Trobe, I found I was meeting not just same-sex couples but also their families. Sometimes parents of people in same-sex relationships would come into the office and meet with me, telling me about their son or daughter without their knowledge. They would bring photos of their child and their child's same-sex partner. For the first time. I started to see that my views of same-sex marriage were causing great sadness to others-not only people in same-sex relationships but also their parents, who, like parents everywhere, want their children to be happy and have fulfilling lives. I then realised it was time for me to seriously rethink this issue, which I did. Following that, I decided I would now support same-sex marriage. AfterI announced my change of position in my electorate, I caught up with good friends Jayson McNaughton, a local dentist, and his partner, Stephen Walden, who have been in a relationship for seven years and whom I've known for six. They've always respected our friendship and, again, have never pressured me to change my views on same-sex marriage, despite their belief that they and other same-sex couples experience discrimination because they cannot marry. They would like one day soon to be able to declare their love to the world through marriage. So, when they heard I had revised my view, they were both incredibly happy and excited. In 2015, I made another decision, which was to ask my electorate for their views on the issue. I decided to run a survey and that, whatever the outcome, I would honour my role as a representative of parliament and follow the wishes of my electorate. As I had changed my own view, I must admit I was hoping for a 'yes' outcome, and the result was that, out of 5,168 constituents who voted, 3,011 voted yes, 2,036 voted no and there were 121 'undecided' responses. So a significant majority of La Trobe residents who responded were in favour of same-sex marriage. The survey brought forth some surprises because it demonstrated how many people from the community supported same-sex marriage-members of the local CFA and football clubs, and a variety of businesspeople. I was even quietly told by some churchgoers and teachers at religiously based schools that the time had come for change. This sentiment in my electorate was reinforced with the recent national postal vote, with 67.5 per cent of La Trobe's voters signalling that they are in favour of same-sex marriage, which, of course, is noticeably greater than the overall national statistic of 61.6 per cent. I would like to congratulate Minister Peter Dutton, as the postal vote was his idea. I also congratulate and thank Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for his support in the postal vote. I also congratulate and thank Warren Entsch. When he first raised this in the party room, back in the Howard days, everyone would just look at him and think, 'What are you on about, Warren?' But he is dedicated to making his vision a reality. This national figure of 61.6 per cent support for same-sex marriage brings Australia into close alignment with a number of other nations, such as Canada, which showed support of 70 per cent; France, at 67 per cent; Ireland, with its plebiscite at 64 per cent; the Netherlands, at 64 per cent; New Zealand at 57 per cent; and the UK at 66 per cent. However, it should also be remembered that not everyone supports same-sex marriage, and in La Trobe 32.5 per cent voted no. The views of those 32.5 per cent are views of the minority now, but they still deserve to have their voices and concerns listened to when it comes to religious freedoms. So here I must point out that I do care about religious freedoms and I do not believe that a celebrant or priest should be forced by law to perform a same-sex marriage if they are against that because of their religious belief. I also respect the right of religiously based schools to select staff with the same values and beliefs as those being taught at their school, and I support the protection of parents. In addition to schools and parents, charities must not be discriminated against because of their firmly-held beliefs. I also believe that the issues not addressed in the same-sex marriage bill must be addressed by the panel chaired by Philip Ruddock that will review protections for religious freedoms. But ultimately I would like to keep away from all the moral and religious arguments around the issue of same-sex marriage and continue to concentrate on this issue from the point of view of people's health. This takes me to the issue of suicide. CanI say: this was not the main reason for changing my decision to support same-sex marriage, but it was the start of my journey for change as gay people told me about the great stress they were under as they believed they were not accepted in society and that the biggest stumbling block was their inability to marry.

The debate may be resumed at a later hour, and the member for La Trobe will be given an opportunity at that time to conclude his contribution. Queensland State Election Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (13:30): I am a proud Queensland Labor member and, after the state election last Saturday, I stand here proud of my Queensland Labor colleagues. The Queensland Premier always said this was going to be a tough election, but Queenslanders knew that Labor was the only party they could trust. It was only Labor that Queenslanders could trust not to sell our assets. It was only Labor that Queenslanders could trust to deliver on local jobs. It was only Labor that Queenslanders could trust to invest in health, TAFE, education, roads, energy and infrastructure. The Herbert community knew that only Labor would fund the first stage of water security and deliver $215 million for the pipeline duplication. Our community knew that only Labor would deliver the Oasis, a defence hub, and jobs for our veterans, ex-serving personnel and their families. The Herbert community in Queensland remembers the former Newman government Treasurer Tim Nicholls and what he did to Queensland. We remember the 398 cuts Tim Nicholls made to Townsville Hospital and Health Service frontline services. We remember the 197 local TAFE workers sacked under Tim Nicholls. The Palaszczuk Labor government reinstated frontline health service workers. Labor has a plan for TAFE and jobs-the 'Queensland first' policy for local jobs-and, importantly, our infrastructure spend of $1.6 billion. That will happen under the Palaszczuk Labor government. I congratulate the Premier. She is not only the first woman to win government from opposition, but the first to be re-elected as Premier for a second time.

Parliament House: Honey Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (13:33): It has already been an unbelievable day here in the parliament. In addition to the start of the marriage equality bill debate in here, the parliament is abuzz with excitement today as, just this morning, we got to see the first honey from the parliamentary beehives. People swarmed to the Great Hall today to see and taste the wonderful honey produced by millions of bees in the gardens of this beautiful building. Each bee produces a single teaspoon of honey in its short yet productive six-week lifetime. To create the 20 kilos of parliamentary honey, millions of bees have buzzed around us diligently doing their job and pollinating and foraging. Unlike some in this place, they have not taken a week off to avoid some hard work. And those doing the work of the hives producing this honey are all female bees-flying, dancing and working for the common good of the colony-and their lives give us this honey. Yesterday I joined fellow apiarists in helping to harvest this honey. My husband, Jamie, and I are both beekeepers and we have kept a single hive for years. We were delighted to join the head beekeeper, Cormac; Sarah, the 'bee whisperer'; Siobhan, an amateur apiarist like me, who is one of the many people who work in this amazing building; and Luke and Kali, who also serve the parliament here. It was 'unbeelievable' to be the first to turn the key on the parliamentary Flow Hive yesterday under the guidance of Don Anderson, an elder from the Anderson clan, who invented the Flow Hive, a very surprising Aussie invention.

33,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (13:34,"I present a petition certified by the PetitionsThe concerns represented by the 48,985 petitioners are shared by countless other Australians. Many parents throughout Australia believe that these programs are inappropriate and misleading, and that's why they would like to see them thoroughly reviewed. The petition read as followsEducation Programs such as ""Safe Schools Program"", ""Catching on Early"" and ""Catching on Later"", which were founded and supported by The Australian safe schools coalition, teaches students inappropriate content comprised of comprehensive LGBT gender theory and as a result undermines religious, cultural and family values. We fear that kids who are exposed to this type of highly sexualized content may become very likely to develop stress and high levels of confusion regarding sensitive topics such as sexuality, reproduction and gender. Within these programs and against parents wishes, Australian children are; instructed to role play LGBT sexual scenarios, referred to sexually explicit LGBT material online, taught that gender theory equates to fact and many other troublesome troublesome practices. Initially dressed up as an anti bullying program, the SSP proves to have nothing to do with anti bullying and everything to do with advancing a fringe LBGT sexual ideology by targeting Australian children and coercing them into contemplating or even engaging in LBGT lifestyle. We therefore ask the house to thoroughly review these programs and to ultimately disband them. from 48,985 citizens. Petition received. Climate Change Nuclear Weapons warning to the Australian people. In an open letter to the Prime Minister entitled 'Last call on the climate and nuclear twin perils', the scientists drew attention to the recent statement of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which said: Over the course of 2016, the global security landscape darkened as the international community failed to come effectively to grips with humanity’s most pressing existential threats, nuclear weapons and climate change … The letter goes on to say: These twin perils are not unrelated. As the full horror of climate change unfolds, conflict among nations and peoples over diminishing liveable environments and disrupted food and water supplies will increase. Nuclear holocaust is a plausible component of a climate change endgame. The scientists want an answer on two key questions: First. Why is the government continuing to promote the mining, combustion and export of coal and other fossil fuels, despite the stern warning by science and the growing calamity of global warming, including the rise in hurricanes and wildfires around the world? Second. There exist some 14,900 nuclear weapons threatening to be triggered by accident or design, with the probability for such an event growing with time. Why has the government decided not to sign the nuclear weapons ban treaty despite the fatal consequences of these weapons? They also ask for the Prime Minister to meet with a delegation of the scientists, but, as yet, the Prime Minister has failed to do so. I seek leave to table the letter.

The Rotary Club of Mount Waverley are a group of wonderful people, united in their desire to make a difference in our local and international communities. Led by Geoff Logie-Smith, the club has a proud tradition of service throughout Chisholm, and I was honoured to meet with many members in recent weeks, including Keith Kendrick, Robyn Morrow, David Whiting, Sean Derbyshire and Ros and Malcom Clowes to hear about their marvellous efforts-including recent fundraising drives, volunteering and community building-in the work they do in Chisholm. Since 1992, U3A Box Hill has provided a pathway for local seniors to maintain their mental, social and physical well-being when they retire. U3A employs a self-help model to provide affordable educational and social programs for seniors. At U3A Box Hill, volunteer retirees share their knowledge, skills and passion with more than 550 members. Members currently have the opportunity to partake in classes covering Nordic walking, photography, choral singing, languages and philosophy, to name a view. For 25 years, U3A Box Hill has been located at Strabane Avenue in Mont Albert. It is superbly led by President Valerie Bourke. I was very pleased to recently deliver a Stronger Communities grant on behalf of the Turnbull government. The Stronger Communities grant is just one example of the positive effect that these grants programs delivered by the Turnbull government are having. Bendigo Electorate: St Joseph's Primary School the year 5 and year 6 students from the St Joseph's Primary School in Quarry Hill. I asked the question: 'What would you do if you were Prime Minister-what would be your priority?' The students responded with the following: no more coal for energy production, do more to protect the environment, allow marriage equality, end homelessness and support those in need, support asylum seekers and be kinder to refugees, end animal cruelty, and do more to protect our native wildlife. There was even a discussion, division and vote on banning pineapple from pizzas. I'd like to finish with a rap that was presented to me by Ashton and Jedd from St Joseph's Primary School, and I will read it, because I'm not much of a rapper: Refugees and Migrants, I don't care about the difference, we're all human beings aren't we? Yeah.! That's what I thought! They don't want to be bought. Never judge a book by its cover! They probably lost someone they love. Refugees aren't the problem! The problem is those who don't accept them. The rap goes on, but it basically speaks to social justice, something that is so important to these students and to the entire Catholic footprint within my electorate. Lots of our schools talk about social justice, and lots of our students call on this Prime Minister and this government to do more to support those in need in our community.

The squadron flew flying boats that could land on the sea, and they were supporting the attack on U-boats that were essentially stopping the food supply into Britain. Incidentally, whilst flying one of the planes, Mr Dudley Marrows sank the U-boat U-461: Machine-gun fire from Marrows' Sunderland silenced the gunners of U-461. He skimmed in so low over the wave-tops that the other two boats did not have a clear shot past U-461. Marrows released his depth-charges and zoomed over the conning towerand sank the U-boat. But, after sinking the U-boat, he came back and dropped a life raft for the 25 to 30 people from the U-boat, saving the lives of 15. He sank a U-boat and then saved the lives of the crew. Later on in life, he went on to meet the captain of the U-boat that he had sunk. Happy birthday. You are a giant of our country.

Kingsford Smith Electorate: Kamay parkrun wonderful volunteers and runners who've taken part in the Kamay parkrun over the past 12 months. It celebrated its first anniversary on 25 November. 'Kamay' is the Bidjigal word for Botany Bay, and the Kamay parkrun takes place on the picturesque shores of Botany Bay in my electorate. A global movement of runners, parkrun was established in 2004, when 13 runners got together on a blustery day in Bushy Park, Teddington, in the UK. It's grown to a global phenomenon, and there are now over half a million parkrunners worldwide. It came to Australia in 2011, and there are now 261 parkruns throughout Australia, with people getting together on a Saturday morning to run five kilometres. It's been a year of achievement for the Kamay parkrun team, notching up a number of significant milestones. In the past 12 months, they've hosted 52 running events, with 3,314 people taking part, covering 17,620 kilometres all up. There've been 1,275 adult women finishers, 1,449 adult men finishers, 300 children and the odd dog. It couldn't have taken place without the efforts of volunteers. In particular, to Emma Trehy and Alan Harris, thank you for your support. Thank you to all those that have participated in parkrun over the course of the last 12 months. There's nothing better than getting down there on a Saturday morning on the shores of Botany Bay. Alexander, Mr John I've met a lot of good members of parliament. I have met no better member of parliament in this place than a fellow named John Alexander. Until he was run over by the citizenship bus that's been knocking this place about and probably will further knock it about in the next few days, I found John Alexander to be the most effective local representative, somebody who has an international focus as well because of his background, someone who understood Australia's place in the world, and someone who understood the diversity of his community. Yet here he is fighting a by-election in Bennelong that was entirely unexpected-a few of us were in here when he made his speech, up behind me, about not retiring and about how important he felt his role here in the parliament was.

Broadband Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (13:45): Deputy Speaker, as you are more than aware, hundreds of Canberrans have taken part in my 'Send me your speeds' campaign over the course of this year. They've shared their experiences of life with less than one megabit per second, thanks to copper. They've shared the impediments to their opportunities that life with less than one megabit per second delivers, thanks to copper. I'm concerned that, after the NBN Co's decision to delay the rollout of the HFC technology, the government will now speed up the deployment of fibre to the node here in Canberra. Fibre to the node is second-rate infrastructure that will need to be upgraded in the short to medium term-an upgrade that NBN Co has admitted isn't in its budget. For the hundreds of Canberrans who live just down the road from Parliament House, for the many who have had their educational opportunities impeded and for the many who have had their business opportunities impeded, why should they bear the brunt of NBN Co's HFC rollout debacle? I'm calling on the government to adopt the NBN committee's report and roll out fibre to the kerb as a minimum. Redesign areas slated for fibre to the node to a fibre-to-the-kerb or fibre to-the-premises rollout, work with me and the ACT government to look at feasible options to upgrade fibre-to-the-node NBN services across the whole ACT to fibre to the kerb, and end the digital divide here in Canberra. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander, Mr John the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, for his re-election to the seat of New England. He also was a victim of the citizenship bus, as the member for McMillan alluded to earlier on. Barnaby had a primary vote of 64.77 per cent, ahead of Labor's candidate, who received a primary vote of 11 per cent. If the strategy was to bring him unstuck, it actually had the reverse effect. It was a stunning victory and one of the biggest swings to a single candidate in Australia's history-an amazing contribution. I offer my greatest congratulations to him both as a friend and as a former staffer of his-I was his chief of staff. I welcome his return to this House. I also want to acknowledge and offer my compliments to John Alexander for the work that he has done in this House and associate myself with the member for McMillan's remarks in offering affirmation to John. It is just dripping with irony that here we have 'Captain Australia', a bloke who's travelled the world with the Australian flag on his back and a patriot for us in an iconic sporting landscape, up against someone who was born in Las Vegas.

Gareth Evans and three members for Wills: me for a couple of years, the Hon. Kelvin Thomson for 19 years and the great Labor Prime Minister the Hon. Bob Hawke. The contribution that Mimi has made to the electorate of Wills is nothing short of extraordinary, so much so that Bob Hawke described her as 'the de facto member for Wills' during his time when the rigours of leading the nation pulled him away from the day-to-day responsibilities of being a local representative. It's doubtful that anybody truly knows the electorate as well as Mimi. Bob also noted that Mimi has worked tirelessly across 13 election campaigns. Most importantly, her effort and dedication has impacted thousands of people, made their lives better, eased their suffering or given them an opportunity that otherwise would not be readily available if they hadn't seen Mimi. Mimi Tamburrino's lasting impact on the people of Wills cannot be summed up in a speech. Her dedication to the job has truly changed lives. Her commitment, her faith, her loyalty and willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty will be remembered by tens of thousands who have benefitted from her service to them.

Banks Electorate: St George Meals on Wheels celebrations of St George Meals on Wheels. St George Meals on Wheels, of course, is located in Peakhurst, in the heart of my electorate, and has been doing an extraordinary job for decades now in looking after people in our community. The event was held at the Maso's club in Mortdale and I would like to thank President Ian Manley and all of the Maso's board for their constant support of community organisations like St George Meals on Wheels. The service started back in 1967 and was originally operated in Depot Road at Peakhurst. But back in 2003, it moved to its current premises, co-located with what was called the Peakhurst Bowling Club but is now the Olds Park Sports Club. More than a million meals have been served in that time, and in the recent 12 months more than 50,000 meals were served to those in need. I'd like to thank President Leslie Sandilant; Vice President John Burke; secretaries Karen Bindon and Lis Smith; and of course, the treasurer, Barbara Sainsbury. St George Meals on Wheels serves our region, stretching right up to the Rockdale region in the north, and for 50 years has been providing a wonderful service. May there be many more decades to come.

Dunkley Electorate: Learn Engage Connect Young Parents Program program run in my electorate of Dunkley: the Learn Engage Connect Young Parents Program. This program is run by Chisholm TAFE in conjunction with headspace Frankston and Anglicare, and assists young parents who have previously experienced some disconnect to build new ideas, strategies and techniques to learn and connect with their children. The structure of a program like this is designed so that education and employment opportunities and outcomes are brought within reach. I was touched that some of the students also wrote me letters about their experience. Abbey said in a letter, 'The fact that I have a chance to finish my schooling is amazing.' Michaela wrote to me about her goal to get her drivers licence and her experience with SalvoCare. Cassie explained how the program got her on track to find employment and a house. She was soon able to finish Year 12. And Candice spoke so eloquently to the room about her experience. Congratulations to Abbey, Corise, Taylor, Jess, Candice and Katherine, who all returned from the previous year's study, and to this year's new students, Cassie and Michaela. The Learn Engage Connect Young Parents Program is a wonderful initiative and all participants have every right to be proud of their success.

New England By-Election Health Care on the weekend in Tamworth, where they had signs up around all the polling booths effectively saying that, if you want to support Medicare, you have to vote for Labor. Well, about 90 per cent of the voters didn't buy these lies from the Labor Party. They actually voted for the National Party. And they did that because they know that Medicare is in good shape. Just to highlight how the coalition is going with health care, last ThursdayI had the opportunity and the privilege of announcing the coalition government's funding of nearly $7 million for a new radiotherapy treatment facility in Shepparton. The Australian government is funding this new radiotherapy facility in Shepparton, fulfilling a commitment to help people who live outside the major cities to have better access to quality health care. Currently, accessing radiotherapy services for patients from Shepparton is difficult, and the nearest facilities are located in Bendigo, Albury and Melbourne, up to two hours away by car. This affects somewhere around 1,900 individuals each and every year. It is a fact that the coalition have got their act together with health care and that they're able to offer these amazing services. And it's a fact that the people of New England are symptomatic of the people around Australia. That is, they do not buy the liars-the liars from the Labor Party.

HMAS Cairns announcement of a $300 million upgrade to the naval base at HMAS Cairns and also its announcement that it will be home-basing four of its new offshore patrol vessels in Cairns. The 2016 defence white paper had originally committed $100 million of the OPV wharf and infrastructure upgrade by 2020, so this announcement includes an extra $200 million to complete the works needed to accommodate these larger vessels. This announcement also comes on top of $22 million which has already been planned for the mid-term refresh in 2019-20 and another $313 million for the redevelopment of HMAS Cairns post 2025-26. This takes the overall commitment spend on HMAS Cairns to $635 million over the next decade and a half, which is $215 million more than the $420 million first committed in the white paper. This announcement reinforces the Defence Force's commitment to Far North Queensland as a major ship maintenance and sustainment hub for Cairns. Local businesses will have the opportunity to provide support for the new patrol vessels. Extra employment opportunities and jobs for the future will be created in Leichhardt, not just through the work created at HMAS Cairns but also through the new service that will be required by many families that will move to Cairns as a result.

Joan Hearn died on 20 November. She was a senator for Tasmania from 1980 until 1985. Stephen Hutchins died on 24 November. He was a senator for New South Wales from 1998 until 2011. As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, I invite all present to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their placesStephen, The Rt Hon. Sir Ninian Martin, KG, AK, GCMG, GCVO, KBE, QC That the House acknowledge the passing on 29 October 2017 of former Governor General the Right Honourable Sir Ninian Martin Stephen KG AK GCMG GCVO KBE QC, and place on record its gratitude of his service to our nation and tender its profound sympathy to Lady Stephen and his family in their bereavement. Sir Ninian Stephen was born in England in 1923. Three weeks later, his father walked out of his life and never returned. Young Ninian and his Scottish mother spent his early years in Edinburgh. Later they roamed the world before settling in Australia. Last month a Scottish pipe band echoed through the streets of Melbourne as we farewelled an adopted son whose life represented the very best of us. Sir Ninian's legacy lives on both here and beyond our shores, in all the nations where he worked tirelessly for peace, justice and reconciliation. But he was not driven by a proud man's desire to leave his mark on history. His motivation was public service and the desire to leave the world a better place. It was a life of many acts played out across many stages. A brilliant commercial barrister and leading constitutional lawyer, he rose to the top of his field to become a justice of the High Court. He served the nation from the battlefields of Bougainville and Borneo as an Australian soldier to the red dust of Uluru-Kata Tjuta, where, as Governor General, he handed Aboriginal freehold title over to the Anangu traditional owners in 1985. As a peacemaker and international jurist, he sought justice and brought people together on the green but riven fields of Ireland, in the jungles of Cambodia, amid the destruction of the former Yugoslavia and across the unforgiving deserts and mountains of Afghanistan. Sir Ninian's wise counsel, fairness and compassion, along with his great constitutional expertise, kept him in demand long after his retirement as Governor General. His many roles included chairman of the Northern Ireland peace talks, mediator between government and opposition in Bangladesh, foundation judge on The Hague war crimes tribunal in respect of the former Yugoslavia, and distinguished observer representing the Commonwealth at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. There were few honours that Sir Ninian did not have to his name-he was knighted five times-but, despite his many public roles and accolades, his role as a father and a husband, as a family man, was paramount. Sir Ninian discovered late in life that his father had not died of wartime injuries, as he'd been told, but instead had left him and his mother to make a new family in Canada. He reached out to that family, proving that a true peacemaker always brings people together. The devoted husband and father of five daughters, he died holding his wife's hand. At his funeral his daughter Ann spoke of her parents' bond:",109,Condolences
54,The Speaker,I thank the House.,110,Condolences
55,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth,"Prime Minister) (14:02): I move:… he was also a romantic, writing beautiful, touching lines to our mother throughout their life together. It may seem that Sir Ninian belonged to another age, but the qualities that made him unique are also timeless ones: witty, urbane, tolerant, humane and with a self-deprecating humour that proved, if any proof was needed, that this citizen of the world was truly one of us. Australia has lost one of its great statesman, and today we all mourn his passing. Our thoughts are with Lady Stephen and their entire family as they celebrate his life and mourn his loss. long life lived for others. Sir Ninian Stephen brought gravitas, good humour and calm dignity to the office of Governor General, and his qualities and capacities were held in the highest regard by all Australians and by all sides of politics. It's a measure of the man that he was initially chosen by Malcolm Fraser but would later have his term extended by Bob Hawke. Sir Ninian's passion for internationalism also broadened the scope of the role, expanding the program of overseas visits now so central to the Governor General's responsibilities as a representative of Australia. Indeed, this was a recurring pattern of Sir Ninian's public life: he enhanced, enriched and elevated every position that he held. In the uniform of his country, in the High Court, in high office and, later on, on the world stage, Sir Ninian Stephen embodied the ideals of service, duty and justice. Perhaps no Australian has received more accolades, yet he was also a person of profound humility who shunned the spotlight and never sought a curtain call. As a young man he deferred his legal studies at Melbourne University when he was called upon to serve in Papua New Guinea and Borneo with the Royal Australian Engineers. He would later become a recognised authority on constitutional law, which, as honourable members know, can be complex and evolving! He was a QC before the age of 45 and a High Court judge before 50. Instead of Governor General being the pinnacle of his public service, it became a springboard for further acts of truly global significance. As Australia's first Ambassador for the Environment, his advocacy and diplomacy helped preserve the entire continent of Antarctica from mining. A quarter of a century later, it's easy to look upon this as a fait accompli, but, amidst the end of the Cold War, this was a highly charged and fiercely contested question, and Sir Ninian's role-indeed, Australia's leadership-in the world's largest conservation decision ought to be better known. As a young man, Ninian was taken to a Nazi rally in Nuremberg, following the annexation of Austria-one face amongst tens of thousands on those vast concrete terraces, close enough to photograph Hitler. Nuremberg would later serve as the home of the war trials for the Nazi leadership, the first of their kind. But, in one of those quirks of history, Sir Ninian would subsequently serve as a judge on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, investigating the atrocities committed there. Indeed, his intellect and diplomatic gifts made him a highly respected mediator in the Northern Ireland peace talks, in the political conflict in Bangladesh and in the dispute over Timor-Leste's sovereignty. On every occasion, Sir Ninian brought a measure of justice, reconciliation and peace to these troubled places, and in doing so he brought honour to all of us-to Australia. Our parliament, our country and future generations of Australians are forever in his debt. We offer our condolences to Lady Stephen and their family and we thank them for their contribution, and for the contribution their loved one made, to the life of our nation and to the cause of justice around the world. May he rest in peace.",110,Condolences
56,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Leader of the Opposition) (14:06): Today we honour a question is that the motion moved by the honourable the Prime Minister be agreed to. As a mark of respect, I ask all present to signify their approval by rising in their places. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. Fife, Hon. Wallace Clyde 'Wal' That the House acknowledge the passing, on 16 November 2017, of the Honourable Wallace Clyde (Wal) Fife, former member of this House for the Division of Farrer from 1975 to 1984 and Division of Hume from 1984 to 1993, and former member of the New South Wales Parliament, and place on record our nation's gratitude for his service, and tender our profound sympathy to his family and friends and former colleagues. Wal Fife served as a member of parliament, both state and federal parliaments, for 36 years. When he retired, in 1993, he was one of Australia's longest-serving parliamentarians. We look back on Wal's career at a time when politics is perhaps not the most popular of professions. Back then it was more of a vocation and those who wanted to join the fray often had a very deep calling to serve. Wal's time in public life demonstrates that in the best possible way. All children have dreams about what they will be when they grow up. Young Wal dreamed of being a politician, and when he was just 10 he set up a make-believe polling booth in the garage and handed out how-to-vote cards to imaginary voters. His parents worked long hours running the family's bakeries and when they decided to send him to boarding school they let him choose which one. Not surprisingly, he chose Canberra Grammar so that he could visit Parliament House regularly and watch politics in action from a front-row seat. In 1947 during his final year at school, he wrote to Robert Menzies, then Leader of the Opposition, to ask if he could have a job with the Liberal Party. Menzies introduced him to Donald Cleland, who offered him a clerical position with the party in Sydney. After three attempts for the state seat of Wagga Wagga, Wal won it in 1957 in a by-election. He was on his way. When Robert Askin led the Liberal Party to victory in New South Wales in 1965, Wal was named assistant education minister, giving him his first real chance to make a difference in politics. Ultimately, of course, he wanted to make a difference nationally, and in 1975 he successfully contested the federal seat of Farrer. In the Fraser government he held consecutive ministries, including Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Education, Minister for Aviation and Deputy Leader of the House. In everything he did, Wal Fife never forgot he was there to improve life for the people who elected him. Of his many achievements he was probably most proud of the role he played in creating Charles Sturt University, bringing university education to the people of his own region. As the university said at his death, 'Wal's fortitude, vision and commitment was instrumental in its establishment.' It takes a special person not only to survive in the political arena but to thrive, and to do so earning the respect of political friends and foes alike. Wal Fife was that person. He once told a newspaper, 'A chap said to me today that I walked through a minefield and came through virtually unscathed. I'm very proud of that. I modelled myself to be a good local member and a capable administrator.' We could all do well to heed those wise words.",111,Condolences

59,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth,"Prime Minister) (14:10): I move:Today we remember a man who had friends on both sides of the House, a politician who never lost sight of his childhood dream to serve his community, his state, his nation. Our thoughts are with his wife, Marcia, his four children, 10 grandchildren and nine greatgrandchildren. May he rest in peace. Fife was, in many respects, an uncomplicated man-unpretentious, unflappable and largely unchanged by the cares and burdens of public office. As he put it when he left this place in 1993, ending 36 years as first a state and then a federal MP, he 'walked through a minefield and came out unscathed'. I counted up the number of elections that that 36 years covered. He won 14 of the elections that he contested. That is a significant achievement. Wal also held a number of ministries in both the New South Wales and federal parliaments, but his first priority was always his community. He prided himself on being a visible, available and conscientious local MP. It is a credit to him that, even a quarter-century after he left this place, the tributes at his funeral in Wagga still spoke of his generosity with his time and his presence. As we've heard, Wal always had a consuming passion for politics. As a child, he created a homemade ballot box, counting the votes cast by his mother and father. It is no surprise that when he was only 28 he was first elected as the state member for Wagga Wagga. At that time he was the youngest person elected to the New South Wales parliament, yet that was his third attempt for the seat! I think it's fair to say it would mean a great deal to him that today the parliament pauses on the threshold of question time to remember and honour him. It is a privilege to serve in this place. It's hard-fought and hard-won. Wal Fife knew this and he honoured it for many years. We offer our condolences to his family. May he rest in peace. in their places. Honourable members having stood in their placesDebate adjourned. Reference to Federation Chamber leave-I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. Prime Minister Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that since the House last sat, five weeks ago, he has cancelled parliament; ruled out a banking royal commission, then announced a banking royal commission; halted the NBN rollout for two million households; had cabinet ministers calling for investigations into each other over cabinet leaks; and been accused by his own backbenchers of a failure of leadership?

63,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Leader of the Opposition) (14:17): My question is to thethe last five weeks and several of them have been overlooked by the Leader of the Opposition, including the result in New England. I have to say, Mr Speaker, the Labor Party put in a strong showing, comfortably ahead of the informal vote. It just got into double figures. Barnaby Joyce's swing was larger than the Labor Party's primary vote! It only happened on Saturday, but I'm not surprised the Leader of the Opposition has blotted it out of his memory. One of the things that have occurred over the last five weeks that the Leader of the Opposition should not blot out of his memory is what advice he gave to Sam Dastyari before he met with Mr Huang. The Leader of the Opposition should not easily forget Mr Huang, because he visited him at his house last year. So he has a very good familiarity with the gentleman. The Leader of the Opposition remembers very well the function that he attended on 17 June with Senator Dastyari, with Mr Huang. And then, shortly after that, Senator Dastyari had a press conference with Mr Huang in the media briefing room at the Commonwealth parliamentary office in Sydney. There are two lecterns, two podiums, there. Each of them has the Australian coat of arms. Dastyari stood at one; Mr Huang stood at the other. title. there that Senator Dastyari said these words, apparently written for him by someone else: The South China Sea is China's own affair. On this issue Australia should remain neutral and respect China's decision. This came after Mr Huang had paid off some debts for Senator Dastyari. It reads like the talking points from the Global Times in Beijing. That's what it was: Senator Dastyari contradicting Australian government policy and Labor Party policy on the South China Sea. Well, he got sacked for that. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, as he trolls through the last five weeks, could remember what advice he gave Senator Dastyari that prompted him to tell Mr Huang how to avoid surveillance by ASIO.

We're ensuring that all Australians have access to the affordable care and to the affordable medicines they need. Our school funding reforms-the biggest and most comprehensive ever undertaken by a Commonwealth government-deliver genuine needs-based funding that is national, consistent and transparent for the first time. We don't just talk about needs based funding, like those opposite do. We have delivered it. That's the difference. We are making child care more affordable and providing the highest level of support to the families that need it most. Our National Energy Guarantee will deliver cheaper power bills and keep the lights on. You don't have to take our word for it. Look at the modelling from the Energy Security Board. You can see there the confirmation that this is the policy that brings together affordability, reliability and the ability to reduce our emissions into one market instrument. We've taken action, of course, to cut power bills in the here and now: on gas, on electricity and on the operators of the poles and wires. When it comes to taxes, we're ensuring Australian businesses remain competitive. The honourable member and I visited a family business in her electorate that is benefitting from the cuts to company tax and, with the growth that comes from our big free trade deals, is able to grow more, invest more and employ more. Lower taxes enable businesses to invest and do more. These and many other measures together are what is delivering the growth we have today. Nearly a thousand jobs a day for the last year have been created, and 85 per cent of them are full-time. That's the commitment. Jobs and growth: not just a slogan, now an outcome.

And what does it say about the character of the Leader of the Opposition that he has a senator who takes money from this businessman, who is a foreign national and works closely as an agent of a foreign country? They talked about money-I'm not talking about donations here. What we're talking about is money that Senator Dastyari took for himself. Senator Dastyari took the money for himself. His own personal debts were paid off. Because he was a Labor senator, he felt it was his right to go to this businessman and say, 'Pay off my debts.' And, when asked why he did it, he said, 'I didn't want to pay the debt.' He didn't want to pay the debt. He preferred to use his influence to sell out his party, and sell out his country, to get his debts paid off. And then, after briefings to parliamentary leadership, after briefings to the political leadership of the Labor Party, Senator Dastyari comes to the view that his patron, Mr Huang, might be under surveillance from ASIO. Off he goes to Mr Huang's house and he tells him to take care and to have a conversation in the garden with the phones put safely inside. That's not the conduct of a loyal Australian.

Unemployment is now down to 5.4 per cent, the lowest level in 4½ years, lower than it was when we came to government back in 2013. We've had 172,000 jobs advertised. That is the highest level of job advertisements on the ANZ survey in six years. We have had 296,000 jobs created in the first 10 months of this year. That is the strongest job creation performance in 40 years. That is the strongest on record of the labour force survey, and four out of five of those are full-time jobs. On top of that, we've now started to see some movement in wages and earnings: an increase of 2½ per cent, with 13 out of the 17 sectors of our economy experiencing a growth in the level of wages and earnings. On business conditions, they are the strongest survey conditions we've seen-four times the long-run average-in 20 years. We have seen the longest run of consecutive monthly positive trade surpluses in 40 years. On top of that, we've got non-mining investment up to now well over two per cent in capital expenditure. That is the strongest figure we've seen in five years and evidence of the fact that this government's actions to drive investment in our economy and to drive growth are having the desired effect.

It is because Australians are getting jobs. Under the Turnbull government that's what's happening. We're making the right decisions by lowering taxes. We're making the right decisions by opening trade. We're making the right decisions by investing in infrastructure, like the $100 million in Bennelong for the transport interchange. The threated posed by the Labor Party is that it will put that at all at risk through $164 billion, as costed by Treasury, of higher taxes on the Australian economy, suffocating the Australian economy. If the Labor Party are thinking up ideas on that sort of reckless damage in opposition, imagine if he were Prime Minister what this Labor leader would do to the economy if he had the chance. Banking and Financial Services confirm a report by Phil Coorey in today's Financial Review that the terms of reference for the banking royal commission were being worked on 'for a long time' because 'we knew this was inevitable'? Can the Treasurer also confirm he was not shown the terms of reference until Tuesday last week? If a royal commission was inevitable, why did the Prime Minister rule one out 48 hours earlier and why was the Treasurer kept in the dark for so long? commission into the banking sector and the terms of reference for the inquiry was made at nine o'clock that day. That was the first that the banks and others were aware that this government was going to put a royal commission in place. There is no doubt that the government over a period of time had been aware of the various arguments that had been put in place, including, indeed, arguments put by the opposition over 2½ years. I note over all that period of time they called for a royal commission into the banks they never came up with terms of reference. Not once did they come up with terms of reference, yet they were the ones who wanted to announce a royal commission into the banks. So it is true that, with my knowledge, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services' knowledge and the Prime Minister's knowledge, the Treasury have been working on a commission of inquiry terms of reference. But, at the end of the day, the decision to go forward with the banking royal commission was made for this reason: the recklessness of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer for over two years calling into question the integrity and the system security of our banking system and financial system upon which the entire country's jobs depend. That had been brought to such a point of risk by their recklessness that it required that the government take control of this action, and that's what we did. What the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have demonstrated is that the reckless behaviour towards the economy they would put into practice if they ever got into government would be an absolute shocker. gallery today Mr Matthew Groom, the state member for Denison in Tasmania.

On 17 November at the handing down of the report into the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory, Minister Scullion stated that the government would develop a response not only for the Northern Territory but every jurisdiction in Australia. Considering that young Indigenous people are 27 times more likely to be in prison than nonIndigenous young people and that we are hearing allegations of abuse similar to those at Don Dale across Australia, urgent action is needed. Will you reaffirm the government's commitment to national leadership on youth justice and detail when the government will action the findings of the royal commission? I acknowledge Amnesty International are here today and they are eager, as I am, for your reply. for her question. The government, as you know, acted swiftly to establish the royal commission in July 2016, following reports of the mistreatment of children at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. I want to thank Commissioners Margaret White and Mick Gooda for their dedication to this difficult but also very important task. I also want to acknowledge, on behalf of the government, the individuals, expert witnesses and government and nongovernment representatives who came forward to give evidence to the royal commission. My government will now consider the recommendations made in the report and work with the Northern Territory government-in respect of whose activities most of the recommendations apply-key stakeholders and communities to inform the development of our response. Most of the recommendations, as I noted, are matters for the Northern Territory government. I'm sure the honourable member is familiar with them. The Australian government will now also carefully consider the findings that are directed to the Commonwealth. We've already committed to ratifying the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which will ensure that oversight of places of detention, including youth detention, is strengthened in the Northern Territory, and, of course, everywhere else. When children are safe, the whole community benefits as well. This is our greatest obligation: to look after our children. We understand that. All children deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and all children deserve to be safe. That's the responsibility of the whole community and, importantly, families and government agencies. I want to make an observation to the honourable member's benefit about funding. I quote from the royal commission: A consistent theme heard by the Commission was that there is insufficient funding in the Northern Territory to address the issues it is grappling with. However, having reviewed financial data available to the Commission, the Commission considers that the underlying problem is not the level of overall funding but that Commonwealth and Northern Territory Government investment is not rigorously tracked, monitored or evaluated to ensure that it is appropriately distributed and directed. Value for the money expended cannot be demonstrated. The major investment in Aboriginal affairs over many years has delivered mixed success, often with dismally poor returns.

The approach must be changed. We absolutely recognise the force of that observation. As you know, in 2017-18 the Northern Territory government will receive $4.2 billion from the Commonwealth. We are determined to ensure that every dollar that we spend on Indigenous affairs and Indigenous welfare delivers the right outcomes that we need. I want to thank the honourable member for her question. It's a very important report and we're working to deliver a very comprehensive response. National Security Ms HENDERSON (Corangamite) (14:38): My question is for the Minister for Defence Industry representing the Minister for Defence.

How could alternative approaches jeopardise our national security? thank the member for Corangamite for her question. She, like this side of the House, takes national security issues very seriously. A government member interjectingbecause it's very important to be consistent in your approach to national security issues. On this side of the House we've always sought to do so.

The point about the lapses of Senator Dastyari's approach to these matters and the most recent revelations concerning his discussions with Mr Huang about his communications is that the jury is well and truly in on Senator Dastyari. What we now need to go to is the Leader of the Opposition's judgement. This goes to the Leader of the Opposition's judgement. Not only did he rehabilitate him; he's now been required to sack him again. Many people have asked why. Why would the Leader of the Opposition be so connected to Senator Dastyari? I think the answer is much more obvious than we know. In The Sydney Morning Herald, Sean Nicholls wrote on 10 April 2015: NSW Labor assistant secretary John Graham… wants more details about the involvement of Labor Senator Sam Dastyari's office in changing the mailing addresses of scores of leadership ballotsin the 2013 ballot that saw the Leader of the Opposition defeat the member for Grayndler. There was an investigation called for into the role of Senator Dastyari in rigging that leadership ballot.

Well, let me say this to the honourable member: if you're not prepared to name him, you shouldn't be prepared to keep him in the Senate. National Security Protection. Will the minister update the House on the importance of strong and consistent border protection measures? Is the minister aware of any other alternative approaches? thank the honourable member for his question. One of the strongest achievements of this government has been to stop the boats, and to stop drownings at sea and to get kids out of detention. We have closed 17 detention centres and we have not had a successful peoplesmuggling venture now for 1,226 days. We know: if we want to undo that success, we change the policies-because that's what Kevin Rudd did when he came into government, after John Howard had successfully stopped the boats. The Labor Party then changed the policy settings that saw 50,000 people come on 800 boats and, tragically, 1,200 people drown at sea. We've seen a lot of banter from the left of the Labor Party. Many members opposite that I'm looking at at the moment are in favour, once again, of undoing those policy settings. This government is not going to fall for that trick. I'm afraid to say that it is clear now that the Labor Party is slowly dismantling the policy that they took to the last election, which, at the time, they claimed replicated our policy in stopping the boats. There are many, many members opposite who would see people come from the regional processing centres to Australia tomorrow, which would result in a recommencement of the boats, because the people-smugglers would be up there saying, 'You can go to Manus Island for a couple of years and eventually you'll move to Australia, which is the outcome that you paid for.' Interestingly enough, the most significant contributor to this debate from the other side is a member who wants to join their ranks formally in this place shortly-that is, a Ms Kristina Keneally. Kristina Keneally has had a lot to say on the issue of border protection. In fact, in 2011, a year in which 4½ thousand people arrived on boats and people were dying at sea, Kristina Keneally told Q&A that she supported onshore processing and that Australia was big enough to bring everyone here.

I also refer to reports in The Daily Telegraph that Mr Huang's long-time right-hand man, Tim Xu, is campaigning for former government MP and Liberal candidate John Alexander in Bennelong.

108,Mr Turnbull,What the Leader of the Opposition is failing to tell us is this: how does,122,Questions Without Notice
109,The Speaker,"The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.did ask the Prime Minister to confine his answer simply to foreign political donations laws. I want to listen to the Prime Minister for the rest of his answer. the critical issue that we have here is whether Senator Dastyari is representing Australia in the Senate or a foreign power. That's what Labor has to satisfy us about. Infrastructure Will the minister update the House on the government's approach to reducing congestion in our urban areas, including in my electorate of Banks and across New South Wales? Is the minister aware of alternative approaches? member for his question, because the member for Banks is a very strong advocate for the people of his electorate in terms of delivering a reduction in congestion. Look, for example, at what he's achieved in relation to WestConnex: the King Georges Road interchange, with $130 million and opened to traffic in December 2016, and the M5 onramps, where he's made a commitment of $15 million of Commonwealth money, together with $15 million of New South Wales government funding. That will deliver a great improvement in congestion for the people in his electorate. Let me contrast that, because I was asked if there are other approaches-and there are other approaches to how to deal with congestion. One approach that's very popular with the Labor Party is to make promises but then fail to deliver. In fact, if you're the New South Wales Labor government, you make a promise about rail 12 times and you deliver just half of one of the 12 rail lines you promised. Carl Scully promised the Bondi Beach rail line; it was never delivered. Carl Scully promised the high-speed rail link to Newcastle; it was never delivered. Carl Scully promised the Hurstville to Strathfield rail link; it was never delivered. The high speed rail from Sutherland to Wollongong was never delivered. For Chatswood to Parramatta, all they could manage was half of that-Chatswood to Epping. The North West Rail Link was also promised by Carl Scully but not delivered by Labor. Then, of course, came John Watkins: the South West Rail Link was promised but never delivered. Carl Scully came back again to promise a new CBD-harbour crossing; it was never delivered. John Watkins promised the north-west metro link; it was never delivered by Labor. David Campbell promised the CBD-Rozelle metro; it was never delivered. David Campbell promised the west metro; it was never delivered. And there was the western expressway. Of course, the current Labor candidate for Bennelong has quite an involvement in this saga, because it was she who came along in February 2010 and cancelled the Sydney Metro at a cost of almost $500 million. There is a very clear contrast between the coalition's approach to delivering congestion-busting projects, like the King Georges Road Interchange, opened in December 2016-operational, unlike the chaos that we saw under New South Wales Labor for so many years: so many projects promised and never delivered.

The Prime Minister and John Alexander promised voters in Bennelong before the last election that they'd all have the NBN by now, but last week NBN announced it was immediately halting the rollout of the second-rate NBN to over 40,000 premises in Bennelong.

It's on track to be available to around three-quarters of Australian households by 30 June this coming year. The company has said it's on track to be completed, in accordance with their schedule, by 2020. The project is underway. The rollout on the hybrid fibre co-ax network has experienced some technical difficulties. They've delayed it or paused it so as to get those difficulties sorted out. People that are on hybrid fibre co-ax now, typically Foxtel customers, have a good broadband service; they're not without broadband at all. This just shows the NBN is delivering but ensuring that they get all of the technology right, so that people get the right experience. It shows that they care about the outcome for consumers, and they're doing that, working right across the country, including in the electorate of Bennelong. Taxation outline for the House what the government is doing to deliver for small businesses across Australia, including in the electorate of Bennelong, and why policy certainty in corporate taxes is so critical for small businesses? question. In the electorate of Bennelong, there are 7,900 incorporated businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million who will benefit from the legislated tax cuts of the Turnbull government. In addition to that, there are 9,700 unincorporated individual small businesses who will also benefit from those tax cuts. That's almost 18,000 small to medium sized businesses in the electorate of Bennelong. Many of them are run by people who have come to this country full of entrepreneurial spirit-the Korean small business community, the Chinese small business community, the Indian national small business community in Bennelong. They are highly entrepreneurial. Those 18,000 businesses are all benefitting from the tax cuts that have been legislated by this parliament. They can count on those tax cuts so long as there is a Turnbull government to make sure they stay in place. There are some 125,000 incorporated entities who also are benefiting from these changes all around the country. And they want to know one thing from the Leader of the Opposition and from the shadow Treasurer before the by-election in Bennelong: will the Labor Party reverse the legislated tax cuts that have been put in place by this government? They need to know it by the time of that by-election. If they don't know it by the time of the by-election, you can be sure a Labor government will reverse the tax cuts that have been legislated by this parliament. I will tell you why: because there is $25 billion worth of revenue attached to reversing those tax cuts. Every time the Labor Party says that we don't need $60 billion to $65 billion worth of corporate tax cuts, that we can't afford them and they shouldn't go ahead, they are telling the small to medium sized businesses in Bennelong that they will remove those tax cuts-your legislated tax cuts.

He refuses to tell them if they will keep their tax cuts under a Labor government. That's what we have come to expect from the Labor Party. We understand that their policies will strand businesses in this country on a tax island, uncompetitive with the rest of the world. The IMF has recently warned that the US is moving even closer to tax cuts for businesses and investments in the United States; that only heightens the risk to the Australian economy. The Labor Party is a risk to jobs, they are a risk to growth in our economy and they are a risk to every one of the 18,000 small businesses in Bennelong. (Time expired) Broadband Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:03): My question is to the Prime Minister. On 27 November 2017, NBN Co announced an immediate halt to HFC rollout because the technology still doesn't work properly. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the government first became aware of problems with the reliability of the HFC NBN network back in November 2015? Did he take any action when he received those warnings? notice. There are obviously always issues with these technologies. I will take it on notice and come back to the honourable member in due course. Health Care the minister outline to the House the action the government is taking to ensure more Australians have access to their GPs, especially in my home state of New South Wales? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches? the member for Hughes, who has been a great friend to those who face challenges with disability, special needs and special services and has, therefore, been a genuine 'medi-friend' and supporter of their access to better Medicare services. This compares with others elsewhere who might be called 'medi-frauds'; these are people who say one thing about Medicare but do the opposite-like those on the other side. Let me give you an example. On this side, what we see is record bulk-billing rates announced last week. In the electorate of Hughes, the figures are four per cent higher for bulk-billing-which means people get to visit the doctor without paying a cent-than they were when Labor was last in office. Across the country, we have seen an increase of 4.2 per cent on the September 2012-13 quarter right through to what we see now with the recent quarter-a 4.2 per cent increase from Labor's last full September quarter to our most recent September quarter. That means hundreds of thousands of additional services for free under Medicare. But it is not just that across the country. That's also the case with additional Medicare services in Bennelong. But we see some claims that there have been reduced services in Bennelong, which are simply false. We know that a former Labor Premier, Kristina Keneally, made the claim that there had been cuts to Medicare services in Bennelong.

In Bennelong, the average bulk-billing rate has climbed to 88.5 per cent, which is above the national average. That is a fundamentally important change. At the same time, we have seen other claims by Kristina Keneally which were false. Kristina Keneally claimed that we had closed the Medicare office there. In fact, that claim lasted until it was shown that the member for Sydney had set out this closure in 2010 for every Medicare office. But, most significantly, we have seen that Kristina Keneally's claim that she had to wait for an hour for Medicare services was absolutely false. In the week that she claimed that, the average waiting time at the Medicare office was 13 minutes. How many people had to wait an hour as she claimed? Not one person. So these claims were false, untrue and incorrect. You cannot trust Labor and you cannot trust Kristina Keneally. (Time expired) Broadband Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:07): My question is to the Prime Minister. Last week, NBN Co announced it was halting the HFC rollout of the Prime Minister's second-rate NBN. Can the Prime Minister advise just how many hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayers' money is being wasted by his latest failure? member that there are billions and billions of dollars being saved by not doing the NBN in the way the Labor Party had proposed to do-that is, $30 billion in savings and six to eight years in terms of time to complete it. The reality is that the NBN is one of the fastest rollouts of a telecom network ever. It is extraordinary-40,000 premises being activated just about every week. As of the last published data, 6½ million premises are available to be connected right now-that is, people can sign up and get hooked up now-and there are 3¼ million paying customers right now. It is an extraordinarily rapid rollout. Of course, like any big rollout like that, it has its challenges in some areas. What NBN Co is doing with respect to hybrid fibre-coax, which is about 350,000 premises at present, is making sure the technology works well. It is a complex business rolling out this network. They are doing an outstanding job and they are making sure they put the customers' experience first. Honourable members opposite, and the media, will focus on a number of cases where people have not had a great experience. The NBN Co is focused on fixing those, addressing those, and ensuring that everybody gets an outstanding service. The company is doing a phenomenal job, but it will do an even better job. It will keep working to improve its service, to improve customer experience, in this the most rapid telecom rollout in our country's history. We inherited a train wreck from the Labor Party. We've rescued it. It was a complete train wreck. Honourable members opposite can scoff. In six years they activated 50,000 premises. The NBN Co right now is doing 80,000 every fortnight. That tells you how incompetent they were. We are getting on with the job and cleaning up their mess. Where service levels have been disappointing-and they have been in some areas-they are going to be addressed. We'll put the customers first to make sure they get the best service.

I'm not going to speak to the amendments-they're well known-but I understand that my opposite number is. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (15:17): I thank the minister. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on these amendments that have been moved by the government to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Quality and Safeguards Commission and Other Measures) Bill 2017. I'm pleased to say these amendments are those that Labor has secured in agreement with the government and in consultation with stakeholders to improve this bill. I appreciate the willingness of the minister to work with Labor on these amendments. Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry to make sure there was a chance for it to be properly examined. This is a major piece of legislation, a very complex piece of legislation, that required a lot of investigation by many, many different interest groups-disability groups, providers of disability services, unions and state governments-all of whom raised multiple and serious concerns about the bill. It is fair to say that some of the concerns that were raised by stakeholders could have been avoided with an earlier consultation process but, that said, this has begun during the period of the Senate inquiry and post that time. I understand the government does intend to continue consulting on the detailed development of the rules-on all of the issues-with people with disability, carer groups, advocates, providers of services, unions, and state and territory governments. The involvement of all these different groups is vital to the success of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Labor has consulted intensively with stakeholders on this bill, working through detailed concerns and also seeking further information. I do want to take this opportunity to thank all of the people who were involved. They did a lot of work in scrutinising this bill-a lot of dedicated work to make sure we get this right-up against very tight time lines. It is right that the government has wanted to move this along and that's why we've tried to work with them to facilitate this, as I said, large and complex bill. I want to take a little time to go through the amendments, because they are significant and they haven't been discussed in the House before. Disability organisations raised concerns that",130,Bills

There is confusion and, in some cases, marginalisation of this important role. Sometimes independent advocates are the only trusted support for people with disability, and National Disability Insurance Scheme providers need to acknowledge and facilitate access to independent advocacy. These amendments will make sure that the bill explicitly states that NDIS participants have the right to access independent advocacy, and the provisions are made to define and protect this role. The bill will be amended to define an independent advocate under section 9 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act, otherwise known as the NDIS Act, in a definition agreed with advocacy groups. These amendments will ensure that registered NDIS providers implement and maintain a complaints management and resolution system that, firstly, acknowledges the role of independent advocates and other representatives of people with disability and, secondly, provides for cooperation with independent advocates and other representatives of persons with disability who are affected by the complaints process and who wish to be independently supported in that process by an advocate or other representative. These are very important issues that do need to be recognised, and I appreciate the government's acknowledgement of that. The bill will also be amended to expand actions that must be taken in relation to reportable incidents. They may include requiring a registered NDIS provider to provide people with disability with information regarding the use of an advocate in relation to an investigation into the reportable incident. The amendments will provide independent advocates with protection for disclosure and ensure that the commissioner must acknowledge, recognise and respect the roles of independent advocates in representing the interests of people with disability. (Time expired) Ms MACKLIN: On procedural fairness for workers-another section of amendments that the government is moving, which we appreciate-unions have raised concerns about the absence of provisions in the bill to ensure procedural fairness for NDIS workers who are subject to complaints or investigations. We have been able to secure amendments that will allow for NDIS rules in relation to the management and resolution of complaints arising out of or in connection with the provision of supports or services by NDIS providers to deal with requirements relating to procedural fairness in relation to the management and resolution of complaints and, secondly, to ensure the commissioner must have due regard to procedural fairness in performing his or her functions. The third area that I want to refer to is restrictive practices, a very sensitive issue in the disability field and very important in this legislation. Disability organisations, including Disabled People's Organisations Australia, the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations, Disability Advocacy Network Australia, National Disability Services, and Children and Young People with Disability Australia, have raised particular concerns that the bill does not include regulatory powers to enable the NDIS commissioner to prohibit certain restrictive practices. As Disabled People's Organisations Australia stated: … current mechanisms at State and Territory level are varied and inconsistent, with some consisting of relatively weak policy functions within government departments and others having established regulatory bodies and mechanisms.",132,Bills

This will strengthen the commissioner's role in this very important area. In the area of governance and involvement with the states, an area that we've been particularly concerned about, we are worried that the Minister for Social Services is forcing governance changes that will reduce the role of the states. This is something that would undermine the success of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It does need to be emphasised that the states and territories have a vital role in the successful delivery of the NDIS. It is a national scheme, not a Commonwealth scheme. It is a national scheme, in which each of the jurisdictions play a very important part. It is important that states' and territories' perspectives are sought and genuinely listened to. It's something that Labor will continue to hold the government to account about. Again, I cannot stress enough the need for the government to include stakeholders as the NDIS is rolled out. People with disability, advocates, unions, providers and the states and territories must all be genuinely listened to and involved to get the best results for the scheme. I also want to state, again, that this legislation does not negate the need for a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disability, as the government has claimed. Therese Sands from Disabled People's Organisations Australia has said of the NDIS quality safeguards framework: It doesn’t address the scale of violence and abuse against people with disability, its many different forms and the range of service and other settings where it occurs. This bill does not address the need for a royal commission into abuse against people with disability. Labor announced in May that, should we win the next election, we will establish a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disability. The continued abuse of Australians with disability by people who are meant to care for them demands a royal commission. People with disability experience much higher rates of violence than the rest of the community and, in many cases, this violence occurs in places where they're meant to be receiving care and support. Children with disability are at least three times more likely to experience abuse than other children. People with disability and their families have been campaigning for a royal commission for years and only a royal commission has the weight, authority and investigative powers to examine these horrific accounts of abuse and violence against people with disability. We call, again, on the government to establish a royal commission into the abuse of people with disability now. As I said at the start, this is a very important piece of legislation and these are important amendments that will strengthen protections for people with disability as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We should never forget that the driving purpose of the National Disability Insurance Scheme is to improve the lives of people with disability, their families and carers. It is my hope that, with the passage of these amendments today, we will do exactly that. Mr Pyne: I move: That the question be put. The House divided. [15:33] (The Speaker-Hon.

153,The Speaker (15:41,"I have received the following message from the Senate:(i) the New Zealand Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Jacinda Ardern, has continued to pressure Australia to accept New Zealand's offer to resettle 150 refugees who are currently in offshore detention; (ii) New Zealand will begin work to expedite processing refugees if, and when, the offer is accepted; and (iii) Prime Minister Ardern stated 'We made the offer because we saw a great need. No matter what label you put on it there is absolute need and there is harm being done'; and (b) calls on the Government to accept New Zealand's offer to resettle 150 refugees and negotiate conditions similar to the United States refugee resettlement agreement. The Senate requests the concurrence of the House of Representatives in this resolution. Ordered that the message be considered immediately. move: That the House does not concur with the resolution of the Senate. That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the resolution of the Senate be agreed to"". This is a very straightforward and sensible motion that has been moved by the Senate and agreed to by the Senate. It is not a motion that has been agreed by only one party; otherwise it would not have got through the Senate. This is a motion that has enjoyed widespread support across the political spectrum within the Senate because it deals with the desperate situation that is currently unfolding at Manus. It deals with what can only be described as an emergency, a humanitarian emergency, where several hundred people have been put in situations where the basic conditions of life for them are now under threat. There were, as people would know, several hundred refugees in the camp at Manus when it was deemed to be closed on an arbitrary deadline by the government. When it was closed, the men who were there said, 'We're not prepared to be moved, because we are concerned about our safety in the place that we are going to.' And it wasn't by any means an ill-founded concern. They had this concern on the basis of what had happened to them in the months and/or years leading up to this. There have been reports of assaults. We know that people have even gone further than that, at great risk to their life and sometimes fatally. And we know that they were concerned about moving to another place where the facilities were not ready. They said that they were not going to move. When they said they were not going to move, they were met with the fiercest of responses, sanctioned by this government. I'll come back to this point, because the government wants to have it both ways. On the one hand, the government says that they're not our problem, Australia's problem, and that what happens to them is purely a matter for PNG. On the other hand, of course, we've got the government standing in the way of a potential resolution. In any event, what happened to those people after they made the decision to say, 'We are concerned about our safety and we are not prepared to move'? What we know is that, after that, forces went in and the basic conditions of life for these men-access to water, for example-were cut off. They had jury-rigged water tanks to catch the water that was falling to make sure that they could collect it and it was then converted to a drinkable form. They had",136,Resolutions Of The Senate

155,Mr Bandt (Melbourne) (15:42,"I move:done that themselves. What happened? We have reports that water was tampered with. The barrels that they were using were tampered with in a way that meant that they couldn't even collect water any more. Electricity was turned off on them, and they were denied other basics of life, including medicine. We had many reports of people who were unable to get the medicine that they needed. We were getting these reports in real time and, as far as possible, the Australian and international media was reporting on what had happened there. But of course, because of restricted access, including increasingly restricted access over the time that they were there, the Australian public was forced to rely, in many instances, on the first hand reports. Not only did we have the first hand reports; we had the United Nations staff who have been on site. The United Nations staff, when they were on site, said, 'Yes, the men's concerns have some validity; it is right that they have concerns about their health and well-being.' Crucially, the United Nations also backed up, as did many other observers, that these men have a very well-founded concern about where they're meant to be moved to, because these places are simply not ready. We're not talking, as the minister has said publicly, about paving around a patio; we're talking about whether or not these new places that the minister wants to move them to are fit and safe places to live. The report suggests they're not, and the men certainly have a well-founded fear of that. So we have this terrible, terrible situation where several hundred wretched souls are now struggling to meet the basic conditions of life, and their lives are at risk. There are many different views about how we got here. The Greens' position on that has been made crystal clear-the Greens' position about the camps, the history of these camps, how we've got here and the supervision that has led them to this point. But the reason that this resolution passed the Senate is that, whatever part of the political spectrum you sit on, people are now coming to the view that the way these men are being treated is just not right and that we need a better way of dealing with them. We need to deal with them. Whatever one wants to do about broader immigration policy, about which there are going to be fierce debates in this place and elsewhere, we need to do something about these men. I personally would prefer that they be brought here, and I know many other people in this country would prefer that. I suspect I probably wouldn't win a vote in this chamber to say they should be brought here. But fortunately, for at least a proportion of those men, we now don't have to resolve that. The government's in a position where, if it's serious about looking after these people, it can in a sense have its cake and eat it too. We, the Greens, will continue to oppose the government's policies, but let's say the government wants to keep its policies. We now have an option on the table from New Zealand. New Zealand has said that it will resettle 150 of those refugees, and it would begin work to expedite processing those refugees if and when the offer is accepted. That offer and that proposal to resettle them in many ways has parallels with what the government has done with respect to the United States. I, and many other members of parliament, might have very strong disagreements about how the government is conducting itself, but if the government is prepared to negotiate a deal that will see some of the men move to the United States then why on earth can't there be a similar arrangement that allows these men to go to New Zealand? Why isn't the government exploring it? SoI simply ask: what have you got, Minister, against them going to New Zealand? We're not saying, in this motion, to bring them here. The Senate's not saying that. I would disagree with the arguments, but I could understand the arguments that would flow. The government would talk about how we've got to maintain our borders, the people smugglers' business model and the like. I disagree with that argument, but I presume that's what the government would say if the question was to bring them here. But the question is not that. The question is whether we will facilitate the offer that New Zealand has made. In that context there can be no good reason for not doing so. If the government is prepared to send people from Manus to the US, the government should also be prepared to send people from Manus to New Zealand. We know it's a bona fide offer that has been put on the table. This motion is a motion stripped of rhetoric, and that's why it has passed the Senate. It is a motion that is stripped of messages of condemnation and so on and it's a motion that steps outside the high-level debate that we will have about what is the best immigration policy for this country and asks very simply: why can't these men go to New Zealand? I know the minister makes the point publicly when he appears on television and says, 'We're not going to be bullied or blackmailed into bringing people here.' I disagree with that point vehemently, but I reiterate that that is not what we are talking about right now. We are talking about whether or not people will be allowed to go to New Zealand and whether the government will facilitate it. If the government says, 'This is really PNG's problem; it's not ours,' then the government should make it clear to all concerned that it is not standing in the way and that, if PNG and New Zealand want to reach an arrangement, it doesn't mind. But, if the government steps in and says, 'No; actually, we're going to stop this from happening,' then how in good conscience can that be done? The government loves to parade the figure of how many people have previously died at sea. That figure is a contested one. What cannot be ignored is that there are now several hundred sitting in Manus and the New Zealand government has offered to take some of them. The fate of those souls is in this parliament's hands, and this House should concur with what the Senate has asked. (Time expired) applaud the member for Melbourne. This motion passed the Senate with the support of crossbenchers, the Greens and the Labor Party. On5 November this year the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, reaffirmed New Zealand's generous offer to resettle 150 eligible refugees from across both Manus and Nauru. It's an offer that Labor believes the Turnbull government should accept, and they should, as per the motion put in the Senate, begin to negotiate on terms similar to the US refugee resettlement agreement, to ensure people smugglers do not exploit vulnerable people and people can get off Manus and Nauru. These places were set up as regional transit processing facilities. Unfortunately, under the government they've become places of indefinite detention because of their failure to negotiate third-country resettlement options. They have negotiated one in relation to the US, and now we have an offer on the table from New Zealand. Labor's asylum policy is different from the Greens' and from the government's. It's clear we don't want the people smugglers back in business, and therefore Labor's position differs with the Greens' in terms of resettlement options concerning Australia.",137,Resolutions Of The Senate
156,The Speaker,Is the motion seconded?,139,Resolutions Of The Senate
157,Mr Neumann (Blair) (15:52,"I rise to support the amendment to the motion and IWe do believe in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement and turn-backs when safe to do so. It's clear the government has been in office for more than four years but not in power on this issue. The government has failed to negotiate other third-country resettlement options. Labor strongly supports the US refugee resettlement agreement, which would see up to 1,250 refugees approved and sanctioned by the UNHCR from Manus and Nauru resettled in the United States. At the time of the US agreement being announced, Paris Aristotle, known to many people in this place, an eminent person, the Chair of the Minister's Council on Asylum Seekers and Detention, told The Australian newspaper about the need for other third-country resettlement options, saying: That is appropriate and necessary because not everyone ultimately will be picked by the US. There will be a number of cases that will not be successful … The New Zealand Prime Minister said at the time, reaffirming New Zealand's offer: … we want to assist as much as we are able in expediting resolution on this issue … The motion from the Senate is about expediting third-country resettlement for eligible refugees on Manus and Nauru-something the government has failed to prioritise. In February 2013, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard brokered a deal with then conservative New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to resettle 150 refugees annually who had arrived irregularly in Australia by boat. So the New Zealand offer being made by the New Zealand government currently is not new. At the time, New Zealand said they would work closely with Australia as part of a regional approach to irregular migration, with the arrangement to be within New Zealand's Refugee Quota Program. This original plan was for New Zealand to resettle 150 refugees annually, commencing in 2014, with allocations formalised in the New Zealand program for both the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial year intakes. The former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, then scrapped the plans once he was elected in 2013-a wrong decision, in our view. If the agreement with New Zealand had been allowed to proceed by the then Abbott government and continued by the Turnbull government, upwards of 600 eligible refugees would have been resettled in New Zealand as of this year. It's clear that Labor was supporting the New Zealand resettlement arrangement for a long time back in the days of Julia Gillard and has continued to under opposition leader Bill Shorten. We're offering the government support for a New Zealand resettlement offer to get these people off Manus Island and Nauru and resettled as quickly as possible. We urge the government to begin negotiating conditions similar to the US refugee resettlement arrangement. The irony of all of this is that the government won't release the US refugee resettlement agreement. Labor's been calling on the government to do this. If the government can negotiate a US refugee resettlement arrangement without any pull factors in terms of people smugglers, surely-surely-it's within their wit and wisdom to negotiate similar terms and conditions with our friends across the Tasman. Even the Prime Minister's own backbench have called on him to accept the offer, with former Liberal immigration minister Kevin Andrews, the member for Menzies, saying: We should give consideration to what New Zealand is offering …The reality is that we have an intractable problem at the present time. Yes, the United States are going to take some of these people, but there's still a large number there. The current immigration minister has already agreed to terms and conditions with the United States government that he believes will prevent people smugglers using that particular agreement as part of a way of exploiting vulnerable people. We've long called on the government to release the terms and conditions of the US refugee resettlement arrangement, but, despite their refusal to release the full details, we know that the US refugee resettlement agreement is a one-off. It's up to 1,250, and there are more eligible refugees. We thank for their cooperation the Nauruan government and the PNG government. We also thank the UNHCR for the work they're doing. But the offer is only available for those refugees on Manus and Nauru, and the government should have lifted the bar for those people from Manus and Nauru here in Australia. Conditions which would be essential, in our view, would be to ensure that there are no pull factors, and the government should negotiate that. Last Monday, 27 November, the New Zealand Prime Minister made clear her stance on people smugglers: We have sent a clear message to people smugglers, and that is that the full force of the law should come down on anyone who exploits people who are vulnerable by taking money, risking their lives by taking to the ocean … The argument that people smugglers will then use that as an excuse to continue to smuggle … you could … make that argument for the United States as much as you could New Zealand. In this the New Zealand Prime Minister affirms what the member for Melbourne is saying and what I'm saying here today: those same arguments don't hold water, and the government has a false argument here. It should be noted that, following the announcement of the US refugee resettlement agreement, the government took steps to increase Australia's border security, describing it as the largest peacetime border security mission, to ensure people smugglers wouldn't exploit vulnerable people. We applaud what the government did in that regard. If an asylum seeker gets on a boat, they should be turned around and resettled elsewhere. They're not being resettled here under a Labor government. The government has pursued, negotiated and accepted appropriate conditions on the US refugee resettlement agreement. Similar conditions can be negotiated. The government can no longer sit on its hands waiting for the US agreement to transpire, when only 54 people have gone. There could be some more to come shortly, according to the minister, but only 54 people have gone. People seem to be waiting indefinitely there. This is a government woefully incompetent at the management of offshore processing arrangements. We know that the Manus Regional Processing Centre was ordered to close, in accordance with a decision of the Supreme Court of PNG, in April 2016. A full-year later, in April 2017, the Prime Ministers of both Australia and Papua New Guinea confirmed the RPC would close on 31 October this year. By that closure date the government hadn't made everything ready, and failed to be upfront about access to essential services and alternative accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees. The lack of assurance led to the stand-off we've seen on our TV screens and in the media. Now that all the men have moved from the old RPC to alternative accommodation, this government has a moral obligation to ensure refugees have access to essential services in the alternative accommodation-food, water, security, health and welfare services-but we also have a moral obligation, as set out recently by the PNG Supreme Court. It's time we moved forward, it's time we accepted the New Zealand offer, it's time the government released the US refugee resettlement agreement, it's time the government, in its fifth year in office, became the government in power in terms of offshore processing and regional resettlement, did their job and stopped blaming Labor for their failures. Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (16:02): I support the amendment from the member for Melbourne. The treatment of asylum seekers is an important issue in my electorate and is a matter of strong views. I understand the problem, I understand the need to break the business model, I understand the need to not send the wrong message to the community and I understand the importance of protecting our borders-that's really clear-but I also get the call from my electorate for compassion, for kindness and for Australians to be their best selves, and I believe these are not mutually exclusive. A meeting took place on Thursday night in the town of Beechworth in my electorate, where a gathering of 48 people signed a petition and asked me to bring a message to parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia from the Victorian municipality of Indigo and adjacent municipalities and communities draws the attention of the House to: a) The plight of people who have sought asylum in Australia but have been prevented by present Commonwealth law from enjoying its refuge; b) Our abiding concern that the Commonwealth, in its administration of such law and its consequent arrangements with the governments of Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Nauru, continues to cause these people grave distress, indignity and discomfort; and c) The aspiration of many Australians in rural communities that the Commonwealth should relieve these people of such anguish. The petition goes on, and I will make sure that the minister gets a copy, but that is my heartfelt plea to the parliament today. This offer from New Zealand, our neighbouring country, shows us they have a heart, they have feelings and they're willing to help us. The call from my constituents is, 'Please, listen to that offer of neighbourly help that they've given us.' The offer from New Zealand, to take 150 people when we have a much bigger problem, is clearly not the answer. I totally get that the government is working with America and that the aim is to close Nauru and Manus-and we want that done as quickly as possible. In the interim, I ask the minister here, with the passion of the people in my electorate and those here today, particularly members of Rural Australians for Refugees: can we find compassion, kindness and a way of working with these asylum seekers that does not punish them? I'm grateful to New Zealand for this offer and to the Senate for considering the motion. I will be supporting it when it comes up for voting. Queensland. If ever I've seen a red-hot issue which will turn the face of politics in Australia upside down, it is the issue of the boat people. Far be it from me to give praise to the Liberal Party-once a year I do it and it's at Christmas time-but they have done a good job here. There were thousands of boat people coming in; now there's not. They have to get the credit for it. The people on the other side get the condemnation for it. The position of the Australian people is quite clear. They don't want them here. You can cry and howl and say, 'I'm so sorry for these people.' Well, I feel a little bit sorry for the Jewish people in Australia who are now sending their kids to school under armed",139,Resolutions Of The Senate
158,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (16:05,"I've just come out of the election campaign inguards. I asked one man, a rabbi, 'Have you ever been attacked personally?' He said, 'Yes, I was beaten up by three them.' He said, 'My family home'-they are a very prominent Jewish family in Sydney-'was firebombed.' I said, 'Well, I don't believe that,' and he said, 'I'd expect you to say that,' and held up a picture on his phone. There was a picture of them going to church-I think they call it synagogue-on Saturday or Sunday or whenever they go. This bloke of Middle Eastern appearance-I myself could claim to be of Middle Eastern or Aboriginal appearance-runs up and grabs him by the shirt and starts screaming out: 'You will pay homage to Allah. You will go down on your knees and you will get out of this country now.' Then he started face-butting this poor person who was just going to church on Saturday or Sunday or whenever it was. The man I was speaking to said, 'You can ring up the police and ask about that incident.' So here are a family that send their kids to school under armed guard and have had their house firebombed. Their synagogue allocates $15,000 per year to clean the graffiti off the walls of the synagogue. Who was responsible for Australian people of Jewish descent being persecuted in this country? Who brought the persecutors in? I don't notice too many Sikhs coming into the country. Heaven only knows they have a claim to being refugees, with 84,000 murdered in one year. I don't notice them coming in. I don't notice Christians coming in. I don't notice the Jews coming in. So it seems quite okay for the people over here to bring in the persecutors but not to worry at all about the persecuted people in the Middle East. There's not a single person in this place, in all honesty, who could say that Christians are not being persecuted in the Middle East. Now we have 2,000 dying at sea-well, with the policies that I ascribe to, those 2,000 people wouldn't have died. So let it be upon your conscience. The realities and practicalities of this situation are that, if they attempt to get here, many of them will die. To say they're refugees is quite fascinating to me because, if you get a globe out, you will see that the Middle East is on that side-at nine o'clock, if you like-and, on the other side of the globe, at three o'clock, is Australia. If you're a refugee, you flee across the border. There are 20 million refugees in Europe, all of them in nations surrounding either Russia or Germany. They were genuine refugees. There were 12 million refugees in Europe 20 years after the war; they were still there. But they didn't get in a boat and go right around to the other side of the world. That's not a refugee-that's not a person 'fleeing from'; that is a person 'going to'. And you say, 'Why do they want to come here?' Well, I'm not going to put any conspiracy theories or nefarious interpretations upon why they want to come here. I just simply want to say that they are involved in fighting and upheavals over there. I think that, if I was a freedom fighter here in my country, if it was invaded, and if I then became a refugee, I wouldn't stop freedom fighting-no, not me! I'd continue freedom fighting from the country in which I lived. And if that country tried to stop me from freedom fighting, I suspect I wouldn't be too happy with the country stopping me from freedom fighting. I think there's over 200 supposedly-Australian people fighting in the Middle East at the present moment-not for this country but for some other country. Why do they want to come here? Well, there are 72,000 reasons for that, aren't there? If you're a husband and wife with three kids then welfare, health and all the other things put together are worth about $72,000. These people are coming from countries with an average income of under $5,000. SoI think it would be a very good idea to come here, and I'm not putting any nefarious or conspiracy-theory interpretations upon that. There are two countries-and I just haven't written down one, but the big one is Saudi Arabia-that will not take Middle Eastern refugees. One is Saudi Arabia, and the other is another Middle Eastern country. Arguably the biggest country in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia-or one of the three biggest, anyway-and it won't take any refugees at all. I mean, it knows what's going on over there, and it says no. If you say no, and you force people to understand that, 'No, you will never enter the waters of Australia if you attempt to get here; we'll just keep turning you back,' then people will know not to come, and those like the 2,000 who died at sea will simply not die. I love my fellow crossbench brother, but I think it's a little bit disingenuous when he says, 'We just want them to go to New Zealand,' because the minute they get to New Zealand, of course, they have access to Australia. So really what we're saying is, 'You can now come to Australia.' It was with deep regret that people like me in this place did not support the ALP proposal, which was the Malaysian solution. Looking back on it-and mea culpa, mea culpa-I think I should have backed it, and I didn't look at the proposal on its merits. But that was a very acceptable proposal. They were going to a Muslim country, where, presumably, they would have been a lot more happy and content than they would have been in a fairly hostile atmosphere in Australia, as people from a different cultural milieu completely. And these people-whether you agree with their religion or not-are very, very religious people, and I don't know whether we could describe ourselves as very religious people. So the government, for once, can be totally proud of their record-that they stopped people from coming to this country and stopped 2,000 deaths at sea. And this is my final statement on the matter. In the pub they said, 'It's all right going on in Sydney, but eventually it'll come up here.' I said, 'Listen, drongo, it's already here!' They said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'There were three people in my electorate murdered, with a bloke shouting out, ""Allahu akbar!"" while he was murdering them with a knife. They were backpackers, working outside Dalby, and happened to be in the Kennedy electorate.' And he used a rather vulgar expression, as my mother would describe it, and I won't repeat that expression, but he was quite astounded, as were the other blokes in the pub, that it was right here in North Queensland. I don't think it's confined to down south. There's a terrorist incident every three months now. To whom do we attribute those deaths-the murder of those three innocents outside of Dalby? Who was responsible for that? Well, if you're in this place and you make decisions, then you are responsible for those decisions. I want to see a very close parliament in the next election. SoI would urge the people on the Labor side: do not continue to pursue these politics, because you might be up against the boneless bunch over here, but they might just get a bit smart with the terror of an election around the corner! It is not a matter of politics, though I would argue that it should be; it is a matter of protecting the integrity of our nation. That is not occurring, and will not occur, when proposals like this are agreed to. want to say on behalf of the government that we oppose this motion, and so should the Labor Party.

It presided over the most significant failure in public policy in recent years, and the result of that failure of public policy was felt both in human costs and in financial costs.

We have a lot of work to do to clean up Labor's mess. I didn't put people on Manus Island; my job is to get them off it. I intend to get them off as quickly as possible, but I need to do it in a way where we don't see new boat arrivals commencing. All of the intelligence available to me from across the region indicates that we have 14,000 people in Indonesia ready to hop on boats now. We have credible information out of other markets that says people smugglers are putting this proposition to vulnerable men, women and children to pay money: 'Ultimately, you'll stay in Manus for a couple years and then come to Australia.' The latest, of course, is, 'You can go to New Zealand, become a New Zealand citizen and then come to Australia shortly thereafter.' We are not going to allow that to happen. The Greens can wax all they want. They can move their position around. They can offer sanctimonious advice to the government. They can offer false hope to people in Manus. But they are not going to change the will of this government to see people smugglers put out of business. The success that we've achieved in relation to this area of public policy has resulted in the largest number of offshore entrants into our country since 1983: over 20,000 people arrived under the humanitarian refugee program last year alone. Going to the member for Kennedy's proposition about those being persecuted in the Middle East at the moment, we've been able to help some 12,000 people under the Syrian and Iraqi intake, including women from the Yazidi community-one of the most persecuted minorities in the world-and we should be very proud of the success we've had in settling those people in our country. But that would not be possible if the boats were still turning up, if a thousand people per week were still being pulled off boats on Christmas Island, as was the case under the Labor government. I was astounded by the contribution from the member for Blair during the course of this debate. It showed to me that he either doesn't have a grasp of the basics of the issue that we're dealing with or has not taken the time to properly consider what it is that we have contemplated and what it would be for him to contemplate if he were to be successful at the next election. Let me be very clear: if we send people to New Zealand today, then, based on the intelligence that I have received, including out of Manus Island in recent weeks, the boats would restart. There is no question in my mind. We have people in Manus at the moment who were on a pathway to the United States and who have said, in light of the announcement by the New Zealand government, that they are now reconsidering their option to go to the United States because they'd prefer to go to New Zealand. That is a terrible situation and one that the government is not going to allow to continue in the minds of those on Manus Island. We have 1,250 places that are available for people to go from Nauru and Manus to the United States. The first 54 have gone. The United States has made announcements in recent days, both negative and positive hand-downs on Nauru and Manus, and we will see a further uplift of people go in the not-too-distant future. There is no push back from the United States at all, and we thank them very much for the support that they have provided to us in helping to clean up Labor's mess. As I said, I did not put people on Manus Island. I've not had a death at sea, and it's been more than 1,200 days since we've had a successful people smuggling venture; however, we are seeing efforts in this regard by the people smugglers. We haven't ruled out the option of sending people to New Zealand at some point, but we would have to, firstly, reassure ourselves that people weren't going to use New Zealand as a backdoor entry to come into Australia. It's a fact that, of the 31 boats we've stopped and turned back in recent times, four were on their way to New Zealand. So New Zealand is marketed as a destination as well, because they have a generous welfare system, health system, education system and housing system like we do in Australia. So we haven't ruled it out, and suggestions by the Greens and others that we haven't properly contemplated that option are a complete nonsense. Frankly, that they would put it forward for their own political gain at the expense of those people on Manus Island says more about the Greens than it does about anybody else in this debate. But the Greens are here today having this debate because they were supported by the Labor Party in the Senate and here on the floor today. In fact, the very words of the member for Blair in this debate were that he congratulated the member for Melbourne. The disaster that the Labor Party and the Greens presided over during the Rudd-Gillard years would be replicated by a Shorten government if they were to be elected at the next election. It's clear that many on the frontbench of the Labor Party, and on the backbench, would revert to the old policy-that is, they would allow people come to Australia from the regional processing centres. We've seen Kristina Keneally out in Bennelong in recent weeks. We've seen her public utterances as far back as 2011 that people should come to Australia, which is a green light for people smugglers. If people believe that Kristina Keneally is not representative of the majority view, I think, within the Labor Party caucus-and certainly in left wing of the Labor Party-then they're kidding themselves. The fact is that Labor would bring people from regional processing centres to Australia. The fact is that they have already declared that they would reintroduce permanent protection visas. Part of our success has been the introduction of temporary protection visas. It is abundantly clear to all of us who deal with these matters each day that Labor in government would again not have the mettle to deal with turning back boats where it's safe to do so. There is no question in my mind whatsoever that Labor would return to the failed policies that saw 1,200 people drown at sea. We have been compassionate in the numbers of refugees that we've brought to our country. We have been strong and determined in saying that we are not going to allow those deaths at sea to recommence. And yet Labor stands here today, complicit with the Greens, reminding all Australians that it has learnt nothing. To those Australians in Bennelong who I know are concerned about this issue at the moment, please be assured that Labor has learnt nothing from the past failures. The Labor Party under Bill Shorten has learnt nothing from the RuddGillard years. The fact is that human lives were lost and they would be lost at sea again. We have considered every option on the table. There is no easy option in this regard. There's no easy option that I have before me that can just allow people to come here or allow them all to go to New Zealand, and the matter will be resolved and we'll never hear from the people smugglers again. As the United Nations points out, there are 65 million people in the world today who are displaced. On top of the disaster that we've seen in the Mediterranean, we would see those pathways open up again between Jakarta and Christmas Island, and I am not going to allow it to happen. We need to work with people to provide settlement support. We provide settlement packages, paid for by the Australian taxpayer, for people to go back to their countries if they've been found not to be refugees. We've provided support to the Papua New Guinean government-and I praise the work of the PNG government and thank them for their partnership, and also the government of Nauru. We have provided support to open three new centres. The East Lorengau centre has been open for something like three years. It can accommodate 440 people. There are 305 refugees there in there at the moment, and Labor and the Greens try to tell us that the centre is not open-that it's not finished and not completed. It's a complete and utter nonsense. For the Labor Party, the Greens and the advocates to hold out false hope to those people on Manus, that the policy of the government will change and that some day they'll come to Australia, is a disgrace. They have for years offered false hope to people who have doubled down on their efforts to stay there, in situ, and not to remove themselves from the RPC, and say that the conditions are squalid and that they won't move, because they thought that would provide leverage and an outcome in coming to Australia. It is not going to happen. We will provide support to those people to move to the United States or to move to third countries or to move back to their country of origin if they've been determined not to be refugees. But we are not going to allow the Labor Party, in concert with the Greens again, to dismantle those policies which meant-and I'm very proud of this fact-that we got every child out of detention and closed 17 detention centres. If another boat turns up tomorrow under this government, or if the Labor Party is successful at the next election, those people are going into detention Regardless of whether they are women, children or men, they will go into detention on Nauru. That's the reality of the circumstance we face. The people smugglers have not gone out of business. They are there and they treat people with the same disdain that they do any other commodity. They see money in moving people; they couldn't care whether they go to the bottom of the ocean or whether they end up in Australia, New Zealand, Manus Island or anywhere else. We are not going to allow those people to get back in control of the situation. support the member for Melbourne's motion that would see those of us in this place agree with the message from the Senate. It is self-evident that the situation on Manus Island is dire. There has now been an abundance of media reports and an abundance of reports from first hand witnesses who have seen the conditions on Manus Island. They have seen the way in which hundreds of men, many of whom who have already been found to be refugees, are living in squalid conditions. I simply do not accept the words from the minister when he says that all is well there, because the fact is there are just too many reports from people who are saying the situation is dire and hundreds of men are living in squalid conditions, many in fear of their lives. That we would allow this to continue is inhuman. That we would refuse a generous offer from the government of New Zealand to voluntarily resettle at least some of those men, that we would refuse that offer, is inhuman. It's time for the government to swallow its pride. I simply do not accept that the resettlement of 150 men in New Zealand needs to be a fast-track pathway to this country. It",144,Resolutions Of The Senate
160,Mr Wilkie (Denison) (16:25,"I agree with the majority view in the Senate, and Ineed not be that way. The fact is the government needs to swallow its pride and act in accordance with the majority view of the Senate and, near on, the majority view in this place-perhaps the majority view in this place if there was to be a conscience vote on this issue. The fact is that we, as a country, need to have a legal and ethical response to people who are fleeing for their lives. Let's not forget that most people who come to this country claiming to be fleeing for their lives are found to have been fleeing for their lives. What's so hard about this country starting to act like the law-abiding, rich, fortunate and ethical country that we would like to think we are? What's so hard for us about acting ethically and legally? Why can't we start honouring the commitments we've made in any number of international agreements-agreements like the refugee convention and agreements like the Rome Statute? When we signed up to these international agreements we did so because we thought they mattered. But they don't seem to matter now because we have a government which is more inclined to pander to the xenophobia and to the racism in this community in a race to the bottom of the barrel. While I'm very heartened and pleased that the opposition, the Labor Party, is supportive of the motion by the member for Melbourne, I also call on the opposition to lift your game too. The fact is there should be no place for mandatory detention. There should be no place for offshore processing. There should be no place for any sort of temporary visa. There should be no place for the tow back of boats to countries like Indonesia. What there should be is an intelligent, legal and ethical response so that when people come to our shore by any meansby air or by boat-and they claim to be fleeing for their lives, we should give them protection. We should hear their claim, and we should give them permanent refuge if their claim is found to be accurate. That's what we should be doing. If there are people in this community who don't like that legal and ethical response, it's our job in this place to start acting like leaders and to explain to the broad Australian community why we need to act in accordance with international law and why we need to act like a fortunate, rich and lucky country, one with morals and scruples, because it's not good enough to pander to those people who would disagree with that in the community. It's time to be leaders. You know what? When I'm out in my community in the Denison electorate, sometimes someone will come up to me and say the most awful things about asylum seekers-call them all of sorts of things-hardly the worse of which is 'illegals', and says, 'They're all terrorists. They should all be sent back home.' I say to these people almost every time: 'Hang on, do you agree that if anyone from anywhere in the world is genuinely fleeing for their life, we should grab hold of them, protect them and look after them?' Without fail, they say: 'Of course we should!' And then I turn the conversation around a bit more and say: 'But that's what we're doing; that's all we're doing. When people come to this country, by any means, and claim to be fleeing for their life, we should give them protection and hear their claim.' If their claim is accurate-and it most often is-we should then give them permanent refuge. We shouldn't send them off to Nauru, Manus Island or anywhere else. Nauru and Manus Island have become our modern day prison hulks-like the hulks that were used in the Thames for convicts. This is a blot on our country's name and our reputation-and will be forever. But we can start to turn it around. It is a decent and generous offer by the government of New Zealand to resettle some of these men. Why can't the government act like human beings? Swallow your pride and say yes. It is not good enough, Minister, to hide behind that old government line: 'We've got very secret information which we can't share you. You've just got to trust us.' That's what happened in 2003, when we went to war. The government then said: 'We've got very secret information. We can't share it with you. You've just got to trust us.' When it comes to asylum seeker policy, there is no trust left. The community does not trust the government. And I'm sorry, opposition, but, despite your good efforts today, when it comes to your broad policy, the community doesn't like that either. The fact is that most people in the community want Australia to start acting like a decent, law-abiding country. They want us to give protection to people who claim to be fleeing for their life. The broad community wants us to hear their claim. Sure, if their claim is fraudulent, then send them back. I will say that again: if their claim is fraudulent, then send them back. The fact is that most people who come to this country claiming to be fleeing for their lifeor who try to get to this country claiming to be fleeing for their life-are found to be genuine refugees. Most of the people on Manus Island at the moment, rotting up there somewhere north of New Guinea, have been found to be genuine refugees. And the best plan the government can come up with is to release them into the local community or to rely on the promises of Donald Trump! Does anyone really think the United States is going to accept over a thousand asylum seekers from this country? Does anyone really think we can trust Donald Trump on this? Of course we can't. He just said what had to be said to get through a difficult moment. There is no way the United States is going to take those people. But here we have on the table a repeated invitation from the government of New Zealand to take some of them. The government should swallow its pride and accept that offer. I make the point again that politicians in this country need to stop pandering to the racism and xenophobia that lurks in the darkest corners of our community. Stop pandering to that for votes. It's only a handful of votes. As we saw in the Queensland election, there weren't that many votes when Pauline Hanson went hard for them. There weren't that many votes. I say to the government and to the opposition: leave those votes alone and stop pandering to them. Start leading the community. Explain to the community the circumstances in source countries. Explain to the community the circumstances in countries of first asylum. Explain to the community the forces at work, the difficulties in transit countries. Explain to the community why we need to start honouring international agreements like the refugee convention, why we need to start honouring international agreements like the Rome statute and why we need to give protection to these unfortunate souls. And we could start with the hundreds of men on Manus Island. If you won't accept New Zealand's offer to resettle some of them, then bring them here now. Most of them have been found to be asylum seekers. It is not good enough to have them rotting up there in halffinished facilities, many in fear of their life. It's not good enough to justify it by saying, as the government does, 'But we've got a secret! And you're just going to have to trust us that this is the best course of action,' because it ain't the best course of action. Remember, it is a crime against humanity to detain people indefinitely without trial. It is a crime against humanity to detain people in inhuman conditions. It is a crime against humanity to forcibly transfer someone to a third country. We in this government are guilty of those crimes against humanity. How about you start turning it around-through you, Deputy Speaker, to the minister-turn it around and accept New Zealand's generous offer? (Time expired) do so and say to the government that this is an opportunity for it to rise to the occasion. There are many things that this resolution is not about. This resolution does not stop offshore processing. This resolution does not assist people smugglers. This resolution is consistent with getting an outcome. At the end of the day, the government is responsible for outcomes, not just rhetoric. The PNG court determined in April 2016 what the closing date of the Manus facility would be. In April 2017, the government came to an agreement with the government of Papua New Guinea that it would close. Yet the UNHCR has indicated that the alternative facilities simply weren't all ready at the time of closure. What you also have is men who have been in detention for 4½ years with still no security as to what the future is for them. People who commit crimes, serious crimes, are often not detained for that period of time. A majority of these people have been found to be refugeesthat is, they have been found under our international obligations to be deserving of Australia's care. It has been found that we have a responsibility to these people. We simply cannot have the approach of the minister, which is to say: 'This is nothing to do with me. This is something to do with the government of Papua New Guinea, nothing to do with Australia.' The fact is that you can be tough on people smugglers without being weak on humanity. We on this side of the House take that approach. What we won't do is just wash our hands of the responsibilities that Australia clearly has. The minister says that he won't consider the resettlement option in New Zealand now. But he leaves it open for the future. He indicates that's correct. If not now, when? What is to be gained, apart from politics, in leaving these people in further uncertainty when the New Zealand government-under both the conservatives, under the leadership of John Key, and now under the leadership of Jacinda Ardern-has offered to assist these individuals but also, frankly, to assist Australia. If the minister says we have no responsibility, if he doesn't think that this is impacting on Australia's standing in the world, then he is wrong, I say to him, with respect. He might disagree with that assessment-people can look at objective facts and come to different conclusions-but it is a fact, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, that this is impacting on Australia's standing in the world. It is also a fact that John Howard, a person he admires, led a government where John Howard, in spite of the rhetoric, said that the people who were on the Tampa would never settle in Australia and never settle in New Zealand-that they'd be sent home. The fact is that many of those people are today settled here in Australia as Australian citizens and many of those people settled in New Zealand. Very clearly it would be possible for these people to come to an arrangement, which New Zealand has indicated would be possible, whereby they commit-they've said they would want to if they were settled in New Zealand-to stay there because they would feel welcome there because of the actions of the New Zealand government and the New Zealand opposition. A good friend of mine, Father Dave Smith of Holy Trinity Church in Dulwich Hill, visited Manus Island a few weeks ago. It is interesting to look at the interviews that Father Dave, as he's known, had with the people there. This is someone who travelled there out of his view of what a Christian should do. I have disagreements with him on some issues politically, it must be said, but there is no question whatsoever of his genuineness. There are so many",147,Resolutions Of The Senate
161,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (16:35,"I rise to support this resolution from the Senate. IAustralians who are looking for a genuine outcome when it comes to this situation. The fact is that a genuine outcome is settlement in third countries. If the government can say it's okay for people to settle in the United States and that that wouldn't provide a pull factor but somehow New Zealand is not okay then that is an extraordinary proposition. If the minister doesn't think that it's possible to deal with the issue of the relationship of New Zealand visas into Australia then I think he's wrong there. Quite clearly, with a little bit of leadership rather than ongoing rhetoric-and I disagree very strongly with some of the characterisations that have been made personally against the minister. I don't think that adds to the debate at all. I'm not seeking to do that here at all. WhatI am seeking to do is to say that these people, who have been in detention at what was intended to be a processing centre to then settle people in third countries, not in Australia, have now been there for 4½ years, and that is just too long. That is having an impact on their mental health as well as their physical health. It would for anyone. When I was at my good old Catholic school, one of the values that I was taught was about putting yourself in other people's positions. I say to the minister: put yourself in the position of those people. The minister needs, frankly, to act with a little bit more maturity rather than the sort of knee-jerk 'Let's hold these people almost as political hostages.' That is unacceptable. The fact is that these people need a solution. That is why we are prepared to support this resolution. We are trying to help the minister find a way out of his predicament, frankly, because, at the moment, the way isn't just to stay in a circumstance whereby he says, 'Oh well, this is all about Labor.' This is about the minister. He has a responsibility.

174,The Speaker (17:07,"Before we recommit the vote, I do want to address the matter ofhave as Speaker, of course, is that the standing order provides for missing a vote through 'misadventure', which in my interpretation is pretty much everything other than deliberately not voting. That's why that word is there. The other difficulty I have is that, with members not being here, to require an explanation from them means that we couldn't proceed to the final vote. We would have just been suspended, not doing anything. But I do think that the Manager of Opposition Business raises a reasonable point. The Senate certainly have a different approach. We can learn from them-not on everything, I hasten to say! But I do think the approach I took was reasonable, inasmuch as the Leader of the House speaks for government members; the Manager of Opposition Business speaks for members of the official opposition. But I have reflected on his point, and I do think that, now that members who missed the vote are here, they should explain to the House that they missed the vote through one of the reasons in the standing orders, notably misadventure.

It's some years since we've had a hung parliament in this place. The last time we did, there were many occasions when we were in government when we brought forward motions that we did not agree with. We brought forward a motion moved by the member for Melbourne, for example-the Fair Work Amendment (Tackling Job Insecurity) Bill 2012. We supported the procedurals for it and then we voted against the bill. But we did so on the basis that when we have a hung parliament the only way to make it work is that we err on the side of at least allowing the debate to go ahead, even if we're then going to oppose the motion itself.",160,Resolutions Of The Senate

192,Mr Burke,"At the moment, we are in a situation that we have not been in at any otherIn the same way, in government we brought on for debate a bill called the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill. It's a fair bet that when the member for Warringah moved the Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill, when we were in government, we didn't think that bill was worth supporting. But we did believe that there was a strong enough view within the parliament that it was worth debating. That's what I'm asking for at this point of each member of the House. I am not asking for anyone to declare their position on penalty rates at the next vote. WhatI am asking the House to do in the next vote is to determine, given the level of angst that is there in the community-and also, with respect to fellow members of parliament, given the level of angst that is here in this parliament-that we should not be saying in the context of a hung parliament, 'We won't even allow the debate to happen.' That's the question now. If it is not a hung parliament, very regularly governments will push through and they'll just decide, 'Well, we're not going to allow this debate to happen or that debate to happen.' They'll move that the member be no longer heard, they'll shut things down and gag debates. The members of the crossbench have consistently-and they're actually the only ones of any side who have been consistent on this-voted in favour of debate and against debate being gagged. Be in no doubt that the motion from the Leader of the House is about gagging the penalty rates debate. That's what it's about. And that's the question that I am seeking to amend with this amendment. We should be dealing with this today. And today we should also be making clearA government member interjectingFirstly, I have already offered additional hours. Secondly, this issue was meant to be dealt with last week. There was an entire week that disappeared. So, please, members opposite, don't pretend and use marriage equality as though that's an alternative to having a debate on penalty rates. I can guarantee to the House that, if this is voted for, we will deal with the penalty rates issue quickly and we will get back onto the marriage equality debate, which everybody wants to get back onto. But I simply ask every member of the House to observe the fact that, right now, we have the opportunity for cooperation. In a hung parliament, that is rare. We should take that opportunity. I ask members of the crossbench, each and every one of them, to vote, as we just did on an issue about asylum seekers, to say, 'When the parliament is a hung parliament, we will, at the very least, unite to make sure issues are debated.' Once we've been through the procedural issues the vote will fall where it will fall based on the individual views of members of parliament. But a hung parliament cannot function unless we work on the basis that the presumption will be that debate will take place. I move this amendment for one reason and one reason only: for debate to take place that otherwise this government will gag and not allow. a long debate but we should have a debate on penalty rates. The other place has debated and resolved the position insofar as this issue is concerned. What they have determined, by way of moving an amendment to the government bill, is that they want to see the penalty rates decision stopped so that the cuts that would take place in future for 700,000 retail and hospitality workers would actually be stopped as a result. Why would that not be a worthy debate for this place now? Why would we not debate an issue given that we have wage",162,Bills

For that reason, it is reasonable for members of this place to do what the Senate did today. The Senate determined this morning that the penalty rates decision should be ceased. I think it's incumbent upon members here who represent retail workers and hospitality workers in their electorates to have this debate. The Manager of Opposition Business has made very clear that this does not have to be a long debate. Nonetheless, we should have a debate because this is an important issue. We say to government members and the crossbench: allow this debate to occur. Voting for this amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business will mean we can have that debate. We can have a quick debate and then we can decide on the merits of the substantive motion that's before the House.

201,Mr Robert,"I have been waiting three hours! Time well spent, though, in the House,Committee on Treaties Report 175. It was tabled out of session on Friday, 24 November this year. Report 175 contains the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' review of five treaties' actions-the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting, the framework agreement on the establishment of the International Solar Alliance and three air services agreements. The multinational convention on tax evasion is an OECD G20 initiative designed to curb base erosion and profit shifting, referred to as BEPS. The strategies are used by international entities to minimise their tax obligations by shifting profits between jurisdictions and exploiting gaps and mismatches in the tax rules. Current bilateral double taxation agreements provide the international legal framework to prevent these practices. Australia is party to 44 such agreements and this new convention will modify these individual bilateral treaties with parties that have also ratified the multilateral treaty. However, Australia has the flexibility to apply various choices and/or reservations to limit the extent of the adoption of the multilateral tax treaty provisions. The multilateral treaty will only modify a bilateral treaty to the extent both parties' choices and reservations agree. If they do not, then the provisions in the bilateral treaty will remain. The bilateral treaty is timely. It addresses a significant and complicated problem in an environment where multinational entities exist in multiple jurisdictions and are flexible enough to make the most profitable use of taxation differences between those jurisdictions. The committee supports this important step in ensuring every entity meets its tax obligation and recommends that binding treaty action be taken. The International Solar Alliance is being established to deepen cooperation on solar research and development. The ISA is open to those solar resource-rich states situated in the tropics and is intended to facilitate the diffusion of solar technologies amongst those countries. It addresses key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy. The committee notes the aspirational nature of the agreement, and we acknowledge it opens up opportunities for Australia to promote its expertise and experience in this broadening field. We recommend that binding treaty action be taken. Finally, the three air services agreements are with the Mauritius, Israel and Hungary, and are based on a model agreement Australia has with a range of countries. These agreements are necessary to facilitate air transport services between countries, and cover access, administration, safety and security. Once again, we raised ongoing concerns that airlines operating within Australia comply with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation. We reiterated that, in future, the national interest analysis should indicate whether relevant notifications of this organisation by the other parties have been considered. In addition, we would wish to see responsible departments consult the Commonwealth Civil Aviation Safety Authority on any safety issues that might be relevant to individual agreements. The committee recommends that binding action be taken for all three air services agreements. The report also contains the committee's review of four minor treaty actions. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House. Economics Committee Report present the committee's report entitled Review of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Annual Report 2016 together with the minutes of proceedings. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e). Regulation Authority appeared before the committee as part of the review of its performance and the strengths of Australia's financial and banking regulator. APRA explained its regulatory agenda, and in particular its activities to improve the resilience of banking institutions and to improve executive accountability through the government's proposed Banking Executive Accountability Regime. The committee scrutinised APRA on measures to reinforce sound lending practices to ensure that Australian banks remain prudentially strong and APRA's recent decision to establish a prudential inquiry into the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. On 31 March this year, APRA provided the banks with guidance to limit the flow of new interest-only lending to 30 per cent of new residential mortgage lending. The letter updated APRA's guidance from December 2014, which instructed banks to limit the growth of investor loans to 10 per cent. The purpose of APRA's guidance was to maintain a strong lending environment during a time of increased risk. In response, the major banks raised interest rates on both their new and existing interest-only loans, even though APRA's guidance was related to new loans and not existing loans. Further, the banks stated publicly that the interest rate increases were a result of APRA's new guidance. For example, on 27 June of this year, the Commonwealth Bank stated: To meet our regulatory requirements, variable interest only home loan rates for owner-occupiers and investors will increase by 30 basis points. Similar statements were made by Westpac and National Australia Bank. APRA was scrutinised on the extent to which it held the banks to account for the way they implemented the 30 per cent limit on new residential mortgage lending. The ACCC's new roles and powers to investigate interest rate decisions, which flowed from a recommendation of this committee, will have a positive impact on competition in the banking sector and in making bank decisions more transparent to Australian consumers. Using these powers, the ACCC will be able to determine whether or not, in its view, any of the banks have made misleading statements in relation to recent interest rate decisions. The committee looks forward to the outcome of the ACCC's investigation on this matter and notes that it will be important for the ACCC to conduct granular analysis of the internal documents of the banks to determine whether or not those internal documents reflect the same outcomes as the banks stated publicly. The government has responded to the recommendations of the committee's review of the four major banks, in particular the establishment of the BEAR. The BEAR will set out clear accountabilities and expected standards of behaviour for banking executives, will make it easier for APRA to disqualify executives and will impose financial penalties on authorised deposit-taking institutions that do not meet expectations.",166,Committees

The committee expects that, once the measures are implemented, APRA's supervision of superannuation funds will be greatly enhanced. The committee will closely monitor APRA's performance in this area in the future. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the Chairman of APRA, Mr Wayne Byres, and his colleagues for appearing at the public hearing. I commend the report to the House. comments in respect of the report. Leave granted. of victims of bank rip-offs, the pleas of whistleblowers who were saying that there were systematic problems in this industry and, indeed, the pleas of their own members of parliament and senators, with the Prime Minister saying, 'There's no need for a royal commission; everything's all right in the banking industry,' just last week the big four banks wrote to the Prime Minister requesting some form of royal commission. And what did the Prime Minister do? He rolled over immediately. He rolled over immediately and announced draft terms of reference that-we find out today-had been in the offing for some months now, but the Treasurer wasn't told about them. The Treasurer only found out a few days ago. These terms of reference for the proposed royal commission represent the panic and ideological bent of this government, particularly against industry superannuation funds. This Prime Minister is seeking to malign the industry superannuation funds through these terms of reference, with not one skerrick of evidence that the industry superannuation funds have been involved in any of the scandals and rip-offs that have plagued the big four banks over the course of the last decade. He's seeking to malign every single industry super fund member in this country and, indeed, their boards of governance. There've been no rip-offs. There's been no evidence of any scandals involving industry superannuation funds. Yet the terms of reference of this proposed royal commission include the ideological agenda that this government has against industry superannuation funds and looking into their governance. It represents the chaos and dysfunction of this government, and it looks nothing more than a dummy spit, to be honest. The Prime Minister spat the dummy from the fact that he's had to roll over on a royal commission. He said as much in the media conference that he gave last week in announcing this. He basically said, 'Well, if I have to have a royal commission, we're going to go after those union-backed industry superannuation funds.' It indicates the smallmindedness of this government. In respect of the APRA hearings that were conducted by the Standing Committee on Economics, they perfectly represent why we need this royal commission into banking in this country. As the chair pointed out a moment ago, there were questions asked of Mr Byres, the Chairman of APRA, in respect of the behaviour of the big four banks in the wake of the new regulatory guidelines that were brought in to secure and reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices. I'm talking, of course, of limiting the flow of interest-only lending to 30 per",168,Committees

205,Mr Thistlethwaite,"After 600 days of the Turnbull government ignoring the pleascent of new residential mortgage lending and mortgage lending to investors in such a manner as to comfortably remain below the previous 10 per cent benchmark. In the wake of those decisions by APRA, what we saw was all the big four banks, almost immediately, at once, putting up their lending rates, using this as an excuse once again to make it more difficult for the average working family in this country and for small businesses. It was pointed out in the committee's draft report that CBA on 27 June, after these new prudential standards were released, in their media release stated: To meet our regulatory requirements, variable interest only home loan rates for owner-occupiers and investors will increase by 30 basis points. Westpac, on 20 June 2017, did a similar thing in lifting their mortgage lending rates. And the National Australia Bank, on 23 June 2017 in a media release, did exactly the same thing. When we questioned Mr Byres about this, his comment was quite interesting. He said: It's not a specific requirement that APRA has imposed, that they need to change interest rates. So there's the view of the regulator: they don't need to change interest rates. But the banks took it upon themselves to do it. As they ordinarily do when these opportunities arise, the banks took it upon themselves to try and gouge their customers and make it harder for the average Australian small business and working family. That's why we need a royal commission into banking in this country. It's clear from this report that the current regulatory system isn't working. If the banks can get away with doing this and no-one is there to pull them up on it then we sure do need a fair dinkum inquiry into banks and financial services in this country. Hopefully, we'll get it through this royal commission. But it's so sad and unfortunate that it took the banks requesting it from the Prime Minister to bring it about, not the pleas of victims and whistleblowers and, indeed, of many members and senators in this parliament. I look forward to, hopefully, seeing decent terms of reference for this inquiry and finally getting to the bottom of what has been going on in banking in this country and restoring confidence for customers, families and businesses.

Australia is fortunate to be not only one of the freest societies in the world but also one of the most culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse. Australia's record is not perfect, and, like any nation, it has sometimes failed to live up to the high standards of human rights and freedoms that we've come to expect in the Western world. Nevertheless, most Australians enjoy a high degree of freedom and quality of life. The right to freedom of religion, thought, conscience or belief is one of the pillars of liberty. Many Australians are descended from people who fled persecution for their faith and found freedom here, including Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews and Buddhists. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians also continue to practise their Indigenous faith traditions, while people with no religious adherence, including atheists, live free from coercion or persecution by religious authorities. We should, however, be careful not to take our strong record of religious freedom for granted. The last committee report into religious freedom was tabled 17 years ago. Since then, events in Australia and abroad have heightened Australian society's awareness of religious issues and impacted how many Australians perceive religious differences. The subcommittee's inquiry is looking into the status of freedom of religion around the world, including here in Australia. The subcommittee decided to first review and report on the current legal framework of the protection of religious freedom in Australia, prior to considering other aspects of the terms of reference and the status of the freedom elsewhere in the world. To that end, without seeking to make any recommendations at this early stage of the inquiry, the interim report reviews Australian law on the freedom of religion or belief. It considers laws protecting religious freedom at the Commonwealth level, which include the Constitution, federal antidiscrimination laws and the common law. The interim report also canvasses the laws in the states and the territories. It identifies the strengths and weaknesses of Australia's legal framework for protecting religious freedom. One of the weaknesses identified by a large number of submitters and witnesses is the fact that there is almost no explicit protection for religious freedom at the Commonwealth level. While the common law has respected religious freedom to a large extent, the Commonwealth legislative framework is vulnerable. Unlike similar countries, including New Zealand, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, Australia is the only modern Western democracy which lacks a codified bill or charter of rights. Our Constitution offers only narrow protection, which prevents the Commonwealth government from restricting religious practice, to some extent. It does not provide a positive protection of the right, nor does it prevent the states or territories from restricting religion. Apart from the Fair Work Act, no federal legislation explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion. Without expressing a preferred view, the interim report goes on to canvass a range of options suggested by submitters and witnesses on how to strengthen religious protection in Australia, including ways to implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into Australian law. Suggestions include a bill or charter of rights, a religious freedom act, or an expansion of the current antidiscrimination laws. These options will be considered in further detail as the subcommittee continues with the inquiry. The interim report also discusses the tension that exists between freedom of religion or belief and other rights, particularly the right to nondiscrimination. The subcommittee recognises that present threats to religious freedom in Australia do not arise from the typical restrictions experienced throughout history, such as the dominance of one religion over others or the state sanctioning an official religion. Rather, they are more subtle and often arise in the context of protecting other conflicting rights. This is most apparent in relation to nondiscrimination laws and in decreasing thresholds for when religious freedom may be limited. Many submissions were concerned that while religious exemptions within non-discrimination laws provide some protection, these laws in fact place religious freedom in a vulnerable position with respect to the right to nondiscrimination and do not acknowledge the fundamental position that freedom of religion has in international human rights law. The importance of this inquiry to Australian society is signified by the nearly 700 submissions received to date. The subcommittee has also held three public hearings, which were attended by legal and constitutional academics, human rights groups and government agencies. The evidence provided by the submitters and witnesses was thorough and proved invaluable to the production of the interim report. On behalf of the subcommittee, I would like to thank all of the submitters and witnesses who so far have contributed to the inquiry. The subcommittee believes that in setting out the issues in relation to Australia's legal framework, the interim report will serve as a foundational document for the subcommittee's continuing work on the inquiry. Given the topicality at the present time of religious freedom in relation to another subject, it may be of considerable interest and use to members in their reflections. The report will also provide a strong base from which the subcommittee can consider how other countries around the world protect the right of freedom of religion. In concluding, can I thank the secretariat, in particular, for their work on this interim report, in particular Sonya Fladun, the inquiry secretary; Daniel Simon, the research officer; and Rorisang Moyo, the legal adviser, who was seconded from DFAT for the purposes of working on this inquiry. I thank all of them for their considerable work, which is evidenced in the report which has been produced and tabled. I therefore commend the interim report to the House. to move that the House take note of the report. That the House take note of the report. Resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Reference to Federation Chamber That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate.

211,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (18:14,"I move:Public Works Committee Report on Public Works, I present the committee's report entitled Report 8/2017: referral made September 2017. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e). Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I have presented the committee's eighth report for 2017, on a proposal referred in September 2017. Airservices Australia have proposed the construction of a range of new aviation infrastructure at Brisbane Airport, supporting the construction of a new parallel runway. There are two parts to this proposal. The first part is focused on civil works to support the installation of new navigational aids and the provision of new fibre-optic cabling to improve communications. The second part is focused on the construction of a new aviation rescue firefighting service station. The location of this station will be critical to the ability of firefighters at Brisbane Airport to meet the mandatory response times on both runways. Once the new station is completed, the existing station will be demolished, and the site will be remediated. The committee recommended that the proposed project should proceed. The reason we suggested that it should proceed is that the bulk of the funding for this is funded by the airlines, so it's not as if it's a laborious weight on the government's or the taxpayers' coffers. It is a self-funded project, along with some commercial lending. By the nature of the board's make-up, being associated with government, the Public Works Committee provides a mechanism to unlock funds so that they can access them. The airlines that we fly on on a regular basis are contributors, along with international airlines. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the committee secretariat for their hard work in supporting the committee through this inquiry. In particular, I would like to recognise the work of Stacey Borg, who as a graduate has taken the lead in supporting the committee in this inquiry, and has done an excellent job. So, Stacey, thank you for the work that you've done. It's your first hit-out. Congratulations to you. I commend the report to the House. Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that it is vital that individuals and entities are not disadvantaged nor suffer any adverse effects as a result of conscientiously holding a particular view of the nature of marriage"".",172,Committees
212,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (18:14,On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee,173,Bills
213,Mr Buchholz,"by leave-I thank the House for its indulgence. On behalf of thebriefing paper released by the National LGBTI Health Alliance revealed that same-sexattracted Australians have a rate of suicide attempts up to 14 times as high as that of their heterosexual peers, and discrimination and exclusion are the key causal factors for their mental health and suicide attempts. Medical studies demonstrate overwhelmingly that being married is a good way to live longer. Research shows that having a spouse gives individuals something to live for, compared to their single counterparts. Looking globally, there are now more than 20 countries that have legalised same-sex marriage, including countries as diverse as Argentina, Norway, South Africa, France, Colombia and Ireland. Support in these countries for same-sex marriage is in certain instances overwhelming. For example, Denmark reported 87 per cent support for same-sex marriage. There was also compelling evidence that support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world. Back home, in May this year football players from every AFL team signed a petition in support of marriage equality, and this petition is part of an overwhelming equality campaign which hopes to continue the push for same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, the AFL Players' Association has been a signatory to marriage equality for the past two years. I believe anyone who is still unclear about the need for a change in legislation should ask the next generation how they feel about this important subject. Nowadays, when I do school visits around my electorate and get the Q&A questions as part of my session, I am faced with a new phenomenon. Primary school children used to ask me about my dog or the make of my car I drive. Now both primary and secondary students ask me, totally unprompted questions by adults: what is my position on same-sex marriage or marriage equality? When I ask the students, with permission of the teachers, what their view is, their response is that they are overwhelmingly in favour irrespective of their age or the kind of school they are attending, which really surprised me. It is clear to me that the majority of my electorate is well and truly ready to embrace change on this important topic, and it is my responsibility to represent their majority views in the forthcoming vote. So today, in conclusion, I stand to say that, as my electorate has now voted 'yes' on two occasions, La Trobe overall supports a change with the times. Love is love and, therefore, I support this bill. Let there be same-sex marriages in the Dandenong Ranges, and it will be great for business. Thank you. Ms LAMB (Longman) (18:20): I acknowledge that many Australians have lost faith in our political system in recent years. I understand that; I really do. This 45th Parliament has been plagued with inaction, indecision, infighting and instability. This catastrophic mess has turned many away from the major parties and many more from the establishment as a whole. SoI say to these people: I hear you and I empathise with you. I understand you feel angry, silenced or maybe disillusioned-maybe all three-but I urge you to look at today and recognise the importance of our political system and the great changes that a parliament can make in an individual's life. We live in a great country filled with great people, and it's exactly that which we can all too easily lose site of. Our country is only great because it is made up of great individuals, of course. Whether you are someone living on a very high income in an electorate like",173,Bills
214,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (18:17,"As I was just saying before the interruption, in 2013 aWentworth or you are somebody just getting by like in my electorate of Longman, it is you as an individual that makes our country great. It's not your pay packet, it's not the colour of your skin and it's certainly not your sexuality. It is the role of your elected representatives to stand up on your behalf and to treat everyone as equals-and, of course, to create change to make it easier for you to get by, easier to live your life, easier to be happy. These may be small changes, of course, that might help a single individual, just like how recently my office helped a man who was living on the streets to find some housing. He now lives on Bribie Island. He's getting by. In actual fact, he's more than getting by. We bumped into each other at Woolworths just last week. He has a home. He has a TV. He has a bed. He's actually got a physical address where he can say to people, 'Come and visit me.' All of these things mean that he has hope back in his life. He's happier than that sad and frustrated man that walked into my office a little bit earlier in the year. These small changes are important, and we can't deny this. Everyone should feel valued, and we must not overlook the importance of helping single individuals. But it really is sweeping changes that make life better for many individuals, and we must truly recognise these as great. There are great changes such as the introduction of Medicare, of course, by the Hawke government in 1994, which allowed anyone and everyone, regardless of privilege or disadvantage, to have access to quality and affordable health care. In 2008 Kevin Rudd officially apologised to our nation's first people for the horrific mistreatment that they have endured. As recent inaction by this government has highlighted, we still have a long way to go and a lot to do in this space, but the gesture of the Rudd government was a huge deal to many marginalised individuals, and now today I can stand here to encourage the passing of another great change, another hugely significant gesture that will be a huge deal to many more marginalised individuals. This is the responsibility of a government. It is our responsibility to change lives for the better and to forge the way, of course, for great things to happen, to take a stand and to lead the way. A government should not be dragged kicking and screaming to deliver something which could have been done a long time ago, delaying and obstructing the passage of what is right. A government should not waste over $100 million of taxpayers' money to cower from its responsibility, and a government should not open the doors for the hate and vitriol against members of our community, like members of the LGBTIQ community who have had to suffer insults and slander that was directed towards them, like those who had to hear a hateful comment when they were walking down the street and those who had to read abhorrent material in newspapers, online, public places or in a flyer in their letterbox. LGBTIQ people are strong people. They are strong people of great character and of great resolve. They are strong people that this really did take its toll on. What this vote unleashed was not fair. It was not fair that these people had to vote on their own rights, to vote for something that so many Australians already have. It was not fair they were told by so many hate-filled individuals along the way that they were inferior. To the today and I tell you: you are great and you are incredible. You are incredible for so many reasons and your sexuality is just one of those many reasons, but it is not the defining reason, of course. It is just an intrinsic part of who you are as an individual. It is just another singular part of your collective whole, like your personality, your smile or the experiences which have shaped you. No matter what anyone tells you or whatever you've heard across the reprehensible campaign, you are incredible. You are incredible, and you deserve just as much as every other Australian, and you deserve equality. Over the course of this parliament, I have spoken many times about four incredible men that I love more than anything else in this world, my four sons: Chris, Kyle, Jack and George. As any proud mum would, I have spoken of how wonderful it is to see these four boys grow into the four amazing men that they are today. Just last month, my youngest graduated from high school and so I am very proud of George, but it means I am no longer a school mumthere's a bit of relief in that. I am no longer responsible for the way these four men choose to live their life. I trust each one of them to live their live with love and compassion, to follow their dreams, to do what's right-and I know they will. But now, as a member of parliament, I have taken a new responsibility. I may no longer be responsible for the way my children choose to live their lives, but I bear the responsibility for helping change the laws that give each one of my sons a choice, an equal choice. As I have said before in this chamber, one of my sons is a member of the LGBTIQ community, and because of this-and for no other reason-he's been discriminated against by the laws of this country. Each of his brothers have grown up with the right to marry the person they happened to fall in love with, the person they want to share their life with, but he has been denied this right. I stand here today for him. I stand here today for every other Australian like him, for every other Australian who has been denied something to which everyone else is entitled to, to right this wrong, to support the progress of this bill in the name of equality. With the passage of this bill, we finally end any form of official discrimination by the Commonwealth against gay and lesbian people. We will finally recognise that the gender of the participants in a marriage does not diminish, does not change or increase the importance of that relationship, and that the state should not preclude people from participating in one of the civic norms because of people they love. For many people, their wedding day is the happiest day of their life. So how cruel is it for a government to deny someone this happiness solely based upon their sexuality? I, of course, 100 per cent support the passage of legislation that removes discrimination. However, I once again need to say that while this bill is to be celebrated, the manner of its conception leaves a lot to be desired. We didn't need an expensive survey to get here. What we needed was a government that had a bit of courage, courage equal to that displayed by generations and generations of gay and lesbian activists, activists who have changed our society for the better, who should watch with pride as this bill passes through this place. I think one of the reasons we saw such widespread community support for this change is because of the courage that was shown by gay and lesbian Australians. The change in attitudes that has taken place just within my lifetime is immense. These changes started with the brave few who were prepared to come out at risk of prosecution and certain persecution up until the decriminalisation in the seventies, eighties and nineties. In my state of Queensland, you can actually pinpoint the start of changes and attitudes to the election of the Goss government in 1989. It is easy to think that a change was just of its time, an inevitability that came with modern society, but unfortunately that is not the case. You see, the National Party at the time campaigned strongly against decriminalisation. In 1989, Nationals election as featured then Premier Russell Cooper warning Queenslanders: 'Labor even plans to make homosexuality legal.' They reassured us with: 'That's a floodgate that the Nationals will never open.' Of course Premier Cooper lost. Wayne Goss was elected, and the floodgates of progressive change really opened up. But, even after decriminalisation, the Nationals in Queensland attempted to ensure Queensland was seen as a bigoted, red-necked laughing stock. Former Nationals minister Yvonne Chapman, the mayor of Pine Rivers, removed all the toilet doors in the shire of Pine Rivers upon hearing there were a group of gays visiting Brisbane for a conference. Can you believe this? Many things have changed since then. Look where we are today. This is in part hugely because of the bravery of those who apprehensively uttered the words to their mums, 'Mum, I'm gay.' Of course, changes legislated by this bill will come too late for many of those brave activists. But, as we should remember, in any great social change we merely stand on the shoulders of giants-giants who founded a parade in Sydney, who marched in demonstrations in the face of police brutality in Brisbane, who conducted a kiss-in in front of the offices of Mayor Yvonne Chapman at Strathpine, and who came to Labor Party conferences and moved motions that at the time weren't at all popular. These were the giants who built a consensus for change. The giants in this debate were not just activists but every gay and lesbian Australian who stood up to be counted, whose relationships we celebrate not just today but at marriage ceremonies for evermore. I'd also like to acknowledge the people who object to this bill. I understand how you feel. I empathise with you; I really do. My office has received correspondence from a number of people who do not support enshrining same-sex marriage in legislation. Some of the correspondence has been filled with vile, hateful atrocities that do nothing but spread hate, anger and hostility. But most of it has been respectful opposition. I don't think less of any of these people; I don't think of them as bigots. I don't agree with the opinions that they shared with me, but I respect their right to have that view. I welcome any of my constituents passing their views on to me, whether in support or in opposition. It is an important part of the democratic process. Whether it is for religious reasons or a conservative line of thought, you are entitled to be resistant to change. But please let me tell you that the passing of this bill will not encroach on you or on any of your freedoms. This is sensible legislation that has protections in place. While we stand on the opposite sides of the respective chambers, I also commend Senator Smith and thank him for crafting it. Despite the deceptive and misleading rhetoric of many 'no' campaigners, Senator Smith has proposed legislation that allows two people of the same gender to be married under Australian law. This legislation does no more than this. In no part does it say what clothes people have to wear. It has no impact on children. There will be no changes to educational programs. It won't affect any religious ceremonies. The only people who will be directly impacted by this legislation are the consenting adults who wish to share their love for one another. This is not a slippery slope. It is a cumbersome mountain. We have lived in the shadow for far too long. It has been a long journey, a demanding climb, but we are close to the summit. We have lived in the shadow for so long now, but finally-finally-there is light. I am so proud to stand here today, to pledge my passionate support for the passage of this bill. This is a monumental change for our country. It is a monumental change for many individuals but, further than that, it is a monumental change for its couples, for the LGBTIQ couples who love each other and wish to share their love. To all of you, when this bill passes through this parliament, the 45th Parliament of Australia, should you decide that you wish to act upon your newfound right to get married, I wish you all the best. I wish you a life of love and happiness. You are all incredible individuals and, together, you will make for incredible married couples, I'm sure. I will end with this: there is nothing wrong with being gay; there is a lot right about what will pass into law with the passing of this bill. I commend this bill to the House. the results of the same-sex marriage postal survey, to enact legislation to give effect to the outcome of the survey and to seek specific protections for people of faith and religious institutions related to those legislative changes. Giving Australians a say on the issue of samesex marriage became coalition policy before the last election, and I supported that policy. Once you promise people a say, you cannot take it away. During last year's election campaign, same-sex marriage was widely canvassed by voters in my electorate. People wanted to know my view of same-sex marriage and what I thought of the plebiscite. Many advocates of same-sex marriage opposed giving Australians a say, but I think, on balance, they were wrong to do so. Same-sex marriage will ultimately have greater social acceptance in Australia than, say, in the United States, where it came about through a decision of the US Supreme Court, because all Australians have had the opportunity to have their say about the issue. Australia, in that case, is a rare country. It's one of a handful of national jurisdictions, including Ireland, Slovenia and Switzerland, where the public have had an opportunity to have a direct say on same-sex marriage. There are also a number of countries-including the United States, South Africa, Taiwan and several South American countries-where same-sex marriage has been brought about via court decisions, which is the most unsatisfactory way of achieving social change. The statistics illustrate the strength of the 'yes' vote in the postal survey. Nationally, 61.6 per cent of people voted yes and 38.4 per cent voted no. The vote was carried in all states and 79.5 per cent of voters participated across Australia. The national result represents the seventh-highest 'yes' vote ever for a question successfully put to Australians. Across the country, women were more likely to participate than men, at 81.6 per cent compared to 77.3 per cent. Some people have suggested to me that 'no' voters were less likely to participate; but older Australians were more likely to vote no and their participation rate was higher than among younger Australians. Those aged 70 to 74 were the most likely to respond to the survey, with 89.6 per cent participating. The participation rate was lowest for those aged 25 to 29, at 71.9 per cent. Berowra residents actively participated in the postal survey. In Berowra, 84.7 per cent responded to the survey. That's the second-highest participation rate in New South Wales and the sixth-highest in the country. Berowra voted 54.6 per cent yes and 45.4 per cent no. In comparison to national referendum results, the Berowra majority is the ninth-highest since Federation. As with the national result, in every category women were more likely to participate than men in Berowra: 86.2 per cent of women and 83.2 per cent of men participated. The participation rate in Berowra was highest for people aged between 65 and 84, where the rate was above 90 per cent for all categories; it was the lowest in the 30 to 34 age group, at 78.5 per cent. But everywhere in Berowra, the result was above the national",174,Bills
215,Mr Leeser (Berowra) (18:35,"This week we're assembled in the parliament to debateaverage. The result of the postal survey put to bed my fears that the turnout would be low and that there would be widespread allegations of voter fraud, which there weren't. The success of the postal survey is a credit to the government and in particular to the responsible minister, Senator Cormann. As I'd said prior to the postal survey, I'm not for changing the definition of marriage. This has never been because I wish to diminish the relationships of same-sex couples, but simply because of the view I have that marriage is between a man and a woman. I've been on the public record consistently on this issue since 2009. I spoke in this House on the plebiscite bill. I wrote a column in The Daily Telegraph. My view was widely reported in the local press in my electorate. As I said in the House last December, when debating the plebiscite bill: In the plebiscite, I will vote against changing the definition of marriage. However… in the event that the plebiscite is carried nationwide, I will vote to implement the result of the plebiscite. … … … My view of marriage is a personally held view. One advantage of the plebiscite is that it gives all Australians the chance to have their own say on what is a deeply moral and personal issue. Another advantage of the plebiscite is that, because it is a vote of the Australian people, the result will carry a political weight much greater than a vote in the parliament. Whatever the result, following a plebiscite I think activists on both sides should regard the issue as being settled. It was people on my side of the debate who called for the public to have a direct say on this matter. Having elevated this issue and asked people for their view, we have to implement that view and respect the wishes of the Australian people. To do otherwise would be to offer a Brechtian response, as if to say, 'The people are wrong. Let us elect a new people.' Therefore, I will vote yes to the bill. The passage of this bill will create a legally recognisable right for gay and lesbian Australians to marry. We all have gay and lesbian friends and family, and this will be rightly a time of celebration for them. While this has been an important debate, it has perhaps removed attention from other issues which are important to gay and lesbian Australians, such as the need for additional support services, especially given the higher rate of suicide among gay and lesbian Australians. I call on the government to put more funding into counselling services for suicide prevention, particularly among young gay and lesbian Australians. In passing this legislation for same-sex marriage, it's important to provide protections for religious institutions and people of faith. Many of those who, like me, voted no did so in accordance with their faith tradition. As parliamentarians, we need to balance competing rights as between minorities and majorities and as between competing minorities, and that is our task in this bill. So, while I'll vote yes to this bill, I'll also vote yes to additional religious protections. I believe we can have same-sex marriage and religious protections too. Many people of faith in Berowra have written to me to express their concerns about the need to protect religious freedoms. I will vote to give voice to those protections within the bill. Unfortunately, the public reaction to the idea of religious protections has revealed that religious literacy is not what it once was-not our level of religious observance but our level of knowledge, particularly about Christianity, the religion which has shaped the free society in which we live today. If understanding of Christianity in our culture were stronger, perhaps there'd be more sympathy for religious protections. Despite the census result, people of faith often feel that they're in a cultural minority, if not a numerical one. In some quarters, there's been an attempt to usher faith out of the public square and to diminish or mock people of faith as being superstitious, backward looking or not relevant to modern Australia. We see this especially when church leaders appear on Q&A. But faith and religious communities are important to the moral ecology of our country. Religion provides answers to some of the fundamental questions of life like: Who am I? Why am I here? How then should I live? At the heart of the Judaeo-Christian tradition is the radical notion that, whoever we are-young or old, black or white, gay or straight-we are created in the divine image and derive our human dignity from that fact. This fact motivates people of faith to great acts of heroic service. Religious communities provide much of the education, health and social welfare infrastructure in this country, and they bring an extra element to their service because of their teaching about human dignity. Sometimes this debate has been presented as same-sex Australians versus people of faith. It shouldn't have been put that way. On that point, I note the statement of the Catholic bishop of Broken Bay, Peter Comensoli, whose diocese covers my electorate. Bishop Comensoli wrote: While I had hoped for a different outcome, I readily acknowledge the result of this survey and respect the firm decision made by the Australian people. … … … I want to stress, once more, that I never considered this a 'referendum' on the worth or dignity of gay and lesbian people, which is beyond question. My concern has always been with the question of what constitutes marriage as a distinctive kind of relationship, and the unique roles of husband and wife in a family. BeforeI came to this place, I had the privilege of working as a senior executive in the largest mission of the Catholic Church in Australia, at Australian Catholic University. I also served on the board of a Catholic aged-care and health organisation. As a person of the Jewish faith, it was a particular privilege to work for these large Catholic institutions. I regard working for these missions of the church as one of the greatest privileges of my life. Christians, as I learnt, have a holistic perspective on the nature of marriage, life and family. It's not a minor article of faith but is central to their tradition and, indeed, to their whole outlook on life. It's a perspective which is shared by people of my faith, and yet it is a perspective which is not well understood and often not sympathetically treated in broader parts of society, particularly the media. My concern about religious freedom is motivated by the way in which this issue has played out in our country and also in foreign jurisdictions. Activists have resorted to lawfare to make a point. Some of those activists are not interested in the position of same-sex couples. Rather, they're interested in attacking the churches and further diminishing their role and status in society. It's for this reason, in the context of litigation, that people of faith seek particular protections and defences, which I support. The religious protections in the bill currently before us focus on protections relating to the marriage ceremony and subsequent celebrations. However, the need for religious protections goes beyond the marriage ceremony itself. It goes to the right to teach and preach about marriage. In changing the definition of marriage, we need to ensure that religious leaders and people of faith can continue to preach without harassment, even though the law has changed, that, according to their tradition, marriage means between a man and a woman. The right of people of faith to choose to teach their children about the faith of their parents is vital to the continuity of any faith community. We also need to ensure that these rights are granted to religious schools so that they can continue to teach unimpeded what marriage means according to their tradition. Therefore, I will be supporting protections for people of faith and religious institutions, which are proposed by some of my colleagues. I want to say something about the inquiry on religious freedom which has been set up under the chairmanship of my distinguished predecessor Philip Ruddock. To the extent that such an inquiry makes recommendations about specific protections in legislation, addressing individual problems and issues identified by faith groups, then I will support them. But, to the extent that it becomes a stalking horse for the introduction of a bill of rights, to that I am implacably opposed. I know the idea of legislating for the broad principle of religious freedoms as opposed to individual exemptions is increasingly attractive to people involved in the governance of faith based organisations. But the global experience, not least in Victoria, should gave faith leaders serious pause before enacting global human rights conventions and broader principles into our law, especially in the form of a bill of rights, which will do little to protect people of faith and instead transfer decisions on issues such as these from the parliament to the courts, which are no friendlier to people of faith and indeed may be more hostile than elected representatives. At the end of his long life, Sir Isaiah Berlin, the great British philosopher, received an honorary doctorate at the University of Toronto. Reflecting on the 20th century, he spoke up for compromise from absolutist positions. That compromise is what is needed now. In addressing the question of how to reconcile competing values, Berlin had this to say: I am afraid I have no dramatic answer to offer: only that if these ultimate human values by which we live are to be pursued, then compromises, trade-offs, arrangements have to be made if the worse is not to happen. So much liberty for so much equality, so much individual self-expression for so much security, so much justice for so much compassion. My point is that some values clash: the ends pursued by human beings are … generated by our common nature, but their pursuit has to be to some degree controlled-liberty and the pursuit of happiness, I repeat, may not be fully compatible with each other, nor are liberty, equality, and fraternity. So we must weigh and measure, bargain, compromise, and prevent the crushing of one form of life by its rivals. I know only too well that this is not a flag under which idealistic and enthusiastic young men and women may wish to march-it seems too tame, too reasonable, too bourgeois, it does not engage the generous emotions. But you must believe me, one cannot have everything one wants-not only in practice, but even in theory. The denial of this, the search for a single, overarching ideal because it is the one and only true one for humanity, invariably leads to coercion. And then to destruction, bloodeggs are broken, but the omelette is not in sight, there is only an infinite number of eggs, human lives, ready for the breaking. And in the end the passionate idealists forget the omelette, and just go on breaking eggs. Like Berlin, we need to make the omelette that is this law through compromise by saying yes to same-sex marriage and yes to protections for religious institutions and people of faith beyond the marriage ceremony as well. That is why I'll vote yes to religious protections, but, even if those protections amendments do not succeed, in accordance with my promise, I will vote for the bill in the second and third reading stages. and reasoned, even when I don't agree with him, but I often do. I will also record some words, although, in my view, this debate has dragged on for far too long. Like so many people in my electorate, I'm frustrated because there are so many other enormously important issues facing",178,Lgbtiq Individuals Across Australia.

216,Mr Hill (Bruce) (18:48,"It is a pleasure to follow the other Julian-always thoughtfulthe nation that we could and should be spending time on. Indeed, we could have come here last week and turned up to work and cleared some out of the Notice Paper. But here we are still, and finally now we can finish this. I know that this means so much to many Australians, straight and gay. I know that many of my colleagues also feel strongly about this, as do my friends. This issue should have been addressed, debated and resolved by this parliament years ago, without an unnecessary, divisive, wasteful, expensive, time-consuming and legally ineffectual optional postal survey-or quiz, as it would be more accurately styled. When the government failed to get their legislation through for the plebiscite, we should have simply had a free vote-radical, I know! Do the job we are elected to do. I know from private conversations that many of those opposite agree with that. But the Prime Minister is too weak, too bruised, too hostage to the Taliban faction in his own party room for something that sensible to have happened, or for him to have done what he actually believed was right. So, in their inimitable way, they came up with the worse possible outcome or solution to the Prime Minister's spinelessness: an optional, Dolly-Doctor style, 'answer and tell us only if you want to' quizpoint of order? Mr Sukkar: I'd ask the member to withdraw his reference to 'the Taliban faction'. It is inappropriate to refer to anyone in this House or to make any such comparisons to anyone that sits in this chamber. that's a term your own members use all the time in relation to the conservatives and it has been in the newspaper a lot. But, anyway, let's move on. As I was saying, in your brilliant way, you came up with the worse possible solution to the Prime Minister's spinelessness: an optional, Dolly-Doctor style, 'answer and tell us only if you want to' kind of quiz, to obstruct, delay and stymie. The only silver lining to this mess is that the Australian people have stepped up wonderfully with a turnout rate around 80 per cent, which has given this whole sorry, shameful exercise sufficient validity to finish it now. This was not because Australians wanted to have their say, as the Prime Minister keeps waffling. The real scientific polls would suggest quite the contrary. People stepped up and sent back their surveys when we, the parliamentarians and the legislators, failed to do our jobs. I'm greatly relieved the national turnout was strong and that the people took charge when we failed them. Senator Smith was absolutely correct when he described his own government's policy to hold a plebiscite on this issue as 'abhorrent'. A waste of $100 million, this weak, pathetic excuse for a Prime Minister called it 'an investment'. Yet, here we are, finally doing the work we were elected to do at a cost of $100 million just to get to the starting line and open the debate. This is only the financial cost. We heard at the outset that this would be a harmful and divisive debate. And so it came to pass. Sadly, the warnings of mental health impacts have been more than borne out with a reported surge and enormous spike in demand for mental health support for too many LGBTQI Australians and their families. For that we should all",181,Lgbtiq Individuals Across Australia. I Tell You That You Are Not Inferior And I Stand Here

219,Mr Hill,"I withdraw in the interests of proceeding with the debate, although I noticesay sorry. Most especially, Senator Canavan, should say sorry for his callousness and lack of empathy-pretty much every time he opens his mouth. A touch of compassion, understanding and generosity would not have gone astray. Indeed, it would have been the decent, Christian thing to do, and people might dislike him a little less. We heard that the debate would be disrespectful. I think most Australians conducted the debate about the definition of marriage quite respectfully. Most people put their views on the issue at hand sensibly, at least in my community from what I heard. I had many thoughtful conversations with many of my constituents and heard a wide range of views. The problem was the licence that this weak Prime Minister's quiz gave for all sorts of other vile rubbish. It is a pity most of the national 'no' campaign seemed to be about everything and anything but the actual question at hand. It is probably good the standing orders preclude us from reading into Hansard many of the horrible emails we all received. Probably the worse stuff was said about the children of our LGBTQI families. But, truth be told, the primary reason for my strident and abiding opposition to this quiz is quite simply because this is not how we make laws in Australia and it is of no legal effect. The fact that we now have to have this parliamentary debate proves that. Under our Australian Constitution, this federal parliament has the power to legislate on this issue and the responsibility to do so. Mob rule is not how laws are made in a diverse, liberal, representative democracy like ours. The last time we tried plebiscites was in 1916 and 1917 on the issue of conscription. This tactic also divided the country, community and families. I understand and share the euphoria and the relief of the 'yes' campaigners and my fellow who campaigned so hard, for having the strength of their convictions and for giving voice to their values. While I do believe that equality will ultimately win in Australia, the land of a fair go, change is not inevitable and is never easy. Change and equal rights are only secured through the efforts of social warriors like those who fought for this. I record my thanks and acknowledgement of the wonderful Tim Gartrell, who led the national 'yes' campaign and should be applauded for his work and commitment. These people continue, and honour, the proud decades-long legacy of those who came before us fighting for decriminalisation and equal rights-as the member for Grayndler so eloquently articulated earlier today-drawing on the heritage and the legacy of the '78ers, those brave people who marched in the first Mardi Gras. That was not a celebration on TV; they were being pelted with rocks and eggs. I am not that old, but, not that long ago, homosexual acts were still criminalised in every part of Australia. It sounds ridiculous to modern ears, but, even worse, there are many Australians alive today who were born when, in some states, being gay was an offence still punishable by death. There is not enough time today to explore the sad similarities between many of the conservative arguments run by the 'no' case-indeed, we heard some with the previous speakers-and the arguments that were put every single time the issue of equal rights came up in the past such as 'but that's just how things are;' 'it's against nature;' 'I have nothing against them but…;' and 'it's a slippery slope to…' The same arguments were used years ago to oppose decriminalisation of homosexuality, interracial marriage, the abolition of slavery and women's right to vote. It's the same conservative logic. I am pleased the matter has been resolved decisively by the Australian people, and my vote will reflect that outcome. But I remain troubled by the dangerous precedent of 'the quiz', which I hope our nation never repeats. Who will be the next minority group you put to a vote? It is a very serious question that warrants careful, quiet reflection by so-called people of conscience. I hope we learn from this and Australia never does this again. A few words are in order to acknowledge that the result of the quiz in my electorate was against the overwhelming national response. I love my electorate and I love my community. I have said numerous times that the human diversity in Bruce, especially the multiculturalism and the high percentage of first-generation migrants, is something I take daily delight in. I'm so proud to serve and represent my wonderfully diverse and caring community in this place. Of course, I know my community well and I'm not entirely surprised that the result of the quiz was a bit lower than the national vote. In significant part, there is a nationwide and decadeslong established pattern that many first-generation migrants have fairly conservative views on some social issues. Bruce also is a little older age-wise than surrounding seats and the youth turnout was well below the average. These factors combined to produce a result lower than the national response-although, of course, many older people and many migrants voted and campaigned 'yes' in support of equality and we can't generalise too much. But the most common view I heard from people-from both those supportive and those opposed-was bemusement that the parliament couldn't just have a vote. And there was utter frustration that we were not dealing with what most people in my community perceive to be more important issues-jobs and the economy, the rising cost of living, the increasing taxation burden on PAYG taxpayers, fixing Medicare and the mess of the NBN. I remember a conversation I had with a lovely woman at a community event. She had migrated from South Asia some years ago. She told me she would tick the 'no' box, consistent with her cultural tradition, although she wasn't overly fussed. She told me that, being from a developing country where there is enormous need and poverty, Australians, to her mind, seem downright crazy to be spending $100 million on this. I could not disagree with her. A common view regarding marriage I heard from many people who had nothing against gay people but feel strongly about the traditional definition of marriage was to ask why marriage must be legislated at all-why not have a common national civil union under the law, so that people are equal, and leave marriage to whatever institutions people want to deal with it according to their traditions and preferences? Personally, that is a view I have much sympathy for. But the reality is that the Constitution specifically empowers us to make laws with respect to marriage, and that is what we must do. Ultimately, this is a national issue and these are national laws. Like everyone here, I too feel bound to respect the overwhelming national support for marriage equality. There is one other important point I want to make. I want to make it very clear, as I have done since the moment I was preselected to run for the seat of Bruce, that equality is a core and overriding principle that I am, and will be, guided by. In representing such a diverse community, I will always keep to my word and vote to back equality under the laws of Australia for everyone, every time, every day of the week. I do so now in this parliament on this matter, and I assure my constituents and this House that I will do so in the future should one part of our community ever suffer, or be at risk of, discrimination under Australian law. We are one of the most diverse nations on earth, and I don't believe that politicians should pick and choose on equality, including in relation to love and marriage. People love who they love. Personally, I've never been married or desired marriage. My daughter was born when I was 22, and it was never a question then between her mum and I. I do quite like weddings, especially those that are palpably, tangibly filled with love, and I was at one, with my friends Daniel and Paula, trying not to drown in the rain in their backyard on Saturday night, surrounded by their kids. But this isn't about my personal choices. I believe my role as a legislator, as I said, is to ensure equality before the law of Australia so that people are equal, and free to make their own choices. Finally, in relation to this bill, I've said consistently that I'd never support legislation that forces a religion to marry people against their tradition and that proper protections for religion are also important. Religious freedom is a serious topic which deserves proper consideration. The issues raised are much broader than marriage, which this bill deals with, and the bill before the parliament does not stop religious traditions or people of faith from expressing their view of marriage. We need to give careful thought, in a separate process, to what may be necessary, and I will carefully consider the outcomes of Philip Ruddock's panel next year. But we must not use this issue as a licence or pretext to expand discrimination. Some in this debate are misusing the notion of religious freedom, confusing it with religious privilege, and also forgetting that freedom from religion is, for many people, just as important in the public sphere. I'm glad that the Prime Minister-I'll say this-found at least one vertebra and killed off Senator Paterson's self-promoting bill. It's astounding, though, that Senator Paterson even actually came up with it, and he'd do well to remember that this is the national parliament, where we make laws that impact on real people in the real world; it's not like a brainstorming session at the IPA right-wing lobby group where he, no doubt, excelled. We shouldn't really be surprised, I suppose, that that was his second notable contribution to public debate, following on from his stunning debut, where he proposed that we sell the national art collection and bank the proceeds! But anyway, that's enough. This whole episode has diminished this parliament, and the Liberals should get no credit for it. As with the history of every other social reform where they happen to have been in government, they've been dragged kicking and screaming to it. 'Leading' to them means 'being the last one to act' when public opinion is overwhelming and the activists-mainly from our side-for decades have done all the hard work. But here they are. Liberal Party HQ should be sent a giant invoice for the cost of this quiz, kind of like the reverse of the old big chequesremember the old big cheques that were so popular in yesteryear at launches and grant announcements?-and they should cough up $100 million and a big apology note. But, as I said, I'm thankful-and I'll record that again in closing-that the Australian people have stepped in and stepped up when this parliament failed to do our job and that the people have expressed a clear, overwhelming view, which I respect and am now guided by. SoI hope we get this done quickly so that those whom this change will affect-not many, in the scheme of the population-can live their lives the way they want to, and so that we in this parliament can then get on and actually deal with the many critical issues that demand our attention. pleased to contribute to this debate.

220,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (19:03): I amelectorate of Dickson who took part in the electoral process. It was an important democratic process, and I pay tribute to those people who voted, yes or no. In the end, my electorate recorded a high 'yes' vote of 65.2 per cent, which compared with 61.6 per cent overall and the 60.7 per cent vote in Queensland. I want to pay tribute also to the 7.8 million people who, across the country, voted yes and the 4.8 million people who voted no. There is no moral high ground in this debate, and we shouldn't be chastising the 4.8 million people who, we recognise, have firmly-held beliefs and have voted no in this plebiscite; we recognise the value of their vote and their opinion, and they are not diminished through this process at all. I want to make just a couple of points on what obviously has been an emotive debate over a long period of time. I can remember, going back to the Howard government days, debates within the party room and within the ministry around the issue of the prospect, at least, of changing the definition of marriage, and, in my judgement, from the moment when the Abbott government took the decision to ask the Australian people about whether or not a change should take place, it was obvious to me that the public would support a change in the definition of marriage, and so it followed. I pay tribute to my colleagues, both within cabinet and across the party, for the grace with which they've conducted themselves in this debate. It is an emotive debate. People have held strong views for a long period of time, but I think the fact that people have been able to respect those differences and contribute to the debate is a great credit to each of them. I acknowledge what has been an important process through the postal plebiscite, which was contentious to start with but necessary, in my judgement. I thank those people who were in favour and those who were against such a process. We had a number of conversations with people, but, in the end, it resulted in 11 million or 12 million people plus voting and having their voices heard in this debate. Had we had a parliamentary vote where several of our colleagues had crossed the floor in a five-minute-to-midnight move, it would have been a bad outcome for the government and a false start to this change in social policy. Given that an overwhelming number of Australians have voted in favour of the change, it gives a legitimacy that would not otherwise have existed had a parliamentary vote taken place. For any important social change, whether you're in favour of or against that change, it is important for the Australian public to know that the process has been a proper one, that the majority have been heard and that those people that have conducted themselves during the course of the debate have ultimately had the ability to cast their vote. I made it very clear during the course of this debate that I would vote no during the plebiscite but I would vote for the bill in parliament if a majority of Australians voted yes, and that's what I will do. I believe that if we proposed a democratic process-and I pushed very hard for the postal plebiscite-we should adhere to the outcome of that vote. That is what the government has undertaken and that is what we are in the process of delivering. It is important that further protections be provided within this bill. I will support sensible protections that are being proposed. I pay tribute to a number of my colleagues, including Senator Seselja, Michael Sukkar, Andrew Hastie and others from the Senate and this place for the courage they have demonstrated in relation to this debate. There have been a lot of critics around whether we have been active enough in the 'no' campaign or in the subsequent process. I'll leave that for others to comment on, but I pay tribute to those colleagues and thank them for having the courage of their convictions and for working through that process. It is very hard to see how those protections can survive the vote in this House, as was the case in the Senate. The fact is that on a good day, as we know, we have a one-vote majority in the lower House and, given the circumstances of this debate, where Labor-shamefully, in my judgement-has bound its members to a position of not supporting amendments, it makes it near impossible for that vote to get up. Nonetheless, the debate will continue over the course of the next 48 or 72 hours or so. Perhaps there is some prospect, but in this business we face the reality of arithmetic, and that is the reality in this parliament, which, given our one-seat majority, is what led to the plebiscite. I pay tribute to colleagues, including Trevor Evans, the member for Brisbane; Warren Entsch; Tim Wilson; and others on the other side of this debate, who had a very passionate view and prosecuted their argument. I thought that during our discussions with them around the plebiscite they conducted themselves in an honourable way, and I acknowledge that. It is the case that, as I said in my opening remarks, the definition of marriage was always destined for change when the Abbott government took a decision to go to a plebiscite. The Labor Party and Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, had been opposed to change for a long period of time. Julia Gillard, the former Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, had been opposed to any change to the definition of marriage, and Labor had done nothing to change the law or introduce same-sex marriage during the six years of their time in government. Mr Shorten, of course, has now flipped his position and has, remarkably, claimed credit for the outcome, even though he was quite a passive participant in it. The decision having been made to go to a plebiscite process, it's hard in this country to carry a debate or, in this case, to see a successful 'no' case prosecuted when, essentially, this argument distilled down to one of religious belief. Much of the argument around children of same-sex couples has been dealt with and legislated for by state governments over the last decade or so. When this distils down to a question of religious belief or practice, the case remains that it is difficult to prosecute that particular argument when even the churches were absent from the argument or, in many cases, were advocating a case for change of the definition, including Jesuit priests in Sydney. That's the reality of the debate. I believe very strongly that the postal plebiscite was the right judgement. It was the right decision for this government, and the number of people who turned out-the number of people who have had their say in a peaceful democratic process-was very important. We embrace social change when it happens and that's the job of this parliament. There have been social changes and changes to legislation that people have agreed with or not, and election outcomes that people have agreed with or not, but, in the end, we abide by the outcome that the people provide. I congratulate those people who have been involved in the 'yes' case, some of whom I mentioned in my earlier remarks, and acknowledge the work that they've done to achieve an outcome that they saw fitting. I don't think there will be success around the level of protection that is required to enhance this bill. It's not a frustrating process, in the sense of delaying the passage of this bill through the parliament, but I do think it would be improved if we had additional safeguards in placesensible safeguards and safeguards that I believe that people would, in the majority across the country, support. If they gave proper contemplation to what is being proposed over the course of the next couple of days, I do believe that Australians would support those safeguards. It's why it is important for us to have another process, which-and I can understand the arguments for and against this-the Prime Minister has announced will be led by Philip Ruddock and will report back next year, because I think there is a proper debate to be had in this country around religious protections, around parental protections and around parents being able to have a say about how their children are taught, particularly if they make a decision to send them to an independent school. I think it's important for us to respect, even if we don't share the same Christian values or beliefs, people's right to practise their religious belief unhindered. Out of the shadow of the marriage debate, once this law has passed and once this question has been settled, we'll have a greater chance of success next year because people, including the churches, will be able to advocate for this position, not in the context of the debate surrounding same-sex marriage but in a fresh light, and I think that is important because those protections are necessary. This debate-this trend; this vilification-is heading in one direction. We need to, as many other democracies have where same-sex marriage has been legislated for a long period of time, have religious protections in place. We need protections because the fundamental belief structures are what underpin our society. Our success as a human race and our civilisation depend upon those pillars going forward. It is incumbent upon us, in the new year, to have a more sophisticated debate than we've been able to have in relation to the protections aspect in recent months, and I think that is important. It's a process that I will support. I hope that some of the protections that are being proposed by honourable members are successful in this place, but, as I say, the arithmetic, in my judgement, dictates otherwise. This is an important debate to continue, and I think it has greater success of public traction, of greater understanding within the public's mind and of greater contemplation of the complexities that have been proposed, the difficulties that we seek to address and the attacks that we seek to neutralise during the course of debate next year. I think that is incredibly important. I said at the start that my intention is to vote yes on this bill, and I commit to that again tonight Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (19:15): A man named Brian wrote to me last week. He said, 'The past year has been excruciating for Andrew and me. For me, it evoked memories of being harassed and bullied when I came out in high school in 1993. Vacillating between pride and self-loathing, this was a period when I attempted suicide four times. I felt vulnerable again during the debate, a feeling not felt since I was that 15-year-old. I had to take medical leave from work to manage my anxiety and depression when it became apparent earlier this year that the marriage equality debate was about to intensify. I had to take steps to protect myself mentally. I had to affirm my value and worth. I'm hopeful that when marriage equality is achieved it will satisfy my 15-year-old self and all the young vulnerable people in our community that we are not the rejected, the abnormal, the deplorable, the deviant but are cherished and highly respected equals.' Brian, I'm voting yes this week for you, mate, and for Andrew. I went to school with Brian in the early to mid-1990s. I'm voting yes because the bullying that he went through at our school, that I'm ashamed of not stopping, does not square with what I took from those 12 years of Catholic education-not just the lifelong friends or the ideas of service and social justice, but, above all, to love thy neighbour, the idea that we treat others as we would be treated. We failed Brian then-I failed him then-but we will not fail him now. Because as we reflect on the overwhelming support for marriage equality in this country, one inspiring thing about the last few weeks, amidst the wreckage, is that we showed that we as a country have the capacity to treat others as we would be treated; that we do have the collective ability to walk in each other's shoes, that most admirable of all human attributes; and that we can support change which may not narrowly impact on our own lives or marriages but which welcomes, includes and enriches us all. The government asked an incredibly difficult thing of gay and lesbian people in Australia. It asked Australians to judge whether some of us deserve to love and be loved and to have that recognised like everybody else. It is hard to overstate the hurt that has been inflicted on our brothers and sisters by asking the country to vote on the worth of their relationships. I'm voting yes for my brilliant friends Chris and Dan, who wrote this about that survey: 'We are very lucky people with nothing to complain about. We have amazing families and friends and have had the good fortune of a great education and careers, yet during the survey campaign there were days when we both felt like outsiders in our own country. We felt at times sad, angry, confused and sometimes all three.' Chris and Dan believe that in resolving this here this week 'it is that new feeling of equality that counts the most. It's knowing that kids growing up today that happen to be gay won't have to worry about being the odd one out anymore'. The postal survey was unnecessary and divisive, and we now need to come together. We do so having learned a lot more about ourselves, about our ability to walk in each other's shoes, about the capacity for our community to step up and lead when the government fails the community and also about how changes which may seem so far down the track can all of a sudden appear within reach and be achievable. Many of us fear that as a country we are becoming more polarised and polarising, more insular, more concerned with our own circumstances than the circumstances of others, afraid and intolerant of differences. But this vote shows the opposite. More than six in 10 of us said yes, so many of us with enthusiasm and with pride. That shows that we care about the people around us, that we understand their situation and that we empathise with them, and that gives me great hope and great heart for the future. I was confident that the 'yes' vote would succeed nationally, but, if I'm honest, I underestimated the groundswell of support in my own state and in my own community. Queensland, where I am proud to be from, is in many ways still viewed as a very conservative place. In 1991, we were the last mainland state to decriminalise homosexuality, thanks to our finest Premier, Wayne Goss. As a state we have come so far. We have confounded our critics, with Queenslanders delivering a resounding 'yes' vote of 60.7 per cent, more than New South Wales. In Logan city, the place where I was born, where I grew up, the place I live in and love, I thought it could go either way. But, in my seat of Rankin, I'm so proud to say that three-quarters of people participated and 54.6 per cent of our community voted yes, and there was an even more resounding result next door in Forde. I'll be proudly representing them when I cast my 'yes' vote on their behalf in this place this week. My community and so many other electorates around the country have overwhelmingly voted for compassion, for fairness and for equality. They stepped up when the parliament failed to deliver the resolution that so many on this side of the House and other friends have been pushing for for so long and for too long. And we know that this progress is being made despite the Prime Minister and not because of him. I'm voting yes because it is not for us to determine where love begins and ends. When I asked my wife to marry me, I didn't survey millions of people. I never had to worry about fundamental questions like: could we marry, and how would society judge our relationship? We got married in Byron Bay, a cherished place, a sentimental place not far from our home. We didn't have to leave our own country to have our vows recognised. On our wedding day, Penny Wong was there with Sophie, and Penny and Sophie had to sit through that formal part of the ceremony that many people here are familiar with that limits weddings to being between a man and a woman. Chris was there as well. I've mentioned Chris already. It was before Dan was a part of our scene. Chris described that part of an otherwise happy wedding as 'a seed of sadness', in his words, which 'makes gay people feel like they are the odd ones out'. My stepbrother, Shannon, is a total legend, a great mate of mine. He was there too of course on that on that wedding day, and he describes that part of the ceremony as being 'that stab in our hearts'. He and his partner, James, have been together for two years now, ever since they met for a quiet beer on a Saturday afternoon like countless other couples have throughout time. I'm voting yes for Shannon and for James. What our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters are asking for in this bill is not actually that much to ask. It's certainly not too much to ask. It's the very least that we can do. I finish by reflecting on the words of a very talented and charismatic mate of ours called John who worked with us here in this building for a long time but who now lives overseas and who has been closely watching and celebrating our progress from afar. He reckons this debate has been about more than marriage equality. It's about addressing the dread that many young gay people feel that something is wrong with them and addressing the feelings of shame and self-hatred that accompany coming out. John wrote over the weekend: 'To me, the greatest significance of this recent vote and this legislation is not that anyone in Australia will now be able to marry whomever they love-though that is indeed an act of electrifying power and something that my friends and I celebrate with happy hearts. The greatest significance is in the affirmation that we are all equal, that we are all worthy of love and respect, that we are all valued and accepted. It is in knowing that the entire nation has said to the young person struggling with being different that 'There is nothing wrong with you; you are as important and as human and as Australian as the rest of us.'

I say to all of them and to all of us the same thing that I have been signing off to emails back to hundreds, if not thousands, of people who have written to me in the past few weeks: 'We are nearly there.

221,Mr Wallace (Fisher) (19:24,"I've had the privilege of serving the people of Fisherthe member for Fisher to speak on this marriage equality bill and to vote in accordance with my conscience. I would like to thank the Prime Minister for affording me that opportunity. I think it's fair to surmise that few bills will generate as much controversy and consternation amongst the Australian people as the one which is the subject of this debate. As a barrister I acted as counsel assisting the coroner in respect of number of road deaths on the Sunshine Coast. The coroner, Maxine Baldwin, would often remark that in her role she needed the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon. I find myself wishing today, as I often do, that I too had Solomon's wisdom as I prosecute my responsibilities as a parliamentarian. I closed my maiden speech in this place with a prayer written by Reinhold Niebuhr-a prayer I should like to open this speech with today: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. The issue of same-sex marriage is a deeply personal one for many Australians and for many more Australian families. Many of us have a story to tell about same-sex marriage, and these stories illustrate and illuminate the complexity of the legislative challenge before us. Like many colleagues, in contributing to this debate I'd like to tell the House about my own experience and the experience of my family which has brought me to my position today. This issue has perplexed me for a number of years. I am a practising, committed Catholic. I do my best to go to church every Sunday. In fact, in my late teens I joined a monastery, willing to give my life to God through the service to others. The teachings of the Catholic Church on the issue of marriage are very clear. The church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others for life. There is no ambiguity in that stance. It is a stance which I shared for most of my adult life. My daughter, Caroline, struggled through much of her teenage years with mental illness. She suffered from an insidious disease, an eating disorder, most notably anorexia and bulimia. My family and I watched our beautiful daughter and sister fight her demons as she slowly became nothing more than skin and bone. In and out of hospital for long stretches at a time, over a number of years she would wax and wane between sheer determination to regain her health, and utter desperation, sinking into the abyss of feeling that there was no hope of an end to this internal conflict. As a dad, I am very pleased and proud to say that my daughter is now in a much healthier and happier place. She has a terrific job and a wonderful partner who our family love very much. 'What does this story have to do with same-sex marriage?' you may ask. About three years ago, our daughter told my wife that she was attracted toDebate interrupted. That the House do now adjourn. National Broadband Network updates from private providers about the delivery of essential services in my electorate, and",190,Lgbtqi Australians When The Result Was Announced I Congratulate And Applaud Everyone
222,The Speaker (19:30,It being 7.30 pm I propose the question:,191,Adjournment
223,Mr Khalil (Wills) (19:30,"As a federal member of parliament, I occasionally receiveduring NovemberI received such a letter from Telstra. The letter informed me that ADSL exchanges in the suburb of Fawkner, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, are currently at full capacity and, as a result, some residents have been unable to access fixed broadband service at their home or business. While Telstra have informed me they will endeavour to resolve the ADSL availability crisis in Fawkner as soon as possible, it struck me as extremely disturbing that even a best-case scenario for the families that live there and the businesses that work there will merely result in them receiving a standard of connection that reached obsolescence near the turn of the millennium, 18 years ago. They will be increasingly unable to cope with modern online services. I wrote about this issue in an opinion piece for the Moreland Leader, the local newspaper, the week after receiving the letter, which induced an inundation of complaints from frustrated people in similar situations, both from my electorate and elsewhere in the country. Without access to a fixed broadband service, they are forced to use a cellular wireless service, which is not suitable for all applications, particularly not for commercial use. In some cases, there are people relegated to dial-up internet. It should be plain to everyone in this place how unacceptable that is. Broadband internet-I would hope those opposite agree-is no longer considered a luxury item. A US government Broadband Opportunity Council report from January this year described broadband as having taken its place alongside water, sewerage and electricity as essential infrastructure for communities. The situation is no different in Australia, with so many of our affairs now being conducted online. Virtually everything is done online. Banking, filing a tax return, Medicare or Centrelink paperwork-which is actually online-or even applying for a job are now approaching the point of being impossible without access to a computer and access to internet. With an increasing number of essential services and communications moving online, the challenge for us is to make the Australian internet more inclusive, and this is becoming far more urgent. The purpose of making these comments today is not to have a go at Telstra for the issue of no expansion of their technology in that particular suburb of Fawkner, or for the fact they are expanding an obsolete technology as a back-up. It is to yet again highlight the desperate need of this government to get the rollout of the national broadband network under control. While the suburb of Fawkner is one of the more egregious examples of this government's failureindeed, pretty much all the northern suburbs in my electorate have suffered from a lack of rollout and are on ADSL and are really struggling with their connections-it's this government's failure to deliver essential infrastructure where it's desperately needed which is having the greatest impact. There is nowhere in this country where the benefits that flow from modern broadband connectivity would not be felt. It is in the national interest for the government to get the NBN right, to get the project under control, and to get it rolled out uniformly to the whole nation. We remember the Prime Minister famously proclaiming before the last election that the government would deliver the NBN to all premises by the end of 2016. It is now close to the end of 2017. We remember when those opposite broke that promise they made to Australia. We are a full year after that. They've let the nation down. We are still waiting for the NBN rollout to be completed. Meanwhile, the project is plagued with cost blowouts, delays and rising dissatisfaction from people who are connected, as connection quality slips and consumers suffer. I hear the member for Leichhardt muttering about it. I'm sure there are people in his electorate who are not getting the NBN and who need the NBN for their businesses and for their work. I'm sure there are many people. In fact, I might give him the statistics so he can have a look at how many people in his electorate have been let down by his government. Many people do not have even the slightest indication of when they will be receiving the NBN. In the final sittings of 2016, I spoke in this place to highlight how the failure was having a very real impact on homes and businesses in my electorate-as you do as a member. I'm here today saying many of the same things I said a year ago, and I don't want to be saying them again a year from today. You need only ask residents in the south of my electorate, who actually received the first-rate fibre-to-the-premises NBN under the previous Labor government, about the benefits that should be delivered to everyone. (Time expired) Leichhardt Electorate: Wombinoo Station went to the polls, the ABC broadcast a story on its 7 pm national news which was supplied to them by the Wilderness Society. They did this without checking the facts. The story alleged that one of Far North Queensland's most respected families, the Jonssons, who are fifthgeneration farmers, illegally logged 60 hectares of forest on their Wombinoo Station, possibly killing endangered species including koalas, and were subject to a federal government investigation for illegal clearing. Since that ABC broadcast, the Jonssons have been the victims of an arson attack, with one of their $180,000 bulldozers set on fire and burnt out. They had graffiti sprayed on their gate labelling them as koala killers, they have received numerous threats and hate mail, and their business has certainly suffered. The facts are that the Jonssons were given state and federal government approvals for permits to clear their land in 2015. I have received confirmation from the federal minister, Josh Frydenberg, that the allegations of illegal land clearing made against the Jonssons by the Wilderness Society, and reported by the ABC on 23 November, were looked at by his department and dismissed as unfounded. He said: 'The Jonsson family are complying with their obligations under federal environment law and a proposal for future clearing is currently being assessed by the department.' The clearing in question occurred three years ago and the family has subsequently planted some 2,000 avocado trees which are now well advanced. About three months ago, the Jonssons made a decision to burn the remnant windrows, which is a normal farming practice. We can only assume that the smoke attracted the attention of the Wilderness Society and that a campaigner was sent to illegally enter the property and take drone footage of the area. The Wilderness Society then sat on that footage for three months, before releasing it to the ABC activist who posed as a journalist, Mr George Roberts. George Roberts is a serious piece of work. He last came to prominence in 2014 when he fabricated a story about unauthorised boat arrivals having their hands tortured and burnt by members of the ADF. He was exposed at the time as an absolute fraud and the story was a total fabrication. Unfortunately, his ABC subeditors and editors in Brisbane made no effort to check the veracity of the story and it was released nationally.",191,Adjournment
224,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (19:35,"On 23 November, just two days before QueenslandersThe Wilderness Society constantly uses iconic symbols like koalas and the Great Barrier Reef to justify their activism and stop development, even though there is absolutely no basis of fact in their statements. There are no koalas on Wombinoo Station, nor is there any evidence of koalas ever existing on Wombinoo Station. This has been confirmed following a total of four independent and federal environmental inspections, all of which were at a cost of something like $50,000 or $60,000 to the landholders. The Jonsson family employ 70-odd people at their farm market store in Cairns and an extra 30 people when seasonal work is available for the picking and packing of their produce. They have won numerous awards for farming and currently have four environmental production trials taking place on their property in conjunction with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Warren Jonsson, the innovative owner of Wombinoo, is also on the Tablelands Regional Council's irrigation and economic development committee to boost business, jobs and resources in the region. The Jonsson family have done everything right in regard to Wombinoo Station, and yet they've suffered financial loss and mental anguish as a result of this criminal activity by the Wilderness Society and the appalling journalism by ABC activist George Roberts. I have written to the chairman and managing director of the ABC lodging a formal complaint against Roberts and the editors. The Jonsson family have now instigated legal proceedings against the Wilderness Society and the ABC. I hope they are successful. The ABC editorial staff, George Roberts and the Wilderness Society need to be held accountable for their actions. I'd like to see them lose their bloody jobs; I'd like to see them lose their incomes and their homes, because the financial and emotional damage that was inflicted on the Jonsson family was so unnecessary. I urge all Cairns residents to show their support for the Jonsson family by shopping at their store. This would mean a lot to the family and assist in helping them to recover from this dreadful experience. (Time expired) Education Ms LAMB (Longman) (19:41): There is a real, stark difference between Labor and the coalition-in particular, the sheer disparity between Australia's two major parties on education. You see, Labor knows that the only way to ensure Australia is great into the future is through education, whether it's in a primary school, a high school, a university or a TAFE. The only way to prepare Australia's future workforce is by giving workers the skills and knowledge that they need. Education should be any good government's priority. But this is not a good government, and education is far from being a priority for it. Let's take the whole Gonski 2.0 debacle, for example. The Liberals snubbed their noses at Labor's plan for true needs based funding when we first called for it. Then they saw the overwhelming support, so they promised to match it and match Labor's commitment. You'll remember hearing that slogan, 'No cuts to schools. Dollar for dollar, we'll match it.' We all remember that-all of Australia does. But of course that promise was twisted and construed until it meant something completely different. And look where it has landed us: $17 million has been stripped away from the education budget. And this government tries to spin that as a good thing. It's absolutely appalling. This government blatantly disrespects the Australian people, time and time again. In the last few months, I've visited a number of schools in my electorate, as I do on a regular basis throughout the year. Sometimes, in the last few months, it has been for graduations and award ceremonies or simply just to go and have a chat with some students. One of those chats I had recently was with students at the Alta-1 school in Caboolture. It is one of our special assistance schools that does some really fantastic work in our area. As a special assistance school, Alta-1 services the needs of those particularly disadvantaged students-the kids who have just fallen through the cracks of mainstream schooling. Another one of those schools is Horizons College. I was at Horizons the other day, at a graduation ceremony. One hundred per cent of those students at that special assistance school either graduated with a certificate of education or graduated with a trade certificate. That's a fantastic outcome. These are the sorts of schools that need our support, not the fancy private institutions that charge tens of thousands of dollars in fees. But it's the students like those at Alta-1 and Horizons who've been let down by this government-not just when it comes to true needs based funding, which they've been denied under the Turnbull government, but also when it comes to the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, which we fondly know as HEPPP. It is the HEPPP funding that the education minister, Simon Birmingham, has now brought out onto the chopping block. Because this government has just wasted over $100 million on a harmful and divisive plebiscite, and because this government is showering big business with $65 billion in corporate tax cuts, the government is now looking to cut funding from anything in its sight. Because this government knows that Labor will stand against any harmful cuts to education, it seems to me that Minister Birmingham is now looking to cut whatever doesn't require parliamentary approval. This, of course, includes HEPPP funding. Labor introduced this funding to help get more people from disadvantaged backgrounds into university. This funding meant that 36,000 additional students from low-income families were able to get a tertiary education-students in my electorate from Dakabin, Burpengary, Woodford, Morayfield and Caboolture. This funding saw Indigenous admissions rise by 26 per cent, and in some of my schools we have Indigenous populations of 20 per cent. This funding saw an Indigenous admission rise, and it saw the number of regional students rise by 30 per cent. Despite these incredible, quantifiable outcomes, the government wants to cut this funding so it can give a $16,000 tax handout to millionaires. I have been recently speaking to Professor Greg Hill, who is, of course, the Vice Chancellor and President of the University of the Sunshine Coast. We're really excited about having the University of the Sunshine Coast in Caboolture now. They are great advocates for education. They know what a difference education can make in a child's life. For this to be a success, students need a pathway to university, they need government assistance and they need the HEPPP funding.

225,Mr Hogan (Page) (19:46,"Tom Hale was a person of great wisdom, knowledge andserved with distinction across the Pacific. Unfortunately, after fighting defensive action in Timor, Tom was one of the 22,000 Australian soldiers, Navy personnel, airmen, nurses and civilians captured by Japanese forces. He was sent to the notorious Changi prison in Singapore. He was a prisoner for three years, 11 months and three weeks, first in Changi and then on the Burma railway. He used to say: 'The only way you survived was you had to have mates. You couldn't do it on your own. When a bloke was sick, whatever extra tucker his mates could scrounge or pinch from the storeroom or the native garden at night, he got the lot until he got better. But it went around-you all got your turn.' It was the Burmese monks and the risks they took to help prisoners whom Tom Hale recalled. 'The main ones that stuck to us were those Burmese Buddhists; they were wonderful people,' he said. 'They'd sneak stuff to us of a night when they got the chance. If they were caught, they were tortured pretty bad, or mostly they got shot-which a lot of them did-but they kept doing it. When the war finished, I was asking this old Buddhist fellow why they kept doing it. The only answer he gave us was, ""Our faith.""' Coming home was tough for survivors, and not just because of the personal demons they had to overcome. Tom returned to Bonalbo, where he worked for the New South Wales Department of Agriculture on the cattle tick program from the 1940s until his retirement in the seventies. He was known affectionately as the only man who could shoe a horse and carry on a conversation with a mouthful of nails. Tom was well known in the Bonalbo community for his vast knowledge of local history. People often referred to him as the town's encyclopaedia. Tom is survived by his wife, Elsie, who is over 100 years of age. I've had the pleasure to meet Elsie on a number of occasions. He had three children, Garry, Gayle and Anne, and stepchildren, Faye, Pam, who's deceased, and Ivy. I also had the honour to meet Tom on a number of occasions. I was always humbled to do so. This country owed him, and those he served with, a lot. The Diggers Military Motorcycle Club saluted Tom at his funeral in Bonalbo. Afterwards, at the Dog 'N Bull, when everyone toasted Tom Hale, the empty black stool was a poignant reminder of a man much loved by his community. As an aside, Ada Baker, who is Tom's sister, is also still alive and well over 100 years of age. It was a delight to catch up with her recently. I still remember very vividly when I saw Ada on her 100th birthday and said, 'How are you?' She said, 'Kevin, when I wake up, it's a good day, and when I'm walking around, it's a great day.' Hear, hear to that! I'd like to congratulate this year's committee of the Grafton Jacaranda Festival, which is the oldest floral festival in Australia. The last Saturday in October marks the big day. It marks the queen crowning, and it also recognises the youth in the community with the Jacaranda Children's Morning. Festivities run throughout the morning, and include the beautiful baby photo competition. Market Square is converted into a huge party zone for all the kids to enjoy. These are this year's winners in the beautiful baby photo competition: boys zero to six months winner was Max Gray, second was Tyreece Close; boys seven to 12 months winner was Cody Want, second was Khan; boys 13 to 18 months winner was Angus Irwin; boys 19 to 24 months winner was Romeo Painter-Hookey; girls zero to six months winner was Ava Tran, second was Emii-Mae Duroux; girls seven to 12 months winner was Honey-lee, second was Indie Willow; girls 13 to 18 months winner was Emily Straw, second was Zarra; and girls 19 to 24 months winner was Lucyana Rose, second was Winter Worthington. Other wins were Aria Atherton and Arlo Hickson. Best dressed boy winner was Keenan Blood and best dressed girl was Lainey Morgan. The overall grand champion runner-up was Honey-lee, with the grand champion winner being Miss Emily Straw. I thank again the Bendigo Bank and Grafton Fast Photos for their support of the children's event and what was a wonderful day for the Grafton Jacaranda Festival. Goods and Services Tax increasing concern to the people of the Northern Territory. We see this government's apparent unwillingness, as evidenced by the Prime Minister's response to a question in question time today about the outcomes and the recommendations of the royal commission recently released in the Northern Territory, to let the Commonwealth provide any substantial financial support to the Northern Territory to fund the recommendations that have been made, which will be at a substantial cost to the Northern Territory taxpayer. I'm raising this because part of what the Commonwealth is doing around Commonwealth-state financial relations has the potential to have a great impact on the Northern Territory-that is, the review of the GST. The distribution of GST to the states currently provides each state with the capacity to provide its citizens with comparable levels of government services. We know that the Western Australians have been bleating about their GST share for some time. What we are seeing now is a response by the Commonwealth, which is asking the Productivity Commission to undertake a review of horizontal fiscal equalisation. The report is due by the end of January 2018. In its draft report, the Productivity Commission says: … [reform] should aim to provide States with the fiscal capacity to provide a reasonable level of services. − Equalisation should no longer be to the highestor strongeststate, but instead the average or the second highest State… Not surprisingly, the Northern Territory opposes this change, as I'm sure other smaller jurisdictions do too. The Northern Territory government says there is no evidence in the draft report to support the proposed change to the equalisation process from 'equal' to 'reasonable'. I might just point out that in its post-draft submission correspondence to the commission, the Northern Territory government has made it very clear to the commissioners that it thinks this is a really inappropriate and unfair act. It has said in its submission to the report: The Territory strongly objects to, and is extremely concerned with, the Productivity Commission Draft Report's recommendations to diminish the level of equalisation achieved in Australia without a strong evidence-based policy rationale to support such a fundamental change to Australia's federal financial relations. If adopted, the Draft Report's recommendations will result in a change to the fabric of the federation in a way that would entrench inequity and result in one state's fiscal capacity being allowed to rise above national levels. We urge the Productivity Commission to carefully consider the implications its recommendations will have on states fiscal capacities and the achievement of equity of access to government services for all Australians, before it provides its final recommendations to the Commonwealth.",195,Adjournment
226,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (19:50,"I want to talk about a grave matter which is ofThe Northern Territory is dependent upon the formula which currently is provided to make sure it can get a reasonable level of services, an appropriate level of services, to its citizens across the Northern Territory. One of the key determinants of the Territory's assessed expenditure needs includes remoteness; the Territory's small population of 245,000, only one per cent of the Australian population, is dispersed over a large land mass and isolated from the main population centres in Australia. Despite its small population, the Territory still needs to fund the same range of services as large states, so it faces higher per capita costs in providing those services. This is especially true in the provision of services to remote parts of the Northern Territory. Things like roads, schools, health, infrastructure and housing all cost a damn sight more in the Territory than they do in other jurisdictions. Aboriginal people make up 30 per cent of the Territory's population-in my own electorate of Lingiari, around 42 per cent-while only three per cent of the national population. And we know that the majority of the Territory's Aboriginal population reside in remote and very remote communities. The Territory's Aboriginal population, like the rest of the Australian population, deserves access to the same level of services as other Australians. Those services are only provided if there is an adequate level of funding provided through the GST distribution-that is, through the horizontal fiscal equalisation formula. We should not change it to diminish the opportunities that exist for people who live in parts of Australia other than Western Australia. Boothby Electorate: Sturt Country Fire Service Group Ms FLINT (Boothby) (19:55): We have had some very hot weather recently in South Australia, which has reminded everyone who lives in and around the Mitcham Hills, as I do, that it is now bushfire season. TonightI want to acknowledge the incredible CFS volunteers in my electorate and the selfless work these hard working volunteers do to keep us safe over summer. Our community is looked after by the Sturt CFS Group, led by Group Officer Dale Thompson and Deputy Group Officer David Simms. I thank David and Dale for being so active and willing to provide information to our community throughout the year, including briefings for me, the City of Mitcham and state members of parliament. Dale and David work with a large group of volunteers. The Sturt CFS Group is made up of five individual brigades, 12 fire appliances and approximately 108 volunteer firefighters. Brigades within the group respond to around 260 emergency incidents each year. I would like to recognise the work of Captain Darren Cock and the Blackwood CFS; Captain Mark Brooks and the Belair CFS; Captain Neil Gloyn and the Eden Hills CFS; Captain Rowan Clark and the Coromandel Valley CFS; and Captain Brian Sims and the Cherry Gardens CFS. We are all reliant on them for protection and assistance over summer. The mixture of suburban housing and native vegetation within the Sturt group's region represents an area that is among the highest risk of bushfire in South Australia. That's why it is so important for the entire community to support the work that the CFS does for us. The CFS relies on community donations and backing to secure essential equipment and infrastructure, provide training services, increase public awareness and support firefighters and their families. Every little bit of financial assistance helps, and I was delighted to secure an election commitment to provide solar panels for brigades in Blackwood, Belair and Eden Hills so that they can reduce their power bills and instead put money raised towards vital equipment. Helping raise funds is why the mayor of Mitcham, Glenn Spear, local Liberal representatives Sam Duluk and Steve Murray and I held our second annual fundraising barbecue for the CFS on 25 November. I was pleased that we again raised over $1,000 for our local group and volunteers. Thanks to Blackwood Coles and the Freemason lodges of Blackwood and Sir Samuel Way, who made generous contributions on the day. So many clubs in our community give to the CFS-such as the Blackwood Rotary Club, who I know do a lot for the Eden Hills CFS brigade, for example. Seeing these groups and the public come together to support the CFS shows us the immense respect my community has for these volunteers. But the barbecue wasn't just a fundraiser. The attendance of CFS volunteers provided a chance for local residents to talk to the CFS about fire safety-which brings me to my most important point. Each and every household in Boothby in a high fire danger area needs to have a bushfire plan. They need to know exactly what they will do on high fire danger days. They need to know what they will do in the event of an actual fire, which we pray never occurs. Each and every household needs to prepare, act and survive. There's nothing more important than having a bushfire plan in place and I will continue to remind my residents of this in the bushfire season ahead. Information is easy to find. The CFS has a great website, cfs.sa.gov.au, and it produces a lot printed guides and materials. Mitcham council also provides excellent information and advice. I thank Mayor Glenn Spear and the council staff for all they do in bushfire prevention and education. I encourage all residents to get a copy of South Australia's Your Guide to Bushfire Safety booklet. AndI urge residents in Boothby and in particular suburbs like Mitcham, Brown Hill Creek, Belair, Blackwood, Upper Sturt, Craigburn Farm, Hawthorndene, Glenalta, Coromandel Valley, Lynton, Eden Hills, Bellevue Heights, Flagstaff Hill, Aberfoyle Park and Happy Valley to make sure they have their bushfire survival plan in place now. Being bushfire ready could save lives. Each and every household needs to prepare, act and survive. When each and every household does their part to prepare we make it easier for our wonderful CFS volunteers to do their job in keeping us safe. In closing, I again thank the Sturt CFS Group, led by Group Officer Dale Thomson and Deputy Group Officer David Sims, and all the CFS brigades in and around Boothby and the Mitcham Hills-from Belair, Blackwood and Eden Hills, Coromandel Valley and Cherry Gardens-for the incredible work they do for our community over summer and in keeping us all safe.

Mr Hill to move: That this House: (1) affirms the importance of strong and effective pharmacovigilance; (2) notes that the rates of death due to complications of medical and surgical care are increasing, with drugs, medicaments and biological substances causing adverse effects in therapeutic uses leading to 40 deaths in 2016 and 60 deaths in 2017; (3) notes that there are many areas for improvement in Australia's overall pharmacovigilance regime, in particular that: (a) the reported rates of clinical prescribing errors can range from 0.14 to 1.5 per patient while the rate of consumer reporting is only 4 per cent (654) of all reports submitted; (b) decision-making in respect of medications has little clinical pharmacy oversight; (c) as only limited information is available to community pharmacists, advice to patients regarding potential risks and pharmacological or non-pharmacological alternatives is likewise limited; (d) drugs can be Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved for one purpose but be prescribed for another, ie, Diane-35 is a TGA approved drug but is not approved as a contraceptive; (e) while off-label use of medications is the prescriber's responsibility, the system does not ensure that approved pharmacological options are exhausted first; (f) the TGA relies on drug sponsors to apply for changes in or extensions to the approved indication and does not proactively monitor post-marketing quality of usage, except known high-risk drugs through Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data or where there has been a number or cluster of reported sentinel events; and (g) there is therefore limited or no oversight of TGA approved medications that are not subsidised through the PBS; (4) welcomes the TGA's black triangle system for new medicines, whereby a black triangle symbol is added at the top of the product information and consumer medicines information to advise consumers of additional product monitoring by regulatory authorities; (5) notes the: (a) likely benefits of promoting this initiative to health professionals and consumers, given considerable under-reporting of adverse effects; and (b) opportunity to consider extending this system to over-the-counter and complementary medicines where concerns exist about under-reported side effects, off-label prescriptions, etc; and (6) welcomes advice and contributions from regulatory agencies, professional bodies and the Government to guide the way for change. Monday, 4 December 2017 Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program experience things that I could never have dreamed of in any other realm. Visiting Australian military bases in the Middle East, getting involved in training exercises and daily briefings, eating in the mess with ADF personnel and experiencing 60-degree heat are some of these experiences. In July this year I spent 10 days in the UAE and Afghanistan, visiting the ADF members involved in Joint Task Force 663, as part of the ADF Parliamentary Program. This program is open to members and senators on all sides of the political divide. While we may have different views on key political issues, we all acknowledge the importance of our Defence Force and the sacrifices they make for us each day. On this particular trip I was joined by the members for Brand, Batman, Fisher, Oxley and Whitlam. One must have sympathy for the member for Fisher, who not only was the sole Liberal Party MP on our trip but also had to share a room with me! The program gave us access to all levels of the chain of command and provided us an opportunity to ask the men and women at various bases we visited what we as politicians can do to support them in their role, as well as to learn directly from them about their lived experiences on the ground and to let them know that they have our full support here in Canberra and across the country. Our Navy, Army and Air Force do an incredibly challenging job in often difficult circumstances, and it is important that we support them. We have an obligation to ensure that they are kept safe abroad and are supported both mentally and physically. The same goes when they come home. As a Western Australian MP and a new dad, I'm very conscious of the toll taken on family by a FIFO lifestyle. Standing at Darwin airport, watching a Defence Force mum say goodbye to her young family before flying out with us, and talking to troops, sailors, airmen and airwomen about their families, whom they can go three to six months at a time without seeing, brought home the personal sacrifice behind the lines and behind the scenes. I thank our guardian angels on our trip: the soldiers and sailors who got us around and ensured our safety; the Air Force personnel who flew us into Kabul; Major Erica Abend and Warrant Officer Jeffery Marshall, for arranging the tours and for escorting us on our journey; our mentor, Major John Spencer; Flight Sergeant Caroline Carruthers of the RAAF, Captain Danielle Andretzke of the Australian Army, and Flight Lieutenant Veronica Manalvo from the RAAF, for our combat first-aid training; and Colonel Mark Ascough and Corporal Sebastian Beurich, from the Army News. I take this opportunity to personally thank all the soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen who are deployed in Afghanistan, across the Middle East and across the globe this Christmas. This is an incredibly tough time of year to be away from family and friends, but I know that those personnel accept their duty with pride, dedication and an unwavering enthusiasm.",199,Notices

229,Mr Keogh (Burt) (10:30,"As a member of parliament I'm fortunate to be able to do andPetition: Lottoland (10:33): We have all seen the advertisements on television offering Australians the opportunity to bet on the outcome of foreign lotteries. One of the most prevalent lottery agencies offering such a product is Lottoland. The temptation of purchasing a ticket in a foreign lottery, with payouts of sometimes many hundreds of millions of dollars, is often too good to resist for some Australians. They dream of opulent lifestyles of glitz, glamour and no mortgages. These are the same people who often have the odd flutter on a weeknight Casket ticket. In recent times I have, along with a number of members here today, heard from local newsagents and lottery organisations that are fed up with this loophole-jumping organisation, Lottoland. Lottoland, which is based in Gibraltar, provides lottery betting products under a licence issued by the Northern Territory and is regulated by the Territory government. One local newsagent in my electorate of Ryan, newsXpress Kenmore, has had enough of Lottoland's continued tactics, which are taking away from their incomes and also the benefits to our communities. Ron and Lynsey, the proprietors of my local newsXpress, spoke with me during my recent visit to their shop, detailing concerns about this ever-increasing form of market dominance. From Ron and Lynsey's reports, Lottoland does not offer real moneybacked major prize pools with payouts that are guaranteed. Australians who support a fair go expect businesses to pay their fair share of taxes and not confuse them with tricky lottery advertising tactics. Further, what is more distressing to small business lottery outlets is Lottoland's online structure, and base in the tax haven of Gibraltar. Real lotteries, like Golden Casket in Queensland, contribute collectively $1.1 billion a year in lottery tax, supporting important community facilities. Lottoland's structure offers no such positive contribution. Ron and Lynsey typify many thousands of local businesses selling lottery products throughout Australia. To demonstrate the community support for their cause, they created a petition to collect the signatures of those who object to Lottoland. More than 650 locals signed this petition to demonstrate their support for local business and local lottery, whilst highlighting their concerns about Lottoland. Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, I seek leave to table the petition. Leave granted. all concerned Australians that the coalition government is aware of issues raised by newsagents and other lottery agents about lottery products offered by Lottoland. I understand that Minister Fifield has written to the relevant Territory minister detailing various concerns about Lottoland and seeking their advice. The Commonwealth is examining its options for further regulatory steps and will take the Territory government's advice into account when it's received. The coalition understands how important small businesses are to our communities. That's why the Turnbull government has delivered so much for small business, including tax cuts and other red tape reduction.",202,Constituency Statements

231,Mrs Prentice,"Thank you. I want to assure not only the residents in my electorate butPetitions Committee for its consideration and will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with the standing orders. Marriage Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (10:36): Two and a half weeks ago I joined Canberrans in a park near my office as we waited for the results of the vote on marriage equality. The results were overwhelming. Compared with the 62 per cent vote nationally, 74 per cent of Canberrans supported same-sex marriage, making the ACT not just the OECD's most livable region, not just a Lonely Planet must-visit destination, but also the state or territory in Australia with the highest support for same-sex marriage. But these figures don't tell the full story. The percentages can't express the relief felt by same-sex couples, who, in most cases, opposed the survey process but did feel that the results acknowledged the importance of their relationships. These percentages can't represent the emotions of LGBTI government staffers, who'd been unable to express their opinions through the survey process. These percentages can't express the happiness of couples whose overseas marriages may now be recognised in their home country. Earlier this year I received a letter from Greg, a fellow Canberran, who told me about how he and his partner, after 22 years together, could no longer wait for Australia to make marriage equality legal. So they travelled to Canada, as others have done-or to New Zealand, Ireland or Britain-and tied the knot in that country. I agree with Greg when he says it's time for change. This is a critical issue for Canberrans. Many Canberrans were deeply disappointed when the private member's bill from the member for Whitlam, Stephen Jones, failed to muster support in the House of Representatives. Many were disappointed when, four years ago next week, the High Court struck down the ACT's marriage equality law, after 31 Canberra couples had tied the knot. Among those couples were Emily and Ellie, a beautiful couple whose photo sits on the fridge of my electorate office as a daily reminder of the importance of ensuring that love can be recognised in whatever form it arises. Australian Marriage Equality sent me and, I suspect, a few other parliamentarians a copy of Australian Love Stories, a book which reminds us of the diversity in the way in which love comes in Australia. In the introduction, it contains a snippet from the Auden poem O Tell Me The Truth About Love: When it comes, will it come without warning Just as I'm picking my nose? Will it knock on my door in the morning, Or tread in the bus on my toes? Will it come like a change in the weather? Will its greeting be courteous or rough? Will it alter my life altogether? O tell me the truth about love. We should make sure marriage equality happens without delay, without amendment, this week.",203,Constituency Statements
232,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Buchholz,"The document will be forwarded to theHealth Care families in my electorate that has been delivered by the Minister for Health and highlights how this government is committed to Medicare. It's been revealed that the national GP bulkbilling rate for the September quarter has increased to a record 85.9 per cent. I'm advised by the minister that this is the highest bulk-billing rate ever achieved for a September quarter and significantly higher than Labor's 82.2 per cent when they were last in government. We are spending more than ever before on Medicare, with record funding each and every year. It's growing-from $23 billion in 2017-18 to $24 billion, to $26 billion, and to $28 billion in 2020-21. Under Labor, in their last year of government, spending on Medicare was only $19.5 billion. People in the electorate of Robertson, on the Central Coast, have also benefited, with the latest data showing that bulk-billing rates for patients visiting their GPs is at 86.2 per cent, which is in fact higher than the national average. That figure, 86.2 per cent, is a full three per cent higher than at the end of Labor's six wasted years in government. In Dobell, at the northern end of the Central Coast, the figure is almost 91 per cent. This means that more people on the Central Coast-people who live in Woy Woy, Erina, Gosford, Davistown, Kariong and Terrigal-can visit their doctor without having to reach for their wallet. In my electorate we can also point to the massive, $45 million investment that this government has committed to the world-class Central Coast Medical School and Health and Medical Research Institute, which will be a game changer for our region, an $85 million partnership between this government, the New South Wales coalition government and the University of Newcastle. We also recently announced funding for a new prostate cancer nurse based at the Central Coast Cancer Centre at Gosford Hospital. I really want to give a shoutout to the former member for Robertson Jim Lloyd, who is now an ambassador for the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and has been a tireless advocate in securing this for our region. We've listened and we've addressed the GP shortage crisis on the peninsula by securing funding in the budget and then working closely with our primary health network on the Central Coast to secure a recruitment breakthrough. Three new doctors have already started working in this area of need thanks to the initiative so far. But ultimately what we have to call out today are Labor's crazy claims about the future of Medicare, which we are even hearing right now in the Bennelong by-election-claims that are downright wrong. The facts are that Australian patients received an additional 21 million bulk-billed visits compared with Labor's last year in government. We've established the Medicare Guarantee Fund to secure the ongoing funding of the Medicare benefits schedule and the PBS. Commonwealth investment in public hospitals is also continuing to grow, and funding for New South Wales hospitals is 43 per cent higher than during Labor's years. I thank the coalition government for their determination and commitment to delivering better quality health care for people on the Central Coast.

234,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10:43,"Booragul, Marmong Point, Teralba, Blackalls Parkaround the western side of Lake Macquarie. What else do they have in common, Mr Deputy Speaker? They are all losing their local post offices. Their post offices either are already closed or are about to close, and I know that this is a common occurrence right across our great nation. Australia Post will say that they cannot secure people to run these licensed post offices any longer, and at first blush that seems a not unreasonable response to what is quite a crisis for many in our local communities. But I ask the question today: how hard are Australia Post really trying? And since when does every aspect of every government business enterprise have to turn a profit? I won't take up time now, but we could all think of tens, if not thousands, of examples where governments subsidise basic community services at the federal, state and local government level. I know Australia Post will also say that it is already heavily subsidising the work of our licensed post offices, but I also pose the question: how much is an appropriate level of investment to keep such basic services going in our community? We all know that letter services are falling dramatically, we all know that email and other forms of electronic communications are now taking over very rapidly the use of the traditional letter services, but we also know that there are many older people in our communities who haven't had the same opportunity or indeed the will or the knowledge to take up those new forms of communications, and we should think of them. Those same people know that Australia Post made a profit of $146 million last financial year. They remember the CEO of Australia Post being paid $5 million annually, and it is very hard for them to understand and accept that it is necessary to shut down their local licensed post office. If people aren't taking up the business opportunity to run these post offices, obviously they don't see it as being economically viable for them-but Australia Post does have the means to make it a more attractive proposition and it should do so and do so quickly. Franceschi, Ms Jennie speaker, the member for Hunter, and I am happy to work together to try and ensure that we have postal services in our regional towns. In my electorate of O'Connor there are some innovative people who are achieving remarkable goals in their business operations. Jennie Franceschi, from the Fresh Produce Alliance in Manjimup, is one such person. Jennie recently won the Corporate and Private Award at the 2017 Telstra Australian Business Women's Awards. This accolade followed on from her winning two honours at the state awards earlier in the year-Western Australian Business Woman of the Year and the Corporate and Private Award. Jennie has been in the avocado industry since 1974 when she took her first summer job working in her family's commercial orchard. After opening her own orchard in Pemberton, and becoming active in the WA Avocado Growers Association and Avocado Australia, Jennie and her husband, Wayne, launched their own packing facility-Advance Packing& Marketing Services-with two other growers. In 2011 Jennie began managing the Avocado Export Company, with the objective of increasing Australian avocado exports to help stabilize the Australian domestic market, keeping it a profitable industry for all stakeholders. Jennie and Wayne launched the Fresh Produce Alliance in 2016, a processing facility that champions a sustainable agriculture ecosystem. FPA started with the vision of reducing the",205,Constituency Statements
235,Mr Rick Wilson (O'connor) (10:46,"I endorse the comments of the previousamount of unmarketable fruit and vegetables being wasted, much of it being used for animal feed or discarded. Using innovative technologies such as high-pressure processing and individual quick freeze, they now produce healthy, delicious, real food that is in high demand. Their high-pressure machine was the first to be brought into WA and only the fifth in the nation. Jennie and her team have developed an avocado and baby food range and will soon bring a low-GI range to the market. Their products are available for both the domestic and export markets, and they supply bulk fresh, frozen and pre-packed fruit and vegetables to food service wholesalers. The operation has also been made available to outside entities under a contract service to help them grow their business. Jennie aspires to help growers become more profitable and sustainable and in doing so retain and improve services in Manjimup and the Southern Forests region. Jennie's career in the avocado industry over the past 40 years has really made an impact on the agriculture and processing industry. I've visited Jennie's Manjimup operation many times, and she is quite a remarkable woman-not only is she down to earth and hard working; it is clear she has a wonderful vision and drive for her business. She strives to create a sustainable future through intergenerational farming, sustainable operations, the creation of long-term job opportunities and reduced agricultural wastage. Earlier this year, Jennie took on the role of deputy chair of the South West Development Commission. She also breeds warmblood show jumpers with her youngest daughter. Frankly, I don't know how she manages it all! The Telstra Australian Business Women's Awards highlight women's achievements as business leaders and celebrate the positive results of inclusive leadership. I see Jennie's win as a stellar example of the innovative industry leaders that can be cultivated in our regions. Jennie's achievement has shone the spotlight on regional WA and, in particular, the Southern Forests agriculture sector. (Time expired) Panagiotopoulos, Ms Zoe Casey-Cardinia Library Corporation Berwick District Woodworkers Club to mention some community champions and local achievers in my area. Last week I had the pleasure of meeting with Zoe Panagiotopoulos from Provenance Artists, who painted a series of paintings as part of the 2015 Holt ANZAC Centenary Fine Art Exhibition, of which a book was produced. It was very moving to meet with Zoe because two of her paintings-one called Somme Reverie and the other called God Speed-will be heading overseas this month to be part of the Sir John Monash Centre's collection at Villers-Bretonneux in France. I felt very blessed that a grant that was auspiced under the ANZAC Centenary grants program was able to produce two world-class paintings as part of this magnificent Holt ANZAC Centenary Fine Art Exhibition and that the people of France will be able to see these particular paintings, as they are quite graphic and quite moving. I would also like to point out that I joined with the Casey-Cardinia Library Corporation to launch the 'Forgiving Tree' initiative. This initiative delivers much needed help and support to local charities in the lead-up to Christmas.

We encouraged all those in the south-eastern region to add a present under the tree whether they had a library fine or not. Finally, I had the pleasure last Sunday week of attending the Berwick District Woodworkers Club's toy gala, which was very good. The organisation was established in 1986. This amazing group of about 100 people crafted more than 850 toys which they presented to local charities on that Sunday. This is an incredible group of people who donate their time. Some of the craftsmanship of the toys, as the member for La Trobe would know, is incredible. There was a rocking horse that I was actually walked up to see. You would value that rocking horse on the market at $5,000. It was donated to charity. I met with the individual who crafted that rocking horse from 300 hours of his own work. That's just one example of the incredible work that's done by the Berwick District Woodworkers Club. I just wanted to mention those three incredible initiatives by local community champions who should be honoured in the lead-up to this Christmas period. Banks Electorate: St Declan's Catholic Primary School Banks Electorate: Picnic Point Pumas Netball Club Banks Electorate: Australian Air League Primary School's parents and friends annual general meeting, and it was a great discussion to have with the parents. St Declan's has been around since 1907, providing high-quality Catholic education to many thousands of students in that time. On the night that I met with the P&F, we discussed a range of issues, particularly concerning traffic safety around the school. St Declan's is in a built-up area near Forrest Road in Penshurst, and the reality is that traffic safety could and should be improved. I am discussing those matters at present with the local council. I thank Cathy Hollamby, the president of the P&F, Sarah Minns, the secretary, and all the other P&F members who were there that evening for their hospitality. I would also like to acknowledge Maria Ross, who has been the principal at St Declan's for a number of years and does a great job in our local community. On 12 November, I attended the annual presentation day for the Picnic Point Netball Club. It was held at the popular Mill Hotel in Milperra. The Picnic Point Pumas are one of the biggest netball clubs anywhere in the Bankstown region, with more than 200 players. To give you a sense of the enthusiasm and quality of this club, the club has 18 teams, 17 of which made it to at least the semifinals this year. So there has been a fantastic contribution from the club. I say thank you to Kim Childs, the secretary of the Pumas, for inviting me along on the day and congratulations to all the players on what was a particularly good season. Yesterday, I attended the Riverwood Squadron's Christmas function and annual prizegiving ceremony.

Tasmania: Health Ms KEAY (Braddon) (10:55): At the moment, we are experiencing a health crisis in Tasmania, and it is a crisis that has been the making of the current Liberal state government. Premier Will Hodgman, in his first budget, cut $210 million from an already under-pressure system. This was in addition to the $1.1 billion that was cut by former Prime Minister Abbott. What was the Premier's response to that at the time? His response was, 'That's disappointing.' Cuts of this magnitude have a human cost, where people suffer pain or even lose their lives. In recent months, my colleagues and I have been asking members of my community to share their stories of their experiences of the health system in Tasmania. Overwhelmingly, the community praised the magnificent work of our health professionals and, in particular, our nursing staff, paramedics and allied health professionals, who are doing an amazing job working in such difficult circumstances. But we also heard stories that confirm the system is in crisis. I make note that the Tasmanian health minister said on radio just last week: 'We don't want to hear these stories. They paint our system as though there is something wrong with it, that we won't get the staff to come and work in Tasmania's health system.' We'll just push those stories under the carpet like they never happened. Well, I'm going to share those stories. We had one story from a volunteer paramedic who told us about a lady who had to be picked up from the far north-west of my electorate. She had a metal plate in her leg that was cutting into the muscle. You can just imagine the excruciating pain that would cause. She was shunted from hospital to hospital for the whole day, travelling hundreds of kilometres because there were no beds. She ended up in her local district hospital and then waiting two weeks to get surgery. She was in immense pain the entire time. We heard of a lady, Glenys from Ulverstone, who presented at a hospital after a fall. She had hurt her shoulder. They did not take any X-rays. They tried to push her shoulder back in, thinking it was dislocated. What they found when they eventually did take an X-ray was that her shoulder was broken. So you can just imagine what was going on there. There was the young man who had had an operation on his foot. He had pins in his foot and through his ankle. It had become infected. He presented at a hospital in Launceston, where he begged them to take the cast off to have a look at it, and they wouldn't do it. He ended up at his local hospital in emergency, where they tried so desperately to save his foot. These are the stories that the health minister does not want Tasmanians to tell. While we're heading into a Tasmanian election, there is only one choice and that is to change the government. Gambling addiction that continues to infiltrate our suburbs and towns, and that is poker machines. I recently attended a public meeting of residents in my electorate of La Trobe, in the suburb of Officer. This meeting was spearheaded by local resident Andrew McNabb-I must say that he is also a great friend of mine-and international poker machine expert Dr Charles Livingstone from Monash University's School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine was invited to",208,Constituency Statements
238,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (10:58,"TodayI rise to draw the attention of the House to anspeak. I also spoke at that meeting regarding my experience as a former police officer. Dr Livingstone is one of the top three independent poker machine researchers in the world. At the public meeting, he explained that poker machines aren't an accidental addiction and that for far too long we have wrongly blamed people for developing an addiction to poker machines. Apparently, the computer programs inside poker machines are designed to target the same part of the brain as cocaine does. Yet, unlike cocaine users, most poker machine players don't know the dangers of the product they are playing with. They perceive poker machines to be harmless fun that is endorsed by the state government. Within my electorate, a planning application to build a hotel with 80 machines was knocked back by the Shire of Cardinia, and I congratulate the shire for their decision. I want to pay tribute to local resident Andrew McNabb and also to Bad Bets Australia strategist Rohan Wenn, who helped run the awareness campaign that contributed to a unanimous decision. However, despite this strong stance at the local government level, the community recognises that the applicant is likely to appeal the decision through the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, so Andrew and Bad Bets are still out there collecting signatures to take it to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. My former life was that of a police officer at Boronia Criminal Investigation Branch. Six months after poker machines came into our area, my colleagues and I started to notice an increase in frauds and thefts, all work-related. When we investigated and ended up charging people, the common denominator was poker machines. It involved good people who sadly got addicted to poker machines, and it ended up destroying their lives, through their being sacked from work, stealing from the family, and using the rent money-it was just horrendous-to cover their addiction. I am very much opposed to poker machines, because, as a former police officer, I've seen the damage. To anyone who wants to hear an expert speak, I mention Dr Livingstone, whose presentation on what is happening out there was absolutely amazing and scary.

In particular, the changes and amendments in this bill are about a simple concept, and that is firstly and most importantly supporting the availability of highquality, safe and effective therapeutic goods and delivering them in the most timely way to the community-in other words, better medicines, better treatments and better devices, at the earliest possible time to the community.

240,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (11:02): I want to thankin potential health risks to the public. Thirdly-something that I'm very pleased about-it is about streamlining and improving the regulatory environment, which is something I've endeavoured to assist with and to deliver across all of the different portfolios. These amendments continue the implementation of the government's response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Device Regulation, and they establish a provisional approval scheme so that patients can have access to promising new medicines up to two years sooner. Other changes to the regulation of complementary medicines will allow indication as to pre-approved claims, all through a new pathway that will allow assessment of the efficacy or effectiveness for indications that fall outside the current permitted list. This will allow consumers to make more informed product choices. In addition, there are significant reforms that will streamline the advertising framework for therapeutic goods. This will ensure that enhanced compliance and monitoring provisions will be in place to strengthen consumer protections. It will also increase post-market monitoring for listed products, leading to efficient reporting of any adverse effects. What that means is better protection for patients. Medical devices will reach the market sooner through the greater use of comparable overseas regulator assessments afforded by this bill. In other words, this is the long-held objective of allowing us to adopt the best quality international regulatory findings and to bring them into the Australian system to help bring the devices into Australia earlier. Patients' lives will be prolonged, protected and improved through this process. This bill in particular, coupled with the recent amendments already enacted, will strengthen Australia's therapeutic goods regulatory framework. It will ensure that it remains well positioned to respond effectively to global trends in the development, manufacture, marketing and regulation of therapeutic goods. It makes Australia a more desirable destination for clinical trials. It helps make Australia a more desirable destination for manufacture and development of medical devices. We will receive better health outcomes and better economic outcomes as a result of these changes. Ultimately, this is our opportunity to make significant reforms to the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia that ensure better access to medicines, streamlined administrative processes and stronger consumer protections. In addition, in addressing the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2017, I would also like to thank members for their contribution to this debate. This bill amends the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act, enabling the imposition of annual charges on newly designated Australian conformity assessment bodies to undertake conformity of medical devices. Annual charges will be introduced on the sponsors who choose the new evaluation pathway of provisionally registering promising new prescription medicines up to two years earlier than the current framework. In other words, it's a fee for service which allows better and earlier access to new medicines. While these new provisions are important for timely availability of medical devices and for access to emerging medicines introduced through the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2016 Measures No. 1) Act 2017, these are new regulatory functions for which the TGA must cost recover in accordance with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines. Ultimately, and in particular, I want to thank Medicines Australia and I want to thank other medical bodies, such as the AMA, the Royal Australian College of GPs and the Pharmacy Guild, for their support. These developments will give Australians better access to medicines at an earlier date. I also want to acknowledge and appreciate the constructive work of the opposition. The opposition spokesperson, the member for Ballarat, has been a valued partner in this process, and I think it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that. This is an example of the policy process, the engagement process with Medicines Australia and the magnificent TGA, led ably by Professor John Skerritt and his team, and the parliamentary process all working in tandem to produce a multipartisan result in the best possible way to produce better health outcomes for Australia. I thank everybody involved and I also want to acknowledge my adviser in this space, Alex Best, who has been remarkable in his work with Medicines Australia; the guild; the opposition; and all of the different players. I am delighted to commend this bill to the House. I present for the information of members an addendum to the explanatory memorandum for the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 and an addendum to the explanatory memorandum for the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2017. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Veterans: Government Response to Report Consideration resumed of the motion: That the House take note of the document. discussion and want to commend the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for its comprehensive report and the recommendations it made within it. As a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I'm all too well aware of the issues that this report deals with, and it's quite confronting. We know that the suicide rate for defence members in service is a lot lower than it is in the broader population. Sadly, though, with the effluxion of time after people separate from the Defence Force, the incidence of self-harm and suicide increase quite dramatically. That needs to be understood from a number of points of view, and I think this committee did a pretty good job in bringing out into the public domain many of the issues which are confronting us. It makes a series of recommendations around how the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in particular, might change the way it operates to service and support the needs of veterans, including the development of specific suicide prevention programs for veterans identified as at-risk.",210,Bills
241,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (11:11,"I'm pleased to be able to make a contribution to thisMy colleague who will be speaking next, the member for Solomon, is a veteran himself, and I'm sure he will have some observations to make, but one of the things that concerned me as a minister is this. When we had people in uniform and in service we had visibility of them. When we have visibility of them, and their mates have visibility of them, there are ways of intervening and providing support. This means, as a result of esprit de corps and a whole range of things that come with being in the services, that you are able to look after people in a way that does not happen in the broader community. What we suffer from, I think, occurs when Defence Force members separate. This is a young person's game. We have lifers, people who become generals, but I think the average length of service is something short of eight years. That means people by their mid-20s have done their service, and over recent years they would have had a number of tours of duty overseas. No doubt that will have brought complications with it-we know that as a result of the instances of PTSD and other issues around mental health that have been reported upon. What concerns me is that there will be young people who leave the defence forces-it doesn't matter what service-and think, 'It's all over, I've had enough of it, I'm gone, I'm moving on' and then sadly, some time later, it could be some years later, they become sick. They don't have the support structures around them, they've lost contact with their service colleagues-some of them are doing that quite deliberately-and they're not part of any group which can monitor them. As a result I think we've seen the sad outcomes which are reported upon in this report. The difficulty is trying to make sure that everyone who signs up in the Defence Force understands that the day they walk in to Kapooka they are potentially a client of the Department of Veteran Affairs for the rest of their lives and they have entitlements as a result of that that they should use. Too sadly, many just don't know-and when they don't know, they don't do. That is a real problem. So, trying to find a way to keep connection with people once they have done their service and separated is a real challenge, and I note that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the defence department and the three services are all aware of this and are trying to look at creative ways of sustaining people. There is a real issue about relevance and we have to make sure the defence service organisations are seen as relevant by today's soldiers, Navy personnel and Air Force people. They have got to be seen as relevant so that they can provide additional support. You might be a part-timer who has been sent overseas. You don't go back to a unit, necessarily. You may not go back to Darwin or to Enoggera in Brisbane; you might go back to where you live, which might be Shepparton, for example. You don't have a unit. You are one-out. You may not have the contacts within that community to give you the support that you properly need. Some of the recommendations in this report make a great deal of common sense. Recommendation 5, that Defence and Department of Veterans' Affairs align arrangements for the provision of mental health care, is a no-brainer. It is something I know has been in the minds of Defence and Veterans' Affairs for some time-making sure there is consistency of treatment and that when people do move from one part of the organisation to another, from being a full-time member serving in the Navy, Air Force or Army to becoming part of the veteran community, there is a seamless transition and their care is provided in a seamless way and is properly monitored. It is important, understanding the tragedy of suicide, that we do establish a national veteran suicide register to be maintained by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It is important so we know precisely what is going on. There are a lot of unknowns in this space and we have to get that knowledge and make sure that we put in place the interventions that will properly address the needs of these young men and women-not all young men and women, but mostly young-and ensure those needs are met. There is a recommendation that the Department of Veterans' Affairs:  conduct a review of its training programs to even sure relevant staff have understandings of the realities of military service,  have an understanding of health issues of veterans … I think many of them do that already. I think one of the issues we've got now is that we have a lot of people who have done three, four, five, six, seven tours of duty overseas, and when they come back they need real care. The problem is not that the departmental officials don't understand them; it is, I think, that the broader community doesn't understand them. Making sure the department services them, though, is a priority which we all ought to make sure happens. I think, when commending the committee for this work, that there is a need to address and continue to support the veterans-centric reform program within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We're talking about people who will be in the care of these agencies for the rest of their lives, effectively. They have entitlements and rights which need to be respected. But what is most important is that we do things that will intervene and make well again those who are unwell, and drive them away from the challenge and the threats of self-harm and suicide. I commend the report. service men and women in my first 18 months as a federal member of parliament. I met them in Afghanistan whilst I was over there on an ADF parliamentary program tour, I have met them through my Fisher Defence Industry Initiative, I spoke at the RSL Queensland AGM at Caloundra this year and I've also been approached by many committed veterans advocates. The service men and women and the veterans that I have met have raised three main issues, in particular, with me. Firstly, they've impressed upon me the importance of the provision of appropriate equipment for our men and women serving in the ADF. Secondly, they've discussed with me the importance of the help that is available when transitioning from service life to civilian life. Thirdly, they've talked to me about mental health and the support available to veterans and their families. Tragically, we know that the challenges of transition can have terrible consequences for too many of our veterans. In 2013, of the 148,000 veterans with service related disability being supported by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, 46,400-almost a third-were living with an accepted mental health disorder. These included post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, depression and substance dependency. In the 13 years to 2014, there were, sadly, 292 deaths by suicide among people who had served in the ADF for at least one day since 2001. Among male veterans, the suicide rate is 13 per cent higher than for the equivalent general population. Among those men aged 18 to 24, veterans are twice as likely to commit suicide than the wider population. There have been 23 deaths since 2001 among that statistically small group. There are many veterans living on the Sunshine Coast, and our community comes together to provide what support we can for them. In Fisher, we have very active RSL sub-branches at Caloundra, Beerwah and District, Kawana Waters, Glass House, and Maleny. I've attended",212,Ministerial Statements
242,Mr Wallace (Fisher) (11:21,"I've been fortunate to meet many current and formernumerous events at these RSLs and I was delighted to join the Caloundra RSL and also the president of the Glass House Country RSL just recently. Separate to the RSLs in my community, we have the Young Veterans Sunshine Coast group. This is a group with 268 members, headed by Jane McFadden and Tay Sukhanthapree aka 'Barrow'-they called him 'Barrow' in the Army because he had so many letters that he had to carry a wheelbarrow around, and that nickname has continued on into his civilian life. They are a great young bunch of men and women that come together about once a month to share in each other's company. They are a terrific bunch of young men and women because they just get together and share each other's company. There are no counselling sessions or anything like that. Just being around one another seems to be of great benefit to them. I want to do what I can to encourage them and support them because many young veterans, sadly, feel there is a disconnect between them and the older RSL groups. There's another group headed by a gentleman by the name of Kevin Moss, from Caloundra. He operates an organisation called Vet-Treks Australia and has done so since 1999. It provides repatriation benefits and health education services to war veterans and widows in rural and remote areas of Australia. The Sunshine Coast community provides wonderful support for veterans. But as a government we owe it to our current and former service men and women to lead the way, and that is what we do. There are 291,000 veterans and family members who currently receive government support, and 48 per cent of these are women. In total we deliver $11.3 billion to veterans and their families each year. In helping veterans to transition to civilian life and in providing support for their mental health, the coalition government is already taking comprehensive and decisive action to deal with veterans' concerns. We are investing more money and we are making bold reforms. In January last year, the government reformed the rules so that the Department of Defence could inform the DVA that a serving member has left the service and become a veteran. That ensures that more veterans can receive much earlier engagement. The government is investing $2.7 million in the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program launched in November last year. This money will be used to help businesses understand the unique skills and attributes that a former ADF member can bring to civilian life and to their employment. It is a wonderful initiative. In terms of mental health, last year's budget made treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and drug and alcohol misuse free for anyone who had served full time in the ADF. However, the tragic case of Jesse Bird, who took his own life this year at the age of only 32, reminds us that much more can and must be done. Men and women in the ADF have a sense of purpose. They have a feeling of belonging, a sense of tribe and a sense of mission. Alongside this sense of direction and belonging, they have structure provided in their lives. The day that they leave the ADF they lose that structure, they lose their place in the tribe and, most importantly, they lose their sense of purpose. One minute they're driving, flying or sailing multibillion-dollar equipment; the next, they can't get a job driving a car. How is that so? How can we as a nation allow that to continue? Our ADF personnel are highly trained. They have learnt and developed the highest level of skills in their fields. Out in civilian life, however, these skills are not widely acknowledged and they are too often not valued by employers and educational providers. As a society, we do not take advantage of these skills as we should. I'm optimistic that, given time, the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program will help with this situation, but we need to do more. Fundamentally, we need to help our veterans get that sense of purpose back. As a nation we need to throw our gratitude, love and support around our veterans in return for the service they have given. Most importantly, I believe, we need to help our veterans have their skills and qualifications recognised by employers and educational institutions. We need to help them get a meaningful job. I believe that is what will make the greatest difference to their transition to civilian life. I know that the government is as committed as I am to improving our veterans' transition. As I have described, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Prime Minister have already brought forward many important reforms and new initiatives. As the minister's statement has shown, they have accepted the recommendations of the Senate report and are already working on new programs, like the development of targeted new suicide prevention programs and the expansion of online engagement. As I said, we still need to do more. There is scope to do more. We need to encourage our service men and women to return to education to get degrees and other qualifications and to have the experience they've had in the service acknowledged in civilian life, because that will be the key to their success in civilian transition. we're having this morning about this very important topic. The report of the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The constant battle: suicide by veterans, is very welcome. It is a comprehensive report and I, like those who have spoken before me, very much welcome the recommendations. I think there is a great deal of bipartisan support for the recommendations in this report. The aim, of course, is that we provide greater assistance to our veterans and ex-service people-and currently serving people-by addressing not only administrative issues in the Department of Veterans' Affairs but a wider problem we have in our community. When we send our young men and women, in our name, to do jobs that are often dangerous, where they confront significant challenges, life events and traumas, we must make sure that we look after them. It is the very least that we can do as a country. SoI want to thank the members of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for all of their work on this important inquiry, in particular former Senator Lambie for initiating the inquiry. I acknowledge the consistently hard work by the chair, Senator Alex Gallacher, and the deputy chairs, Chris Back and Bridget McKenzie. It is fantastic work, and really important work for our nation. I thank each and every individual out there in the community, whether they are part of ex-service community based organisations, whether they are from the department, or whether they are lone former service men or women who are dealing with their issues and who put forward their experience in order to make life better for their comrades. I'll reflect on one of those people shortly, but first I want to say thanks to every individual and organisation that made a submission. It is because of their strength and resilience that this report builds such a comprehensive picture of the difficulties some veterans and ex-service personnel experience post their time in the ADF.",214,Ministerial Statements
243,Mr Gosling (Solomon) (11:31,"I am very happy to make a contribution to the debateI say 'some veterans and ex-service personnel' because thankfully not all veterans and ex-service personnel are affected in negative ways. I think it is true to say that service most definitely has an effect on everyone. I don't think there are too many people, men or women, who go through training in our services who aren't changed, but the overwhelming majority of the time those changes are positive. They build the resilience of the individual and build the character of our country. But, as the previous speakers have said and as the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, knows from his time in the role of Minister for Veterans' Affairs, there is a very multifaceted collection of experiences and reactions to experiences that brings about a very complex set of circumstances that we, as a government, need to provide the framework for within the Department of Veterans' Affairs to support our ex-service organisations but also to build that resilience in our community and that connectivity between the community and our serving people that will really provide the best context for people to make a transition that maintains the well-being of the individual and, of course, their families. Families are obviously the ones that are there, side by side, as our veterans and ex-service people engage in this constant battle. The stats on suicide by veterans are just phenomenal-and some of them aren't even being counted. So, again, I welcome this report because there is so much that we need to do. The ex-service suicide rate is 13 per cent higher than the general population's. As I said, there is a lot of bipartisanship in this space, but I am really glad that on our side before the last election we committed to a first principles review of veterans' affairs. The government has agreed with the report's recommendations, so again I welcome that in a bipartisan way. Transition back into civilian life with that structure that the former speaker spoke about is a time of great vulnerability. I have seen that play out for constituents in my electorate. There are many former defence personnel in Darwin, in Palmerston and, indeed, in the rural area which is in the member for Lingiari's seat but very much part of our greater Darwin community. I could tell many stories of individual accounts and phone calls with distressed parents. SoI know I can speak on behalf of all of those parents, such as Jesse Bird's parents, when I say that we need to make sure that these recommendations are turned into practical and effective support to ex-service people and veterans on the ground as soon as possible. I just want to reflect on a good mate of mine, an old commando comrade of mine, Todd Berry or 'Chuck' as we all called him-a real champion of a bloke. I was very happy to see him again last year when I joined with the member for Menzies, the member for Warringah and others on the Pollie Pedal which was raising awareness and funds for Soldier On. It was great to see Todd Berry again. I had not seen him since the time we served together. He found himself in a very difficult place in life, dealing with a trauma that he'd been part of during his military career. He went to the depths. What he has done with a mate called Rob Ginnivan is quite extraordinary. With the support of family and friends, Todd got himself together through a long process and he's written a book called Everything's OK: Post-Traumatic Stress Dissolved. What he's attempted to do-and he's done an incredibly good job of it-is to reflect on his own experiences, what he was feeling while he was going through this very difficult process, the effect it had on his family, the depth that he went to, the actions that he took and the relief that he was not successful in taking his own life. He put his energy, love, ideas, thoughts and reflections into a book. I'm very happy to say that, in the new parliamentary year, we're going to launch that book here in Parliament House, on 6 February at noon. I'll send an invite around to everyone. It was great to hear Todd's reflections on his life and what his book is about. The great message that it has is about connectivity to the community. Some other friends recently have given me some feedback that I thought I'd share with the House. We talk about digital communication and technology nowadays. There's a young soldier who had an idea, after one of his mates took his own life, that there would be an app for a phone. I don't want to misrepresent the idea, but it's a bit like Tinder in that you can see where other ex-servicepeople are in the vicinity if you need a chat, if you need to say, 'Oh, mate,' or if you need to reach back into the tribe and just reconnect with someone that you knew before. I think that's a great initiative, and I look forward to helping them with that. I think we need to take into account these ideas, these reflections that come from those with that lived experience of serving our country, experiencing trauma and having difficulty transitioning but getting through with the help of their friends and family. I think we need to take those into account, as well as these recommendations that I commend to the House. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11:41): This is a long overdue and very worthwhile report, and I commend the committee that did such a comprehensive review. You can tell how comprehensive the recommendations of this review are. There are very significant recommendations over a broad range of sectors We have 24 recommendations, and they cover everything from the DVA white card through to transition assistance, which is vitally important, and through to the delivery of services from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, as well as the first principles review that my colleague just mentioned. As the shadow assistant minister for defence, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important report produced by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. There have been a number of reports over the years into issues addressing the wounded and soldiers returning from conflict. In my time on the Defence Sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, we did an extensive review into how well DVA, particularly, was managing the return of wounded or injured soldiers from Afghanistan at that time. That report highlighted a number of significant gaps. One of the most significant was that-despite assurances in the evidence given to that committee that the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs were working closely or they were attempting to improve the connectivity and seamlessness between those agencies to ensure that, when someone was transitioning out of Defence into the DVA environment, it would be disrupted as little as possible-we discovered that there were still significant challenges there and that the seamlessness that was suggested by those officials who were giving evidence didn't exist. This report has highlighted that as well. Once again, there are still these challenges, particularly in that transition from Defence into the DVA environment. It's still incredibly chaotic in some instances. We have veterans who have left the service and are going through the trauma and the challenges that you face having signed up to be a warrior for your nation and a defender of your nation. Many of them have been through conflict. They have gone from that into this environment where they are a veteran, seemingly with very little support services, not just in terms of career transition arrangements, which this report highlights, but also in terms of mental health support and just financial support. Quite often there are gaps, and we hear that people aren't getting the support that they need, the financial support that they need. They are in this limbo, in this no-man's-land, and it's for too long, despite the fact that so many reports from Senate committees and joint standing committees have highlighted that transitioning from being a warrior in Defence to a veteran being processed through DVA is still not seamless. This has been highlighted; this has been an issue for a very long time. The fact that we are still having this conversation and that this report highlights that this is still a significant issue is concerning. That's why I welcome this report. As my colleagues have mentioned, it has bipartisan support. It highlights a number of very concerning issues, and I trust that the government will accept these recommendations and address them as soon as possible. It's tragic, as this report highlights, that so many of our younger ex-serving men are at risk of suicide death when compared to all Australian men of the same age. Ex-serving men aged between 18 and 24 have a suicide rate almost two times as high as for Australian men of the same age. I remember that in my last term the actual suicide rate of ADF members was an issue that was being debated-what was the true figure? Was it higher than the Australian average? These were issues that were debated quite extensively, and, in a way, they delayed any government agency addressing the actual issue. Now we know that ex-serving men aged between 18 and 24 have a suicide rate two times higher, and those aged between 25 and 29 have a suicide rate 1.5 times higher than the Australian male average for those of the same age and that ex-serving men aged between 25 and 29 have a suicide rate of 1.5 times the Australian male average of the same age. As the committee chair said in the foreword of the report: For modern veterans, it is likely that suicide and self-harm will cause more deaths and injuries for their contemporaries than overseas operational service. How extraordinary is that! Suicide and self-harm will cause greater injury than actually serving in conflict overseas. We know that the effort to prevent suicide by our veterans is one of the biggest challenges facing our Australian Defence Force. We know that. It's quite clear that we still have a long way to go to address the stigma around mental health. As beyondblue has said: People with depression and anxiety, and their family and friends, experience significant levels of stigma and discrimination. … … … People with depression and anxiety report that the stigma and discrimination they experience may be worse than their mental health condition(s). We must do better to ensure that veterans and those currently in the ADF who are dealing with depression or anxiety are provided with the appropriate support they require and that they are not stigmatised in any way. It's vitally important. I note that the stigma of actually coming forward and saying, 'I have a depression or anxiety issue,' is a barrier for many of our warriors coming forward and identifying the fact that they need some help. In the nearly four or five years I've been holding a shadow defence portfolio, I've met many veterans, and, along that course, I've met many serving ADF members. WheneverI meet veterans-young veterans particularly-who have been damaged by what has taken place in conflict, by what they've seen in conflict and by what they've experienced, it breaks my heart. I think about these young men who have been, in many ways, broken. Their self-esteem has gone; their self-confidence has gone. One of the men I met when I was in Afghanistan was part of a very large team that was looking after the four MPs who were there on a visit to Afghanistan. Years later I again met this young man, who I remembered as being incredibly fit, energetic, effusive, enthusiastic and proud of the work that he was doing. He was a broken man. He was a broken man from the fact that he suffered from PTSD. He had put on a significant amount of weight. He was trying to work his way through the system to get support for a university education from the ADF, and it was a struggle. Not only was he struggling with personal and mental health challenges; he was also going into battle, so to speak, with the actual ADF to try and get some support for him to make the transition out of military service. In Queensland, I met another young man who was, again, very broken and bruised from PTSD. He had had a real struggle in trying to get support for his condition, but he got through it. One of the great joys was seeing him supported by an assistance dog, which was providing great relief for him. I commend the committee on this report. I commend the courage, bravery and conviction of all those people who made submissions to the inquiry and appeared before the committee. This is a significant issue. These figures are frightening in the fact that, as Jeff Kennett said, our modern veterans are more likely to suicide and self-harm than be injured in conflict. This is a significant challenge for Australia, and we need to address it. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (11:51): I am pleased to speak on this report into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. I want to start by acknowledging the submissions made by Jesse Bird's family and ex-partner to the inquiry, and I thank them for their words. I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been for them, but their submissions were vital and have assisted in forming the recommendations put forward. This matter needs to be put and said quite simply. The system has failed. The system failed Jesse Bird. The system failed Jesse's family. The system failed his friends and loved ones, and the system is continuing to fail many of our veterans, families and defence personnel. We must be honest in order for real change to occur. And 'by the system', I do not mean just the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Governments have allowed this to happen. Service providers have allowed this to happen. Community support has failed. These men and women have put their lives on the line to serve and protect our country. When they return, we as a country need to acknowledge the sacrifices that they and their families have made and we must provide them with the support that they say desperately need. If we are to create change then we cannot be scared to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask: could we have done more, or could we have done something different? The answer is generally, 'Yes.' The black dog is not a problem that the defence community faces alone or needs to face alone. Mental illness is something that we as a community need to tackle. Assisting current and ex-service personnel, veterans, family members and peacekeepers does not simply mean checking and ticking boxes. It is so important that we understand that these are people and not just numbers. For their needs to be properly understood, it is really important that we ask the right questions so that we can shine a light on the many issues that have led us to this point in time. This is not a one-person problem, but a problem for many. In Australia, we are on the verge of an epidemic, where our soldiers and veterans are taking their lives at incredibly high rates. We are losing more Australian soldiers to suicide than in the war in Afghanistan. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that, from 2001 to 2014, there were 292 Defence Force personnel who took their lives, but that figure only includes personnel who joined from 2001. Ex-servicemen aged between 18 and 24 accounted for 23 suicides during that time, a rate that is almost twice that of Australian men on average. These figures are shocking and an outrage. Our veterans fight for us, and it is time the community stood up and fought for them. This is not just a Defence problem. This is a problem for the community to address, because mental health is everybody's responsibility. Our defence personnel are part of our community, and it will take a community to help keep the black dog from the door-or, better still, nowhere near the door. We need to focus on health services, community organisations, employment programs and financial assistance. Communities should be honoured and proud to have defence communities. I represent the largest garrison city in Australia and I am proud that I represent an electorate of which, it is estimated, 20 per cent are currently serving and ex-serving men and women, veterans, peacekeepers and their families. Since being elected in 2016, I have continually said that I will be a strong representative for our defence community and that I will engage with our defence community to ensure that their voices are heard loudly in Canberra. Last year, I was proud to launch the first-ever Townsville Defence Community Reference Group. This group contains a collective of 25 current, serving and ex-serving personnel and ESOs, and the first thing that we as a group tackled was that very issue of mental health. Since forming this group, in less than a year we have already had some fantastic achievements. The reference group has fought-and won the fight-for a local young veteran to be included on the national mental health review panel, and for community consultation to occur in Townsville for the veterans suicide review. The veterans suicide review panel came to Townsville to meet with defence group members. The group drafted the terms of reference and the project management job description and appointed the steering committee and the chair of that steering committee for the veterans suicide prevention trial that is currently underway in Townsville. The reference group has fought for and won, in partnership with the state government, the Oasis Townsville hub, a one-stop shop for all veterans' needs. When it is up and running, it will have the space to house all ESOs, and additional community and health support services. Further to this, the reference group members have been involved in the RSL Queensland Employment Program for veterans, which has now commenced in Townsville. I have to say this is one of the most outstanding employment programs that I have seen in many, many years. To that end, this program is currently being considered by the government for a rollout nationally. I fought against this government when locals reported to me that it was trying to shut Townsville's Department of Veterans' Affairs office and move services to Centrelink. The minister, Dan Tehan, was forced to make a public statement that this would not happen, on the very day that I raised the alarm. By bringing the defence community together and supporting each other, the Townsville Defence Community Reference Group have achieved so much in just one year, and we will not stop there. Locally, we are getting on with the job and supporting our defence community, but more needs to be done-and more needs to be done in this place, including more work around good, solid employment opportunities. Our soldiers need a reason to get out of bed. Our veterans need a reason to get out of bed. They need purpose and meaning, and their children need to see them going to work. We need more staff and departmental access for our veterans, more assistance for transitioning defence personnel and more assistance with community connection. I say to our currently serving and ex-serving personnel, veterans and peacekeepers: thank you for your service to this country, and please know that my door is always open. I will continue to listen to you, work with you and fight hard for you in this place. Townsville is proud to be the largest garrison city in the nation. Defence veterans and families make a huge social and economic contribution to our community, and, for that, we are truly grateful. Defence are valued in the Townsville community. Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (11:59): Yesterday morning I had the privilege of joining the 336 Squadron of the Australian Air Force Cadets at their annual trophy day parade, where they displayed their skill on the parade ground and several received awards for the very hard work that they had done throughout the year. There were around 50 cadets in all. There was a look of pride on their faces, whether they won an award or not. That was matched only by the pride on their parents' and families' faces. These are young people who spend often years involved in cadets and, when I speak with the older ones who are ageing out of cadets, many express a desire to join the Defence Force. It's these bright young faces I think of when we talk about suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. This group had within it some of our service personnel of the future, and we need to be taking steps to make sure that the trust they place in an institution like the Defence Force, and the RAAF, is well placed. It's their parents' faces, glowing with pride as they watch their children, that I think about because they're the ones who trust that this parliament and the departments that we guide will provide a safe environment for their young people to work in as they go through their career. It is the trust that something like the cadets has developed in these young people-the trust they have for the RAAF, the trust their parents have for the way they expect their children will be supported in a respectful way-that is so important in relation to this Senate inquiry and the findings it has made into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, because it's clear that the trust has not always been well placed. It's beyond doubt that veterans and exserving personnel are not receiving the support that they have every right to expect and that their families have every right to expect for them. The 458 submissions that the Senate inquiry received from peak bodies, ex-service organisations and many individual veterans and their families show that, as does the data. It never ceases to shock us when we hear that the suicide rates of ex-serving men are more than twice as high as for those serving full time or in the Reserve. Ex-serving men aged 18 to 24 are at particular risk, two times more likely to die from suicide than other Australian men of the same age. Those who left the ADF after less than a year of service are 2½ times more likely to die by suicide than other groups, and those discharged involuntarily have a similarly high rate of suicide. Those figures show us that we haven't got it right. The government has announced that it will accept every recommendation the Senate inquiry made, and we on this side are very supportive of that. That bipartisanship is crucial as we move forward. There's obviously work to do on the detail and we look forward to a collaborative approach bringing these recommendations to a practical implementation. There are 24 recommendations in the report about providing greater assistance to veterans. There are recommendations about the compensation claims process, which in itself is a fearful process for many people. I have been told that it exacerbates mental illness by its very nature. There are recommendations about the training of the staff who work in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and it is crucial that they understand what it has been like for people who have stepped up and served Australia as members of the Defence Force. There are recommendations about the medico-legal firms involved in the assessment of veterans, and I have to say that all of these issues touch on conversations that I've had on the doorsteps of Glenbrook, Hobartville, South Windsor or McGrath's Hill, where many defence families live. It is often a mother or a father who talks to me about the challenges that their son, often, is having, having left the Defence Force. I find it interesting that it isn't always the immediate family who wants to talk about this stuff-it's not the partner, and certainly not the person themselves. They have enormous loyalty to the Defence Force. They spent years of their life there, the family has made enormous sacrifices and it gets to a point where it's the mum or the dad who quietly talks to me and says, 'What's happening is just not right.' I think this inquiry was able to give voice to many of those issues and has fulfilled a very important role in taking away the opaqueness that was around it. People were able to speak without it being seen as a disloyalty to the Defence Force, and that's really important. The RSLs and the Blue Mountains Vietnam Veterans association have very reasonable expectations of the way people should be treated, as do, by and large, the mums, the dads, the partners and the children. In my electorate we have RAAF Base Richmond and Glenbrook air headquarters, so we have a large number of RAAF defence personnel. We are also very lucky to have St John of God Richmond Hospital, which focuses on veterans' mental health issues. But I welcome in this report the government's acceptance that we cannot just rely on existing services and we need to see some improvement in services. I'm particularly keen to see the trial program that will provide assistance animals for veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. My electorate actually has a hand in developing these assistance dogs, because we have the Guide Dogs breeding program at Glossodia. The guide dogs that don't quite make it through the program for assisting visually impaired people are often moved into an assistance program. I like to think that my electorate is going to be part of the solution through some of these programs. We certainly have some terrific stories of the assistance dogs that have been born and bred in the Hawkesbury. One of the key areas the inquiry touched on was the danger of transition-that it is a really vulnerable time. Anybody who has had any involvement with mental health and how it affects someone's life knows that change is a real trigger for mental illness-things are going along well but then a set of circumstances changes. Why would it be any different for our people who have served in Defence, particularly when you think about the structure and the amazing support that people have within the services? I got a taste of that at Amberley through the ADF Parliamentary Program, when I got to see the sorts of structure and support that are there. It's easy to understand why leaving it creates vulnerabilities for people. So it's great to see that there are four or five recommendations that look at how we support people as they transition. I'm particularly pleased to see that all ADF members will have access to the DVA white card while they transition into civilian life. That's a really important step. It stops there being that gap, that time when all the support they had is suddenly gone. The gaps in medical services are important to overcome, as are the employment issues. We need to provide more work not just at the point of transition, at the point of leaving the ADF, but as people are considering their future. My experience is that a lot of people in their 30s who have families ask: is Defence really where I want to stay for the next 10 or 20 years? They may or may not decide to leave, but we know that if they do they will need education and training support to help them transition into a civilian life where their skills are identified and they are recognised for what they are: diverse, highly skilled-often multiskilledindividuals who just need some support in shifting from the Defence structure to civilian life. I want to finish where I started, and that's with the families. Ex-Defence families carry a huge load. Anyone with a family member suffering mental health issues carries a load, but for Defence it's an even greater load. So it's very good to see recommendations 19 and 20 in particular, which talk about more support for partners of veterans and for families. It's an area in which the Labor Party certainly want to see a lot more work done. When I think of family days for DefenceI think of them as being not just about getting a ride in a plane but about supporting Defence families with their mental health. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 12:09 to 16:00 China to a more realistic view of our major trading partner, China, and its very different political nature from our Australian democracy. Both sides of Australian politics are committed to oppose foreign donations and what's been called foreign interference or the activities of the 'China club'. One of those aspects, in particular, is the Foreign Investment Review Board, which has adopted a much more active role in all of this-a very good role. Let's remember that the China club got a lot of prominence years ago when the then communications minister and now Prime Minister supported Beijing's telco Huawei constructing and controlling our $50 billion NBN network. Let's also remember that the Western Australian Liberal Party and, in particular, the member for Curtin accepted $230,000 of a $500,000 donation from the Beijing linked Huang Xiangmo Yuhu Group. Let's remember, too, that former minister for trade Andrew Robb took an $880,000 sinecure from the Beijing controlled Landbridge corporation immediately after he ceased office at the 2016 election. Finally let's remember the low point of where our naive attitudes towards China began, and that was when the Liberal government in the Northern Territory sold the port of Darwin, next to our joint Australian-US naval facility, for a trifling half a billion dollars. Forde Electorate: Beenleigh Theatre Group sheer talent that exists in my electorate of Forde. I'd like to take the opportunity this afternoon to acknowledge the wonderful work of the Beenleigh Theatre Group for its incredible efforts and ongoing dedication to its craft. Last month, the devoted cast of more than 40 put on a brilliant production of the musical Anything Goes. I'm grateful to have had the pleasure of seeing the performance on its opening night. It was a truly fantastic evening. Originally written in 1934 by songwriter and composer Cole Porter, Anything Goes has become an",216,Ministerial Statements

245,Mr Van Manen (Forde,"Government Whip) (16:02): I remain blown away by theiconic piece of theatrical history, taking place on board the SS American. It's a classic tale of boy meets girl, skilfully complemented by music, singing, dancing and some very funny comedy. Directed by Michael Skelton and assistant director Katya Bryant, our own Beenleigh Theatre Group presented the 1987 version, which features more dance music than in the original. The Anything Goes band, directed by Cindy Ashton and musical director Christine Leah, also did a fantastic job scoring the production. The arts and those who work in the industry are an incredible asset to our communities. They entertain us, inspire us and enrich the fabric of our societies. I'm proud to see the industry flourishing so well in my home town of Beenleigh. I'd like to thank Ms Dana Le Brocq for her assistance putting this together during her work experience in my office over the past couple of weeks. Multicultural Awards for Excellence Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (16:03): Last week, I attended Government House in Victoria for the annual presentation of the 2017 Multicultural Awards for Excellence. I want to congratulate members of my local community who were recognised for their hard work and commitment in creating social cohesion in the federal seat of Calwell. I want to begin with Mr Ajit Singh Chauhan, who received the Award for Meritorious Service to the community for his work with disadvantaged youth from diverse cultural backgrounds, particularly in his role at Spectrum Migrant Resource Centre and with the Hume Interfaith Network youth program. Mr Walid Markas received the Award for Meritorious Service to the Community for his work with Victoria's Chaldean community, especially tackling issues facing women and young people. Ms Martha Metuisela was the winner of the Youth Award for her work with Brimbank City Council as a youth worker. She co-founded Westside Pasifika, a group that fosters intercultural understanding Mr Adel Salman received the Award for Meritorious Service to the Community for his work on improving Victorians' understanding of Muslim communities as vice-president and media spokesperson for the Islamic Council of Victoria. Mrs Thekla Scarcella of Campbellfield received the Award for Meritorious Service to the Community on behalf of the GreekAustralian Recreational & Instructive League Of Vic. The group partners with the Babylon Cultural Centre to connect newly arrived migrants to the established Greek community and other migrant communities in our electorate. Congratulations to all recipients. International Day of People with Disability with Disability. I want to acknowledge the work of charities in my electorate who help to ensure that, in keeping with the themes of the day, we leave no-one behind and work to support people with disability to be active contributors to society. To mark the day, I recently visited Montrose Therapy and Respite Services in Birtinya, with my wife, Leonie, and daughter Sarah. Sarah lives with disability, and Montrose have provided her with the very highest standard of care and support. In keeping with the meaning of International Day of People with Disability, Montrose aim to help people live a satisfying, happy life. They recognise that every individual is important. Montrose combine physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, psychology and social work in a unique plan tailored for each of the 94 people they work with on the Sunshine",224,Statements By Members
246,Mr Wallace (Fisher) (16:05,"Yesterday we celebrated International Day of PeopleCoast. Across Queensland, they help 1,300 people. They have provided more than 54,000 hours of therapy over the past 12 months. With this inclusive approach, they continue to expand and grow. They are now offering services not only on the Sunshine Coast but at 12 facilities from Townsville to the Gold Coast. I want to take this opportunity to thank Sarah's therapist, Amanda, the regional manager, Jo, and all the team at Montrose for their exceptional care. Brand Electorate: Christmas Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (16:06): Last Friday, 1 December, I had the pleasure of kicking off the Christmas season in my electorate of Brand, with the annual Mother Teresa Catholic College Christmas carols in Baldivis, alongside my WA Labor state colleague Mr Reece Whitby, the member for Baldivis. Hundreds of people turned out to sing, dance and enjoy the atmosphere. The students from each year group performed a collection of Christmas carols or Christmas songs, and I can tell you that there were many parents who were very proud of their children's performances and many children who were really enjoying the evening out. It was a beautiful night in Baldivis-a little windy, but that's the sea breeze for you. I want to thank the wonderful staff of Mother Teresa Catholic College and their principal, Geri O'Keefe, for hosting this wonderful community event at their very beautiful school in the ever-growing and wonderful community of Baldivis. There are more Christmas carols to come. On 17 December, I'm hosting another event outside the Darius Wells library in Kwinana. I will be hosting this along with the Deputy Premier, my friend and colleague Mr Roger Cook. Calista Primary School will be doing some singing, along with the kids who participate in the WA Symphony Orchestra Crescendo program. This is a fantastic program where kids from North Parmelia, Medina and Calista primary schools all get to enjoy listening to and learning more about orchestral music in their music lessons. I would encourage the community of Kwinana and the surrounding suburbs to come down on 17 December to Darius Wells library-and try not to be scared by Roger Cook's singing! Robertson Electorate: Christmas electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast, we kick-started this on Sunday with the wonderful Christmas fair at Kariong, at Mount Penang. This was the 10th year of the fair, and this year it was even bigger than ever, with thousands of Central Coast residents heading out to Kariong for the day. With more than 150 stalls, ranging from handmade jewellery and candles to artwork, handcrafted teas and some beautiful food, the fair has quickly become one of the Central Coast's most popular markets. I was honoured to be part of the day, with our stall featuring some incredible entries from the 2017 Robertson Christmas Card Competition. Every year, primary school students from across my electorate send in their amazing designs, with the winning entries being featured on my Christmas card. My congratulations go to Eden from Chertsey Primary School on her winning design. Hundreds of people at the fair stopped to look at the students' entries. It was fantastic to see that these beautiful designs brought as much joy to all who were at the Christmas fair as they did to me and my office.",225,Statements By Members

(Time expired) Aviation Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (16:10): In September, cancellations for flights from Canberra to Sydney topped the nation at 8.1 per cent. In October, cancellations from flights from Canberra to Sydney reached 6.6 per cent. The national long-term cancellation rate is 1.4 per cent, so what we saw in September and October here in Canberra is five to seven times the average. Qantas alone cancelled 8.8 per cent of its flights. It impacted on as many as 6,000 people travelling along the route. That's 6,000 people who were paying a premium price, some spending hundreds of dollars, for flights between Canberra and Sydney and being left stranded. Canberrans are missing work. Canberrans are missing meetings. Canberrans are missing weddings. Canberrans are missing concerts. Canberrans are missing sporting events. Canberrans are missing funerals. Canberrans are missing anniversaries and birthdays. This is simply not good enough. Canberra Airport called for the Turnbull government and the consumer commission to step in when airlines have a higher than average flight cancellation rate. What was the response from the government? The government said that it would monitor the situation. On-time flight statistics are published by the government, so it is up to the Turnbull government to make sure airlines are accountable for their performance. The Turnbull government's inaction on this issue lets airlines off the hook and underscores, yet again, its complete and utter contempt for Canberra. O'Connor Electorate: Students students are finishing up the school year and looking forward to the Christmas break. I congratulate all of them on their hard work and hope their efforts have paid off. For those who have graduated this year, congratulations on reaching this milestone achievement. Many will be taking a gap year or continuing their education at university or undertaking vocational training. Others will be starting an apprenticeship or traineeship or entering the workforce. I wish the class of 2017 the very best for the exciting new adventures ahead. I thank their parents, teachers and mentors for shaping the young adults they have become and I look forward to the contributions they will make to their communities in the future. Speaking of strong communities, only last week I attended a seniors Christmas lunch in Mount Barker. It was hosted by the Rotary Club of Mount Barker, with generous donations from the local co-op, primary producers, wineries, the Bendigo Bank and the Shire of Plantagenet. Most heartening was seeing the Mount Barker Community College students dedicated to spoiling their senior citizens who have contributed so much to the community. I met graduates who came back from their leavers celebrations to host and serve meals, students who were bussing tables and hospitality students who were slaving away in the kitchen.

I take this opportunity to wish you all a very merry Christmas and reaffirm my commitment to you in 2018. Petition: Small Breweries 1,477 signatures calling for an end to the current unfair tax treatment of small brewers in Australia. I do that to support the craft brewing sector, a sector that, I know, has got some bipartisan support in this parliament. The petition recognises the inequity which is there for how the Commonwealth excise is calculated between smalland large-scale brewers, disadvantaging the smaller craft brewers. In simple terms, this means that the current rate of federal excise charged for a keg containing 50 litres of beer is less than the rate charged for a keg containing 30 litres. With excise making up approximately 40 per cent of operating costs for most craft breweries, this must change. Craft breweries are growing. There are now over 400 around Australia. They are small businesses employing people in local communities and providing a centre for community activity in our suburbs and in our regions right around Australia. They will contribute some $35 billion to the overseas market by 2020. The sector has become an economic powerhouse. With proper support from the federal government, there is enormous potential for future growth. It should get that support. Petitions Committee for its consideration. It will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with the standing orders. Goldstein Electorate: Schools representative in this place is being able to meet the wonderful school groups from the Goldstein electorate that come and visit Parliament House. All members know this wonderful joy of engaging directly with the voters of the future, the thirsty and hungry minds of our democracy, and we welcome them every day. So far this year, I've had the pleasure of meeting students from Kilvington Grammar School, McKinnon Primary School, St Joseph's School and St Mary's Primary School from the Goldstein electorate. Thank you for coming to Canberra, and, more critically, thanks for coming up on a sitting week so we can chat. It is an honour to meet and spend time with young, bright students who are discovering the strong spirit of our democratic institutions and traditions in the great land we call Australia. The questions they ask and the observations they make are thoughtful and insightful and make me proud to be their local representative. Inquiry is critical to the future and health of our democracy, and they embrace that. It is always refreshing to be able to step out of the hustle and bustle of political life and engage directly with young people on a personal level and to connect with them so they can have a greater confidence in our democracy into the future. I'd like to emphasise how exciting it is to see what great values and curiosity our local schools are instilling in their kids.

But what's our government done? In the face of warnings from the UNHCR about a looming humanitarian catastrophe in the lead-up to the closure of the facility on Manus Island on 31 October, the government did nothing. We saw a profound failure of leadership-moral and practical-and we have seen the humanitarian crisis that we were warned about. I stand here in this parliament to say to those men that we are aware of their suffering, and we will do what we can to alleviate it. In particular, I join the shadow minister in calling on the government to stop sitting on its hands and to, at the very least, accept the generous offer of New Zealand to resettle some of these men to protect them from harm. I call more broadly on government members to pay attention to our moral and our legal obligations to those who seek help from us-those who are forced to flee their homes and are entitled to ask us for help. I call the government to join us in forming a more decent debate about these most challenging issues, to do justice to these men and to those elsewhere in the region who also are entitled to more from us. La Trobe Electorate: RidgeWalk Project $2.5 million towards the RidgeWalk project in the Dandenong Ranges. The 14 kilometres of walking trails will connect villages in the ranges from Ferny Creek, Sassafras, Olinda, Mount Dandenong, Kalorama and Montrose right down to Upwey. It will have minimal environmental impact, and the great news about this project is that it will tell the incredible history of the Dandenong Ranges-of Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Fred Williams and Aboriginal artists such as William Barak and Bill and Lin Onus who were inspired to create their masterpieces in the Dandenong Ranges. This is a very important local project for creating jobs in the hills, and I'd like to thank Ali Wastie from the Yarra Ranges Council and Dr Bronwyn Hanna, who has been working tirelessly behind the scenes putting together a national heritage listing for the Dandenong Ranges, something I'm passionate about. At the moment, the problem is that, although we have $2.5 million of federal funding, we need the state Labor government to get on board. With Puffing Billy, they finally came to the table and put money down on a vital local tourism project. They need to come to the table again and put money into this very important project. This is something very exciting. It will tell the history of the Dandenong Ranges and will be great for tourism. It will create local jobs and tell a great story about Australian landscape artists.

He founded many services and programs that still run today. His contribution to our community touched thousands and thousands of local residents. I was always inspired by his work and found his energy and passion an amazing gift he gave to so many. In his later years, when he was sick, Tim had to leave the Hackham West community. He turned his attention to running retreats and providing people with spiritual direction. Across his life, he helped many people in many different ways: in his younger years by doing youth work, then by providing people with education as a teacher, then through community development at Hackham West, and then, in later years, through retreats. His commitment, his passion and his love will be missed greatly. Gilmore Electorate: Small Business someone you love. Firstly, let me take this opportunity to wish everyone a healthy and happy Christmas, a plea to stay safe and have a terrific time with your family. On another point, our local shops are part of our regional family. They support employees and give energy and spirit to our towns and villages. Apart from trying to purchase all my gifts from local small businesses, I've taken the time to copy a colleague and establish some small boxes in different shops, to collect vouchers, in some of my Nowra stores. The 2017 Gilmore Shop Small project promotes our local businesses and encourages people to shop locally during December. The participating businesses include Flamingo Florist, Cherubs 3, Deli on Kinghorne, Ninety one Junction, Aquatique, Knickerboxers, Scruples Hairdressing, The Leaf, Kinghorne Traders and Nourish. A customer can fill out a form and put it in a big barrel. We'll pick one out, I'll buy a voucher from the winning store and that will be delivered to that particular person. It's just a way of saying: 'Let's shop local. Let's look after our local businesses, and somebody will get a prize.' I want to give a shout out to the Nowra CBD revitalisation committee. They have done an amazing job putting corflute wrapped in triangles around all of the posts, and the sign says 'Merry Christmas'. It's a bit of colour and a bit of cheer. It's well deserved. People are really happy with it. They've put tinsel all around the town. It feels like Christmas. Let's hope they all enjoy it. Macquarie Electorate: Public Transport Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (16:23): The lives of many commuters in the Hawkesbury have been turned upside down by the New South Wales government's new train timetable. How's this for a plan: let's make an already long commute-about an hour and 20 minutes-even longer by adding small stations to it, let's make people get up 15 minutes earlier and let's make them wait an extra 15 minutes to get home. Last week, at Richmond station, people were telling me the New South Wales Liberals have added as much as 40 minutes a day to their trip-that's three hours a week for those worse affected. Not everyone can change their start and finish times to suit the New South Wales trains. For working parents, it's an absolute nightmare. It was always tight, but now you can't drop off a child in time to catch the train you need to get to work by nine because",229,Statements By Members

These may seem like minor inconveniences to the state member, Dominic Perrottet, who has so far avoided meeting with local community advocates like Stuart Gale and Nathan Cox. Blue Mountains commuters in my electorate are also impacted, but they have a state member, Trish Doyle, who's taking up the fight. We may as well not have a state member for the Hawkesbury. But that doesn't mean that the Hawkesbury doesn't have serious state issues that need to be addressed. Menzies Electorate: Veneto Club people to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Veneto social club in Bulleen. The social club has been part of the fabric of our local community for more than half a century. The concept of a club focusing on the Veneto region began in April 1966 with a handful of then young men from the Treviso area who had immigrated to Australia. As Jenny Mountstephen has written in Mr Pronto, a story of one of the founders, Dave Barro, the men's idea was quite simple in the beginning: they just wanted to form their own small club and have a clubhouse-a meeting place where those of similar origins could play a game of bocce and share conversation over a glass of wine. A club was subsequently formed and a fundraising appeal soon established. With the assistance then of Sir Billy Sneddon, land was acquired in Bulleen and the now familiar Ermin Smrekar designed building was constructed. Sir Billy opened the new building on 8 December 1973. Since then, the Veneto Club has grown into a major social, cultural and sporting centre for our local community. It's a tribute to the founders and all those who have worked for the Italian community for these past 50 years. It's also a reminder, I believe, that what matters most in society happens in the space between the individual and the state. Creating, sustaining and protecting the space which is occupied by families, community and civic institutions like the Veneto social club is one of the most important things we can do. Workplace Relations Marriage highs and lows of this year. The low must have been on 1 July, when more than 700,000 Australians had their penalty rates slashed by the Turnbull government whilst, at the same time, a fortunate few received a tax cut. It seems no thought was paid to the economic and social impact that these cuts will have on the pay of our lowest paid workers-and will continue to have on the local communities. If it was considered, this government simply didn't care. For many, penalty rates are not a luxury. They can be what pay the bills, send children to music lessons or put a gift under the Christmas tree. As a high point, I cherish the moment that support for marriage equality was formally announced. I did not support the survey. I thought parliament should have done its job, but I am proud to stand here as a representative from an electorate and a state that had a solid majority yes vote.

256,Mr Hart (Bass) (16:26,"I would like to take this opportunity to briefly consider theconstituents a safe and peaceful festive season, and a happy new year. I know that many people at the fringes of society have difficulties around this time of year, particularly at Christmas. I urge those people to seek the comfort of counselling services if they feel they need that. Melanoma bear with me to see where I'm going on this. Having been a farmer for 20 years, I found there is value in checking your arms. A couple of days ago I found myself with a little dot on my arm-a mole that was growing. Being sensible, my wife told me what to do. She said, 'You should get that checked out.' I got it checked out. I got it cut off only to find it was a melanoma. CanI say to the farmers out there, to the country people and to Australians who love the sun: go and get checked out. Do yourself a favour before Christmas. It was very small. It didn't look much-two colours and a little bit sharp-but I have been told that the flat ones, the ones that don't look so sinister, are the ones you've got to watch out for. It seems to be a trend of the Nationals. Our leader, Barnaby Joyce, who we're pleased to have back, has had some cut off. Maybe I've got leadership aspirations by also having a melanoma cut off my arm! CanI say: we love our sunshine and we love our summer, but do yourself a favour blokes and ladies and go and get checked out-particularly blokes, because we're notorious at not looking after our health. Luckily they got it in time. They've got to cut out a bit more in the next couple of weeks, when I get back from here. Ultimately, get a check-up, look after yourself and that will be the best present you can give yourself this Christmas. jacket for such a serious message. I give the call to the member for Ballarat. Ballarat Electorate: Marriage Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (16:29): I commend the member for Mallee for raising awareness about skin cancer in this place, particularly amongst those of us who live in the country. This week, of course, we will be debating marriage equality, and it's an honour and a privilege in this place. I will speak in the other chamber at some length, but I want to talk a little bit about the results of the postal survey in my electorate of Ballarat. We obviously did not want the postal survey but, once the government determined that that was the course it was going to pursue, I made it very clear that I would be supporting the LGBTIQ community in my electorate. Almost instantly in my electorate, 'yes' supporters pulled together and started campaigning. I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in the 'yes' campaign. In particular, I make special mention of the Ballarat Pride Hub for all of their hard work. I know how much of an emotional toll this took on their members. I thank Brett Edgington and his team at Ballarat Trades Hall, in particular, for their work. I thank all of the volunteers. The Australian Labor Party ran campaigns and the Australian Greens ran a campaign, as did the Liberal Party in my electorate. They were all campaigning in different ways but making sure that there was a campaign run in my electorate. I thank all of the volunteers who helped with street stalls, phone banking and getting letters into mailboxes. It was really important, and the results speak for themselves. Nearly 82 per cent of people returned their surveys in the electorate of Ballarat, returning a 70.5 per cent 'yes' vote, a very important and significant vote for inclusion in my electorate of Ballarat.",231,Statements By Members

But nothing fills me with a greater sense of pride today than to be able to stand and congratulate the Canungra Chamber of Commerce and local community for getting behind Turning Canungra Pink. Basically, as a whole community they set about raising money for breast cancer, and they turn their entire town pink. The power poles are painted pink, all of the businesses don pink streamers, and events happen during the course of the week. It was fantastic to see this small town with a big heart raise no less than $46,000 for breast cancer research this year. Many locals' lives are touched by cancer in some way, and this event succeeds in bringing the community together in taking positive steps to fight this horrific disease. A similar event was held in Beaudesert in September with the local branch of Cancer Council Queensland, decorating the local streets blue in awareness of prostate cancer research. Just two weeks ago, the Jimboomba branch of Cancer Council Australia had their annual Relay for Life event, where more than 500 people laced up their boots and did 18-hour walks. I think they raised about $75,000, an incredible contribution. Wills Electorate: Coburg West Primary School West Primary School. The initial plans for establishing Coburg West Primary go all the way back to 1912, when the education department purchased three acres of land in Coburg at a cost of 10 pounds. A public meeting was convened in June 1916 on Munro Street, just a couple of doors down from my current electorate office, and a committee was formed to campaign for the construction of a new school in West Coburg, which officially opened in September 1917. If we fast-forward more than 50 years, in the mid-seventies, under the Whitlam government, the school was listed by the Australian Schools Commission as a disadvantaged school and received funds to assist in the education of the increasing number of migrant students. At the centenary celebration, I joined Barry Shackleton in unveiling a commemorative plaque in recognition of the school's long and proud history. At the age of 96, Barry is the oldest living alumnus of the school, having attended from 1927 to 1933. It was great to see Barry there. We heard from the current principal, Mark Colagrande, that during the Great Depression Barry and his mates got into big trouble for ringing the bell during school hours. Given it was the Depression, I said to Barry, 'I'm surprised you and your mates didn't nick the bell and try to pawn it off.' But I'd like to congratulate all the teachers, the students and the parents of Coburg West Primary School, past and present, on a fantastic centenary. Here's to the next 100 years. McMillan Electorate: Marriage at the moment because, even though the vote for same-sex marriage in my electorate was 61 per cent and about 40 per cent voted no, I, their federal member, will be voting no in this debate.

This is not what we're used to and not what we're a part of.' I have got to tell you that, in my role, I have agreed with people in regard to same-sex marriage, and my agreement with them is more important than the job that I actually do-my agreement with those people that said, 'This is the way I will vote; this is the way I'll support you.' So, for those who have huge concern about the fact that I am voting one way, I put to you that this is the way I will be voting. Taxation Dr LEIGH (Fenner) (16:35): Last week, by a vote of 51 to 49, the US Senate passed a major corporate tax cut. The bill has several similarities with the corporate tax cut being debated here. A survey by the University of Chicago found that 37 out of 38 US economists said the GOP bill would increase the deficit. The 38th later said he didn't understand the question. In Australia, an Economic Society of Australia survey of 31 economists found two-thirds agreeing: Australia will receive a bigger economic growth dividend in the long-run by spending on education than offering an equivalent amount of money on a tax cut to business. Treasury's own estimates say that the government's big-business company tax cut would deliver only a 0.1 per cent increase in personal income-in the 2030s. The US tax cut bill will be regressive, with middle-income tax breaks being temporary but tax breaks to private jet owners being permanent. Likewise, the Australian company tax cut would be paid for by increasing taxes on lowand middle-income-earning Australians-a measure that Labor has opposed. There are similarities too in the handwritten nature of the US tax bill and the fact that the Turnbull government is now back to attempt to redraft its own changes to small business tax cuts. The government says that Australia's company tax is too high, but the US Congressional Budget Office's analysis ranks Australia's 30 per cent rate as 10th in the G20. If the US bill passes committee, it will move us to ninth-hardly a reason for a budget-busting, regressive tax change that won't tangibly boost growth. Wright Electorate: Christmas being something different for everyone. For most it's a joyous occasion, but it's not necessarily a great part of the year for all of our community. Christmas is the time to expand our giving, encompassing those in need. It's a time for sharing, because there's no greater gift than if you can give your own time. I want to acknowledge the Rotary Club in the Fassifern Valley, because it's giving soldiers that are serving abroad a taste of some country hospitality this Christmas by sending no fewer than 60 specialised diggers packs to the Middle East. It was my pleasure to contribute puzzles, pencils, Australian flags, diaries, notepads, envelopes and writing paper to those diggers boxes, along with the homemade cakes, chutneys, jams and jars of Vegemite. It's a great opportunity to show how we appreciate our nation's servicemen, who may be spending",233,Statements By Members
262,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (16:37,"It is the most wonderful time of the year-Christmastime away from their families. It will possibly be the only gift they get at Christmas until they return home to their families. I also recently donated some stationery packs to Able Australia in Jimboomba. Able Australia are like the safety net in our community; they help people who are disadvantaged with food packs and other assortments. Back-to-school supplies can be an expensive cost for families looking to get children back to school. So it's been an opportunity for me to give something to the community. Perth Electorate: Schools enjoying this time of the year. One of the reasons I do is being able to attend any number of school graduations in my electorate. I see my great mate the member for Fremantle here; I'm sure he will agree that we can't always spend as much time in those school as we would like to, because we have the privilege of serving in this place. So, in the remaining 60 seconds of my speech, I am going to try to give a shout out to all 50 of them, and here I go-with apologies to Billy Joel: ANZAC Terrace Primary School, Aranmore Catholic times three, Ashfield Primary School, Bassendean Primary School, Bayswater Primary School, Camboon Primary School, Carmel School, Casa Mia Montessori Community School, Chisholm Catholic College, Coolbinia Primary School, Cyril Jackson times three, Durham Road School, Eden Hill Primary School, Embleton Primary School, Hampton Park Primary School, Hampton Senior High School, Highgate Primary School, Hillcrest Primary School, Infant Jesus School, Inglewood Primary School, John Forrest Secondary College, KIDS Open Learning School, Kyilla Primary School, Maylands Peninsula Primary School, Mercedes College, Morley Primary School, Morley Senior High School, Mount Hawthorn Education Support Centre, Mount Hawthorn Primary School, Mount Lawley Primary School, Mount Lawley Senior High School, Noranda Primary School, North East Metropolitan Language Development Centre, North Morley Primary School, North Perth Primary School, Perth College, Sacred Heart Primary School, SIDE schools, Sir David Brand School, St Columba's School, St George's school, St Michael's School, St Paul's Primary School, St Peter's Primary School, Trinity College and Weld Square Primary School. That is all of them, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I tell you what: they all do such a good job. To all of the kids, all of the principals, the great teachers, the support staff, the ed support and all of the admin staff: you deserve a well-earned break, you do a marvellous job, and thank you very much. Cervical Cancer Ms BANKS (Chisholm) (16:40): I rise today as a very proud member of the Turnbull government, a government that is delivering for all Australians. In fabulous news for Australian women, last Friday, 1 December, the new human papillomavirus, HPV, test began being used by Australian doctors. From now on, Australian women will benefit from this new and more effective screening test for cervical cancer, which provides greater accuracy and requires testing less often. The new HPV test will prevent up to 30 per cent more women developing cervical cancer because it detects HPV, an early risk indicator for cervical cancer, while the previous Pap test detected cervical abnormalities after they occurred. This is wonderful news for Australian women, who now need to be tested only every five years instead of every two. We know that cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers,",234,Statements By Members
263,Mr Hammond (Perth) (16:39,"I'm sure I share with all of us here a lot of love inbut screening is vital. Around 80 per cent of Australian women who develop cervical cancer do not get screened regularly, as recommended, or have never been screened. The Turnbull government is committed to improving women's health through prevention and early detection. I'm thrilled that the new HPV test will aid many women to manage the detection. In addition to the new HPV test, it is fantastic that our new national cervical immunisation program is now using Gardasil 9, which will be offered through the National Immunisation Program. Even with the vaccine, it's important that women continue to have regular screening, and this is why I'm proud to speak today on the new test that will help generations of Australian women to prevent it. Fremantle Electorate: Community Groups all the community groups that do such good and important work in my electorate of Fremantle. They provide essential services; they fight for social justice; they enable sports and outdoor activity, including water safety; they sustain our arts and culture; and they deliver environmental protection. These groups in turn depend on thousands of people to give their time, energy and goodwill as volunteers. I particularly thank those who take leadership positions and act as office-bearers. Your community service is vital and it is hugely valued. In the last few months, I have been glad to assist a number of groups through the Stronger Communities grants program, and today I'd like to mention a few who operate across the four corners of my electorate. The grants in this round included $7,000 to provide air conditioning in the charming but often extremely hot cottage headquarters of the Fremantle heritage guides; $2,850 for a new trailer and lightweight tents to enable the Atwell Scouts to go further into the wild; $20,000 for critical upgrades to the APACE community garden facilities in North Fremantle; and $19,000 to build a new training room at the Coogee Beach Surf Life Saving Club. I am grateful to all these groups. They form part of the connective tissue that binds together the wonderful communities in Fremantle, East Fremantle and Cockburn. I know they will magnify the value of these grants through their hard work, which of course is a labour of love. Banks Electorate: Panania Senior Citizens' Centre and All Starz Performing Arts Studio Panania senior citizens' group at the Panania Senior Citizens' Centre. As always, it was a fantastic visit, chatting with some of the ladies who were on a break from their Tai Chi class and talking about local issues in the Panania region and the broader East Hills region. One of the issues that many residents are concerned about, as I am, is the extraordinarily unacceptable proposals of Bankstown council in relation to high-rise development in the Panania area. That is an issue on which I will continue to represent the views of our community. I do thank Wynn Burns and everyone who was at that centre on that day. Wynn Burns has been involved with the senior citizens' centre for many years and puts a great deal back into our community.

Federation Chamber adjourned at 16:45 National Broadband Network (Question No. 729) Mrs Elliot asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, in writing, on 22 May 2017: In respect of the NBN rollout on the North Coast NSW, (a) can the Minister provide a timetable of expected dates for its completion, and (b) will additional satellite capacity be made available for regional and rural consumers on the North Coast. Mr Fletcher: The answer to the member's question is as follows: (a) NBN Co. Limited (nbn) is on track to complete the rollout nationally, including the North Coast of NSW, by 2020. Anticipated Ready for Service (RFS) dates for individual addresses are available using the 'Check your address' function on nbn's website at www.nbnco.com.au. (b) On 27 June 2017, Minister Fifield announced that nbn would double the maximum monthly wholesale data limits and increasing average peak download plans by up to 50 percent on the Sky Muster service. While it is up to retailers to decide what plans they offer, nbn will increase the average allowable download per customer from 30 gigabytes (GB) to 45GB of peak data a month, and around another 150 GB of off-peak data per month. Going forward, nbn will continue to optimise the pricing model and data plans of the Sky Muster service, with further offerings on business and education services expected to be available in the next 12-18 months. nbn also has a process to provide more capacity to ""Public Interest Premises"" such as eligible education and health locations. National Broadband Network (Question No. 730) Mrs Elliot asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, in writing, on 22 May 2017 (1) Why did it take more than a week to restore NBN services for some customers after the recent flooding in Northern NSW. (2) Why were there no effective alternatives offered for these customers to access the NBN, especially given such delays were not experienced when the copper network was in use. Mr Fletcher: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The companies that own telecommunications infrastructure, whether NBN Co Limited (nbn) or another company, are not able to restore services when it is not possible to access the site or sites where remediation activities need to take place. Where communities are recovering from severe weather and flooding, there will often be impacts to communications services. Telecommunications companies make every effort to ensure the continuity of their services and work to restore telecommunications services as quickly as possible, once areas are deemed safe to enter by emergency services. nbn acted to restore services across NSW and Queensland after Tropical Cyclone Debbie as quickly as possible. In the case of NBN services in Northern NSW, end users serviced by the fixed wireless towers at Tygalgah and Clothiers Creek experienced a lengthier loss of service as a consequence of flooding in the area. The Tygalgah site is built on a two metre high raised platform; however, the extreme flood waters rose above this, inundating the wireless tower cabinets. End users at Clothiers Creek experienced a loss of service due to the upstream dependency on the Tygalgah site. It should be noted that migration of telephone and data services from the legacy copper service to the nbn infrastructure is not compulsory in areas serviced by fixed wireless. Despite a number of attempts over five days, issues accessing the Tygalgah site caused delays in restoration activities. When nbn first accessed the site on 4 April 2017, impact assessment identified that a full cabinet replacement was required. Further difficulties were experienced in getting the required equipment to the wireless tower due to flood damage to the site access track. Once technicians were able to reach the site with replacement cabinets and equipment, the site rebuild was completed and end user services were restored. (2) It is not correct to say that outages or delays were not experienced ""when the copper network was in use"". In fact, the copper network is still in use in many of these areas and Telstra reported very similar issues: www.crowdsupport.telstra.com.au/t5/Announcements/Tropical-Cyclone-Debbie-TelstraService-Update/ba-p/664409. As noted above, all network equipment can be subject to damage and disruption from extreme weather events and natural disasters. Accordingly, emergency services agencies recommend that people do not rely on a single form of communication or source of information during an emergency. This also applies to the period when services are being restored. Operators of some telecommunications services are able to offer temporary alternatives to end users. However, in this case offering a temporary nbn service would require an installation of new equipment. It would not be feasible for nbn to provide temporary services to premises in this way in a shorter timeframe than repairing the infrastructure that usually provides the nbn service. However, nbn has provided access to its satellite Road Muster trucks in situations where a concentrated population of end users has been impacted by a network outage (for example Rockhampton in the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie). Health Care (Question No. 748) Ms McGowan asked the Minister for Social Services, in writing, on 13 June 2017: (1) How many Australians now suffer from chronic disease. (2) What (a) number, and (b) proportion, of (i) rural, and (ii) metropolitan, Australians suffer from chronic disease, and how has the Government addressed this disparity in available medical and surgical services. Mr Porter: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) According to self-reporting in the 2014-15 National Health Survey reviewed by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), around 11 million Australians (50 per cent of the population) have one or more prominent chronic conditions (arthritis, asthma, back problems, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or a mental or behavioural condition). The Department of Health has provided input to this answer, as it falls outside my Portfolio responsibilities. (2) According to self-reporting in the 2014-15 National Health Survey, the AIHW has estimated that 3,546,500 Australians, or 54 per cent of those living in regional and remote areas of Australia, have one or more prominent chronic conditions (as outlined above), compared with an estimated 7,890,200 Australians (or 48 per cent) living in major cities. The Australian Government seeks to ensure that access to services for chronic disease patients in rural and remote areas is maintained through programs such as the Rural Health Outreach Fund, which supports increased visiting specialist, general practitioner, nursing, allied and other health services in regional, rural and remote areas of identified need and increases and maintains the skills of rural and remote health professionals in accordance with local need. Additionally, the General Practice Rural Incentives Program (GPRIP) is a component of the Rural Health Workforce Strategy, a 2009-10 Budget measure that provides for a range of initiatives aimed at attracting and retaining medical practitioners in regional and remote areas of Australia, and supports increased delivery of services in rural and remote communities. The GPRIP provides financial incentives to medical practitioners who are providing eligible primary health care services to the communities within eligible regional, rural or remote areas. There are also telehealth services available under the Medicare Benefits Schedule that provide rebates for services provided by metropolitan-based medical specialists to regional and rural locations. The Department of Health has provided input to this answer, as it falls outside my Portfolio responsibilities. Health Care (Question No. 749) Ms McGowan asked the Minister for Social Services, in writing, on 13 June 2017: (1) Has the Government completed modelling on the impact of the rising cost of health care on sufferers of chronic disease; if not, why not. (2) How does the Government provide additional support to sufferers of chronic disease in recognition of these conditions being ongoing and incurable, causing a prolonged detrimental effect upon the sufferer's mental and physical health. Mr Porter: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government funds activities that measure and report on chronic disease in Australia, including the National Health Survey, the Australian Burden of Disease Study, and Longitudinal Studies. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Australian Burden of Disease Study: Impact and causes of illness and death in Australia 2011 measures the level of disability associated with a disease, as well as loss from premature death (www.aihw.gov.au/reports/burden-of-disease/australian-burden-ofdisease-study-impact-and-causes-of-illness-and-death-in-australia-2011/contents/highlights). Further work is ongoing to assess health system expenditure. In order to assess the broader context of health and chronic disease through the life course, the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health investigates factors such as annual out-of-pocket costs, and the characteristics of women who reached the Medical Benefits Schedule safety net including their area of residence, educational status, health care card status, and their ability to manage on income (www.alswh.org.au/publications-and-reports/annual-reports). The Department of Health has provided input to this answer, as it falls outside my Portfolio responsibilities. (2) Through the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, the Commonwealth Government, in partnership with states and territories and following extensive public and targeted consultation, developed the National Strategic Framework for Chronic Conditions (the Framework). The Framework was endorsed by all Health Ministers, through the COAG Health Council, in February 2017 and publicly released in May 2017. The Framework's primary role is to provide high-level guidance to support the planning and development of specific policies, strategies, actions and services so that all Australians may live healthier lives through effective prevention and management of chronic conditions. The Government also provides support for patients with a chronic disease through the Chronic Disease Management (CDM) Medicare items listed in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). These items enable GPs to plan and coordinate the health care of patients with chronic or terminal medical conditions. GPs are able to use Medicare items for GP-managed care planning and/or team-assisted care planning, depending on the health needs of their patients. Once eligible CDM items are in place, patients are able to be referred by their GP for up to five Medicare rebateable allied health services each calendar year. Eligible allied health services are: Aboriginal health work; audiology; diabetes education; chiropractic; dietetics; exercise physiology; mental health work; occupational therapy; osteopathy; physiotherapy; podiatry; psychology; and speech pathology. The Government is also undertaking a stage one trial of the Health Care Home model. The trial seeks to establish a new model of health care for up to 65,000 patients with chronic and complex conditions, in up to 200 general practices and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services that are supported by innovative technology and new payment approaches. These enablers will: support greater team-based care; support patients to improve their health literacy and play a greater role in their health care; and more effectively allocate resources in accordance with need. The trial responds to key recommendations of the final report of the Primary Health Care Advisory Group, chaired by Dr Steve Hambleton, Past President of the Australian Medical Association. The Department of Health has provided input to this answer, as it falls outside my Portfolio responsibilities. Health Care (Question No. 750) Ms McGowan asked the Minister for Social Services, in writing, on 13 June 2017: (1) Has his department undertaken an analysis to assess the greater costs to rural Australians for accessing medical care; if so, (a) what was the Government's response to the findings, and (b) can this response be published. (2) Are the additional costs to rural Australians for accessing medical care taken into account when determining Health Care Card eligibility. (3) Is the level of support and access to medical care determined by location. Mr Porter: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, my department has not undertaken such analysis, as this does not fall within the responsibility of the Social Services Portfolio. (2) Eligibility for a Health Care Card is based on universally applied criteria. (3) The Social Services Portfolio does not have responsibility for determining the level of support and access to medical care. Health Care (Question No. 751) Ms McGowan asked the Minister for Social Services, in writing, on 13 June 2017: (1) Are the partners of people with chronic and serious illness included in the income test for eligibility for the Health Care Card; if so, (a) what is the policy rationale for this, and (b) are there any exemptions; if so, (i) how many Australians are exempt from partner means testing, (ii) on what basis are they exempt, and (iii) what will this cost the Government in 2017-18. (2) Has the Government considered only including the income of the person suffering from chronic and serious illness in the means test for Health Care Card eligibility; if so, what is the estimated cost to the Government of removing partners from the income test, and does this estimation take into account the improved mental and physical health prospects of providing an independent income and therefore, greater autonomy to those with chronic illness. (3) Will the Government acknowledge that means testing (a) Australians suffering from chronic disease as well as their partners creates a work disincentive for both of them, and (b) to include a partner's income adds significant burden to relationships already stressed by ill health. Mr Porter: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The social security income test for a health care card uses the gross income of both partners of a couple. (a) This is based on the principle that couples are able to pool their resources for their mutual benefit. Taking into account the combined gross income and assets of both partners ensures that partnered couples with similar combined levels of resources receive similar support from the social security system. (b) There are no exemptions for special circumstances from the social security income test for health care card. (2) No. (3) (a) Means testing is designed to target income support payments to those who need it the most and to encourage recipients to supplement their payments with employment income. (b) Taking account of the income available to both partners in a relationship is the fairest way to assess the relative financial needs of members of a couple. Health Care (Question No. 752) Ms McGowan asked the Minister for Social Services, in writing, on 13 June 2017: What appeal mechanisms are available to those whose health is being negatively impacted by the ongoing costs of living with chronic disease but who do not qualify for a Health Care Card. Mr Porter: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A person who is not satisfied with a decision made by the Department of Human Services may lodge an appeal for a review. The process includes asking for a full and detailed explanation of the decision and, where they are not satisfied, they may request an internal review by an Authorised Review Officer. If the person is still not satisfied, an appeal can be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for a review of the decision. There are two levels of review at the AAT; if the outcome of the review at AAT1 is not to the person's satisfaction, a further appeal may be made within 28 days to AAT2 for another review. The person can also appeal to the Federal Court, if they are not satisfied with a decision at AAT2. The review system is designed to ensure correct decisions are made in accordance with legislation. Age Pension (Question No. 782) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 8 August 2017: (1) For each month in 2016-17, what was the average number of days taken for an age pension application to be processed to completion? (2) What are the remaining inconsistencies in Centrelink's automated debt raising and recovery system and what steps are being taken to address these inconsistencies? (3) What was his response to recommendations 1 to 8 of the Commonwealth Ombudsman report Centrelink's automated debt raising and recovery system (April 2017). (4) What supports are currently available to the most vulnerable Australians to navigate the Centrelink debt raising and recovery system. Mr Tudge: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A suite of changes have been implemented which are speeding up the Age Pension claim process, making it quicker and easier for older Australians. The improvements have reduced processing time by several weeks for most claims submitted online from August 2017. These include:  Changes to the processing of Age Pension claims, reducing the number of steps required.  The online claim for Age Pension has been overhauled to give a better user experience, making it easier to claim online.  The Department of Human Services' (the Department's) webpages regarding the Age Pension have been improved to provide clearer advice on eligibility, including the requirements regarding age, income, and assets. Of the Age Pension claims assessed in 2015-16 more than 10 per cent were rejected as the claims lacked crucial information. The new online claim will help ensure more claims contain all the information needed to be processed quickly.

(4) Vulnerable people have always been a priority. As acknowledged by the Ombudsman, the fully automated system was never intended to, nor will it be, rolled out to vulnerable recipients. Standard practice is to make outbound calls to vulnerable people to assist them to meet their compliance obligations. The Department offers to review debts and negotiate repayment arrangements for any person taking into account their individual circumstances. Defence Industry (Question No. 789) Mr Marles asked the Minister for Defence Industry, in writing, on 10 August 2017: In respect of competitive tenders for Project AIR 7003: (a) why did the department bring forward the due date from November to August 2017, (b) what is the anticipated impact of this change on competition for the tender, and (c) can the department demonstrate that it has done a comparative analysis to include (i) capability, (ii) Australian Industry Content, and (iii) best value to evaluate all systems and proposals provided. Mr Pyne: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: a. The evaluation process is ongoing for AIR 7003. b. N/A. c. Defence utilises a risk based decision support process called 'Smart Buyer' to develop capability acquisition strategies. The Government is committed to ensuring that all capability options are properly assessed when considering capital acquisition projects, to deliver the best value for money across the capability life cycle. As with any materiel acquisition $20 million and above, the project will include an Australian Industry Capability Plan as a contract deliverable. Medical Costs (Question No. 805) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 4 September 2017: Can he detail any current or future plans to provide public funding for transcranial magnetic stimulation, a treatment for major depressive disorder. Mr Hunt: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In order for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of major depressive disorder to become available on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), it would need to be assessed and recommended by the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). MSAC is an independent, expert committee that advises the Australian Government on whether a medical service should be publicly funded based on an assessment of its comparative safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. rTMS was considered by MSAC in 2008 (Application 1101) and 2014 (Application 1196), and both times MSAC advised the Government it did not recommend public funding. In its more recent consideration, MSAC did not recommend public funding because of uncertain clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness due to insufficient comparative data in treatment-resistant patients against current antidepressant treatments and uncertain costs. MSAC considered that any reapplication should include: better definition of the patient population; better definition of the clinical setting for this treatment; evidence comparing rTMS against contemporary alternative antidepressants in this patient population; and further consideration of the treatment costs of anti-depressants. Further information can be found by searching for 'Application 1196' on the MSAC website: www.msac.gov.au. To date, no further submissions have been made to the Department of Health or to MSAC regarding rTMS. National Broadband Network (Question No. 809) Mrs Elliot asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, in writing, on 04 September 2017: In respect of the NBN rollout on the North Coast NSW, (a) why has the timetable for completion been delayed, (b) why have 15,000 premises in Ballina had their completion date pushed back to 2019, (c) why have 7,500 businesses and residential premises in Kingscliff been told that completion will be delayed to 2018, (d) why may people living in (i) Mullumbimby, (ii) Brunswick Heads, (iii) New Brighton, and (iv) South Golden Beach, have to wait until the end of 2018, and (e) will the Minister commit to fast tracking the rollout in the electoral division of Richmond. Mr Fletcher: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a)-(d): NBN Co. Limited (nbn) uses an iterative network planning process to determine the technologies and timeframes for the rollout and this plan is continually optimised as the rollout progresses. This means that timeframes for individual areas can change, in order to ensure the overall rollout is completed as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. (e): The Government has committed to rolling out the network to all Australians as soon as possible and has fast-tracked the rollout through moving to a multi-technology mix. It is important to understand nbn is building and operating the network on a commercial basis at arm's length from Government, in line with the Statement of Expectations of 24 August 2016. Day-today technology selection and network design are matters for nbn. In addition to this, nbn's plans and rollout boundaries are based on its own network planning, which does not consider electorate boundaries. nbn will continue to complete the rollout nationally as quickly and efficiently as possible. National Broadband Network (Question No. 810) Mrs Elliot asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, in writing, on 4 September 2017: In respect of the Prime Minister's election promise that every Australian would have access to the NBN by 2016, (a) why has the rollout in regional and rural areas, including in the electoral division of Richmond, been delayed by up to three years, (b) why will over 30,000 premises in the electoral division of Richmond not have access to the NBN for more than two years, (c) why are there delays in regional and rural Australia, and (d) what measures is the Minister taking to address these delays. Mr Fletcher: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government has put the National Broadband Network (NBN) on track to provide high-speed broadband services to every home and business in Australia by 2020. This is much quicker than would have been the case under the previous Government. The Strategic Review released just a few months after the September 2013 election showed that the project was in a fundamentally worse position than the previous Government had at any time disclosed to Parliament or the Australian public. Three years into the rollout it was two years behind schedule. At that time the then Shareholder Ministers for NBN Co Limited (nbn) advised that the accumulated delays and state of the nbn company meant the Government's aim of ensuring nationwide access to fast broadband by 2016 could not be achieved. (a) Rollout in regional and rural areas has not been delayed. By7 September this year, 81 per cent of homes and businesses outside major urban areas were in ready for service areas. The rollout to homes and businesses to be served by fixed wireless and satellite is particularly advanced, with over three-quarters of premises to be served by fixed wireless now able to order services and all premises eligible for satellite across the country able to connect to Sky Muster satellite services since April 2016. (b) It is not correct that there will be 30,000 premises awaiting NBN access in the electorate of Richmond in two years' time. As at 7 September 2017, just under 37,000 homes and businesses, were already able to access services in the electorate. By the end of 2018 just over 21,000 additional premises are expected to be in ready for service areas with the remaining premises (fewer than 8,000 homes and businesses) mainly expected to be able to order services during the first half of 2019. This means that almost all premises in the electorate of Richmond will be able to connect to an NBN service by the middle of 2019. (c) As noted above, rollout is progressing very well in regional Australia. Naturally there are some changes in timing as nbn coordinates the massive logistics involved in a project of this size. Since earlier this year, nbn has been advising when locations can expect to be able to order services. Prior to that, the company had been advising when network construction would commence. There is an intrinsic time gap between these two points as in most cases network construction begins well before services will become available. (d) The Government has already taken prudent steps to allow the network to be rolled out as quickly as possible. This has included giving nbn flexibility in network design, installing a highly experienced board and management team and providing ongoing funding through a loan to allow the company to focus on the rollout at this point in network construction. Road Safety (Question No. 813) Ms Keay asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 5 September 2017: In respect of the Bass Highway intersections at Leith in North West Tasmania, at Short Street and at Braddons Lookout Road, has he received any representations from the Tasmanian Government for work on these intersections to address local road safety issues and, if so, (a) when were those representations received and (b) what form did they take. Mr Chester: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Tasmanian Government provides the Federal Government with updates on roads across the state regularly and through a variety of channels. Visas (Question No. 816) Mr Hill asked the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, in writing, on 12 September 2017: In respect of the Temporary Work (Short Stay Specialist) visa (subclass 400): (1) Does his department publish statistical information about the subclass 400 visa, including the number of visas granted each quarter (by State and by Occupation) and the number of visa holders in Australia each quarter (by State and by Occupation), if so, where can this be found and if not, why not.

(9) What are the precise data/fields which are (a) collected in applications for subclass 400 visas, (b) stored in his department' s systems, and (c) searchable in his department' s systems. (10) Did his department issue any subclass 400 visas in respect of Ships Engineers, Ships Masters and Ships Officers prior to 18th April 2017and if so, how many in each classification. (11) What procedures did his department follow to determine whether the work of these Ships Engineers, Ships Masters and Ships Officers is Highly Specialised Work for the purposes of the Migration Regulations, and did his department (a) consult with any other State, Territory or Federal Government bodies about the nature of the work to be performed by the Ships Engineers, Ships Masters and Ships Officers, and (b) consult with or seek the views of any external bodies. (12) What steps has his department taken to ensure that when issuing subclass 400 visas to Ships Engineers, Ships Masters and Ships Officers, such skills are not readily available in Australia, and that such visas will not have adverse consequences for employment or training opportunities for Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents. (13) Are subclass 400 visa approvals only available in occupations that are on a recognised skills shortage list. (14) Does Ship' s Engineer (classification ANZCO 231212) fall within ANZSCO Major Groups 1-3. (15) Does Ship' s Master (ANZCO 231213) fall within ANZSCO Major Groups 1-3. (16) Does Ship' s Officer (ANZCO 231214) fall within ANZSCO Major Groups 1-3. (17) Has his department contacted any of the Ships Engineers, Ships Masters and Ships Officers, whose contact details it has, and who are unemployed and ready willing and able to work in the maritime industry, and has his department contacted the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to seek advice about the Ships Engineers, specifically the qualifications of these Certified Officers. (18) What advice has AMSA provided to his department about the qualifications required for working as Chief Engineer or First Engineer on vessels working in Australian waters. (19) What steps does his department take, if any, to check the answers provided by applicants for subclass 400 visas, particularly in respect of questions about character and background, including questions about criminal record and security issues. (20) Is he or his department aware that on the offshore support vessel ' Southern Ocean' owned by Oceanteam Bourbon4 AS and managed by North Sea Shipping AS (both Norwegian companies), non-Australian Engineer Officers who have held subclass 457 visas are now seeking subclass 400 visas in order to continue working in Australian waters. (21) Is the subclass 400 visa intended to be a long-term work visa. (22) Is it appropriate for the subclass 400 visa to be used to replace and extend a subclass 457 visa when the 457 visa has expired. (23) Are subclass 400 visas being used as a substitute for 457 visas now that the 457 visa is not available for Ships Engineers, Ships Masters and Ships Officers. (24) Is he aware that the department has been provided with the names and details of unemployed Australian Engineer Officers who hold the necessary qualifications to fill all Engineer Officer positions on vessels including Offshore Support Vessels such as ' Southern Ocean' . (25) Is he aware of applications for subclass 400 visas from persons employed by Programmed Marine Engineering to work on the vessel POSH Arcadia (a Bahamas Flagged vessel contracted to work off WA until late 2017 associated with the commissioning of Shell' s LNG plant). (26) How many subclass 400 visas have been issued for personnel to work for ProgrammedMarine Engineering on the POSH Arcadia, and which countries are the workers from. (27) What positions on board the POSH Arcadia vessel will be filled by the personnel issued with subclass 400 visas. (28) Do these circumstances result in an adverse impact on Australian employment opportunities for Australian Deck and Engineer Officers. (29) What instructions has he given to the department about the subclass 400 visa in the last 12 months. (3) Has he provided any direction to the department to restrict the issuing of subclass 400 visas for Marine Engineer Officers, Masters and Ships Officers as long as there are unemployed Australian personnel available to do such work. Mr Dutton: The answer to the honourable member' s question is: Question1 Response No. The Department administers over 99 different visa types and publishing details on all subclasses is not practicable. Question2 Response No. The information collected by the Department as part of visa applications reflect the different requirements of each visa.

Energy (Question No. 817) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for the Environment and Energy, in writing, on 13 September 2017: (1) Why is Australia the only member country of the International Energy Agency not in compliance with the 90-day fuel supply stockholding obligation. (2) Will the 'ticketing' arrangement envisaged in the original Liquid Fuel Emergency Amendment Bill 2017 result in any additional holding of physical fuel stock within Australia, if so, (a) how many days of physical fuel stocks will Australia have, and (b) what are the calculated delivery delays from the various sources for fuel provided under the ticketing system. (3) Given current global instability and the possibility of a nuclear confrontation between North Korea and the United States, escalating conflict over the South China Sea, and continuing international terrorism, on what basis does the Government believe that reaching 90-day fuel reserve compliance by 2027 is an adequate timetable. (4) What is the detailed timetable for reaching full 90-day fuel reserve compliance. (5) What plans are there to establish in-country storage facilities for each state and territory. (6) What arrangements exist between the federal and state governments to manage a sudden fuel shortage emergency. (7) Is there a public information strategy on how to advise, if necessary, when and how fuel rationing would occur. Mr Frydenberg: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 90-day obligation requires International Energy Agency (IEA) members to hold 90-days' worth of oil based on the previous year's net imports. Australia has historically relied on commercial stock levels to meet the obligation. Increased demand for liquid fuels and declining domestic production in recent years has resulted in an increase in net imports. This means that the amount Australia is required to hold has increased. The compliance gap has not been caused by a change in our commercial stock levels. Australia is currently the only non-compliant member, however, other IEA members have also been non-compliant from time-to-time. (2) The ticketing arrangement envisaged in the Liquid Fuel Emergency Amendment Act 2017 (the amendment Act) under section 40A would permit additional oil stock to be held in Australia if an onshore ticketing contract was successful through the procurement process. Until the ticketing procurement is undertaken, it cannot be determined if, or how many days' worth of, additional stocks would be held physically in Australia. Delivery times to Australia of offshore held stock will also depend on the procurement process outcome. (3) The first (pilot) phase of Australia's compliance plan is underway. This will allow Australia to meet its obligation to contribute in the event the IEA calls for an international response to a severe global oil supply disruption. The 400 kilotonnes to be purchased in Phase One is equivalent to five days under the IEA obligation and provides us with twice the amount that the IEA has previously requested Australia release in response to a severe global oil supply disruption. The 2026 date will give the Australian Government the time to properly assess the outcomes from Phase One to determine the most effective and least cost approach to return to full compliance by 2026 under Phase Two. (4) Phase One of the Government's two-phase plan to return to compliance is underway. Mandatory petroleum statistics reporting for businesses will commence on 1 January 2018 under the new Petroleum and Other Fuels Reporting Act 2017. The Liquid Fuel Emergency Amendment Act 2017 now provides the Australian Government with legislative authority to purchase oil stock tickets. A procurement process is being developed to allow an initial 400 kilotonnes of oil stock tickets to be purchased in the financial years 2018-19 and 2019-20. Phase Two of the compliance plan will incorporate a long-term, sustainable and least-cost approach to returning to compliance by 2026. As it will be informed by an evaluation of Phase One outcomes and subject to Government decision, a detailed timeline is not yet feasible. (5) At this time, the Australian Government does not have plans to establish in-country storage facilities for each state and territory. The Australian Government cannot comment on the oil storage policy of the state and territory governments. (6) Arrangements are in place for the management of a sudden fuel shortage which vary depending on the nature and severity of emergency. In the first instance, a market response would be sought to any fuel supply disruption. Australia's liquid fuel supply chains have shown over time to be robust and flexible in response to supply disruptions. The primary principle underlying all Australian energy supply emergency responses is for government to only intervene in market operation as a last resort. Should government intervention be required, Australia's state and territory governments have constitutional responsibility for planning and co-ordinating the response to fuel shortages within their territorial boundaries and so manage fuel shortages of a jurisdictional scale under jurisdictional specific arrangements. In the event of an actual or likely fuel shortage with national implications, the Australian Government has primary responsibility for response, with powers to control the refining, distribution and use of liquid fuels in a declared national liquid fuel emergency through the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984. In 2006, an Inter-Governmental Agreement between federal and state/territories governments was signed which sets out parameters for a co-operative response in a national emergency. A National Liquid Fuel Emergency Response Plan and supporting documents have been developed to describe these arrangements. In the event of a major emergency, the National Oil Supplies Emergency Committee operates to support the management of widespread liquid fuel shortages. The Committee comprises Australian Government, state and territory governments and fuel supply industry representatives. (7) Arrangements for fuel rationing vary depending on the nature and severity of emergency, where the Australian Government is only involved in managing emergencies of a national scale. In the event of a declared national liquid fuel emergency, the National Liquid Fuel Emergency Response Plan provides states, territories and industry with guidance on when and how fuel rationing under the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984 would occur.

Aged Care (Question No. 824) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Aged Care, in writing, on 14 September 2017: In respect of My Aged Care home care packages: (1) Can he provide detail on the average waiting time (a) on the national priority queue for a home care package, and (b) for residents of the electorate of Mayo. (2) Are applicants for a home care package notified that there is a national priority queue and that they will have to wait for their application to proceed, and if so, are applicants advised of their expected waiting time. (3) What steps is the Government taking to reduce waiting times, especially for applicants deemed as a high priority. Mr Wyatt: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1. (a) The average wait time is not available. (b) The average wait time is not available for residents of the electorate of Mayo. 2. Yes. Clients not yet approved for home care can view general information on maximum expected wait times on www.myagedcare.gov.au. During the assessment process for a home care package the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) will explain the approval and queue process to the client and provide a hard copy of the Your Guide to home care package services for reference after the assessment process. Once approved, clients can check their individual expected wait time for a home care package by calling the My Aged Care contact centre or via the My Aged Care client portal. 3. The Australian Government is taking steps to reduce waiting times for all people approved for a home care package. Due to the evidence provided by the first Home Care Packages Program Data Report 27 February– 30 June 2017, which showed strong demand for higher level packages, the Government immediately responded by releasing an additional 6,000 level 3 and 4 home care packages. This was done by converting some low level (1 and 2) packages in to the higher level (3 and 4) packages. Palestine (Question No. 827) Ms Rebekha Sharkie: asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 14 September 2017: In respect of concerns regarding the treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli military, as identified in reports from UNICEF and Military Court Watch, including that most children do not have parents or legal counsel present during interrogation; 75 per cent report physical violence; a quarter are made to sign a statement in a language they do not understand; and up to 60 per cent are transferred into Israel, restricting the access of family members: (1) What representations, if any, has the Australian Government made to the Government of Israel on these issues since November 2016. (2) Is the Government aware of any substantive improvement over the last twelve months to the conditions that Palestinian children face in military custody.

Beverages (Question No. 843) Ms Sharkie asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 23 October 2017: (1) Why is cider prepared from the juice or must of fruits other than apples and pears not included in the definition of cider under Standard 2.7.3 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. (2) Why is raspberry, blackberry and blueberry cider currently classified as other excisable beverage not exceeding 10 per cent by volume of alcohol under the Excise Tariff Act 1921 when cider is included in the definition of 'wine' under the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 (thereby, not attracting excise duty). (3) Will the Minister consider including cider prepared from the juice or must of fruits other than apples and pears (such as raspberries, blackberries and blueberries) as a class of beverage exempt from excise duty under the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999; if not, why not. Mr Hunt: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1) During the development of Standard 2.7.3 in the joint Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code) there was support for separate definitions for cider and fruit wine. An expert advisory group was set up to assist Food Standards Australia New Zealand develop Standard 2.7.3. The fruit wine industry representative on this group advised that as there are strong consumer expectations for traditional alcoholic beverages like cider, definitions for both cider and fruit wine were needed. The definitions for cider and fruit wine were further supported during public consultation for the development of Standard 2.7.3 and have been in the Code since its gazettal in 2000.
