Can the Minister give the House any information regarding the progress made in providing additional accommodation for the mentally diseased out of the £10,000,000 granted last year-eithe r what is being done immediately or what is being planned by the States? . House will remember that last year a bill was passed to provide for the expenditure of £10,000,000 by the Commonwealth on tbe basis of £ 1 by the Commonwealth for every £2 expended by the States on improving conditions at mental hospitals. All the States have now submitted programmes for the current financial year, amounting to a total of about £3,750,000. Tliese have heen approved by the Commonwealth, which will, of course, be responsible for one-third of this expenditure, and work is now proceeding on this scale. is directed to the Treasurer, in the absence of the Prime Minister. By way of preface, with the construction of the Adaminaby Dam, the township of Adaminaby will be inundated, and the site of the new township has already been chosen. Is the Treasurer aware that the Snowy Mountains Shire Council has unanimously passed a resolution that the name of the new township should be changed, and that the new township should be named Chifley in honour of the man who was Prime Minister and Treasurer at the time when the Snowy Mountains scheme was established? As that is the unanimous wish of the shire council of the area, will the Treasurer interest himself in the matter so that, through the Snowy Mountains Authority, the views of the residents of the township may be ascertained as soon as possible? is an emphatic "" Yes "". NEW REGIONAL BROADCASTING General tell us when the proposed national regional station at Albany, and what will be the frequency on which it will operate? not in a position to give the honourable member complete advice regarding this matter, on which he has been inquiring for several days.

If so, is it intended to provide substitute drugs? question of what drugs should be provided under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is decided hy an expert committee appointed to advise the Government in this matter. Drugs are either placed on or taken from the list in accordance with the advice tendered by the committee. 1 am sure the honorahle gentleman will agree that there is no other suitable method for providing drugs under the scheme. This is a very expert committee. He can be assured that, when drugs are removed from the list, adequate substitutes always remain on it.

10,Mr Howse,"My question iswave broadcasts, particularly to countries outside Australia, have been going on for a number of years. Special efforts have been made in recent times, perhaps during the last year or so, to improve, if I may use the honourable gentleman's own words, the quality and quantity of the programmes. The service is, of course, primarily an entertainment service, but it contains a good deal of information by way of news and comment on the news. The Postmaster-General's Department, through the Australian Broadcasting Commission, is primarily responsible for the service, but the Department of External Affairs co-operates actively in respect of all matters that have what might be said to be a political content. At present, there are broadcasts in English, French, Indonesian and Thai. Quite shortly, there will be broadcasts in Mandarin Chinese. The number of hours occupied by broadcasts to each of the relevant countries is being increased constantly. At the present time, the Government is in the course of substantially doubling the transmitting equipment available to Radio Australia. It is a popular service, which is well received in all the countries to which it is directed. That is shown by the fact that, in a world-wide census taken during the last week or two to ascertain the popularity of various shortwave broadcasting services, Radio Australia came first, quite easily. Ten other short-wave broadcasting services throughout the world occupied various positions below that. I think the Australian Government, and perhaps the Australian Broadcasting Commission in particular, have considerable cause for satisfaction with the fact that this relatively young Australian broadcasting service has achieved such a high place among the broadcasting services of the world. tion to the Minister for Supply. Isi t a fact that 90 per cent, of the world's production of rutile is taking place in Australia? Is it also a fact that rutile is a base mineral used in the production of titanium, the world's lightest, strongest and most heat-resisting material? Is it true that titanium for use in jet aircraft production is at a premium, and that, within a few years the metal will he of inestimable value in other fields of industry? What action has the Government taken to protect British Commonwealth industries from possible exploitation and discrimination by foreign manufacturers in the sale and distribution of titanium? ls the Government satisfied that Australian producers are receiving the best prices for their mineral? Is it the intention of the Government to assist this vital young industry financially by setting up in this country a treatment and rolling plant, thus enabling us to earn muchwanted dollars in the world's markets? Or are we to be suhject to the exploitation of foreign manufacturers for all time so far as titanium is concerned? honourable member really does not expect, me to be able to answer all those questions immediately, but I can tell him that titanium is produced in Australia from beach sands on the east coast of Australia north of Newcastle and also in certain parts of Western Australia. I am also able to tell him that titanium is an important modern metal used in aircraft production. If the honourable member will place the remainder of his question oil the notice-paper, I shall answer it in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for National Development, who knov, s a great deal about this matter. for External Affairs say anything useful about the recently concluded conference between the Dutch and the Indonesians? started at The Hague, in December, concluded at Geneva earlier this montb. It was an attempt to find solutions to a number of outstanding questions between the two countries. Before the conference commenced, it was agreed that each country should maintain its attitude towards the sovereignty of Western .New Guinea. Unfortunately, after a very long series of meetings, no definite agreement was reached between the two countries although, in a joint communique issued at the conclusion of the conference, both countries expressed satisfaction with the fact that a great deal of ground had been",11,Pharmaceutical Benefits

Tliere is not very mucli more to say about the matter, but the press has reported-the information havingcome from the Indonesian Indonesian Union has been dissolved. W«. have not any definite information on that, matter. As honourable gentlemen, I am sure, are aware, that union has been the subject of considerable what may be called dialectic dispute over the last several years, and I should not be surprised to le&rn that, unfortunately, the press report was true. If I may be permitted to express a personal opinion, I tliink it was a good thing that the conference was held, even although no particularly definite situations were arrived at by agreement between the two countries. for External Affairs a question arising from his answer to the last question. In view of the direct interest of Australia in tion to the Minister for Labour and the relationship of Indonesia, Holland and New Guinea, does the Minister or the fiovernment propose to take up the matter afresh, or has the Government any policy other than looking on at what is taking place ? mi policy may not he asked at this stage. Mr Speaker, I should like to reply without going into matters of policy. The Australian attitude on the subject, which is clearly in the mind of the right honorof the shipowners and the Waterside able gentleman, is well known, and no alteration has been made to it. I think 1 can say without boasting that I have not been inactive on behalf of the Government in relation to this matter in hoth New York and Djakarta, where I spent a considerable number of days about four months ago in intimate discussion with His Excellency Mr Anak Agung, the Toreign Minister of Indonesia. We reached agreement on a joint statement, which T should like to believe expressed the policy, not only of the Australian Government, but also of Australia generally. Our attitude towards Indonesia is an outstanding desire for the best possible relations with that country, and I think that, as a government, principally through the Colombo plan, we have given material evidence of our desire to live on the best possible terms with our nearest neighbour, Indonesia. I think that progress towards a solution of a matter that is in such acute dispute as this would end that the Dutchnot be advanced by any public discussion of the matters that the Indonesian Foreign Minister canvassed in our many hours of meetings only a very few months ago. The Australian attitude is clear. We are not a principal party but we are a very interested third party, and I think I can assure the House that we have attempted to discuss this question with both sides in directions that we believe will be conducive to continued peace in this part of the world. I again repeat the point that the Australian attitude on these subjects has not changed at all. National ServiceI refer to the continuing strike by waterside workers at Gladstone, where the men are refusing to work until their demands, made last November, are met. As this strike is causing unemployment and distress to meat-workers and others in the district, I ask the Minister whether he has been ablefcoarrange a conference between the dissenting parties in an endeavour to end the present deadlock. advised that a meeting of representatives Workers Federation of Australia will be held to-morrow. I think that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board's representative will also he present. That meeting was to have been held at 2.30 p.m. to-day, hut I gather that it was postponed because of some indisposition on the part of Mr Healy, the general secretary of .the federation. If I can gain any further information in respect of the matter I shall do so and let the honourable member have it. r Minister for Air a question relative to the fact that ten or twelve clays ago a small Wackett aircraft, which was flying from Casino to Tenterfield, was lost, and",12,Indonesia

I am pleased in its net profit for the 1954 season was one way, and grieved in another, to £223,000. inform the House that the wreckage of the aircraft has been found. Shortly before lunch to-day an aero club aircraft from South Grafton, flown by an instructor, Mr Hayter, located the wreck about 15 miles north-east of Tenterfield, follows: Is the Government negotiating and was able to fly low and identify to sell this splendid, profitable people's scattered parts of the aircraft.

It is true that the aircraft carried it called for tenders for the disposal of three passengers when it took off, but I this asset? Finally, will the Government do not think it would be proper for me make available to this House a compreat this stage to express an opinion as to hensive statement relating to the history whether or not it was overloaded, at the of the station, its capital value to-day, beginning of this tragic flight.

To that extent, the Australian Whaling Commission's activities have served the purposes which the Government believes are desirable and useful. the Government intends to sell it. tion is that the Minister is entirely entitled to decide what answer he will give. Honourable memhers have considerable latitude in asking questions, and the honorahle member for Lalor has used that latitude to the full extent. It is a matter for the Minister, to decide what the answer will he. inform us whether the Commonwealth Bank or the Commonwealth Trading Bank is refusing further advances for the purchase of motor cars? If this is the position, does he not appreciate the fact that this policy is just driving very highly profitable financial business into the hands of private financial institutions? I should like to ask him, if he has not given full consideration to this matter, and if the facts are as I have slated, whether he will take action to ensure that when people are able to get money from other institutions, the Oommonwealth Bank will not restrict its advances in that way and give undue profit to those private institutions. honourable member will no doubt recollect that last September the Prime Minister had a conference with the trading banks, the central bank and other institutions regarding Australia's financial position in general, and hire-purchase finance in particular. A mutually satisfactory arrangement was arrived at between the central bank and the trading banks. The trading banks, whose advances had heen expanded to such an extent as to endanger the economy, agreed to a policy which involved the curtailment of advances. This Government's policy is not to interfere with, or direct-eve n if it could-the trading banks. It does not wish to determine to whom the banks shall make advances, or what the extent of those advances should he. It merely wishes to direct the general policy to be followed in deciding the nature of advances and the priorities to be observed in the interests of the stabilization of the general banking economy.

Minister for Defence) -by leave I feel it appropriate to inform the House of instructions that ai'e being issued to the United Kingdom forces concerning the conduct of prisoners of war after capture. This matter has been the subject of study for some eighteen months by a special committee in the United Kingdom on which the Australian services were represented. Other Commonwealth countries were also represented on the committee. The general conclusions of the special committee are supported by the Australian defence and service authorities. The House is no doubt aware that the rules for the treatment of prisoners of war by civilized nations are laid down in the Geneva Prisoners of War Convention of 1949. In ratifying that convention the Russian Government made a reservation to the effect that the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics would not feel bound to extend its benefits to prisoners of war convicted under the law of the detaining power of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The potential effect of this reservation is illustrated by the Chinese contention in the Korean operations that all prisoners of war were, by the very act of having waged war against them, war criminals. It has heen decided that members of the forces shall be instructed that if they are taken prisoner in any future operations, that they can be required under the terms of the Geneva Convention only to furnish to their captors their name, rank, number, and date of birth. Experience has shown that any relaxation of this rule can result only in the divulgence by prisoners of war of information useful to the enemy. A t the same time, members of the forces will be given knowledge of the conditions they may meet if taken prisoner, and the aim will be to strengthen, by various training and administrative methods, those military .qualities which support a fighting man in the stresses of combat conditions and sustain him if he becomes a prisoner of war. These principles will apply in the Australian forces. The problem has also been examined by the authorities of the United States of America, whose decisions were announced in August, 1955. The views of Britain and the United States are in very close agreement and the code of conduct of prisoners of war in their respective forces will now to all intents and purposes he identical. The United Kingdom Government considers that the only satisfactory solution of this problem would be for all nations to observe the code of conduct towards prisoners of war embodied in the 1949 Geneva Prisoners of War Convention. The Australian Government shares this view. I have been informed that the United Kingdom Minister for Defence is to make a parallel statement in the House of Commons to-day.

65,Sir Philip Mcbride (Wakefield,,19,Arthur Fadden
66,Debate (On Motion Hy Mr Chambers),"pleased that the Government in its discretion has allowed further time to the House to debate this measure. A bill affecting the size of the Ministry is clearly one of quite considerable importance. It concerns the House in many respects very intimately and it should be adequately considered. I must confess I say this in a friendly maimer-that I was surprised last night at the attitude of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden)_ and the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) ancl their tactics, which some of us on this side of the House felt, at first blush at any rate, were unfair in principle to members who have come here to deliberate and not to be stampeded, especially on the first night of the new Parliament. Therefore, along with my friends, the lionorable member for Farrer( Mr let me say without further ado that 1 Pairbairn) and the lionorable inember for Franklin( Mr Falkinder), I pressed for the adjournment of the debate. But let me emphasize, before I go any farther, that our difference with the Government was a very transient one, because it was confined specifically to a point of procedure, and I hope that no honourable inember or no body of opinion outside will misconstrue this attitude or try to read into it an interpretation which most certainly is not there. I venture to say that honourable members on all sides of thc House may possibly agree that it will be an unhappy augury for the Twenty-second Parliament if members generally are to he treated with a disregard of their individual rights. approval from the Opposition, but let me remind honourable members opposite that, when they were in power, to my knowledge they were far more guilty in this respect than this Government bas been. That is established hy the records, and I think that outside the House it. is accepted by common consent. On this matter, which, of course, is of supreme importance in the institution of Parliament, I should like to say that in my experience in the six years I have sat in this House this Parliament appears to he more machine-hound, whichever side of politics is in office, than any other legislature of which I am aware. It is certainly far more party-bound than are the State parliaments of which I have some knowledge, certainly far more than the Parliament of South Australia, and less liberty is given to members than exists in the British House of Commons. So my plea on this procedural matter, which is confined not only to this bill but also to all future matters before the Parliament, is that I hope, whether my own side of politics is in office or whether, in a future which is so distant that we cannot foresee, the evil occasion arises when honourable members opposite come into power, that more latitude will be given to members of this House. If it is not given, then Parliament as an institution will suffer and it will lose very seriously in its main purpose. Now let me come to the bill itself, and support it warmly and whole-heartedly. I listened with interest to the criticisms of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and one or two other lionorable members last night, and, if I may say so, I thought that they appeared to be superficial and purely of a. debating character. After all, the criterion of any administration surely lies in its efficiency. So long as the numbers of a ministry are reasonable, there should surely he no substantial criticism of their increase. It is quite conceivable that in a crisis, such as a war or a very grave economic depression, imposing unexpected and heavy duties on the government of the day, the Ministry might have to be extended even further than the present total of 22. Nor should honourable members, I submit, cavil at what, in terms of the national budget, is a very slight increase in cost. Surely it is the falsest of economies to underpay men such as Ministers with the undoubtedly heavy responsibility they have cast upon their shoulders. One has only tn compare the emoluments accorded to Ministers of State in this Parliament with those drawn by leaders of commerce ancl in business, and compare the responsibilities, on the one hand, of servants of the Queen and the nation with, on the other hand, the servants of purely private enterprise, to see in relation thereto how very much at a disadvantage are Ministers in this place.

Let us have a look at the facts surroundthe affairs of the country were directed ing the measure. Before the last Parliament closed its doors last year, we heard read in this chamber a statement on the economic condition of the nation. It was a most lucid statement. The phraseology was excellent and the figures were very informative. But, regarded from the point of view of a statement to indicate that something was to be done to remove the threat of continuing inflation and l i ft from the shoulders of the people the burden of ever-increasing prices, it was utterly barren. The statement indicated that there was a dangerous inflationary trend in Australia. It informed the people that the essential requirements were more work, more production, a reduced demand for imports from other countries and, consequently, under certain circumstances, a reduction of the standard of living of our people. ""We were told that the Government had called into conference the great banking magnates of this country-the heads of the private banks and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. ""We were told that the Government had made an appeal to the great captains of finance in this country to tighten the screw, to discourage the tendency to borrow too much money or be too extravagant and demand from a limited production more than the economy could stand. ""We were told that the Government had called into a conference the magnates who direct the hire-purchase organizations and loosen up credit. We were told' that they had been appealed to able memher is getting a long way away from the bill. to the point. We were told all those things. The theme was. ""More work, more production, less money ancl everything in the garden will be rosy"". But what do we find now? I propose to make a brief historical survey of the situation that preceded the present situation. I suggest that that is relevant to the question whether there is any justification for the appointment of more Cabinet Ministers. The most difficult governmental period, if I may so describe it, in thc history of this country was from 1939 to 1949. For most of those ten long years by a Labour administration, consisting of nineteen Ministers. At no other time in our history were the burdens of office of so great a magnitude. During a period of war there are thrust upon this Parliament, in effect, practically all the powers that are normally exercised by the State parliaments. Consequently, those nineteen Ministers laboured long and arduously. From the outbreak of war till the end of 1941 there was an anti-Labour administration. Then for eight long years a Labour administration was in power. We managed to do the job, although the volume of work was enormous. But something else was done. Under that Labour administration, the Parliament sat each year for double the time that it has sat under succeeding administrations. That indicates, not only that nineteen Labour Ministers were able to handle the administrative requirements of the country, although the volume of work had doubled, but also that they were good enough to see to it that the Parliament met eaca year for at least double the time thai it has met since Labour went out of office. Everybody knows that when a government shuts down the Parliament the burdens of the respective Ministers are substantially lightened and that their toil is not so arduous as when the Parliament is sitting. Let me refer briefly to the first four or five years after 1945. The situation that then existed required the minute attention of every member of the Cabinet. The vast ramifications of post-war reconstruction, the difficulties associated with international trade, and particularly international finance, and the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, required the close attention of Ministers. The volume of work of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, which until recently was administered by the Minister for Trade was handled by one Minister. The volume of work was greater then than it is now, because in the early post-war period it was necessary, not only to reshape, in many ways, the administration of the",21,Opposition Members Hear Hear

72,"( Mr Mcewen), Was Tremendous, Yet It","department, but also, week by week, and month after month, to introduce new legislation into the Parliament. The then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture coped with the reshaping of marketing boards and the preparation of all kinds of legislation. To-day we are in the calmer and more highly organized conditions of a peace-time era, yet this Government which, in the policy speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and in its economic treatise delivered to the last Parliament, called for greater productive effort, now requires 22 Ministers instead of nineteen. At a time when it is demanding more work and greater production from the nation, it proposes to provide, by the appointment of additional Ministers, for less work to be done by individual Ministers. The Prime Minister has told the Australian Loan Council and the country that, to assist Australia to conquer inflation, Commonwealth expenditure is to be reduced by 10 per cent.; hut he now proposes that his Ministers, who are competent in the sense of being experienced administrators-as far as I am concerned, their type of administration is hopelessshall do less work at higher cost. What an example to the nation! This situation has arisen because the Government has been jammed into a corner by a section of the Parliament, to wit the Australian Oountry party, the members of which are interested more in place, pay and portfolios than in the welfare of the primary producers. The pages of the political history of Australia are riddled with examples of the struggle for place and power within tory cabinets by members of this rump party, the Australian Country party. The rumour is abroad that the Minister for Trade occupies No. 2 position in the Cabinet, that shortly he will slip into the Liberal party, and that in due course he will become the Prime Minister of Australia. In other words, if that rumour is correct, he is prepared to sell "" down the river"" the views that he has held since his advent to political life. He has been successively a member of the Victorian Country party and of the Australian Country party, which broke away from the Victorian Country party. He has quarrelled with every viewpoint of the organization to which he belongs and has pushed over everybody who has got in his way so that eventually he might reach the zenith of power in this country. To satisfy that kind of greed, and to make room for more Australian Country party Ministers in the Cabinet, the Government is prepared to sell down the river every policy and principle it has enunciated as a means of placing Australia on an even keel financially. These highly skilled old-school-tie Ministers ou the other side of the House are always telling the electors how much more suited they are for the administration of our public departments, and of the opportunities they have had to study administration, yet, to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth, ten years after the commencement of the peace-time era, they require a greater number than did the hobnail boot gang of the Australian Labour party, as they were once called by the opponents of Labour in the early days of federation. To describe the memhers of the Australian Labour party in that way was a disgraceful and horrible start, and I hope it is something I shall never hear again in parliamentary life. All I can say is that the consciences of many of the opponents of Labour must be pricked. Last night, the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney), in his maiden speech, referred to the importance of Her Majesty's Opposition, and rightly so. able member must not deal with a speech delivered during the debate on the Address-in-Eeply. right, Mr Speaker. However, last night I heard supporters of the Government stress the need for more work. Probably implicit in that suggestion is less pay and longer hours. The Government has always opposed more pay and less work yet that is what it is now proposing for its Ministers. I leave the matter by expressing my disgust and that of the members of the Australian Labour party. If given the opportunity, nineteen good men and true on this side of the House would willingly perform the work for which 22 men on the opposite side of the House are now required.",22,Opposition Members Hear Hear

74,Mr Pollaed,"I think you areI rise to support the bill, uot completely, ber for Lalor before I dealt with the hill. but to a large degree. Before proceeding to do so, I should like to refer to some of the comments of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). Honourable members will recall that, during the Labour regime, the honourable member was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. A few moments ago, he said that members of the Australian Country party were more interested in personal aggrandizement than in doing anything for the primary producer. Let me remind him that, while he occupied that portfolio, he got away with selling wheat to New Zealand at 5s. 9d. a bushel when the international price was considerably higher. He is the same gentleman who entered into an agreement with the socialist government of the TJnited Kingdom to tie down the Australian egg producer to a price variation of not more than 7 i per cent. The same position obtained in relation to the meat producers, the dairymen, and other primary producers. He is the gentleman who was responsible for writing into legislation -dealing with the Australian Dairy Produce Board the provision that, if the chairman of the board disagreed with the decision of the other members of the hoard and so reported within a certain period, he, the Minister, would determine the matter. During his whole term as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, when he was in a position to do something for the primary producers, he did more than anybody else to harm them; yet in this House he now accuses memhers of the Anstralian Country party, who can lay claim to some of the monumental statutes -of this country, of seeking personal aggrandizement rather than giving assistance to primary industries. Moreover, the honourable member knows only too well that he was one of those who supported the policy of introducing a home-consumption price for wool-the one industry that carries this country on its back. Mr Peters interjecting, member for Scullin( Mr Peters), who has just interjected, has only recently been able to make up his mind about his political affiliation. His interjection jujtifies my statement that I would deal with the remarks of the honourable memI support this legislation to increase the numerical strength of the Cabinet to 22 Ministers, and I disagree entirely with some of the comments made by members of the Opposition. However, I am not completely satisfied with the bill as it stands. WhilstI shall raise no objection to the bill being read a second time, I sliould like some more explicit information in respect of clause 4 before I shall be able to bring myself to vote for the complete passage of the measure. I refer to clause 4 because that clause provides for an increase of the Cabinet fund from £41,000 to £46,500, in order to provide salaries and allowances for two extra Ministers. On first thoughts anybody would think that the extra amount of £5,500 was to be divided between those two extra Ministers. That is not the position. The previous Cabinet fund for twenty Ministers was £41,000, an amount which, divided by twenty, gives afigureof £2,050. The proposed Cabinet fund of £46,500, divided by 22, gives a result of £2,113; but, again, that does not give a true picture of the real position. The man in the street, however, will see it that way. It is not so long ago that this Government appealed to the man in the street to exercise some measure of restraint, because of the economic difficulties we are likely to encounter as a result of our prosperity. No matter what arguments may be advanced, as this legislation now stands we shall not be able to convince the man in the street that somebody, somewhere, somehow, will not be receiving extra emoluments. If it is good enough for the ordinary members of this Parliament to accept voluntarily the postponement of any increase of salary until the end of this financial year, or until some correction of our present economic position is achieved, then it is good enough for the same principle to apply to all members of the Parliament. I completely disagree with the failure of the legislation to make completely clear where this extra money is to go. Anybody who cares to study for a few moments the Nicholas The honourable report on parliamentary salaries and allowances, a copy of which I now have before me, can find out readily enough just what salaries and allowances the various Ministers receive. No matter",23,Opposition Members Hear Hear
75,Mr Hamilton (Canning) [3.42],,24,Opposition Members Hear Hear
76,Mr Hamilton,"how figures may be juggled it is impossible to dovetail that extra amount of £5,500 into the set-up that was recommended by the Nicholas committee. It would appear, on analysis, that an extra £2,000 will be divided among four Ministers who will be elevated to the rank of senior Minister. Further study of the Nicholas report will show that that allocaconditions of a system that had been tion would dovetail snugly into a distribution under which extra salary is received by senior Ministers as against that received by junior Ministers. I do not suggest for one moment that any Cabinet Minister is adequately compensated for the work that he does in this Parliament, but I say that there is a principle involved in this matter and that 1, for one, shall not support the adoption of clause 4 during the committee stage unless we have more information regarding the destination of the extra money than we have at the moment, because it is definitely wrong to ask the people of this country to exercise restraint in the present economic position and then, as representatives of the people in this Parliament, to pass legislation which enables certain individuals to receive extra emoluments. What would be the charge levelled at us if we allowed this legislation to pass without raising any objection to it, or without obtaining at least some information on what is to become of the extra money? The charge could be rightly levelled at us that, despite what the Prime Minister said in his statement on the economic position only a few months ago, we believed that the only people who were not expected to exercise economic restraint were those conNevertheless, I think that we can see in ducting hire-purchase activities, and some senior members of Cabinet. As a member of this Parliament I do not intend to provide any ground for the levelling of such a charge. |'3.50] I rise to support the bill. I do so with a very great deal of pleasure, because I recall that in this House, on th? the Cabinet, but who will be brought into 38th February, 1952, I advocated the principle of an inner Cabinet, and of having Ministers in charge of departments but not being members of the Cabinet. It seems to me that this is a very great and necessary improvement following upon the evolving lines of Cabinet structure that have been determined by experience in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. It has been said that, in view of that speech, I am, to some extent, the originator of this bill. I do not think that that is true. My advocacy of four years ago was not original. I merely suggested the application to Australian evolved in the United Kingdom as a result of experience, and I think it would be too much altogether to claim originality for ine, because I had suggested the application here of a system that was perfectly well known in other parliamentary democracies. Indeed, sir, in some respects the movement in this direction, evinced in this measure, is not so great as I should have liked to see. It does not go so far along the lines of parliamentary evolution as I hoped it would. But perhaps that lies in the future. Perhaps one should not hope for much to be done quickly. IfI may now revert to my remarks of four years ago I shall perhaps be able to outline to the House the way3 in which I think the principles of which I have spoken may be further developed. The very good principles which are embodied in this measure should be carried to their logical conclusion. I am not attempting, in making that statement, to criticize the' bill in any way. No doubt the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has in mind a number of things which are unknown to me; no doubt ho has met many organizational difficulties of which I am barely aware; and no doubt it would be unfair to expect everything to be done at once. this bill, at least in outline, the course of Cabinet evolution. First, I think that, in time, all major functions of government will be represented by senior Ministers who will be members of the Cabinet. Those senior Ministers will have, respon(Mackellar) sible to them in a sense, junior Ministers in administrative charge of departments -Ministers who will not be members of the Cabinet for consultation when their departments are under discussion. It seems to me that, eventually, the departments will be better grouped, because every function of government will have a senior Minister in Cabinet to represent it and to he responsible for it.

The same would be true of social services or transport, the-Postal Department or the Department of Works. Surely, as the system evolved, we would find perhaps a Minister for Social Services in the Cabinet who would have under him the administration of social services proper, repatriation, housing, health and functions of that character. Or we might find in the Cabinet a Minister for Transport or Minister for Communications who would have under him the administration of the railways, shipping and the Postal Department. So the functions of government would be properly grouped, and in the inner Cabinet, or the Cabinet itself, there would always be a Minister responsible for, and representing, every major function of government. This is the second point I make, and it follows on the lines that I suggested to this House almost exactly four years ago. If we were to do this the Cabinet would have a better organic structure. How, for example, can the defence functions be properly co-ordinated when the Minister for Defence Production ( Sir Eric Harrison) is technically senior to the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) ? Surely we need in the Cabinet a Minister for Defence who has under him junior ministers who are responsible for the various functions of defence so that there is an organic structure throughout the whole system. I feel that while this new reform goes some way towards that objective, it does not yet go far enough. In saying that, I am not suggesting that there are not a great number of difficulties in the way of doing everything at once. I am not suggesting that the bill is inadequate to the present circumstances. I am saying it is inadequate to the future constitutional development of this country. It may be laying a. good foundation, hut it is not complete. My third point is this: If one did have, functions would better be performed by as I suggested, inside the Cabinet a Minister responsible for the main functions of government, then that Minister would have his own Cabinet sub-committee consisting of Ministers who were not in Cabinet hut who were responsible for the administration of the various functions which came under his authority. It is quite natural that any Minister who is putting his hand to any original work or any difficult task would like to have thrown upon it the light of the criticism of a colleague who was versed in ' its details and who would have an independent mind. Nobody has sufficient self-confidence to think that he could see everything at one glance. Even the most acute Minister will find some point eluding him. It is better that he should have another political mind turned upon the problem before a final decision is made. If one had, as I have suggested, an organic structure throughout the whole Cabinet, then there would he the natural Cabinet sub-committees, each member of which would he versed in his own subject ; whereas if one simply has an ad hoc collection of Cabinet sub-committees consisting of people who are not close to the problems with which they are dealing, the effect is a greater division of effort, more work will be thrown on to an already overworked administration and one will not necessarily get the best result. Indeed, sir, one would hope that, under this system, senior Ministers would be free of administrative responsibilities to a greater extent. The prime example is, of course, the Prime Minister himself. If one looks at the estimates of his department, one will see that he still has to perform a number of irritating, small functions of government which must take up his time and interfere with the proper assessment of the many national problems that are his proper concern. The human mind has only a certain capacity. The day is only 24 hours long. It is a pity, I think, that a greater effort has not been made to cut away the smaller details of administration from the senior Ministers in the Oabinet itself. I know, sir, the constitutional difficulties. In some ways, many of these under-secretaries but we know that, unhappily, under our Constitution, there are several impediments to that, and something else has to take its place. So, whilst I support this bill with a great deal of gratification, I hope it will only be the prelude to further constitutional developments upon the line3 that I described to this House on the 28th February, 1952, and which I still believe to be the soundest of all lines. Let me just turn to one other point. I refer to clause 4 of the hill which, as honourable members know, seeks to increase the size of what is known as the "" Cabinet pool"". I , myself, am not altogether happy in regard to this. It is quite easy to see how it has been worked out in terms of the Nicholas report. The House has the details of that report which obviously underlie the selection of this figure of £46,500 because it does follow, in a sense, on things which are in the Nicholas report. There is a Prime Minister at £4,000; a Treasurer at £2,500; ten senior Ministers, in addition, at £2,250; and ten junior Ministers at £1,750. that sum, one w ill find that it comes to £46,500, which is the amount referred to in clause 4 of this bill. Nicholas report does the honourable member refer? 23 of the Nicholas report w ill be the relevant pages. In a sense, this can be technically justified by the Nicholas report. Buti f honourable members w ill look at page 15 of that report they w ill see did not make any greater sum operative that although the number of senior Ministers should be fixed at the Prime Minister's discretion, a figure of six is tentatively suggested. That figure has been raised to ten in order to build up the members of the Cabinet itself to twelvethe ten senior Ministers, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-and that gives the figure that I quoted. I am a little bit unhappy about this provision. What the Government has done is technically in accordance with the provisions set out in the Nicholas report, because the report does leave within the discretion of the Prime Minister the number of senior Ministers who would be entitled to higher salaries. Tet I feel, in a way, having regard particularly to what the Prime Minister said to this House on the 27th September, 1955, that it might have been a good thing if the f u l l technical range had not been given and if there had been a little R -[3 ] restraint in that matter. A f t e r all, the two junior Ministers could come in at £1,750, the figure recommended in the Nicholas report. I feel that whilst it may be a small matter, it is perhaps something of a blemish on the bill although I can appreciate the technical foundations in the terms of the award if one can call it an award. It does follow the letter of the award, but it does not follow, perhaps, as closely as it might, the spirit of the Prime Minister's statement to this House on the 27th September, 1955. PerhapsI might read the House one paragraph fro m the Prime Minister's statement. He saidWith good reason, we appointed an independent committee to examine Parliamentary salaries and allowances in the light of to-day's circumstances. We now announce that we have requested the committee to make no report until the end of the current financial year. If one works out That this will involve many members of Parliament in real hardship we do not doubt; but in a community co-operative effort to cure a national problem all must play a part if we are to achieve that balance which will not only make our prosperity completely sound but will give us confidence for the futnre. I feel that those words of the Prime Minister were very wise and it might be a good thing if the Government considered reducing the new provision to the amount necessary to cover the salaries of two junior Ministers or, alternatively, until after, the 30th June, the date mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech of the 27th September as that applicable to the general parliamentary remuneration. I feel that that is an important matter, but it is a minor matter compared with -the very real advance which is being made in Cabinet structure, and the very real measure of further constitutional development which this bill envisages. For the reasons that I gave to the House four years ago, I support this bill, and hope that it w ill be the forerunner of further developments along the same lines. Opposition) [ 4 . 6 ] It is a matter for satisfaction that there has been an opportunity for further discussion of the bill, but I should have liked to see some investigation of the facts of administration, in the light of the changing functions performed by the Commonwealth.

If nineteen Ministers, sion of power, right down to those who really start recommending the decisions that ultimately percolate slowly through to the top level. The whole situation should be examined from a different point of view. First, the legal functions of the The Nicholas report has no bearing on Commonwealth, under the Constitution, are far less important than they wen; during the war and the post-war period. The war gave the Commonwealtli legislative power over virtually every activity within Australia that had any bearing upon the war effort of the nation. democratic government which is responFor instance, so far as primary industry was concerned, it was able to organize almost every aspect of marketing and to set up the great war-time pooh. These controls were exercised so that the nation cerned with war-time activities. That could be better organized for war. That threw a tremendous burden upon the Commonwealth Government. The present Treasurer is an ex-Prime Minister and was for some years a war-time Minister and a member of the Advisory War Council. He will know that what I say is true. A heavy burden was thrust upon the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, which was for some time under the control of the present Minister for colleague, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). The burden on such Ministers was tremendous, for it was necessary to exercise what amounted to a combination of the limited functions of the Commonwealth and the generally unlimited functions of the States as though Australia had, for the time being, a unitary government like that of the United Kingdom. That is only one illustration. Industrial conditions, the control of employment and the direction of labour, are normally quite beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, but in war-time they were the very essence of its jurisdiction. That was because, under national security legislation, the Commonwealth had been given every power that might be necessary to further the war effort. How many Ministers were required to do this war-time job 1 The number fixed by the Menzies Government in the early stages of the war was nineteen, and that number continued to apply throughout the war and into the post-war period. It even continued for some time after the advent of the present Governwho were responsible to the Parliament and the people of Australia, were able to clo that job, what case can be made out now for increasing the number to 22 ? It is not a matter of finance or of salaries. the point that I am making. It deals with the particular question of persons in oflice and the salaries that they should receive. The real question is, what is necessary to preserve in this country sible to this Parliament ancl leaves the real power in the hands of the people? In war-time there was a War Cabinet of seven or eight Ministers directly conCabinet sat almost continuously. That can be justified in war-time but not in peace-time, when the Commonwealth's powers are limited. It is quite wrong to refer to the United Kingdom, practice because the Parliament of that country has supreme power over every activity within it. In Australia we have federal control and limited power in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. I do not know why it is that if there are nineteen Ministers it is thought that twenty will do a better joh; that if there are twenty why should we not make the number 22; and that if there are 22 why should we not appoint another Minister and make it 23. The real question is, what functions are there and how many responsible Ministers should exercise them ? Personally, I believe that the proposed number is too great. I do not think that it will mean additional efficiency. Indeed, I think that it will create inefficiency.",27,Opposition Members Hear Hear

It will mean that the permanent secretaries of some of the departments administered by Ministers who are not in the Oabinet will know more about the decisions of Cabinet than will their Ministers. How is an "" outer "" Minister to be informed? He is to be called upon to attend Cabinet when required. Under the Australian system, no Minister should be put in that position. It might be suitdoorstep in case he is needed? Such a able in Britain because of the enormously wide area of power that is given to the United Kingdom Government. In that country there is unlimited jurisdiction as to suhject matter and the number of Ministers is as high as 50, 60 or 70. Obviously, they could not all be members of the Cabinet. In Australia, however, the position is different. We have to govern a continent in respect of federal matters. The limiting of the Cabinet to twelve will mean that at the Cabinet level, which is the decisive level, important secThere is no need to mention his name and tions of Australian opinion will not be represented. Defence offers a sufficient illustration. for Defence is a member of the Cabinet. only listen to me, instead of gossiping, he would understand my point. The Minister for Defence is to be in the Cabinet, but if a ruling is wanted on an Army matter it should he given, there and then, by the Minister charged with the administration of the Army. It is absurd to create associated with the Ministers for a this artificial separation between those who are in the Cabinet and those who are not. I think that the present number of Ministers is sufficient. I believe that twenty Ministers could do the job efficiently. My own view is that they should be retained as a Cabinet, especially since this is a time of peace. I have already pointed out, following my colleague, the honourable member for Lalor, how different the position was in time of wa r. What case has heen made out for the second team will eventually he dropped. increase of the number of Ministers by What does it mean, in effect? Who will two? Why 22 rather than twenty? We have the greatest increase of power as a would like to see some statement hy result of this change? Will it be the administrators that this increase is essential. I submit that no case has been made out for it. If one looks at the matter from a departmental point of view one finds some extraordinary contradictions. Some of them have already been pointed out. The Minister for Supply is not in the Cabinet, and yet supply is the very life of the defence of this country. When matters of defence are discussed in the Cabinet, is that Minister to hear of them subsequently? Is he to be called from Sydney when Cabinet meets, and made to wait on the procedure would be the complete antithesis of a united effort by the Cabinet from the point of view of the efficient government of Australia. Some Ministers in the second group obviously have qualifications as administrators superior to some of those who are in the Cabinet. I think every one would agree with that. Reference was made to one Minister by way of criticism, when it was said that he had heen a failure. I think, on the contrary, that he had been a great success. so introduce personalities into the debate. The Government has made a great blunder in this matter. I believe the time will come when the Government will quietly drop the distinction between the twelve Ministers in the Cabinet and the ten who might be .summoned, and that it will then have a Cabinet working together. But the real point is whether the number of Ministers should be increased to 22, and no case has heen made out for suoh aa increase. There have been parliamentary under-secretaries number of years. Those under-secretaries have included the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton), the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz) and the honourable member for Oalare( Mr Howse). What has become of them? Were they not assisting the Ministers? Could not that system be of use if it was thought that those gentlemen could render assistance to Ministers ?

That, I believe, will he enjoyed l>y the permanent heads of departments -person s who are not in touch with the people of Australia. Members of this Parliament who, although they are Ministers of State, will he excluded from Oabinet, will not enjoy the same degree of contact with Cabinet as will be enjoyed by their own permanent heads. That will be a result of this scheme, which has been introduced on the principle that something that is good in the English system is necessarily good for Australia, where a Cabinet of nineteen or twenty is not too large for the great area of Australia. My complaint ahout this proposal has nothing to do with the additional expenditure involved, except hy way of illustration of what will follow. Once we have two new Ministers then we have, in effect, two additional departments. Not only will there be the additional expense on salaries, but also each new department will draw additional power to itself. I believe that the Government has blundered on this matter. It wanted the scheme adopted by Parliament, so it tried to have the measure rushed through yesterday in order to avoid an analysis of this kind. But sueh an analysis had to come sooner or later. What is the most efficient way of governing Australia at the federal level, remembering our limited powers, and remembering the area that is to he covered? Would the presence in the Cabinet room of ten more Ministers of State, members of this Parliament, interfere with the deliberations of the Cabinet? It is said that their presence would make the proceedings more lengthy. It is not numbers that make proceedings lengthy or short; the deciding factors are the wisdom, prudence and discretion of the members of Cabinet, and the self-control that is exerconfirms our view that there has not been cised at the Cabinet level. I am not looking at this matter for one moment from a party point of view. I think that we, as a Parliament, should not merely express dogmatic assertions as to what will happen-on e cannot be sure of these things-hu t I direct attention, by way of illustration, to the anomaly that will be created when two service Ministers are in the Cabinet and one is not in it. Why should that be so? That will put the service which is not represented in the Cabinet in an inferior position, and everybody will know it, including the memhers of the armed forces controlled hy that Minister. It will be said, ""He is not in the Cabinet, and so he does not enjoy equal status with the other service Ministers"". Cabinet is a body in which all the Ministers of State should he able to put their views, not merely in respect of their own departments, but also in respect of the general administration and policy of the country. There is scarcely any department the activities of which have not some bearing upon those of other departments. I do not propose to carry the matter further. There has been a complete failure by the Government to show how this system will work, or to show the necessity for it. Of course, there was a desire to promote certain persons, and therefore it was decided to appoint another couple of Ministers, resulting in the juggling and shuffling which is now evident. I submit that some of the Ministers in the second group are more efficient than are some of those in the Cabinet. That is inevitable once an arbitrary division is made of twelve on the one hand and ten on the other. The parliamentary under-secretaries who were selected to assist the Ministers have been left out of the picture altogether. Why can the matter not be looked at afresh? I suggest that that should be done. In the meantime the view of the Opposition is that the Government has not proved its case, and that the Opposition should not support a measure of this kind. The extra time that we have been given to consider this measure merely a proper approach to the matter from the point of view of efficient administration. I repeat that those whose power has in creased and is increasing will enjoy a still further increase in power. I refer to the permanent officials of the departments. As a result of this demarcation between Oabinet Ministers and other Ministers, the views of high-ranking officials in the Public Service will have greater weight. They will be able to express opinions which will carry substantial weight, and they will be able to do so much more readily than is the case at present. They may be very able and efficient men capable than the present Ministers. j) resent Ministers, whatever their limitations, do represent the people of the country, and they should know what the democratic system requires. That is why we have Ministers. If we did not, we eould pick out a dozen permanent oflicial? and say to them, "" Govern Australia"". That is not the kind of system that any memher of the Parliament favours. Those are the views that I formed after listening to the case that has heen made in the future, of the 22, twelve will be out for this change. What ease has heen members of the Cabinet, whilst the other made out by the Treasurer ? He has given Ministers will be outside it. It has been us a short and summary statement, which urged, in support of this new principle, I suggest is a perfunctory analysis of the that deliberations among twenty people position.

The Opposition has attacked the measure on the basis that if it were possible to conduct the war with nineteen Ministers, who were all members of the Cabinet, it should be possible to attend to the country's affairs to-day with at least the same number of Ministers as constituted the Ministry before the hill was introduced. The validity of that argument depends on whether the proposed reorganization of the Cabinet, which has been mentioned, will be satisfactory, and whether, under the new system, the affairs of the country will be more efficiently conducted.

88,Mr Tubner (Bradfield) [4.25],"United Kingdom Parliament has to perform which do not come within the concern of the Australian Parliament. Nevertheless, there they have a Cabinet consisting of fifteen or sixteen Ministers those reasons alone, included in the and another ten Ministers outside, as well as a large number of parliamentary under-secretaries and so on. The proposal in the measure is to reduce the present Australian Cabinet to twelve. In the United Kingdom it is evidently possible to conduct a great deal more business with sixteen Cabinet Ministers. On the face of it a reduction in the number of Cabinet Ministers to twelve in the Australian Government is at least not justified by experience in the United Kingdom. Australia should be able to conduct its affairs satisfactorily with a Ministry of, perhaps, sixteen. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) that all sorts of anomalies are associated with the perditions imposed by our federal system. formance of their duties by Ministers inside and outside the Cabinet. One would suppose that the Minister for Defence in the Cabinet would have as colleagues outside the Cabinet Ministers concerned not only with the Army, Navy and Air Force, but also with defence production and supply. The strange position obtains, however, that the Ministers for the Army and Supply are now outside Cabinet, whereas the Ministers for the Navy and Air and Defence Production are inside. Looking at the matter more closely, one must come to the conclusion that under the Commonwealth Constitution, whicli has so many difficulties associated with it, the personnel of the Cabinet consists of persons who are there not because of the great importance of the departments that they administer, but because of their prestige in their party or because they represent a particular State or some specific interest. To be logical, only those who represent the major departments ought to be in the Ministry. It is anomalous that the Minister for Defence Production should, as such, be in the Cabinet and the Minister for Social Services outside it. I hope, with the honourable member for Mackellar, that the proposed alteration represents only a transitional stage and that ultimately the Cabinet will consist of those representing the major funcWarI . The matter was considered again tions of government, with others under them outside the Cabinet. It is to be hoped also that other considerations, such as the representation of a particular State or other interest, will not be, for Cabinet. There is every reason why the Cabinet should consist of more than twelve members, because it must always have in it a certain amount of "" dead wood"". Reviewing the Ministry as at present constituted, and not dealing with the ultimate situation envisaged by the honourable member for Mackellar-whic h I hope will be reached at some stage-and also bearing in mind the fact that some members are in the Cabinet by reason of their administering an important department, the position arises that some Ministers in the Cabinet would be better outside it, and vice versa, under the conSome new Ministers have been appointed who might bring fresh ideas to the Cabinet and so greatly stimulate it. That is perhaps the most valid criticism of this proposal. It has been suggested that the Cabinet has not been as active or as inventive as it should be. If new Ministers with fresh ideas are to be kept outside the Cabinet, this would amount to a sterilization of innovation, and I am concerned at that possibility. At this stage in the evolution of a new Cabinet1 should be pleased to see sixteen Ministers appointed with others outside, rather than a Cabinet of twelve and some outside it representing departments that have greater justification for inclusion in the Cabinet. The honourable member for Mackellar and other honourable members have mentioned the desirability of allowing Ministers inside the Cabinet some freedom from administrative responsibilities so that they might be able to brood on the affairs of the nation. It is argued that they should be freed from matters of detail that would distract their minds from, broad issues of policy. This suggestion has a long history of argument over the years, nnd dates back to tbe Haldane Committee on the Machinery of Government and the days of Lloyd George and his war Cabinet in World by Winston Churchill during World War II . and by Mr no w Earl-Attle e after hostilities had ceased. I propose to read from Churchill's memoirs of 1942, and will preface the quotation by saying that when Mr Churchill became Prime Minister of Great Britain at the commencement of World War II . there were 23 Ministers in the pre-war Cabinet, but he reduced the numbers and his war Cabinet consisted of only eight or nine. Subsequently he wroteIn direct contrariety to a strong current of opinion, I have now given f u l l effect to my view that war Cabinet members should also he the holders of responsible offices and not merely advisers at large with nothing to do but think and talk and take decisions by compromise or majority. He was greatly in favour, in those difficult times-and Australia is passing through difficult times now in other circumstances -of all memhers of the Cabinet being in charge of an important department of State because it brought them into touch with the day-to-day problems confronting the Administration, instead of their being aloof from what was going on. It also means that those who are responsible for the great offices of state, and being concerned with major decisions arrived at by Cabinet, will be all the more bound to stand together in their Cabinet responsibilities whereas, if quite important functions are left outside the Cabinet, then, although those Ministers outside Cabinet who have to abide by Cabinet decisions no doubt will do so with the utmost conscientiousness of which they are capable, there will no doubt be times of stress when they will feel that, not having been consulted, and not having taken part in the discussions, it is a little hard to expect them to abide by the decisions arrived at. So Mr Churchill took the view that the Cabinet should consist of those who hold the great the proposed increase in the number of offices of state and who are not free of Ministers. Most of the knowledge we those administrative responsibilities at all. have of the question has been gleaned I do not want to delay the House on to the assembling of this Parliament. We this matter, but I think we may well see know that when negotiations were taking an important, experiment carried out folplace between the Prime Minister and lowing upon this bill that I think will the Leader of the Australian Country have good consequences. At the same party ( Sir Arthur Fadden), the question time. I should not be at all surprised also of how many portfolios should be allotted to find, just as the division of the Cabinet to the Australian Country party was disinto two ""elevens"" recently was not cussed. The information we received, and found to work successfully, that it will I think it was fairly accurate, was that also be necessary to modify the present reorganization by way of an enlargement of the Cabinet to perhaps sixteen members in the not distant future. [4.37] -First, I wish to reply to some of the remarks made by the honorabie member for Canning( Mr Hamilton). 1 think he was most unfair to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). He stated that when the honourable member was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, he sold wheat to New Zealand for 5s. 9d. a bushel. He also spoke about the sale of wool at the cost of production. He was endeavouring to convey the impression that the honourable memher was a failure as a Minister. Let me point out that the honourable member for Lalor was not the Minister when that wheat was sold to New Zealand. Another point is that when the Labour Government took oifice in 1941 the outgoing Liberal Government had arranged to sell wool to the British Government at 13d. per lb. It was only after the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) had intervened, and had made representations in London, that the price was increased to lod. per lb. I mention those matters to show that the honourable member for Canning, when he made those remarks, displayed a very poor spirit indeed. He should not have raised those matters. We all know only too well that one may sell something for a certain price to-day only to find in a month's time that circumstances have so changed as to make one say, "" If I had only known, I would have hung on until now and got a higher price"". That was really the position with the sale of wheat to New Zealand. We on this side are not happy about from what we read in the press just prior",31,Opposition Members Hear Hear
89,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"the Prime .Minister proposed that there should be four Country party Ministers and sixteen Liberal party Ministers. that he said it ; I am saying that statement appeared in the press, and I think it was fairly correct. When the Australian Country party would not agree to the proposal that only four Ministers should be appointed from their ranks, the Prime Minister compromised. He suggested that five Australian Country party Ministers, and two additional Liberal party Ministers be appointed. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and other honourable members on this side have stated that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) has not put forward any justification whatever for an increase of the number of Ministers. The reason why he has not done so is quite simple to find. It is because he is not able to justify the mcrease. When we are considering the justice oi fairness of the present proposal, it may be of advantage to recall a discussion that In my view, the increase of the number took place a few years ago on the appointof Ministers is proposed, not because 22 ment of parliamentary under-secretaries. We were told that certain men had been appointed parliamentary under-secretaries to understudy Ministers with a view to being given ministerial rank subsequently. But what do we find when new Ministers are appointed? The honourable member for Canning, who has done a great deal of work as a parliamentary under-secretary, is overlooked and somebody else is appointed. Day after day in the previous Parliament, the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz) asked questions of the various Ministers, and particularly of th* Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. They were what might be called "" DorothyD i x "" questions, and were put with a view to demonstrating to the'people just how hard the Ministers and he were working. Every one was thinking that the honourable member for Darling Downs certainly knew the business of the primary producer. People were convinced that he was coming into the limelight, as it were, and that he was almost certain to become a member of the Ministry. But that did not happen. In the appointment of two additional Ministers, the honourable member for Darling Downs is overlooked. The men who were supposed to be apprentices, or understudies to Ministers and to he training for the Ministry, have been passed over, and others have been appointed in their stead. Another important point is that if we are to have a Ministry that is truly representative not only of this Parliament but also of the people of Australia, South Australia should be given more than one representative in it. There are on the Government side more than one capable representative from South Australia who should have been elevated to ministerial rank. One cannot be blamed for thinking that there is a special reason for giving South Australia only one-twenty-second of the representation in the Ministry, although the State has one-eleventh of the population of Australia. There is a veason. These South Australian representatives are passed over not because they lack ability but because the Government wants to appoint to the Ministry men sponsored hy powerful interests. Ministers are required to carry on the business of government, but because the Government desires to please certain parties and the people who support it. I was amazed to hear the honourable inember for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) say that he would support the bill because it could be the means of bringing about something that he advocated four years ago. At that time, he spoke of an inner or superior Cabinet. An examination of the bill will disclose that it does not contain power to do that. All it seeks to do is increase the number of Ministers from twenty to 22. Even without this bill, even with only twenty Ministers, the Government would have power to appoint an inner Cabinet. It is my opinion that honourable memhers on the Government side are merely taking advantage of the opportunity presented hy this hill to air their views on that matter. We are not debating whether there should be an inner Cabinet or a first eleven and a second eleven. The point we are debating is whether there should be",33,Opposition Members Hear Hear
90,Mr Brand,He never said that.,34,Opposition Members Hear Hear
91,Mr Thompson,"I am not saying22, or only twenty members in the Ministry. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has stated, this party will not vote for the measure. ""We shall oppose it because the Government has not put forward any sound reason why we should support it. I admit I believe that Ministers should have ample time in which to do their job. I know that some Ministers have enormous tasks, hut when I consider who the proposed 22 Ministers are, and when I recall speeches they have delivered here, and their attitude to various matters that have been dealt with, I cannot understand how those 22 will be able to do any better than, or even as well as, twenty Ministers have done in the past. In my opinion some men who bave not the necessary experience to do the job are appointed Ministers. ""What will happen, as I said years ago, is that as the number of members of Parliament is increased the rank and file in the Parliament will lose control, and the Parliament will come under Executive control to an increasingly greater degree. Likewise, as the number in the Ministry is increased the more the Ministry will come under Executive control. Some people think that is a good thing. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner), who has just resumed his seat, said that he would sooner see a Cabinet of sixteen Ministers, all in the Cabinet doing the joh, than twelve Ministers actually in the Cabinet with authority and another ten Ministers outside it. I agree with bim to a certain extent. The effect of an enlarged Ministry can be illustrated by what happens in a large caucus of, say, 100 members. Every matter cannot be thoroughly digested and so must be left with a few in the Executive. So it will be with the Ministry. The larger the Ministry the more necessary it will be to have a hard core in that Ministry, and that core will be the deciding factor. We desire to leave the position as it ii"" is a matter for regret that the Prime and allow the present twenty Ministers to carry on. I know very well that the Government has the numbers to put this bill through, but it was wise of the Treasurer last night to accept the motion of the honourable member for Angas( Mr answer. In his absence the Treasurer Downer) to adjourn the debate so that we could consider it further. As a result well ave been enabled to look into this matter more fully. The honourable member for Angas stated that even though he wanted more time to consider the matter, he unreservedly supported the bill. The adjournment has given us the opportunity to consider for ourselves what the results of this bill will be, and to place our view? before the people. I have no spleen, or animosity, in this matter, but there is no doubt in my mind that the result of this bill will be to create a hard core in the Ministry, and increase the power of heads of departments. Departmental control will become even greater than it is now. In Australia, a Minister, no matter who he may be, is dominated or influenced to a great extent by the department which he is supposed to control. That occurs whether a Liberal government or a Labour government is in power, although I make the observation that the Ministers in Labour governments have exercised a greater degree of control over their departments. Only to-day, the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) said that when the honourable member for Lalor( Mr PoUard) was a Minister he stated that he would step in when the department did not do what it should do. I believe that is a wise attitude. We are elected by the people to govern and administer the country and, in that respect, every Minister should accept his full responsibility. To-day, we are getting away from the principle that if Ministers had direct^ instead of remote control, and were not influenced unduly by an inner cabinet and departmental heads, we would have a much better system. In those circumstances the Labour party is quite justified in objecting to this measure and in. refusing to support it. to support, with some reservations, this hill which seeks to amend the Ministers of State Act. I say at the outset that it Minister( Mr Menzies) is not here to handle the passage of this hill because it concerns his department. Some matters have been raised to which he would have been able to give a very satisfactory ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has explained the meaning of the bill and what it proposes",34,Opposition Members Hear Hear
92,Mr Failes (Lawson) [4.50],"I rise to UJ; and it is for the House in this democratic Parliament to make observations and decide whether fche bill should become law. It has been said that one of the reasons for an increase in the number of Ministers of State is that in the preceding Parliament the Ministers were over-worked. I do not doubt that at all. I have every sympathy for Cabinet Ministers; I believe they have been tremendously over-worked. However, I do not think it was necessary for them to work so hard when such a position could be avoided. I suggest that Ministers, particularly those occupying high Cabinet posts, should be relieved of the necessity of signing letters regarding personal matters. As a private memher I receive many letters asking that a certain matter be brought before a Minister, and I feel bound to place such representations before the appropriate Minis : ter. An honourable member feels bound to his constituents to do that, but if the constituents appreciated the tremendous amount of work that devolves upon Ministers I am sure they would he content to receive an assurance from a senior officer of a department, or from their own member on the authority of the department, that a particular matter would he considered without the Minister having personally to sign a letter. It is incomprehensible that Ministers should be expected to do so, nor should they be expected to peruse every letter they are called upon to sign. That practice has grown up, but Ministers could be relieved of a tremendous amount of work if a suggestion along the lines I have indicated were adopted. They should not be required to sign letters referring to personal matters, hut, naturally, they would he prepared to sign letters to organizations or letters dealing with policy. There is the man who is in the habit of writing to his member, "" I want a telephone and I cannot get it. Will you take this matter up with the Postmaster-General? "" That type of man is still with us. We have to take the matter up with the Postmaster-General hut the man would receive just as much satisfaction, and probably a quicker reply, if he were to go direct to the district telephone oflicer who would be in a position to tell him whether he could get an immediate service or not. In that respect, Ministers could he saved a tremendous amount of work and left free to devote their time to matters of policy which, after all, is the important function of Cabinet. We find that in the proposed reconstruction of the Cabinet, Ministers other than the Cabinet Ministers, will be expected to be only administrative Ministers. In other words, they will have very little to do with matters affecting overall policy but will be responsible only for policy concerning their departments. In the selection of the Cabinet Ministers has consideration been given to personal qualities rather than to the needs of departments? On looking down the list, one wonders why it is that the Minister in cliarge of such an important department as the Department of Primary Industry is not worthy of inclusion in the Cabinet. We are crying out for greater production, particularly from the primary industries, which provide some 90 per cent, of Australia's export wealth. Therefore, one would think that the Minister in charge of that department could justifiably be included in the Cabinet. It has been said already that the Department of Supply is of great importance to us under present world conditions, particularly on account of its association with the atomic bomb. Yet the Minister in charge of that department is not included in the Cabinet. I find it difficult to understand how the Postmaster-General's Department, for instance, can be expected to discharge not only its Australian obligations but also its international obligations, particularly with the expected introduction of television, unless its Minister sits in the Cabinet. I find myself wondering whether this is only an experimental arrangement. Is it proposed that, having seen how it works, it shall he improved ? No doubt that is so. It seems to me that some Ministers are capable, and have proved themselves capable, of administering more than one department. I mention as an example the administration of the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Immigration hy one Minister. If a Minister is capable of administering more than one department under the present set-up, in which he has the whole responsibility, I suggest that it is possible that the ministerial heads of all departments might be included in the Cabinet by allocating more than one department to individual Cabinet Ministers. If this were done, the Cabinet Ministers in charge of departments, as a Cabinet Minister, would have direct access to the source of policy, and could be freed of the administrative responsibility for the departments by the remaining Ministers, who could act as assistants to the Cabinet, if a Cabinet of twelve, including the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, is adhered to. That would leave ten Ministers, apart from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, each of whom could administer two departments, with the assistance of the other ten Ministers who are at present classified as junior Ministers. I. believe the question of appointing honorary Ministers has not been investigated. There are in this House young men who are anxious to do more than they are able to do as private members. Three of them were glad to work as hard as they could as under-secretaries without additional remuneration. The appointment of honorary Ministers would afford an opportunity to try out the younger memhers of the House in the capacity of assistants to Ministers. Although it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to select the Ministers who will hold Cabinet office, I think it is a very sound proposition that private members should have the privilege, as they have, of discussing these matters and expressing opinions on them. The bill has been introduced so that the form of Cabinet and Ministry proposed by the Prime Minister may be adopted, and I support that portion of the measure which is designed for this purpose. I hope that consideration will he given to the inclusion in the Cabinet of the ministerial heads of what I believe are important departments. I have mentioned in particular the Department of Primary Industry, because, as I have said, we are so greatly dependent upon primary production for our export trade. The importance of the primary industries justifies a place in the Cabinet for the ministerial head of the department concerned with them. It is proposed to increase the number of Ministers to 22. I doubt whether, under present stresses, it is possible to carry on with fewer than 22 Ministers, although it might be possible to reduce the number by a reconstruction of the Ministry. But, as that is not to be done, it is necessary to provide for the remuneration of the two additional Ministers and clause 4 of the bill amends the principal act for this purpose. I agree with previous speakers that it is unfortunate that the hill provides not only for the remuneration of the two additional appointees but also for some additional remuneration to other Ministers which, I understand, is the result of the changes in the Cabinet. If the Ministers of State who comprise the Cabinet are selected because of their particular ability, I believe they are capable of administering more than one department. If they are not capable of administering more than one department, I fail to see why their remuneration should be increased. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I support the bill with some reservations. If it can be shown that, by this reconstruction of the Cabinet, the country will be administered better and the Cabinet Ministers will be able to give more time to policy matters and less time to detailed administrative matters, it will be a very good thing. If it is found that better administration is achieved by a Cabinet of ten Ministers, together with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, it is correct that those Ministers should be promoted to senior Cabinet rank and given the remuneration that goes with that rank. But I do not consider the present is the appropriate time for such action. This is a time when we are asking people to button up their pockets and tighten their belts, to work harder and not ask for more money for the extra work, and in general to put their best foot forward and do their utmost. Members of the Parliament have given a lead by demonstrating that they are prepared to do what the people are asked to do. I refer to a report, which, we believe, indicates that many members of this House are not receiving remuneration commensurate with their costs. I emphasize that their remuneration is not commensurate even with their costs, as distinct from what they would like to receive. I believe that, while increases of members' remuneration remain in abeyance, it would have been wiser to allow the provision for increased remuneration of Ministers made in this bill also to remain in abeyance. However, there the matter stands. 1 have stated that I support the bill because I believe it is a move in the right direction to give Ministers of State more opportunity to deal with policy matters. I suggest, also, that this is a suitable-time for Ministers to indicate that private memhers will be given more authority to reply to representations from constituents, because Ministers should not be expected to reply personally to each individual letter written to them. sordid bargainT h a t tlie question be now p u t .

I feel very deeply about the step the Government has taken, because not very long ago, as I have already stated, the Prime Minister, in an address to the nation, pointed out its economic difficulties and asked the people to exercise restraint wherever possible. Honourable members on both sides of the House voluntarily agreed not to accept an increase of salary until at least the 30th June, 1956. It does not fol'ow that we shall receive an increase even then, and, as we all well and tru'y know, some honourable members are finding it difficult to carry on. After a resounding victory, when the people endorsed the policy of a Government that had always claimed to be of the highest moral courage and integrity, and which they thought would not countenance underhand work, the first piece of legislation to be introduced is this bill. Now we are told that it provides for salary adjustments for some senior Ministers. That means that somebody somehow will receive something extra. In view of our plea to the people to exercise restraint, and of the attitude that has been adopted by honourable members in relation to their salaries and allowances, I think that the step the Govevnment has taken is a breach of faith. .

The question of salaries arose only as the result of an analysis of the hill by my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean). ""Will the right honourable gentleman tell us which Ministers will be affected by the alteration? Let me remind him that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) announced last year that the Eichardson report in relation to the salaries of ordinary members, which was then before him or ahout to be presented, had been set aside. ""Why has provision been made for Minister's salaries in a bill that has nothing whatever to do with salaries? It was presented, in the first instance, simply to make provision for tbe salaries of two additional members of the Ministry, but in fact, it is not entirely that kind of bill. The haste with which it was introduced was improper. Some personI do not say it was the right honourable gentleman-mus t have known these facts. As I have stated, only at the last moment, as a result of an analysis of the measure by the honorahle member for Melbourne Ports and the devastating criticism of the honourable member for Canning, have these facts been made known to the public. They are scandalous. Canning( Mr Hamilton) feels so deeply ahout the fact that in some way or other some one will get some money that he thinks that person is not entitled to. As I understand his complaint, the burden of it was simply that there was some relationship between this bill and the selfdenying action of honourable members in deciding that, they would not seek an increase of salary for the time being. If the honourable member for Canning ancl other honourable members would examine tbe position carefuUy they would realize that that, in fact, is not the position.

What has happened in the Cabinet re-organization which passage of this bill will regularize is that certain Ministers have been raised from junior status to senior status; in other words, to put it in common parlance, they have been promoted to a higher salary level. Does any one suggest that the fact that they have been promoted to more responsible positions which carry, means that an increase of salary is to be given to Cabinet Ministers generally? Such a suggestion would he quite fantastic. I consider that the position has been misunderstood by the honourable member for Canning, ancl I hope that, on reflection, he will appreciate that fact. The hill has been surrounded by a great deal of confusion, due to the unfortunate illness of the Prime Minister( MrI think, therefore, that the committee can Menzies), because it has always heen the Prime Minister's prerogative to distribute the fund available to Cabinet Ministers. either members of this Parliament, or Cabinet Ministers themselves, have greatly concerned themselves with the method of distribution of the fund. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) has made quite clear the fact that this alteration in the standing of Cabinet has been in accordance with the Nicholas committee's report. In fact, if the position is examined closely it will he found that the Prime Minister has used the discretion that the Nicholas committee recommended he should use from the outset, because I understand that the Nicholas committee's report suggested there should he six senior Ministers. In fact, from the outset there were seven senior Ministers, and the fund available for only six senior Ministers was divided among seven. In other words, at that stage they received less than the Nicholas committee suggested they should receive.

I imagine -of course, we have no detailed information on this, nor do we seek it-that the twelve senior Ministers will receive remuneration on a basis somewhat nearer to the rate of payment for seven senior Ministers than the rate of payment for the six suggested by the Nicholas committee; in other words, they will continue to receive less than was suggested by the Nicholas committee. I suggest, therefore, that the honourable member for Canning has completely misunderstood the position. Further, I suggest that it is rather degrading for him to advance a case which suggests that the business of the government of this country, and the appointment of the normally, higher salaries, Ministers to carry it out, could he made the suhject of a bargain on the basis that we would be willing to authorize the payment of higher salaries to Ministers if they were willing to introduce legislation to increase the salaries of honourable members generally. That is a rather sordid and. degrading proposition to advance, and if the honourable member were to examine his argument he would see that that proposition is implicit in it. pass this legislation with a clear conscience and that the Government has not in any way tried to conceal or to confuse I do not think that the issue. This legislation is perfectly in accordance with the Nicholas committee's report. It is also perfectly in accordance with the discretion that that committee suggested should be left to the Prime Minister. Further, it is perfectly in accordance with the ideas of this chamber, as already expressed by its vote, that there should he a certain re-organization of Cabinet along the lines laid down in the bill. desire, in common with other honorahle memhers, to register my protest at the unnecessary haste and the manner in which this proposed increase has been placed before us. I did not intend to rise because I thought that the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) had put forward very effective arguments. But, because the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) has risen specifically to oppose the arguments advanced hy those honourable members, I consider that I am forced to point out that he, alone of the 124 members of this House, has had his electoral allowance increased hy regulation.",41,Pairs

I should also like to point out that the electoral allowance of the honourable member for Forrest was the only one increased by regulation, a fact of which most honourable members were not aware. Now, he rises to defend the actions of the Government, more or less to say, "" Thank you "" to the memhers of the Government for their very generous attitude towards him. I understand his electoral allowance was increased from £600 to £750 and, as a colleague reminds me, the increase was made retrospective. So one would expect him to come to the defence of Ministers who are now to receive increased salaries at a time when the wage-earners and salary-earners of Australia have received shocking treatment from the various people who pay their wages and salaries. It is a pity we cannot import into this matter, not the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator, because he dealt fairly with Commonwealth employees in his last award, but the Full Oourt of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to examine the difference between the margins paid to the specially skilled Ministers going to he promoted. He may he expectand those paid to the semi-skilled Ministers in the second grade. I hope that the Treasurer will withdraw this bill and will see, at least, that the Ministers themthe honourable member for Capricornia selves are prepared to pull in their belts and do without increases of margins until the great mass of workers in this country receive their due rights. Clause3 is objectionable because it seeks to regularize an increase of the number of suited you.

Clause4 is agree with his speech or disagree with it ? ob jectionable because it proposes to approCome clean! Tell us where you stand. ( Mr C. P. priate an additional sum of £5,500 for the payment of the salaries of Ministers. If the Government considers that more Ministers are needed, then it ought to be able to make provision for the ministerial salaries of the additional Ministers from the amount of £41,000 that the Parliament has already appropriated for that purpose. But, under clause 4, the Government wants to appropriate another sum of £5,500. This is the Government that is telling everybody in the community to tighten their belts. It is telling the people to spend less and work harder. It is telling the waterside workers that they have to do this and that. It is lecturing the primary producers. It is hectoring the manufacturers. It is telling the importers that they must reduce the value of their purchases abroad because the state of the economy is bad. We are suffering, as I said earlier, from what the Prime Minister, in a delightful phrase, termed "" the problems of prosperity"". Heaven help us if we did not have prosperity to-day. I do not know what the position would be like if we were in adversity. But the Government, which is lecturing everybody else, says in effect, "" Our new Ministers, who are not to be allowed to attend Cabinet meetings unless and until summoned for consultation, are useless Ministers"". But our useless Ministers, in effect, are to he paid an extra remuneration. It is all right for the honourable memher for Forrest( Mr Freeth) to make a plea for the Government.

121,Mr Chambers (Adelaide) [8.35],"immediate post-war period was any less than the amount of work that has to be done by twenty Ministers at present. 1 am sure that no one would claim that except, perhaps, the Government itself, including the two new Ministers. -I remember well, that in 1946, the then Opposition took up much of the time of tlie House in criticizing the Chifley Government for the appointment of nineteen Ministers. As I have said, that occurred in the important and very difficult period, less than a year after the cessation of hostilities, when a million of our people had to be taken from the various services and defence works and placed back in employment. It must be remembered, too, that in that period, when that transition was done so smoothly, not one person was unemployed. Not one person who wanted a job in 1946,1947 or 1948 could not get a job. That work was done with nineteen Ministers, the appointment of whom was criticized for some time hy the then Opposition which now forms the Government. I say that if it was necessary to condemn and criticize the Government then, surely we are entitled to criticize the earlier times, Prime Ministers from hoth Government and vote against this measure, irrespective of thc financial side of it. The financial proposal, I think, is disgraceful; the honorahle member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) has already said so. This Government went to the electors only a couple of months ago and pointed ont to the people how necessary it was to r-conomize. Why has the Government piesented to the House, as its first bill, a financial measure which will involve the Treasury in the expenditure of an extra amount of money? It is the most disgraceful measure that has ever come before this House. It warrants the severest criticism. The proposed increase could easily have heen avoided hy giving more worlf to the twenty existing Ministers. I say most emphatically that if, in the immediate post-war period, there was no necessity to have more than nineteen Ministers, there is definitely no necessity to have 22 Ministers now, ten years after the war has ended. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [8.41] -The Opposition, by the manner in which it has addressed itself to this bill, has missed an opportunity to do a useful service for this parliamentary institution. This is an important bill, and much more than a machinery measure. It enables us to reconstruct the method of Cabinet government in this country. Therefore, it invites the earnest consideration and analysis of all sections of this Parliament. If the Opposition -had been really concerned about the welfare of the parliamentary institution it would have attempted an honest analysis of what the Government was trying to do. Honourable members opposite could have offered their own views on the subject, and, if they felt that improvements in the method of Cabinet organization could be made, they could have put them before Parliament for consideration. This country has, over the years, been working towards the evolution of a satisfactory system of Cabinet government here in Canberra. We are not entirely men of free will in this matter because we are hound by the provisions of the Constitution. I have no doubt that, in sides of politics in this country would have welcomed an opportunity to set up a system of assistant, or junior Ministers, somewhat comparable with that which obtains in the TJnited Kingdom, but we in Australia have not such an opportunity. We cannot appoint an assistant to a Minister unless he is himself a Minister of State in the full sense, administering a department of state. I think we are all agreed that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has had a very long and practical experience of these matters in Australia, and has watched closely the operation of the British cabinet system. Consequently, when he had to face up to the problem on this occasion, he decided not to continue what, from our own experience, had proved to be a cumbersome cabinet structure. T refer to the practice of having twenty Ministers sitting around a table. He kept in mind the desirability of encouraging younger and less experienced members of Parliament to learn something of cabinet administration and thereby equip themselves for even more responsible cabinet duties. He realized that this could not be achieved simply by appointing junior",44,Pairs
122,Mr Harold Hoit (Higgins,"Minisor assistant Ministers who had not a department of state to administer. He sought a practical solution of the problem the manner of its introduction. I should and decided to have a cabinet of twelve senior and experienced members of Parliament-fro m both Houses and representing all the States of the Commonwealth-and ten other Ministers who would gain valuable experience and would, in their turn, have an opportunity to serve in the Cabinet of the nation. That proposal, which this Parliament has adopted by passing the second reading of the bill, has commended itself to most of the people of Australia. They feel that it will produce a more workable government, and result in speedier and more effective decisions at the Cabinet level. They realize, too, that it will provide valuable experience for junior members of the Parliament who can, while giving useful administrative service, equip themsure. He is qualifying what he is selves for the more responsible positions held by existing Cabinet members. For those reasons I do not think that there need be much argument ahout the structure which the Prime Minister has adopted. Indeed, at no stage of this debate has any one, so far as I am aware, challenged the fact that it will be useful and mittee four or five years ago, members valuable for our purposes. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) says, "" Years ago Ministers dealt with certain problems. Why cannot the same number of Ministers deal with them to-day? "" In point of fact, fewer Minisfor Forrest have pointed out, certain ters will he dealing with the matters to which he referred because only twelve will struction of Cabinet, been raised iu be sitting around the Cabinet table-no t nineteen, as in his day. Moreover, ours is a rapidly growing country. Even since Labour was in office we have added 1,500,000 to our population, and the national income of the country has trebled. Industrial development is going on all over Australia. These things have created novel problems, and, I believe, justify the kind of Cabinet structure that the Prime Minister has established. Let us leave that for a moment and look at what has been, for several honourable members, the real bone of contention. They hold the quite mistaken belief that members of this Cabinet who have not, for reasons which the Prime Minister has publicly indicated, been disposed to support an increase in parliamentary salaries, are in some way feathering their own nests by virtue of this legislation and have thought that the remarks of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) and the honorahle member for Forrest( Mr Freeth), who followed him, would have completely removed that impression, but if any one on the Opposition benches or, for that matter, in any other part of the chamber, is in any doubt on the matter, I can assure him from direct personal experience that no member of the Cabinet, so far as I am aware is aware! I have a fairly good knowledge of what is going on among my colleagues. saying. sure. I know my own situation as well as that of my colleagues and far from receiving some payment in excess of what, was recommended by the Nicholas comof the Cabinet are, in fact, receiving less than was recommended. Therefore, we can hardly be accused of having in some way greased the pig on this occasion. As the Treasurer and honorahle member Ministers have, by virtue of the reconstatus. They are now to receive payment accordingly. No Minister who, before the passage of this legislation, enjoyed the status of senior Minister, will receive one penny more. Ministers will get something.

There has been no serious attempt to criticize the Cabinet structure which the Prime Minister has constituted and the attacks of honorahle members opposite have been directed to the fact that some Ministers' salaries are to be brought in line with those of other colleagues with whose duties their own are consonant. That is the position as I see it. I hope that that explanation is clear, at least to those who sit on the Government side and support the Government, and that they will have no doubt as to where their support should be directed when the vote is taken.

Both those issues are of considerable importance. The third issue, I say, transcends them in importance, and ranks with the most important issues with which this Parliament has ever had to deal. The third issue is that an attempt has been made, by stealth, to increase the salaries of senior Ministers in a government without the knowledge of the Parliament which was expected to pass the legislation. I do not know whether an exactly similar situation to that has ever arisen in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament, but it is one that is shameful to men who should be a pattern of honour in the public life of this country. I read the words which the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) himself used when informing this House of what was being done. The Ministers must have known what was being done because what was being done effected them personally, yet this is what the Treasurer saidThe increase of the munber of Ministers will involve a consequential addition to the annual sum set aside for Ministers' salaries, and the bill provides fnr this increase. I ask every honourable member of the House to note thisThe amount of the increase is limited to the minimum needed to provide salaries under the arrangements now proposed, the arrangements proposed being the increase in the number of Ministers and the consequential addition to the sum. for their salaries. Those were the words used by the Treasurer. status of the Cabinet. Do not forget that the words used by the Treasurer. I point, out to the House that that was the sole explanation given by the right honourable gentleman to the House for the increase in the Cabinet pool appropriation from £41,000 to £46,500. At the same time, an attempt was made to force the bill through the House at one sitting. The second-reading debate was not to he adjourned in orcier to give us an opportunity to consider the measure. The House and the nation were placed in this position. First, the servants of the Parliament, the Ministers, refused to the House a true explanation of the contents of the bill which they brought before it. Secondly, the nation itself was deceived by the trustees of the public purse as to the purpose for which the increased appropriation from the public purse was to be used. The shameful fact about it is that the deception was of this character, that the a ppropriation, about which the House and the nation were to know nothing, and which was to be forced through this chamber in one hour last night, was to be used to increase the emoluments of senior Ministers. tbem. The third point with which I am now dealing is not whether those increases a.re justified. That has nothing to do with it. It is not whether an increase of the number of Ministers is justified. That also has nothing to clo with the matter. The point that I am discussing ancl emphasizing is that an attempt was made to deceive the House in the appropriation of public funds for the private benefit of men who are the trustees of those funds-the Ministers in this Government. That is something quite shameful. I am certain it is quite unprecedented in the history of the Australian Parliament and probably unprecedented in the history of any ""ther parliament. There is a biblical saying about the man who cometh like a thief in the night, and I apply it to the manner in which this bill was presented to the House last night. If that manceuvre had succeeded, four Ministers would have added to their own emoluments out of thp 'public purse at the cost of the taxpayers, without the House or the taxpayers having had any knowledge of the purpose for which that money was to be used. I believe that, in bringing this legislation forward as its first measure in the new Parliament, and in attempting by evasion and stealth to prevent the House and the nation from knowing the real purpose behind the bill, the Government has made an indelible blot upon its recorda blot which will not readily be forgotten or forgiven by the people of Australia.",48,Thebd Eeading

Treasurer entitled to make a second-reading speech during the discussion of an amendment to the motion, "" That the bill be now read a third time "" ? I remind you, sir, if I may do so, with deference, that the argument must relate to the question before the House at the time. The Treasurer is rambling and ambling on in his usual way, is ignoring your position, the traditions of this Parliament, and your rulings. I suggest that the discussion be brought back to the question whether the. bill be read a third time now or six months hence. that ruling, I am afraid that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr ment. In no case will a Minister receive Calwell) and his colleague would not have got very far. I am simply allowing a little latitude on account of the peculiar ambiguity about that explanation. There circumstances applying to-night. right honourable gentleman is going too far. able gentleman knows that he should remain silent while the Speaker is on his feet, or at least I thought he knew that. I shall allow the Treasurer to proceed. understand the point taken by the honourable member for Melbourne, because the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, in the course of his speech in justification of withdrawing the bill accused the Government, and he accused me as representing the Government, of deceiving the House and the country in respect of the amount and the reason for the required appropriation as provided in clause 4 of the bill. It is my responsibility to say that there was no deception, there was no back-handed method, and there was nothing ambiguous in the opposite presentation of this bill and the explanation that I gave of it when the opportunity was afforded to me. I repeat that it has been a long tradition, of which honourable members will be aware, that the sum provided is allotted entirely at the discretion of the Prime Minister. That tradition, of course, is maintained, but notwithstanding this, I am quite prepared to explain to the House, on the Prime Minister's behalf, that since 1952. when the act was last amended, the Prime Minister has arranged payments to Ministers completely within the spirit of the report of the Nicholas committee, which sat in 1951 and reported in January, 1952. Since then, I repeat, there has been no review of ministerial salaries nor has any such review heen sought. Furthermore, I explained also to the House that the increase of £5,500 now sought is still within the spirit of the Nicholas committee's report and, in fact, is absolutely the minimum increase by which salaries recommended by that committee can he paid to the new Ministers and consequential adjustments made in the payments to some other Ministers arising from the new Cabinet arrangemore than was recommended by the Nicholas conimittee. There can be no can be no deception about the provision, the and the purpose of the provision, of the £5,500 that is sought under clause 4 of the bill.

Not one member of the House thought otherwise. My colleague, the honourable memher for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), dealt with the matter and analysed it last night, and no attempt was made then by the Treasurer to answer his case. Sir ARTHUR. could be made. could be made. Instead of the gags that were moved last night the facts could have been put to the House. We are in this position: The great point in the bill -the only point I discussed in the debate this afternoon-wa s whether it was necessary to increase the number of Ministers by two, having regard to the enormous reduction in functions since the war and the post-war period. My colleague's have dealt with that matter. Then it emerged to-night, after the speeches of the honordo not think that the conduct of the Goable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Canning( Mr at all. Hamilton), following what the Treasurer had said, that by a side wind to the main purposes of the measure, the provision for two new Ministers of State, each of four existing Ministers of State was to receive an increase of approximately £500 a year. That might be a perfectly legitimate proposition to put to the House, but it was not stated to the House. That is the point, and the Treasurer will not deal with it. A committee was appointed by the Government to deal with the salaries of honourable members, and because of the economic situation in this country, the Prime announced from the table of the House, towards the end of last year, that there was to be no increase in the salaries of honourable members despite the enormous increase in the cost of living. That was accepted by the House and the country. I do not know who will receive the salary increases. Will the Treasurer be good enough to tell us who are the four Ministers to receive the additional emoluments ? out of twelve. The right honourable gentleman is not entitled to the information he seeks. of the four increased? There is no suggestion that it has. These increases in salary, with no extra duties, are to be made after the mandate was issued by the Government that there were to he no more increases in salaries of members and this House. That was the point that was emphasized with considerable force by the honourable member for Canning. He said he was sick of it and disgusted with it. That is what we object to. It is not the main point of the bill. It is incidental to the bill, but it is a serious matter that this intention should be given effect in that way without frankness and openness. So we come to the main point. Has the Government made out its case? This amendment is designed to test the feeling of the House on that important point. 1 vernment can be justified in this respect If the Government is to increase the salaries of Ministers, whose duties are not altered so far as we know, it should tell the facts to the House and the country and then we shall pass judgment on them. I do not think that anybody would have known of this intention but for the intervention last evening of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, which produced to-day the speech of the Treasurer and the revelation of the surrounding circumstances hy the honourable member for Canning. This is a very serious matter affecting parliamentary governMinister( Mr Menzies) ment and the duty which the Government has to be frank to Parliament and the country. It has completely failed in that duty. Mr Speaker That the question be now put. The House divided.",51,Thebd Eeading

As a member of Webb. C. H . the Parliament, I believe that the will of the people, as expressed at the election for the House of Representatives, should prevail. After June, we shall have two senators whose party affiliations, policy Evatt, Dr. H . V. and practices have been absolutely rejected Daly, F. M . by the people of Australia. But they Brace. H . A. should not be in a position, either as the Clark, J. J. result of political manceuvring or political Riordan. W. J.

My attitude since soon after the present Government assumed office has been that, if governments are elected by the people, even though I may agree or disagree with them, the will of the people should not be frustrated by a legislative chamber that has not been elected broadly by the will of those people. I have no doubt that, in any review of the relationship of the two Houses of the Parliament, the Australian Labour party would seek to ensure that the desires of the people were not frustrated. Although His Excellency made no specific reference to the matter, I believe that, if a committee consisting of members of both Houses were appointed to resolve the difficulty with which the Government is faced, it could consider a",52,Fadden N O Answer Ministers That Is What Is Objected To In
171,"Wilson, K. C. _ Mr Peters (Scullin) [9.46]","As Imethod of electing senators that would ensure that an immense number of informal votes would not be cast. The method of Senate voting should be simplified to avoid the casting of one informal vote in every five votes cast, as happened at the last general election. That should not occur, and it occurs, of course, because of the number of candidates who seek election to the Senate, because of the method of preparation of the ballot papers, which means that the names of candidates are stretched across the papers, and also because the voters are not aware, from a study of the ballot-paper, of the identity of the particular party which each candidate is representing. That is also a matter which which could be considered by a committee of both Houses and comprised of members of both parties. The Governor General's Speech dealt with two other matters, defence and the economic condition of the country. His Excellency saidThe first embraces foreign policy and the related defence measures which can make that policy effective. The second can be described broadly as the economic problem. It has particular relation to internal development; the increase of production; restraint upon the rising costs of production 'which threaten to impair our internot doing so. There is every oppornational trading position; the encouragement of our exports; the control of our imports; the restoration of a sound balance of trade; the preservation and building up of our international financial reserves; and the protection who were with me on that visit overseas of our currency. Those two particular items had a very familiar ring. AfterI had left the Senate chamber at the conclusion of the Governor General's SpeechI obtained a copy of the speech that a former Governor General had made when opening the Parliament in 1950. I read that speech through carefully, and I found that a big proportion of it was devoted to the measures that were considered, essential to make the defences of this country adequate, and to other measures considered necessary to enable our economy to develop progressively in the interests of the nation. In relation to the economic position at that time the then Governor General statedMy Government views with grave concern said that it was intent on solving the increase which has been taking place in the economic problem. Honorahle memrecent years in the cost of living. It is realized that the solution of this problem is bers will recall that, in 1950, the not easy . . . An intensive review is at present being made by my Government of the causes of present price trends, with a view to determining the most effective measures which can be taken to remedy the current inflationary situation. Recently, by the grace of this Parliament, I visited our gateway in the north -Manus Island, our most northerly possession. ThereI found an air depot without an aeroplane, and a naval depot without a ship. I found also that, whilst the development of our northern areas may he slowly progressing, it is not progressing so rapidly as it should if this country is to establish buttresses between itself and people who, the Government alleges, are our potential enemies. After all, millions of pounds can be expended on military adventures in Asia and other distant parts of the world. Living between Malaya and Australia are 80,000,000 Indonesians and, if we are to believe some of the statements of the leading members of the Government on the danger from Malaya-and who am I to contradict them ? I do not contradict them-then , in a country with a population of the strength of ours, our first duty is to the people of the country. ""We should mend our own fences before we embark upon military adventures in any other country of the world. We certainly are tunity in Papua and New Guinea for development and improvement of our defences, as those members of Parliament realize. They know that we can develop the industries and the resources of those territories, and give them the requisites for adequate defence so that our northern gateway will not lie open to any potential enemy that may care to attack us. However, I shall leave that matter in order to deal with the economic problems that confront the nation. As I have already said, in 1950 the Government said, ""We have problems, one of which is rising prices"". The problem of rising prices includes, of course, as members of the Government themselves pointed out, the problem of increasing production. Through the medium of the Governor General's Speech in 1950 the Government then Treasurer introduced a budget which, he said, was designed to remedy our economic ills and to destroy inflation. In 1953, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court decided, measures had proved inadequate, to suspend the operation of the quarterly adjustment of the basic wage and the hearing of the margins case. ""Why did the court take that step? It did so in order to cure inflation, in order to remedy to day. A wise Treasurer would have the problem that the Government itself said, in 1950, all its measures were designed to remedy. Now we have a position, nearly six years later, in which people outside these legislative halls are advancing the proposition that the Government can remedy inflation by certain drastic means. These people are learned professors. They are economists from all parts of Australia, and the solution they advocate is an increase of taxes, both direct and indirect. Of course, the Government will probably heed their suggestions. But who does not remember the horror budget which the Treasurer introduced in 1951, contemplation of the provisions of which filled the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) himself with horror? ""What were the measures proposed in that budget? Increased taxes, both direct and indirect! The Government on that occasion said that it intended to skim off the excess purchasing power of the community. So it increased abnormally the burden of both direct and indirect taxes on the ordinary section of the community. gentleman's election speech? a pretty good one. However, in spite of that budget, in spite of the fact that the Government had drawn off the excess purchasing power of the community, inflation continued to mount. But new problems then arose-unemploymen t and the danger of overseas insolvency. In 1952, the Prime Minister pointed out over the air that the nation faced international insolvency unless stringent measures were taken to obviate it. He said that we must impose the most rigid import restrictions. But we of the Opposition had been pointing out, month after month, the dangers that were facing this country. We had pointed out that overseas balances were diminishing month after month and that unemployment was mounting in certain industries. We told the Government that every action that it had taken would lead inevitably to the development of the posibecause the Government's tion that did develop in 1952. Of course, any government or any wise administrator in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs would have seen the position developing from day been aware of the position developing from day to day and, in his wisdom, and in the interests of this country, he would have taken the necessary measures to prevent a catastrophe. The Government did take some measures. As a result of those measures, it claimed that it had conquered inflation, and that our overseas position was remedied. The Government then adopted a new policy in connection with imports, and the depletion of the overseas balances began again. The situation deteriorated more and more rapidly, until, just before the last Parliament went before the people, the Prime Minister in an economic statement to this House, pointed out that we were again in danger of overseas insolvency, that we were facing an economic blizzard, that a crisis was looming ahead. He said that his Government had certain propositions for coping with the position and that if they were not successful, the Government would inaugurate, at a later date, more severe remedies in order to cure the economic ills of this country. Honourable members will remember how the Prime Minister brought to Canberra the representatives of hire-purchase organizations. He said to them, "" The position that has developed to-day is due to the fact that you people are providing too much money for the purchase of goods on time payment"". Honourable members will remember, too, that he told the representatives of private banking institutions that he desired them to restrict credit to all sections of the community, because it was the credit that the private banking institutions were issuing to the public that was causing the economic blizzard, or crisis, that existed at that particular time. The crisis exists to-day. Of course, honourable members remember all those things. This Government has done nothing to remedy the position.",54,Governor General S Speech

But that did not eventuate. I do say that the private banking institutions are, to a large extent, to blame. If taxation means the reduction of the living standards of the vast mass of the people; if it means the reduction of the capacity of the people to purchase homes; if it means the reduction of their capacity to purchase refrigerators and the reduction of their capacity to purchase the ordinary amenities of life, then increased taxation will not be a solution of the problem that concerns this Government and this country.
