Wednesday, 17 September 2003 ----prayers. Medicare: Bulk-Billing very clear message to this House. They want to save Medicare. They have sent their message in the form of a petition containing more than 2,400 signatures. This petition shows that thousands of locals in my seat are worried about the future of Medicare. They are worried that they will be locked out of health care. They are worried that their children and their grandchildren will be denied access to universal health care-and they are right to be worried. We know that the government’s planned changes to Medicare mean that families earning more than $32,300 a year will miss out on bulk-billing. Hospitals are being put under greater pressure because people who cannot find a doctor who bulk-bills are going to hospitals for treatment. For thousands of people in my electorate who signed the petition to save Medicare, these are very real concerns. The future of Medicare is something they take very seriously. That is why so many locals took the time to sign this petition. They took the opportunity to come to talk to me about Medicare when I spent several Saturday mornings collecting signatures at shopping centres in Riverwood and Penshurst. A lot of the people who spoke to me about their concerns were parents. They said they were worried that if their kids were sick they might not be able to afford a doctor. In presenting this petition today, I give my commitment to the people of Banks that I will work to deliver on Labor’s campaign to save Medicare. Under John Howard, Australia is moving rapidly towards the Americanisation of our health system. In the United States, 45 million people do not have any health cover. If they get sick or injured they either go without treatment or face financial ruin. Labor will not tolerate that sort of health system in Australia. Labor will save Medicare for all Australian families. I present a petition from 2,481 citizens, drawing to the attention of the House that under the proposed changes to Medicare families earning more than $32,300 a year will miss out on bulk-billing and doctors will increase their fees for visits that are no longer bulk-billed; that the rate of bulk-billing by GPs has plummeted by 11 per cent under John Howard; that more than 10 million fewer GP visits were bulk-billed this year compared to when John Howard came to office; that the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP who does not bulk-bill has gone up by 55 per cent since 1996-to $12.78 today; and that public hospitals are now under greater pressure because people are finding it harder to see bulk-billing doctors. The petitioners pray that the House takes urgent steps to restore bulk-billing by general practitioners and rejects John Howard’s plan to end universal bulk-billing. These signatures have been certified by the Deputy Clerk as required by the standing orders. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment Also Reported By Reuters

(Time expired) Health: Eczema Awareness Week would like to take this opportunity to let the House know about some of the daily difficulties faced by eczema sufferers. Eczema belongs to a category of diseases called atopic-a term often used to describe allergic conditions where there is a family history. Eczema is a common, non-infectious inflammatory skin disease where the skin becomes red, dry, itchy or scaly and may weep and bleed and crust over. The word eczema comes from the Greek word meaning to boil over. It is the continual itch of eczema that separates it from other skin diseases, such as psoriasis. The condition can spread over the entire body but commonly affects the face, hands and creases of the elbows and knees. Triggers can include stress, foods, preservatives, chemicals, pollens, dust mites, toiletries and weather conditions. A change of season often triggers eczema to flare up and often this flare-up occurs around springtime. Eczema affects one in three Australians. The skin disease is most common in children, but it can occur in people of any age. My own children suffer from eczema from time to time. Over the last 30 years, the prevalence of eczema has increased from one in 10 people to almost one in three. While 60 per cent of people will grow out of symptoms, others will suffer them for life. The management of eczema can cost a sufferer up to $2,000 a year, with 40 per cent of sufferers using four or more products to treat their eczema. Managing eczema is a constant battle involving dietary restrictions; avoidance of allergens and irritants; and daily moisturising with emollients, plus the application of topical steroids if flare-ups occur. The constant itching and scratching of eczema can lead to sleep disturbance, infections and days off work and school. There are many wonderful groups out there in the community who work hard to promote worthwhile causes. The Eczema Association of Australasia is one such group. The Eczema Association of Australasia was established in 1994 by Heather Jacobs. It provides support and assistance to eczema sufferers and their families and is a national, non-profit organisation with international links. Throughout its nine-year history, the association has developed a good working relationship with Australian and international dermatologists, doctors, pharmaceutical companies and political representatives. The Eczema Association of Australasia offers members extensive counselling and support, quarterly newsletters, a web site featuring information on a wide range of topics and samples of cutting edge products.

308,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (9.43 A.m.),"This week is Eczema Awareness Week, and Izema Awareness Week, I commend the association’s great work to the House and thank the association for the work it does to help eczema sufferers. (Time expired) Bendigo Electorate: Calder Highway the funding of the Calder Highway when he said during question time: So if it had not been for this government-and I am sure the member has told the Bendigo Advertiser this-none of that would have occurred; none of the extension would have occurred because there were no roads of national importance. He concluded by saying: I am sure that the Labor Party would acknowledge the fact that there would have been no funding if it had not been for the coalition. This was blatantly wrong. The Treasurer has misled the parliament and he should at the very least explain his answer to the House immediately after he returns from overseas. These are the facts: it was the Hawke Labor government that started the duplication of the Calder Highway. The federal Labor government by 1996 had provided around $75 million for reconstructing and duplicating the Calder Highway under a number of roads programs. It provided $2.8 million for the Gap Hill to Gisborne preconstruction; $15.2 million for the Kyneton bypass; $7.1 million for the Diggers Rest to Gap Hill preconstruction; $29.2 million for the Diggers Rest bypass; $13.2 million for the Keilor to Diggers Rest duplication; $2.04 million for the Big Hill to Ravenswood duplication and $2.05 million for the Harcourt to Ravenswood duplication. Labor set a target to finish the entire Calder Highway duplication from Melbourne to Bendigo by the year 2000. This project would have been completed three years ago if it had received the same support from the Howard government as it received from the previous Labor government; it did not get that support. Liberal-National coalition governments under Mr Kennett in 1992 and then again under Mr Howard from 1996 abandoned Labor’s 2000 completion deadline and stalled the project. The Howard government does not have a deadline for the Calder; all it has is a dead end. There is one reality about the Calder: the massive federal upgrade of the Calder was born under the federal Labor government and it has been killed off under the Howard government. The Treasurer has reneged on his 2001 election commitment to Bendigo to match the funding put down by the Bracks state government. The Prime Minister has reneged on his promise to complete the Calder. The Calder Highway today is John Howard’s ‘Calder Lie way’. Mr Howard’s government has excised the Bendigo district from its map of Australia and now the government has resorted to minister smuggling. Recently Mr Anderson crept into central Victoria without being seen by the people of Bendigo. Mr Anderson is the invisible man. He is the phantom of the highway, the ghost who does not talk. Labor commenced construction of the Calder nearly 20 years ago and the Liberal and National parties have deliberately scrapped it. No electorate is suffering as cruelly from the federal government as the Bendigo electorate. Last year the government claimed it could not afford to fund the Calder because of the drought. This year it claimed it could not afford the Calder because of the drought, the bushfires and the invasion of Iraq, and it has also refused MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Statements By Members
309,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (9.46 A.m.),"Last Thursday the Treasurer misled the House overto help the victims of the tornadoes that savaged Bendigo recently. Next year it will no doubt claim it cannot afford to pay for the Calder because of its intervention in the Solomons. How come Bendigo always foots so much of the bill for natural disasters and the foreign adventures of the Howard government? The government now has a five-year freeze on funding the Calder. The freeze will last until at least 2006-07. It has no commitment to fund the Calder even after that date. Over this five-year period, on my broad calculations, the electorate of Bendigo will be paying around $450 million in federal fuel excise and GST on that excise and not one cent of that is coming back to the Calder, central Victoria’s lifeline to Melbourne. Bendigo people ask: what has this government got against Bendigo and central Victoria? How can it rip taxes out of the Calder motorists and give us nothing back for our major highway? (Time expired) Queensland Government vember 2001, I came here with the intention of representing very forcefully the constituents of Ryan, to make sure that their concerns and interests were represented in the federal parliament. That is my position. I thought that all members of parliament at the state and federal levels would do that, but it seems that some in the Labor Party do not subscribe to that view. They are more interested in talking about the other parties. So it was with some astonishment that I read an article in the paper about the state Labor member for Logan, in Queensland, who it seems is more interested in what is happening in the Liberal Party than in his constituency. He seems to have a lot to say about those in government, but he does not seem to have much to say about his own electorate. I thought I might take a look at Mr Mickel’s representations on behalf of his electorate. I had a look at his maiden speech and at some of the things that are important to him. He talked about jobs being important. He said that the way that social security can be enhanced is to give people jobs. I wanted to let the parliament know that Mr Mickel’s electorate of Logan has nine per cent unemployment. I have looked for speeches and representations that the state member for Logan has made about the work that he is doing in his electorate to provide jobs for his constituents. Nowhere can I find them. He is a member of the Queensland government who clearly is not doing his job as a local member. Some nine per cent of his electorate is unemployed. For an electorate that has weekly rents of $150 to $200 and weekly individual incomes of between $300 and $400, I would have thought that the member for Logan would be more interested in representing his electorate and the concerns of his constituents than worrying about what is taking place in other political parties. Payroll tax has been increased by the Queensland government. It has gone up dramatically. There are record levels of unemployment in Queensland. Compare that to what the federal government is doing here in Canberra for the people of Australia. Nationally, the unemployment rate is 5.8 per cent. It could be far less if the opposition supported the government’s position. Stamp duty conveyance is up nearly 30 per cent in Queensland. I want to say to the Queensland Premier and the Queensland government: let us get on with the business of looking after our own electorates. Let us get on with the business of looking after the people of Queensland instead of worrying about all these other things. Insurance tax in Queensland is up 22 per cent from last year. I say to the Queensland Premier: tell your members of parliament to look after their own electorates. Look after the people of Queensland. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Statements By Members
310,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (9.49 A.m.),"When I was elected to the federal parliament in NoHuman Rights: Burma the Sagaing division in the north of Burma. This visit was a popular triumph, and large crowds welcomed her to the opening of a new office of the National League for Democracy, or NLD. At that time, members of the pro-junta Union Solidarity Development Association were deployed to attack the motorcade. This led to the death of a number of NLD supporters. Following this attack, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested. She is being held under section 10(a) of the 1975 State Protection Law. This law allows detention without access to family or lawyers for 180 days at a time, for up to a total of five years. Aung San Suu Kyi has no prospect of appeal. It is very clear that this was a premeditated attack and crackdown. The day after the attack, all NLD offices throughout the nation were closed. The regime also ordered the immediate closure of universities and tertiary colleges, just two days before the start of the new term. This attack on democracy should concern all Australians and all those good citizens of the international community who are concerned to uphold democratic and human rights. The National League for Democracy received 82 per cent of the vote in the May 1990 general election. It is very clear that it is the legitimate government. The military junta has oppressed the Burmese people and is responsible for murder and constant human rights abuses. The current detention follows Ms Kyi’s being held in detention prior to May 2002 for some 19 months. If we are to have credibility in speaking about human rights abuses and the need for democracy in places like Iraq, Australia must take a much stronger stance on the Burmese situation. The situation whereby Australia has a so-called Burma human rights initiative is simply not good enough. As South Africa showed us, sanctions do work, and the Burmese government should be isolated until such time as the junta steps aside and the democratically elected government takes its place.

While many of these initiatives are focused on benefits for the wider community, in some cases a group of people rally to help an individual and their family during a time of need. I have seen no better example of such support than those in the Coffs Harbour community who have rallied behind Allan and Julie McCabe. Allan McCabe was an ordinary father of one when he ran onto the field at the grand final of the local rugby union competition in August last year. The excitement of the big occasion soon turned to tragedy when Allan collapsed following an innocuous piece of play. It was obvious that Allan had suffered serious injuries, as medical specialists later confirmed when they told Allan that he would be a quadriplegic for the rest of his life. I am sure that all my colleagues in the House can appreciate how devastating such news was to Allan and his wife, Julie, who was pregnant with their second child at the time, and to all their family and friends. However, sometimes in periods of great adversity there is opportunity, and in this instance the opportunity has been created by the strength of the McCabe family and their nucleus of friends. Shortly after the accident a management committee was formed with a view to raising enough funds to build the McCabes a purpose-built house.

312,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (9.55 A.m.),"In my electorate of CowperI have enjoyedpledged their time and materials once construction commences. At a recent black tie function at Opal Cove Resort in Coffs Harbour, two of our most well-known Australians, Kieren Perkins and Alan Jones, joined more than 300 people to raise funds for the McCabes. I would like to note my gratitude to those parliamentary colleagues and staff who, through their genuine empathy with the McCabes or their love of the rugby family, made a contribution towards the fundraising activities on that night. But the real recognition must go to those residents of Coffs Harbour who have been 100 per cent behind the McCabes since the accident. The Chairman of the Allan McCabe Trust, Allan Sparkes, deserves special mention, as does former Wallaby and Coffs Harbour resident, Dwayne Vignes. Then there is the fundraising management committee, which is made up of friends such as Julie Wills, Ngaire Robinson, Donna Parkins, Jenny Ryan, Narelle Corless and Maekila Miller. Their commitment has been complemented by supportive businesses, including Des Taylor from Belbowrie Motors, who has provided a vehicle to transport Allan and the family around. As Allan and Julie continue to rebuild their lives with their two children-Gabriell, who is aged seven, and Bethany, who is nearly one-they do so with the knowledge that they have an extended family in Coffs Harbour that wants to ensure they live a comfortable and productive life. That says a lot for the goodwill of the Coffs Harbour area. It is true that a lot has been achieved in the 12 months since the accident but, for all those involved in the trust, the hard work is just beginning. As Allan McCabe continues his rehabilitation, he and his family and friends know that many challenges lie ahead. But, most importantly, he understands that the journey is one that will be shared by many throughout the community who will provide much-needed ongoing support. der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by Mr Slipper: That this bill be now read a second time. most entirely non-controversial and I will be brief in talking about it. It contains seven schedules and Labor will support all of them. The first schedule deals with the franking of nonshare dividends. Non-share dividends are returns made on interests characterised under the debt-equity rules of division 974 as equity interests that are not in the form of shares. An example of these is reset preference shares. Under existing law, dividends on shares have to be paid out of realised profits to be frankable. To ensure non-share dividends were treated in a similar manner, the imputation rules required franking of non-share dividends to be made out of available frankable profits. Available frankable profits were intended to be defined as both profits on hand and expected profits minus committed share dividends. However, expected profits were not included in the calculation. Schedule1 would allow a company to use expected profits to fund frankable non-share dividends. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Statements By Members

314,Mr Cox (Kingston) (9.59 A.m.),"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 is alThe second schedule is a set of consolidation measures dealing with cost-setting rules and franking deficit tax offsets. Parts1 to 6 of schedule 2 amend the cost-setting rules for consolidating groups. The head company will be required to choose an effective life for certain depreciating assets brought into a consolidated group where the prime cost method was used to determine the decline in value just before the joining time. The cost base for a pre capital gains tax asset that is rolled over will be the same as the cost applicable to the originator of the rollover for the purposes of the cost-splitting rules. A new capital gains tax event-L8will apply where there is an excess allocable cost amount on joining that cannot be allocated to reset cost based assets. An asset’s entitlement to accelerated depreciation will be reserved in certain circumstances-that is, if it has been held continuously since a particular date. Unfranked dividends will be required to be paid in working out the adjustment to the cost for certain overdepreciated assets where unfranked profits are included in working out the allocable cost amount during the transitional period. Finally, an anomaly will be corrected that bases penalties for errors in cost setting on the error and not the tax associated with the error. Part7 of schedule 2 corrects an error in the existing consolidation regime that allowed certain tax requirements that applied to head companies not to apply to MEC groups. This measure is retrospective to 1 July 2002 to cover a gap in liability caused by that drafting error. Treasury maintain that MECs would have recognised that the requirements for Australian head companies were meant to apply to them. If anyone recognised the gap and tried to exploit it, they would be caught by this provision. Treasury know of no instances where that is the case. Senators may want to ask the Tax Commissioner a question in estimates to confirm that. Part8 of schedule 2 contains rules for franking deficit tax. Any joining company’s excess or unapplied franking deficit tax offset will be transferred to the head company. The head company will be allowed to apply the franking deficit tax offset in accordance with the provisions of the simplified imputation system. A joining subsidiary will be prevented from applying any franking deficit tax offset whilst a member of a consolidated group, and any franking deficit tax offsets will remain with the head company upon the departure of any subsidiary from the group. Schedule3 provides an income tax deduction for taxpayers entering into conservation covenants with the Commonwealth, a state, a territory or a local government body. The amount of the deduction will be determined by the commissioner through the Australian Valuation Office and will be equal to the fall in the market value of the land as a result of the conservation covenant. That tax benefit may be spread over five years at the taxpayer’s discretion, as is the case with gifts of property to deductible gift recipients. Schedule4 deals with fringe benefits tax depreciation rates for cars. The commissioner announced on 20 June 2002 that, for cars acquired after 30 June 2002, the effective life would be increased from six years and eight months to eight years for income tax depreciation purposes. Schedule4 realigns the deemed depreciation rate used under the operating cost method for valuing car fringe benefits with the new effective life determination. The amendment applies in respect of cars acquired after 30 June 2002. The amendment will only affect car fringe benefits valued using the operating cost method, which is beneficial for taxpayers with a very high proportion of business use. It does not affect the value of fringe benefits on cars using the statutory formula, which is used by most taxpayers. If this was going to cause the car inMAIN COMMITTEE dustry any grief, I am sure that as the member for Mitsubishi I would have heard about it by now. Schedule5 will permit statutory bodies that are established in perpetuity by the Commonwealth parliament to be endorsed by the commissioner as deductible gift recipients, despite not having a winding-up clause. These organisations are probably collecting institutions like the War Memorial. Winding-up clauses require the assets of a deductible gift recipient to be transferred to an organisation of like purpose. Obviously, if the organisation is going to be there in perpetuity, like the War Memorial, the assets are not going to need to be transferred to an organisation of like purpose. Schedule6 will make it easier for primary producers to determine if an entity is eligible to issue them with farm management deposits, by replacing references to prudential supervision or regulation under a law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory with the requirement that the entity be an authorised deposit-taking institution under the Banking Act 1959. I just reflect that at times it has been difficult for some states to know what financial institutions they are supposed to be supervising prudentially, let alone for some poor farmer who is looking to purchase a farm management deposit to know whether an organisation is being prudentially supervised by anybody rational or competent. Schedule7 will provide rules under the simplified imputation system to allow entities that have incurred a franking deficit tax liability to offset this amount against an income tax liability. Special rules are provided for life insurance companies to ensure that a franking deficit tax liability can only be offset against that part of the company’s income tax liability that is attributable to its shareholders. I hope the bill will be dealt with in an equally expeditious manner by the Senate. ston, he is certainly keeping up with that ideal. I rise today to add to the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003. As I have said previously in the House, all too often taxation amendment legislation passes through both chambers without too much attention because, more often than not, the amendments concern what we like to call housekeeping issues and are designed to tidy up our taxation system. As the previous opposition speaker, the member for Kingston, said, this legislation is not controversial. However, I take great interest in the amendments that we make to our taxation system, as every little change is one step further in a streamlined, smooth-running and efficient system. At all times this government is listening to the Australian people and trying, wherever possible, to provide them with what they want. In fact, many of the amendments in this legislation are the result of listening to what various sectors think about the taxation laws and keeping an open mind as to how to improve the system. For example, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 seeks to amend farm management deposits. I have taken a particular interest in this amendment because, as I am sure you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent an electorate which is very much a rural one and which is home to thousands of primary producers. The purpose of this amendment is to make it easier for these primary producers to determine if an entity is eligible to issue farm management deposits. Currently the law requires farm management deposits to be made with a financial institution as defined by the current law. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No 8 2003
315,Mr Secker (Barker) (10.07 A.m.),"If brevity is the talisman for the member for KingThis amendment clarifies which entities are authorised deposit-taking institutions and therefore eligible to issue farm management deposits, thus ensuring that primary producers can benefit from the scheme as designed rather than unwittingly placing funds in an unauthorised entity. This amendment also seeks to protect the tax status of certain pre 1 July 2003 deposits and transfers that were made in good faith with noncomplying entities offering products described as farm management deposits. Currently, if deposits are made with an entity that is not a financial institution-that is, an unauthorised, noncompliant entity-then the deposits are not considered as farm management deposits. This amendment seeks to treat certain noncomplying entities as financial institutions in relation to pre 1 July 2003 deposits and transfers. This means that those deposits and transfers will be treated as farm management deposits, provided the other requirements of the scheme are met. These amendments will complement recent changes to the farm management regulations that require entities to declare their financial institution status. The clarification of the term ‘financial institution’ will take effect from 1 July 2003 and ensure that the primary producers that make deposits with or transfer the deposit to a noncomplying entity before 1 July 2003 will have the tax status of their deposits protected. All in all, these amendments introduce some positive changes to the scheme and work for the benefit of the primary producer. The government is very conscious of just what a tough year primary producers across the nation have had. We are doing all we can to ensure that they have every opportunity available to them to help them plan for their future. That was also the case at the end of last year when the government legislated to enable farmers to make a rough estimate of the amount they wanted to put into farm management deposits by 30 June each year. I am particularly proud of this legislative change, as it was drafted as a direct result of a query from one of my constituents in the seat of Barker. That proves that this government does listen to and act on the concerns, statements and ideas of the Australian population. I must add that my colleague Senator Grant Chapman played a strong role in getting this legislation drafted, and his hard work has certainly benefited the many primary producers in my electorate of Barker and all around Australia. Prior to the introduction of this piece of legislation, farmers could not, before accurately finalising their financial statements and knowing their net income, put more money into a farm management deposit in a particular year than they may wish to have in the farm management deposit when their income position for tax purposes is finalised and then withdraw the surplus in less than 12 months without it detrimentally affecting the validity of the remainder as a farm management deposit. However, as a result of this concern being raised with the government, the federal government legislated just prior to the Christmas recess. The change enabled greater flexibility in making farm management deposits and has increased their usefulness. Farmers can now make a rough estimate of the amount they want to put into farm management deposits by 30 June each year and, if the subsequent calculations show this to be more than they needed to put in for sensible financial management or for income tax purposes, they can then withdraw-as long as it is less than 12 months of depositing-a portion of the amount, with the balance remaining as a legitimate farm management deposit. This amount then becomes income for taxation purposes; however, prior to this, any amounts withdrawn meant the farm manageMAIN COMMITTEE ment deposit was invalid and the entire income of the deposit would have been considered a taxable income. This is a very sensible amendment, as I am sure you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker. As someone with quite a bit of experience in the agricultural field, you would know that often in the month of June farmers are still putting in crops, and that is their priority-not knowing the exact amount in their books so that they can organise their farm management deposits. Like the legislation that we are considering today, this amendment is a result of the government interacting with the Australian people and making decisions with them to benefit them. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 also seeks to implement changes as requested by the Australian taxpayer. A measure to amend the imputation rules contained in the income tax laws that deal with the franking of non-share dividends is contained in this legislation. This is yet another example of listening to what Australians want and working with them to govern the country. Prior to this amendment, a company could only frank non-share dividends with available profits after amounts required to secure future dividends were taken into account. The trouble with this scenario is that, while it acknowledges that future dividends reduce the amount of available profits, it does not take into account expected future income and profits that will be available to frank non-share dividends at the required time. That is why this amendment has been sought-to ensure that any future profits a company expects to generate can be taken into account, so that future dividends do not bear so much of an impact on current profits available for franking non-share dividends. This amendment will apply to non-share dividends paid on or after 1 July 2001, the date when the debt/equity rules first applied. This legislation also seeks to amend laws relating to consolidated groups. To enhance the consolidation regime, this legislation allows for wholly owned groups to be treated as single entities for income tax purposes. With the introduction of the consolidation regime, a number of enhancements will help to further clarify the consolidation cost setting rules and ensure that the income tax law that applies to head companies of consolidated groups also applies to head companies of multiple entity consolidated groups. These amendments have a retrospective effect to 1 July 2002, which is when the consolidation regime commenced. There are many issues that this amendment seeks to address. It will remove the unintended outcomes in relation to depreciating assets where the prime cost method is used. It will ensure that the cost base for a pre CGT asset that is rolled over is the same as the originator’s cost base for the purpose of the consolidation cost setting rules. It will also ensure that accelerated depreciation is available for an asset of an entity that joins a consolidated group, provided that there has not been a disposal for which rollover relief was not provided, and ensure that the requirement that unfranked dividends have been paid is met where unfranked profits are included in working out the allocable cost amount during the transitional period. It will base penalties on the amount of tax associated with any error, rather than on the amount of the error, and apply the income tax law concerning CGT and the measures to address unintended tax benefits to head companies of MEC groups in the same way that they apply to consolidated groups. It also seeks to pool the FDT offset entitlements in the company at the time of formation of the group when a subsidiary joins the group and allow the head company to apply the offsets against the group’s income tax liability, consistent with the application of the franking deficit tax offset provisions of the simplified imputation system. MAIN COMMITTEE Currently, FDT is payable where a company franks dividends to shareholders without sufficient franking credits to do so. Companies that have incurred an FDT liability can offset this amount against an income tax liability, and special rules are provided for life insurance companies to ensure that an FDT liability can only be offset against that part of the company’s income tax liability that is attributable to shareholders. The amendments in this legislation will mean that companies will continue to be entitled to allow FDT to be offset against company tax by inserting rules into the SIS. Generally, the rules remain the same, with the exception that the former franking additional tax provisions have been replaced with a simplified penalty for excess over-franking. In fact, under the rewritten provisions where there is excess over-franking, a company’s FDT offset against future company tax liabilities will reduce by 30 per cent. In addition, the FDT offset will be treated as a tax offset and thus part of a taxpayer’s assessment. The SIS gives companies more flexibility in franking dividends and reduces their compliance costs, and it is another of this government’s business tax reform measures. The FDT offset rules will generally apply to events arising on or after 1 July 2002, when the SIS rules commenced. The reduction of a company’s FDT offset against future company tax, where over-franking occurs, will generally apply to FDT liabilities arising at the end of 200203 and later income years. The legislation also includes measures to provide an income tax deduction for taxpayers entering into certain types of conservation covenants with government entities. This amendment will extend the deduction to taxpayers entering into certain types of conservation covenants with the Commonwealth, a state or a territory. This legislation is particularly poignant for many rural electorates as the amendment will provide landholders with a greater incentive to protect and manage their land for conservation purposes. As I travel around my rural electorate of Barker, I do see some cases where land degradation is apparent. Being a farmer myself, I understand the conflict that primary producers feel when deciding what the best method for land regeneration is without impacting too heavily on their survival. I know that many farmers would like to enter into conservation covenants, but the fact of the matter is they just cannot afford to do that. Farmers have workers to pay, stock to feed and crops to tend to and it all costs money. Some farmers just cannot afford to enter into conservation covenants. Currently, some landholders may claim an income tax deduction subject to certain conditions when they enter into conservation covenants with certain deductible gift recipients and prescribed private funds. Eligible conservation covenants are those that restrict or prohibit activities that degrade the environmental value of the land and are approved by the minister. Deductions will be limited to covenants with more than $5,000 or covenants over land purchased within the 12 months. It is important to note that the amount of the deduction is determined by the Commissioner of Taxation and is generally equal to the fall in the market value of the land as a result of a conservation covenant. In some regions of my electorate of Barker we are greatly affected by dryland salinity. With many years of clearing natural growth to make way for land which can be farmed, the watertable has risen and there is increased salinity in the region. In the upper south-east and lower Murray areas, we are now having to undertake some serious work to try to restore and repair the land affected by this problem. With the dropping levels of the Murray River and the drought we all suffered through last year, land conservation and environmental damage are certainly in the forefront of the minds of many regional development board members and the MAIN COMMITTEE local community. If this amendment goes even just a little way toward encouraging landholders, big and small, to rejuvenate some of their land, then it is certainly a worthwhile amendment. While multifaceted, this legislation seeks to amend our taxation laws to remove anomalies which up until now have existed. I have to say that I am proud to be speaking to recommend this bill and to outline the importance of such housekeeping bills as this. There are two vital amendments contained in this legislation, which I know will be very beneficial to my constituents in Barker. For this reason, I commend the bill to the House, and I am sure that the opposition will do so as well. stration) (10.23 a.m.)-in reply-The member for Barker of course is an outstanding representative of his part of South Australia, and the fact that he gets up in the parliament and speaks so strongly in favour of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003 indicates that he is very much aware of what is good for his constituents and he continues that sound representation. At the outset, I would also like to thank the member for Kingston. He actually urged strong support for this bill. He mentioned that he rather hoped that the other place would give this bill speedy passage. Naturally, both the government and I share that important aspiration on the part of the member for Kingston. The member for Barker referred to farm management deposits, which are really important as far as many rural people are concerned. I thank the member for Barker for highlighting the important role of farm management deposits and the role that farm management deposits play in supporting primary producers to plan for their good and bad years. The amendment in this bill will give farmers greater certainty about those entities eligible to accept farm management deposits-and I can see the member for Barker is nodding about this important initiative. The bill generally makes amendments to the income tax law and other laws to give effect to several taxation measures. Each of the measures will refine the operation of the current law, improving the fairness and equity of the tax system. Schedule1 to this bill amends the imputation rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure non-share dividends can be franked in the manner intended by parliament. The amendments will ensure that entities can take into account expected profits when calculating if sufficient profits are available to frank a non-share dividend. Non-share dividends are intended to be frankable in the same way that dividends on shares are frankable. This measure will amend the rules that apply to non-share dividends to ensure they work fairly and equitably. The amendments in schedule 2 provide a number of further enhancements to the consolidation regime which will further clarify the cost setting rules and ensure the income tax law that applies to head companies of consolidated groups also applies to head companies of multiple entry consolidated groups. In addition, this bill introduces rules to permit the transfer of any unapplied excess franking deficits tax offset from joining entities to the head company. These amendments have retrospective effect to 1 July last year, which is the date of commencement of the consolidation regime. The amendments are beneficial to taxpayers or correct unintended outcomes. The amendments to address unintended outcomes are consistent with the original policy intent for the consolidation regime and therefore have the same commencement date as the consolidation regime.

This amendment will extend the deduction to taxpayers entering into certain conservation covenants with the Commonwealth, a state or a territory. The amendment will provide landholders with greater incentives to protect and manage their land for conservation purposes. I know the member for Cunningham, who is in the chamber, will strongly support this initiative of the government. I see that he is nodding and I thank him for his backing. Schedule4 of this bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to maintain alignment between the deemed appreciation rate used under the operating cost method for valuing a car fringe benefit and the rate used for depreciation purposes under the income tax provisions. This amendment will ensure that employees who take a car as a fringe benefit are not disadvantaged compared with those who purchase a car out of after-tax income. The amendments in schedule 5 amend the gift provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to remove the requirement to have a winding-up clause as part of the endorsement provisions for statutory bodies that are established by the Commonwealth parliament in perpetuity. The amendments are part of the government’s response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. Schedule6 of this bill will make it easier for primary producers to determine if an entity is eligible to issue farm management deposits. The amendments also protect the tax status of certain pre 1 July 2003 deposits and transfers that were made in good faith with noncomplying entities offering products described as farm management deposits. The approach will give farmers a transitional period of up to four years to move their funds into an appropriate institution while preserving the tax benefits. Schedule7 will amend the imputation rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow companies to offset a franking deficit tax liability against any future income tax liabilities. There are rules for both ordinary companies and life companies. These amendments are a further component of the simplified imputation system that commenced on 1 July last year. The rules will generally operate in a similar manner to the former franking deficit tax offsetting rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. However, a change, as previously announced by the government, is the replacement of the franking additional tax with the simplified penalty for over-franking. This penalty will apply to reduce a company’s franking deficit tax offset entitlement against future income tax liabilities by 30 per cent where there is overfranking. I thank the opposition for its support, and I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by Mr Williams: That this bill be now read a second time. 2003 makes amendments to the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964. The 1964 act provides that certain criminal laws applying in the Jervis Bay territory apply to Australian citizens and residents serving overseas under arrangements made between the Commonwealth and the United Nations. This bill would amend the 1964 act to ensure that these same laws also apply to Australian non-military personnel working under a variety of agreements and in a variety of roles in any jurisdiction outside the Commonwealth of Australia. As the opposition does not oppose the bill, I will not be taking up more of the Committee’s time than necessary in making some brief comments on issues raised by the amendments. The amendments contained in the bill intend to extend the operation of the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 to cover two categories of Australian non-military personnel working outside the Commonwealth of Australia. It is not necessary for the bill to cover military personnel, because members of the Australian Defence Force are already covered by the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, which establishes a regime of extra-territoriality along the same lines as the jurisdictional regime outlined in these amendments. The first category of personnel covered by the proposed amendments are personnel working under multilateral or bilateral agreements signed by Australia and the relevant host state which specifically grant immunity for criminal offences to Australian personnel operating in these jurisdictions. These amendments are uncontroversial and they are supported by the opposition. Essentially, where that immunity is granted, these laws would come in behind the Australian personnel and, if you like, would apply a matrix of criminal laws that currently apply to people in the area of the territory of Jervis Bay, holding them accountable to that framework of laws. As I say, these amendments are uncontroversial and they are supported. The opposition recognises that these amendments are necessary to ensure that Australian personnel operating with immunity overseas are nonetheless held responsible for criminal acts that may be committed while they are covered by the immunity agreements. The opposition supports these amendments because such an extension of jurisdiction-that is, the jurisdiction of the criminal law of the territory of Jervis Bay-is necessary to close the jurisdictional gap that currently exists for Australian non-military personnel operating with such immunity granted by those host states. Although the overwhelming majority of Australian personnel who undertake roles associated with the Commonwealth government overseas do so professionally and with nothing but the highest regard for the laws and customs of the nations in which they operate, it is unfortunate but possible, given human nature, that some individuals might break local laws while serving under an immunity agreement. It is therefore necessary for Australian courts to have the ability to apply Australian criminal jurisdiction to individuals accused of offences that are covered by immunity agreements. This extension was expressly recommended by a unanimous report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade handed down in 1999. This report recomMAIN COMMITTEE",173,Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No 8 2003
317,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.29 A.m.),"The Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Billmended that the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 be amended to extend its jurisdiction to Australian civilians serving overseas in situations not covered by the agreement with the United Nations. Just as the opposition supported this recommendation in 1999, we continue to support amendments to the 1964 act that close the jurisdictional gap and ensure that no Australians are above the law. The opposition believes that, rather than being a condemnation of the great service of the vast majority of fine and distinguished Australians who have represented Australia overseas in dangerous and challenging roles, these amendments affirm the integrity of those Australians by holding them to the vigorous test of the rule of law-and they have not only passed that test with flying colours; in many cases, they have actually been instrumental in upholding and strengthening the rule of law in the nations in which they have honourably served. The second category of personnel covered by the amendments contained in the bill are Australian non-military personnel who are serving overseas in jurisdictions under agreements that do not specifically grant immunity or who are operating in countries without any agreement involving the host nation and Australia at all. In these circumstances, the Attorney General has the power to declare an agreement under which Australians are serving or a country in which Australians are serving a declared agreement or a declared country. This prescription by regulation, at the discretion of the Attorney-General, automatically activates the jurisdictional provisions of the act. They would be so activated, for instance, if the criminal law framework in such a host country were inadequate, insufficient or in some other way corrupted or ineffective in enforcing and implementing the rule of law. Once again, this amendment implements a recommendation of the unanimous report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, handed down in 1999. It recommended replacing ‘under agreement between the United Nations and the government of that country’ with ‘a prescribed arrangement’. The opposition supported the recommendation handed down by the joint committee then and continues to support an amendment that now implements that recommendation to enable such a prescribed arrangement to be made by a declaration of the Attorney-General. The use of the principle of extraterritoriality in criminal law matters is not without precedent in either Australian law or the laws of other nations. The opposition believes that this instance is one of the occasions where the utilisation of what is quite a novel jurisdictional strategy is not only legitimate but, in the circumstances, demanded by the principles of justice. Australian law already utilises the principle of extraterritoriality in the prosecution and punishment of child sex offenders who commit offences outside the criminal jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Australia-again, in circumstances where there are some concerns as to whether they will be brought to account for their heinous actions in the countries in which they commit those acts. The requirements of justice in the case of offenders who commit such sexual offences against children in countries where they are effectively above the law demand that the principle of jurisdiction be interpreted in such a way as to facilitate their prosecution when they return to Australia under these laws that have extraterritorial operation. The factual contingencies contemplated by the bill we are debating also demand such an interpretation of the principle of jurisdiction. However, in this case, the principle of extraterritoriality needs to be applied both offensively, in the pursuit of Australian non-military personnel who may be guilty of committing offences in countries where they enjoy immunity, and deMAIN COMMITTEE fensively, in the protection of Australian non-military personnel who are the subject of hostile or mala fide prosecutions in situations where the country of origin, or its prosecuting authorities, has sought for ulterior reasons to bring a false, sham or concocted criminal prosecution against them. In that case, the Attorney-General has the ability by declaration to grant prescribed immunity from the operation of those laws. The opposition also cites the recent moves by the American legislature to implement a similar regime-regarding its own civilians posted overseas in connection with the United States Department of Defense-as evidence of the growing trend among nations concerned with protecting the rule of law toward implementing legislation to ensure that no-one escapes liability for unlawful acts by falling through the jurisdictional gaps opened by the increasing overseas postings of non-military personnel. In particular, the opposition draws the committee’s attention to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000, enacted by the United States Congress on 22 November 2000. That act was designed to extend federal criminal jurisdiction to civilians accompanying the armed forces of the United States who commit serious offences overseas, when a host country does not exercise criminal jurisdiction. In conclusion, for the reasons it has cited, the opposition supports the amendments proposed by the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003. seas) Amendment Bill 2003. As we have heard from the opposition spokesman, this is a bill to extend the operation of the Australian Criminal Code to extraterritorial operation, such that Australians who are serving overseas in various aspects and in various ways will be subject to Australia’s criminal jurisdiction.

However, this law does not extend to Australians who may serve overseas in any other capacity-for example, Australians within the AFP, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or any other government departments who may be posted overseas on other duties. We heard the opposition spokesman raise the fact that in September 1999 the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade presented to parliament a report that indicated that there was in fact a jurisdictional gap, a legislative lacuna, which resulted in Australian non-military personnel who were serving overseas-for example, civilian personnel in the Bougainville peace monitoring group-not being covered.

323,Mr Ciobo,"This amendment bill serves to ensure that certain criminal laws that applybill operates to close that legislative lacuna so that there will be criminal laws that apply to Australian personnel overseas. We have also sought to include the Iraq and Solomon Islands operations. The amendments aim to ensure that Australian civilians who work under an immunity understanding-for example, Australians who are currently serving in the Solomon Islands-will be protected by the extension of Australian criminal law to their activities. Without this extension, Australian personnel who are accused of crimes whilst deployed could find themselves subject to the jurisdiction of local courts in the country in which they are serving. Under the proposed amendments contained in this bill, Australia would retain primary criminal jurisdiction over its personnel. It was also decided that the legislation should be extended to include any relevant arrangements and agreements so that more informal situations would similarly be covered by the amendments. In essence, the bill before the Main Committee today extends Australia’s criminal jurisdiction to cover those Australians serving overseas in the following situations: people who are serving overseas under arrangements or agreements between the Commonwealth and the United Nations, or indeed an organ of the United Nations; and people who may have diplomatic or consular immunities or immunities that have been granted to a person due to their relationship with an international organisation, to the extent of the immunities that have been granted. It also will exist between the Commonwealth and a foreign state where immunities have been granted to those persons, again to the extent of the immunities that have been granted. The bill also serves to capture those persons serving overseas under prescribed arrangements or agreements between the Commonwealth and the United Nations, or indeed an organ of the United Nations, or between the Commonwealth and a foreign state. Finally, it also serves to capture those persons serving overseas in a prescribed foreign country or a prescribed part of a foreign country. There is contained as part of this bill a regulation-making power. The regulations that are provided for may be regulations that prescribe an agreement or arrangement, or a foreign country or a part of a foreign country and can serve to limit the extension of Australian criminal jurisdiction to a category or indeed to a category of persons. This type of exception is important to take into account the fact that there may be particular activities that serve to be excluded from such jurisdictional extension of the Criminal Code. The bill also excludes acts or omissions done by members of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate, for example. There is no particular cloakand-dagger reason for this exclusion. Rather, it is simply because those people serving in either DSD or ASIS who are serving in the proper performance of their functions in the operation of the act are in fact already covered by the Intelligence Services Act 2001. SoI would not like there to be a scare campaign put forward by certain members because there is an exception, an exclusion, for acts done in the ordinary course of the operations of ASIS or DSD. It should be noted that those particular acts, provided they comply with the proper performance of their functions, as I said, are already captured by the Intelligence Services Act 2001. Indeed, further to that, the operation of the act also does not apply to members of the Australian Defence Force. Again, in a similar vein, this is because Australian criminal jurisdiction already applies to those personnel under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. MAIN COMMITTEE So in essence this bill provides for the protection of Australian personnel who serve in mainly humanitarian and security operations overseas. It provides a clear basis for Australia to claim jurisdiction and demand the return to Australia of those personnel who may be accused of serious crimes overseas-thus saving Australians from being dealt with by foreign criminal justice and prison systems. I cannot emphasise this point enough. The fact is that Australians serving overseas should enjoy the rights and responsibilities that apply to Australians who remain within the bounds of Australia. We certainly recognise that there are unfortunately many countries that are subject to questionable regimes with questionable criminal law jurisdictions. The very last thing I and indeed the government would like to see is Australians being subjected to what may be trumped up charges, a trumped up system and a trumped up conclusion to any type of trial-or indeed a summary trial-that may occur in an overseas jurisdiction. Australia increasingly is playing an important and pivotal role in our local international community in South-East Asia. There are in fact some countries that I would say fall into this category-that is, those types of country that I have just been talking about. If Australia is to continue its role of providing for peace and humanitarian relief in international jurisdictions, we need to be able to do that with the full knowledge that there is safety for these Australians-that is, the safety that comes from Australians knowing that they can serve in their required capacity internationally and be subjected to the same safeguards as ordinary Australians. Of course, to a lesser extent this should then allay what I would say are unfounded fears that certain people may have about the operation of the International Criminal Court. WhilstI would highlight that I would not ever see the International Criminal Court having jurisdiction over the activities of Australians abroad, this is nonetheless a safeguard that should serve to reinforce the fact that Australia retains primary jurisdiction and retains the primary right to deal with those who may breach Australian criminal law internationally. The final way in which the bill assures and assists Australians is by making sure that Australians will not be immune from prosecution if they operate under some form of immunity overseas and can be brought to justice in Australia. Again, this is essentially a notion of goodwill to those foreign countries in which we do operate, to say that if there is an Australian who misbehaves or in some way breaches the criminal code of this country they will be subject to prosecution back in Australia, even though they may have immunity internationally. So it serves as a poignant reminder to those Australians abroad that, at the same time as they enjoy the liberties that apply to all Australians here at home, they are also subject to those responsibilities that go with being a good and decent person when they are abroad-thus curtailing any improper thoughts or motives that may exist in the minds of less scrupulous Australians who are overseas and who may happen to enjoy immunity. All in all, this is a very good bill. I am pleased to see that the opposition is supporting the bill. I am pleased that Australians can know that they will continue to be ambassadors for their country internationally and that they will continue to be subject to the rights and responsibilities that flow from a good, liberal democracy like Australia. In a very direct way, this bill serves as a reminder and serves to showcase that we are a very responsible international citizen and that we expect the same of Australians abroad. Further Proceedings That further proceedings on this bill be conducted in the House. MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Crimes Overseas Amendment Bill 2003
324,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (10.50 A.m.),"I move:Question unresolved. with standing order 270 the bill will be returned to the House. Family and Community Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 8 September, on motion by Mrs Hull: That the House take note of the paper. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (10.51 a.m.)-While we have a long history of success with methadone maintenance treatment in our country, newer medications such as LAAM have to date only been trialled on a very small scale. We acknowledge that methadone programs are vitally important but we also draw attention to what has been described as the problem of ‘parking’ on methadone maintenance and how we as a society might better deal with that issue. You will see in the body of the report that reference is made to this issue by people who have been on such programs for considerable periods of time. The committee also dealt with another pharmacotherapy-namely, naltrexone-which, unlike other treatments for heroine addiction, is not itself an opioid substitute. While mindful of some of the potential risks associated with the use of naltrexone, the evidence contained in our report suggests that it is an effective treatment when patients are carefully selected and extensive social support is provided. In that regard, I draw attention to the work being performed by Dr Currie in the public hospital system at Westmead Hospital. His efforts are to be commended, and it will be interesting for all of us to follow the outcome of his work. I want to reiterate, though, that naltrexone is not a magic bullet. It should be seen as but one of the many forms of treatment for opioid dependency. I am concerned that to date little is known about treatment for the misuse of psychostimulants-the commonly known expression for them is ‘party drugs’-which are very easily sourced and, in my judgment, appear to be a major and growing problem among young people. Trials of pharmacological treatments for amphetamine dependence have shown little or no promise to date, and the same is true for cocaine. The committee recommends that more research and funding need to go into these areas. There is also a need to provide stricter regulation on the chemical precursors for these drugs, particularly pseudoephedrine. The growing importation of these chemical precursors was highlighted in recent days by the seizure of a huge amount of imported pseudoephedrine with an estimated street value of around $1 billion. As part of our ongoing concern to minimise harm and to save lives, urgent attention needs to be given to the escalating incidence of hepatitis C among injecting drug users. The government’s response in this area has been inadequate. We have not succeeded in controlling this epidemic and, on recent estimates, it appears that it is likely that half a million Australians will be affected by this debilitating virus by 2020. It is no wonder that the Minister for Health and Ageing is sitting on an independent report which analysed the issue and came to a conclusion about the inadequacy of the response to date on this critical issue. The committee makes several recommendations that I commend to the government. The road to recovery for people dependent on licit and illicit substances will depend on a combination of strategies within a compassionate environment that recognises addiction as a MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Crimes Overseas Amendment Bill 2003
325,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Hawker),"As the question is unresolved, in accordancemedical condition which cannot be wished away. I support the idea that more resources need to go into prevention and treatment, particularly in areas such as those in my electorate, where the lack of access to detoxification and rehabilitation places is absolutely acute. We, as a parliament and a government, need to continue harm minimisation strategies. We do have a responsibility-understanding that you cannot wish away the problems that afflict people who are dependent on licit and illicit drugs-and a moral and compassionate obligation to continue those harm minimisation strategies that have saved lives and to continue to provide support to the wonderful organisations and staff who work in this critically important area. My work on the committee has provided me with a greater appreciation of the complexities of substance abuse in its many manifestations. It is regrettable, I guess, that the time constraint means that I have concentrated most of my attention on issues to do with opioid dependency. I think we as a community need to remember that alcohol is the most widely used substance. Fewer than one in four Australians now smoke and, according to the most recent studies, even fewer-one in six-had used illicit drugs. So there is some encouraging data which suggest that there has been a decline in the use of illicit drugs and that that decline was significant. But the data also suggest that alcohol consumption is on the increase. Of particular concern is the occurrence of binge drinking among youth. I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to work with them on this inquiry, and I also thank the staff who worked very diligently to provide the report, which has been three years in the making. I guess it is not surprising that, in an area as widespread and important as this, there are differences of opinion, and that has been reflected in the report. I conclude by reaffirming what I said in my concluding comments in the report: Finally, in supporting a greater emphasis on harm prevention and treatment, this does not equate to a strategy of zero tolerance. As I said before, we cannot wish these problems away and, in my understanding, where the zero tolerance strategy has been applied, it has not produced sustainable, long-term outcomes. Further: Addiction is a medical condition. Dependence on licit and illicit substances is not something that can be wished away. As a society we have an obligation to provide the necessary support for people seeking to break their dependency, recognising that opioid dependency is a chronic, relapsing disease. In that process saving lives and minimising harm will continue to be part of an overall compassionate strategy. opportunity to talk about the Road to recovery report, the report of the inquiry by the Family and Community Affairs Standing Committee into substance abuse in the Australian community, specifically because in the 49th parliament I was a member of that committee under the chair of Mr Barry Wakelin. I was disappointed to see him lose the chairmanship of that committee, because he had a grasp of the issues and was working very cooperatively with the committee on that issue. There are a number of issues within that report that I would like to talk about, but time constraints restrict me from doing that. WhatI would like to do is take people back into history. When I was elected to the New South Wales parliament in 1988, the needle and syringe exchange program-that is what it was called in those days-had been operating for about two or three years. It was operating in an environment where pharmacists were involved, and about 600 of them in New South Wales were involved in that program. At that time there were MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Committees
326,Mr Schultz (Hume) (10.59 A.m.),"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be given theabout 1.3 million needles and syringes being distributed and exchanged through that particular system. I think there was at that time an exchange rate of around 83 to 85 per cent. It was a very good program because it allowed those in the community, from the police down, to have the responsible exchange of needles and syringes, rather than have them lie around in the community and create other dangers to people in the way of possible needlestick injuries. But more importantly it gave the police an indication of where the people who were dependent on illicit drugs were in the community because there was a database set up by the Pharmaceutical Guild in pharmacies right throughout New South Wales. As a member of the Greiner government, I remember only too well the decision to move the needle and syringe exchange program into the public arena through the public health system in New South Wales. I opposed that at the time because I believed that we would lose control of it. I have considerable files-about four or five lever arch files-on drugs in the community that I have compiled over a 15-year period, but these are the only figures I have off the top of my head. When you look at the percentage of syringes that were distributed and exchanged in the way of fit packs from that period of time, you will see that in 1994-95 just over two million needles and syringes were distributed. Of those, about 972,798 syringes were received back. In the 1995-96 period, 1.9 million syringes were distributed and the exchange was in the vicinity of 1.2 million. The reason for the drop in the figures was that, following the decision by the then government to extrapolate the scheme out into the public sector through the hospital system, a number of pharmacists opted out of the system. I must compliment every member of the committee for the very significant contribution they made to the report, not only as members of parliament but as people who have concerns about the issue of licit and illicit drugs in the community, despite the fact that some of them may have had, from time to time, alternative views on it. In the period from 1988 to the present day, I have seen the hospital system and the community health system run programs for the distribution of needles and syringes on a no-exchange basis, and I raised concerns in the community about young people having access to those distribution programs. They had access to these programs in an environment where the individuals working for the health system took it upon themselves, because of privacy rules, not to notify the parents that some of their children were in fact using illicit drugs. That was disturbing to me, to say the least. In 1988 I predicted that the needle and syringe exchange program would blow out and become a needle and syringe distribution program, which is what it is commonly referred to as today. It went from 1.3 million needles in 1988 to over 13 million in the last financial year in New South Wales alone. That would indicate to me that it is indeed out of control. I also predicted in those early years that the incidence of hepatitis C would increase. I note that the member for Throsby made reference to hepatitis C and to the fact that 500,000 people are infected by it around Australia. The needle and syringe exchange program was introduced on the basis of it being an ideal way to control HIV and hepatitis C. The reality is that the thing that controlled HIV was the very sound safe sex program that I think was introduced by the Hawke government in the late 1980s or early 1990s. That was very effective in keeping HIV under control. It is interesting to note that the increase in hepatitis C, which is a disease that is transferred by blood-to-blood contact, is at the same proportionate level as the increase in needles and syringes being distributed in the community. MAIN COMMITTEE I am also very conscious of the methadone program, which was first introduced, from memory, in the late 1960s. It was introduced to a small group of people with a view to treating them with methadone, reducing the dosage and trying to wean them off the habit that they had. It has now become referred to as the ‘methadone maintenance program’ and we distribute increasing doses to people to keep them on their addiction. That, to me, is deplorable. The reason I am making these comments is that, whilst the 128 recommendations in this report are very commendable and are trying to steer governments in the right direction in terms of control, in particular, and accountability for these programs that attract government funding, if history is to be repeated, the things that I feared in the late 1980s will continue into the future. I agree with the member for Throsby in her concerns about the lack of treatment services for people with addictions. On numerous occasions I-like many other members of parliament-have had constituents coming into my office with their children who were dealing in illicit drugs and wanting to get off them, and we could not get them any treatment at all. It was only through the assistance, on a number of occasions, of the Salvation Army that we were able to find some treatment processes for some of those children, because in many cases there was a six-month waiting list. I think that is one issue within the report that needs to be addressed aggressively by governments. If we are going to assist people with this health issue-and it is a health issue; I did not think so in the early stages, but I do now-we have to make sure that not only is there a very sound education process in terms of the dangers of using illicit drugs and, indeed, licit drugs, but that there are appropriate rehabilitation places so that people can go into at least a detox situation in a controlled environment. In the last couple of days I have received a copy of a critical response to the Kings Cross injecting room, from Drug Free Australia. When I read it I thought it appropriate to make some comment about a couple of the recommendations in it which are very good and which touched me. Recommendation 7 in the report says: We recognise the compassionate and effective treatment and rehabilitation, community support programs and social worker and outreach programs and place an increased emphasis on prevention of ongoing illicit drug use rather than blind tolerance of a crime and addiction cycle that is harmful for both the addict and the wider community. While we recognise the strong community support to ‘get people off drugs’ it should also be acknowledged that the Australian people are very compassionate and take an open arms approach to helping people get back on their feet when they have demonstrated a willingness to do so. This should be a message strongly supported by government programs. I know that is in the general thrust of the Road to recovery report. Recommendation 8 in the report is headed, ‘Compassionate not commercial’ and says: It is also of great concern to us that current proposals calling for Injecting Centres in Redfern and the A.C.T. are being supported by outspoken pro drug groups on commercial grounds rather than on drug policy reasons aimed at helping people achieve a drug free outcome. We recommend strongly that commercialisation of substance abuse, addiction or human misery be rejected. Clearly while the operators of such facilities enjoy large contributions by sponsoring governments these funds are better used in treatment and rehabilitation services aimed at helping addicts achieve a drug free status. That particular recommendation centres around another concern of mine in the 1980s, and that was that we were creating an industry and that that industry would grow and, to justify the continuance of government funding, the distribution of things like needles and syringes would expand and more and more people would be employed. MAIN COMMITTEE In the brief time. I have left, I want to say that the issue of drugs in the community is not an easy one. As a member of parliament travelling excessive miles in rural and regional Australia. I have personally been down the track of seeing drugs being distributed by bikie gangs. I was instrumental in sending off some intelligence reports to both the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police in the early 1990s about the involvement of police officers with rebel bikie gangs-particularly in the Young area, which is part of the electorate that I represent. That culminated in a sting operation in which a number of people in the police service were caught. I have to say that that was done at considerable pain and penalty to my family. A lot of people do not understand that when members of parliament take these issues on, rightly or wrongly, they are subjected to a significant amount of pressure. Due to my outspoken comments on the issue of drugs and their distribution, I have received death threats. My son has received death threats. My son was had a number of spurious charges made against him, because of my activity in the drug arena. That cost us about six or seven years of pain. I am still trying to get justice. Fortunately, at great expense to us, my son was proven innocent of the charges. That is just an indication of the sorts of things to which members of parliament are subjected. It is interesting to note that whilst the community want you to stand up and be outspoken and expose these issues, there are not too many people around supporting you when you need that support. The issue of drugs is a very significant one. It has permeated right throughout society and everybody is affected by it. I close by making this point in support of what I have just said: I can go into my old home town of Cootamundra any day of the week, talk to people I know in the community and identify people who are openly distributing drugs in the community, yet the police have not shut them down. It just makes you wonder why that is occurring and what involvement some members of the New South Wales Police have in the dreadful industry that distributes illicit drugs to our community. I thank the parliament for the opportunity of saying those few words. (Time expired) say that I am very disappointed in this report. It is a sad reflection on the majority of the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs that, given the period of over three years since the committee first received the terms of reference about substance abuse and the wealth of evidence that it has received in response to both its initial inquiry in 2000 and its subsequent inquiry in 2002, it has come up with a very bland report. I am disappointed because here was an opportunity for the committee to be courageous. That opportunity has been squandered. There has been a prolonged inquiry spread over two parliamentsA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.15 a.m. to 11.26 a.m. quiry spread over two parliaments. The inquiry would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In good faith, members of the public have made submissions and appeared before the committee as witnesses. For what result? The result is a report whose recommendations are more likely to take us backwards than forwards in this difficult area of substance abuse. MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Committees

328,Mr Leo Mcleay,"As I was saying before the division, there has been a prolonged inMaybe there was some significance in the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Hume, relating to the change of committee chair in the 40th Parliament. No-one can deny that substance abuse is a real problem in our community. There is a problem with abuse of both legal and illegal drugs. In June 1999 in this parliament-and while I was referring to illicit drugs it holds true for substance abuse-I said: ... there is a problem with illicit drugs in our community whether we like it or not. It is affecting all levels of our society. Potentially all of us-it may not be in our immediate family, if we are lucky, but I would be surprised if many of us were not affected-know someone in our social circle who has suffered because of drugs. I believe that these words still hold true today and probably always will. The phrases ‘all levels of our society’ and ‘potentially all of us’ are the ones I would like to emphasise today. Substance abuse is not some isolated rare occurrence or something that only happens to other people. It can happen and does happen to everyone, whether it be abuse of alcohol, tobacco, heroin or some other substance. It can and it does happen. I am aware that the committee received a great many submissions and that it also received wide-ranging evidence at its hearings. The fact that it received many submissions and that it also received a variety of evidence makes it all the more amazing to me that it could come up with some of its more narrow recommendations. In reaction to the flavour of these recommendations, I would like to draw attention today to the minority report of my colleagues the member for Fowler and the member for Cowan, both of whom are very empathetic human beings who are willing to open their hearts and minds to the plight of those caught up in the maelstrom of substance abuse. I will start by quoting from their report, for the benefit of everyone here and for the parliamentary record. Under ‘General comments’, they wrote in the minority report: As members of the committee since the inquiry began three years ago, we have no objections to the conduct of the inquiry. The range of submissions and evidence of witnesses allowed the committee the fullest opportunity to address the inquiry’s terms of reference. The most valuable part of this report is in fact the submissions received by the inquiry, the volumes of testimony given by witnesses before the inquiry and in the forums conducted as part of the committee’s information gathering process. However, the consideration of evidence, the conclusions reached and the recommendations made must be seen as coloured by the personal views of committee members (including ourselves). This can be a strength of the political process. After all, elected representatives should be a sounding board for the views of the electorate. What are seen as socially acceptable recommendations can be expected to prevail. They went on to say: But in reaching conclusions and making recommendations which reject the findings of scientifically based studies and by using assumptions and anecdotal evidence to support its recommendations, the committee’s report loses credibility. In many ways the report is not an objective assessment of the facts but a one sided argument in favour of a predetermined outcome. Surely the lives of young Australians should be above politics. Indeed the Australian people deserve an honest and open appraisal of drug policy. I do not think I have ever heard a more damning indictment of a committee report by members of a committee. There have been minority reports to many committee reports before, of course, but usually these reflect philosophical or personal differences with the majority, reached at the end of the process, after much soul-searching on the part of the dissenters. It MAIN COMMITTEE seems to me that what happened here with this report is that some members embarked upon the inquiry with preconceived thoughts about the outcome. They did not listened to witnesses and they did not understand the submissions. They decided to pursue a particular outcome which seems to fly in the face of the evidence before the committee. I have some considerable sympathy for my colleague the member for Fowler, who said in this Main Committee room last Thursday that she regretted having any part in the setting up of this inquiry. Like her, I think the bulk of the recommendations reflect backwards steps in our policy towards substance abuse. Here was an opportunity to think outside the constraints of previous policy, and all the committee has done is recommend that the policy become even more constrained. Substance abuse is a health issue. Substances or drugs, both legal and illegal, exist, and people use them for what they think are their own health, social or recreational purposes, or whatever. The fact is that people take drugs, and they are not going to stop taking them. Fear of punishment, death or disapproval does not stop them. It never has and it never will. That is why a policy of harm prevention is a nonsense, because it implies that a point can be reached where no-one is harmed. The only way this point could be reached would be if no-one took any substances or drugs, either legal or illegal. This is not an imaginable situation. Its logical extension is to have no alcohol, no tobacco and no medicines. I could go on, but I think I have made my point. There is nothing to be gained by narrowing the policy in this area. In fact, the opposite is needed. We need to be open to a wider view and to different points of view. We need to embrace a variety of ways of dealing with the problems associated with substance abuse. We should not reject possible treatments or approaches without giving them a fair trial. We should not be overly anxious to see a one-size-fits-all solution, because, quite frankly, there is not one. We should also strive to be compassionate and understanding rather than judgmental. We are dealing with people who have a problem. We are not dealing with objects. Anything that has the potential to help these people should be given a chance to be tried. I share the concern of some of my colleagues about the emphasis given in the report’s recommendations to getting people off methadone as soon as possible and about the committee’s decision to suggest naltrexone as appropriate for trialling with opioid dependent prisoners. I am personally appalled that such a trial should be recommended. It reminds me of past practices when people in prisons in the US were experimented on or when members of the armed forces or defeated populations in war situations were used as human guinea pigs. Prisoners are vulnerable people. Who knows what pressures might be applied to them to participate in a trial. It could be claimed by authorities that they are willing to participate, but they will be very vulnerable to inducement. More favourable treatment could be offered, for example. How many of them would fully understand the implications of their involvement in a trial, the likely risks et cetera? Imagine how we would like it if it were suggested that politicians should be used as guinea pigs for a particular experiment. This highlights another problem that I have with the report as well. This committee seems to be looking at individual areas and making bizarre recommendations. Recommendation 95 says: ... all personnel employed in correctional facilities should be subject to mandatory random blood or urine tests. MAIN COMMITTEE Why not policemen, judges and juries as well? Why is the report looking at those in prisons? Prisoners are being punished for crimes they commit by being incarcerated, and rightly so. But I just find the whole idea of making them part of an experiment totally abhorrent. To suggest that they be used as guinea pigs in this way is inhumane and denies these people any remnants of dignity and basic humanity. I suppose predictably-I am not really surprised-the report is not keen on safe injecting rooms. Again, this reflects an attitude of putting one’s head in the sand. People inject drugs. They are not going to stop injecting drugs. If safe injecting facilities are not available, they will inject in an unsafe way. It is as simple as that. They will not cease injecting drugs into themselves or each other just because there is no safe place available to do it, and when they inject, often they will die. In saying this, I am not trying to encourage the use of injectable drugs. I am not, but I do recognise that it happens, and as long as it is happening I would like to see safe injecting rooms operating as part of a package of strategies dealing with substance abuse. The evidence seems to be that where there are safe injecting rooms the incidence of overdose or death due to dirty needles or unsafe practices declines considerably. Surely this is a desirable outcome. Would those who are not in favour of safe injecting facilities rather have these people die? That is the logical outcome of not having safe injecting rooms for those who are going to inject drugs anyway. Unfortunately, what we have in this report is a missed opportunity. Rather than being open to a broad approach to the problems of illicit drug use, the committee’s recommendations in this area reflect a particular mind-set focused on zero tolerance. It may not have used that particular terminology, but zero tolerance is harm prevention carried to its logical conclusion. It is not that easy or simple. I can well understand the anguish of my colleague, the member for Shortland, who now regrets that she was an active supporter of this inquiry when it was first being established. The results shown in this committee report are disappointing, to say the least. An opportunity to be courageous has been lost and the cost will be borne by all those who suffer now and in the future from the effects of substance abuse. quiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, I would say that I have come a long way on this journey. As the previous member suggested, it was a long inquiry. It has taken me not only to just about all corners of Australia but also to places like Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK, to get a better appreciation of some of the issues that this difficult subject confronts the nation with. To me, the drugs issue strikes at the core of our civilised society. It tests our values. It highlights the positive and negative aspects of life and all the options and choices, right through to criminal behaviour and our jail systems. It has been just over 25 years since the last report on drugs came into the parliament. I think it was a controversial topic then, and it remains thus. But I think the nation has come a fair way, nevertheless, in that time. I want to give a few snapshots on those issues which I thought were important in terms of the general thrust of the report. BeforeI go into that I want to thank and acknowledge some key people. In doing that you always leave somebody out, so I apologise to those I leave out. I want to acknowledge Wayne Hall, Professor Ian Webster, Brian Watters, Alex Wodak, Tony Trimmingham and Brian McConnell and Marion McConnell. I also want to thank all the state MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Committees
329,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (11.38 A.m.),"In speaking to Road to recovery: report on the inand territory MPs and public servants who have put so much into this, the non-government agencies such as ADCA, and the councils such as the Fairfield City Council and the Newcastle City Council. The support received by this committee, and probably by both committees, was simply outstanding. It came from all levels of government, regardless of political background, including local government. It was an outstanding cooperative effort. I need to place on the record the wonderful efforts of Shelley McGuinness, who served us so well in the previous parliament. I thought I would touch on those issues which probably will not get the pre-eminent focus. We know that smoking and alcohol are key issues. They are the big dollar items where we have particular issues. The issue that society tends to focus on is the illicit drugs. I can understand why that is the case. It is because they give a sharper focus and are more obvious. That is what I will focus on today. I think there are issues around the treatment of alcohol and cigarettes and there are some pretty good recommendations about that in the report. FirstlyI want to talk about cannabis. BeforeI do so, I should say that in the available statistics the illicit drug situation in Australia has shown significant improvement in the last three or four years. Between 1998 and 2001 we have seen a significant drop in consumption by those aged 14 years and over of cannabis, analgesics-not that these are illicit-heroin and methadone, and a slight drop in cocaine. In terms of the available statistics, we can see that there is some progress on the issues that give us some of the greatest concern. On methadone, I would like to read a brief quote and perhaps subtext it. This witness really summed up for me the issues around methadone. I think a number of speakers would have spoken about the issue of parking people on methadone and not dealing with it in a more comprehensive way. The witness said: One of the things that I have been disappointed about in relation to my own treatment, and I know that it is an issue for others, is never having had a treatment plan developed for me. I have just continued on and I happen to have the wherewithal to be able to make my own decisions now. I certainly would not necessarily have said that when I first went on the programthat is, the methadone program. She concludes: It saddens me a great deal to see people turning up and going each daythat is, to collect their methadone doseswhen no one connects with them. I think there is so much lost potential there. I hope that the recommendations relating to methadone can be looked at and dealt with. As far as cannabis goes, I think we have come a long way in 25 years in understanding what cannabis is about. Professor Saunders said: One could argue that cannabis use, as practised 20 years ago, was a relatively trivial form of substance abuse-that is not the case now. We are seeing an increasing number of people with cannabis dependence and the severe health effects of cannabis. A number of witnesses went along with this to a greater or lesser degree. But the issues that I think are relevant here are the THC content and the hydroponics which now enable people to grow cannabis as a cottage industry, if not a major industry, all over Australia. We need to be conscious of that and we need to get the best information out to people so that they understand much more accurately what they are actually dealing with. MAIN COMMITTEE The changes to illicit drug laws were, of course, hotly debated. Major Brian Watters is a well-known advocate of a particular view and Dr Alex Wodak is an advocate of another view. I happen to believe that the Watters view is the one that we should be aiming for, and I think that there is significant evidence-although I know that will be debated-to say that the best way to go is to have a focus which discourages people from being involved in the illicit drug issue from the start. I accept what people say-that is, that people will take illicit drugs, whatever-but it does not mean that we do not have a responsibility to make sure that we give everybody every opportunity to know to the best of their ability what they are actually dealing with and that these laws are not there just for the hell of it. In saying that, I do not decry Alex Wodak; I respect his view, but I take a different point of view. Therefore, I support the current legislative framework, to which we need to keep constantly alert, making changes where we need to. In terms of treatment, the report talks about the lack of a comprehensive treatment map. Certainly, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of where individuals can go for help is something that absolutely amazed the committee over recent years. The recommendations talk about urgently completing the map of available alcohol and drug services across Australia, identifying the gaps, ensuring the data is collected accurately-and this has been a constant issue in a number of reports and is an issue around Commonwealth and state relations-and readily updating the information contained in that database. The Australian National Council on Drugs is to perform that task, and the committee was really interested to see that that was done as expeditiously as possible. It recommended that the Australian National Audit Office make an evaluation of that work, but there is a sense of urgency about it. In conclusion, I would like to quote once more from the previous report. The area that I had a particular personal interest in is to do with the issue of violence-the mixture of substance abuse, mental health and violence. It is fair to say that Australian society has become more violent over the last 15 to 20 years. There is a lot of evidence to support that view. In the evidence we took some three years ago, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health pointed to: ... increasing evidence that the co-existence of substance abuse and serious mental disorder not only prolongs the illness and makes treatment more difficult, but also dramatically increases the likelihood of violence. The discussion paper that the committee presented in the last parliament, referring to the Victorian research, states: Those who had a history of substance abuse in public mental health were over seven times as likely to have acquired a conviction as those in the general population, and in convictions for violent offences it was nearly ten times as high. Therefore, it is not surprising that the committee made the recommendation that we do a lot more research. We became a little wary of the word ‘research’ because you can research something literally almost to death-in fact, people have been dying as we have discussed these matters, so it is very important that this research be applied, evaluated and put into the community for the community’s benefit. That is all I really want to say this morning. In conclusion, I acknowledge the remarkable contribution of hundreds of people who not only saw this issue as serious enough to come before us and literally weep and be in total discouragement but also offered great encourageMAIN COMMITTEE ment. I believe it is as serious an issue as I have had to deal with in my time in parliament. There are great opportunities to do a lot better in this country on all these issues. I have not even touched on the opportunities in the jail system, but that is more of a state issue. I could even have talked about needle exchanges but time does not permit. I simply acknowledge my fellow Australians at all levels, including my colleagues who, for all our discussion, debate, disagreement and agreement, gave themselves willingly to the task. I think that this report, 25 years on from the last one, will give reasonable service to the Australian parliament and the Australian people. Members of the public may not read it all in one hit but I trust that many of them will take time to have a look at the recommendations and then refer back to some of the basis-the reasons that the recommendations were made. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (11.50 a.m.)-Deputy Speaker Corcoran, I apologise at the outset because I too am suffering from the same sort of lurgy that you are at the moment so, if I sound a little croaky or die along the way, my apologies. One of the wonderful things about this parliament is the committee structure. I do not think we actually have enough recognition of the committee structure out there among the public or even in the parliament. I want to commend the House for having the decency to refer this report to the Main Committee so that more than two speakers with five minutes each can get to speak on what is a fairly hefty and at times worthy report. Having said that though-and having welcomed the report and all the effort that has obviously gone into producing it over two parliaments-I want to condemn the government for having politicised the committee system. We currently have before the House several committee inquiries which are heavily politicised in nature. My own committee at the moment is doing an inquiry into cost shifting to local government by state government. If that is not a political exercise, I am not quite sure what is. I would say that that is an abuse of the committee process. Also before the parliament at the moment we have an inquiry into the recent bushfires. Unfortunately this again is being used as a politicisation of the committee process. I think that detracts from and demeans the fundamentally good work that committees do. The committee process raises us above the partisan bickering of the parliamentary executive government system. It says to the Australian public, ‘We as parliamentarians can actually get together and do something for the benefit of the community. We can leave aside political differences and actually say that there are community issues out there that we need to explore as a parliament, coming up with recommendations as a parliament that we can endorse.’ Sadly, this report went off the rails at the end of the day-when it was being written and tabled. A phenomenal amount of work went into receiving submissions and hearing from an absolutely broad brush range of individuals-from, on one end of the scale, people who are involved in harm minimisations or who are in Sydney trialling the heroin injection rooms to, on the other end of the scale, Fred Nile and the Festival of Light. All these people came together to present their viewpoints. Instead of distilling down those viewpoints and saying, ‘Here’s an evidence based approach to this serious health crisis’-not somehow a moral crisis but a serious health crisis-‘and a well researched report,’ we had to go down the route of coming up with a politicised report; we had to go down the route of coming up with politicised recommendations. MAIN COMMITTEE There are 128 recommendations in this report. Some of them are fairly worthy and some of them are well researched. But, sadly, they have all been tainted by a political bias-an approach that says, ‘We can achieve abstinence; we can have abstinence; we will achieve a drug-free society.’ I am not sure what fairies are at the bottom of your garden, but we have never had a drug-free society. We are never going to have a drug-free society. There have always been drugs in our community. Depending on what your drug of choice is, there will always be drugs in our society, because people will always abuse alcohol. Alcohol and tobacco abuse create some of the highest imposts upon our health care system. Still today it is tobacco abuse that causes more trouble and more cost within the health care system than any other single thing. It outrates obesity, heart disease and everything-because it causes all those things. So to sit here and say, ‘We are never going to have drugs, we are all going to be abstinent and all we have to do is to have parents talk to their kids,’ is a joke. It is demeaning the good work that is actually going on in our community now, because it somehow says to a whole lot of parents, ‘Because you didn’t talk to your kids right, they’ve become drug addicts.’ I certainly know a lot of people who have family members who are drug addicts, sadly. In the area of Box Hill in my seat of Chisholm there is a prevalence of drug abuse and in my day-to-day working life I come into contact with a lot of families who have children who are dependent upon drugs. They are not bad parents. They did not fail their children. They did not fall over at some point along the way. But something happened in those children’s lives and they have become addicted to drugs. It is a health issue. It is a not a moral issue; it is a health crisis. It is an addiction; it is not some moral failure of the individual or their family that they have ended up that way. I think one of the things that this report ignores is the question of why people turn to drugs. We as a society have failed to address those systemic issues that lead somebody to say, ‘Life is so bad-there is no hope and I am going to turn to drugs to sustain myself.’ There is a bit of a discussion about mental health but it does not sufficiently go into whether people are using drugs as a form of self-medication because there is already an underlying mental health problem or whether the drug use has created the mental health problem. AgainI would say there is a bit of a political bias in how those conclusions have been reached. If we can give our young people jobs and self-esteem, they will be far more likely to stay out of the mix of drugs. That has been proven but it is not something the report goes into. I think one of the most alarming things about this report, though, is that out of the 128 recommendations it makes there are only four that talk about hepatitis C. At the moment we have a hepatitis C epidemic in this country. Hepatitis C is linked most heavily to intravenous drug users. The Prime Minister and his health minister have been sitting on a report that they received last November that indicated that their Tough on Drugs policy was causing-it was the link to-a hepatitis C epidemic. They had that report. They have only released it in the last couple of weeks, and the health minister has graciously said that she will give us a response in June. That is fantastic. We have got this road to recovery report, which, in relation to a major epidemic in our society-hepatitis C-has four recommendations. They are actually not bad recommendations but they certainly do not go far enough. By the end of the report, we get down to the most damning corruption and politicisation of this report: we have decided that harm minimisation has to be dumped. I love the semantics of it all: it says we have to go away from harm minimisation to harm prevention. This will only MAIN COMMITTEE add to the hepatitis C epidemic we are currently experiencing. The report, which also gives great credence to the government’s current Tough on Drugs stance and its law enforcement, again fails to mention that we have had a heroin drought for the last two years. I will be quite frank: I have not read the whole report-I will be honest. I have read great chunks of it, but I have not read the whole lot. I apologise. If anybody gets to read everything that comes across their desk in this place, I reckon they should get the gold elephant stamp of the year! But the thing that did alarm me in the report is that there is not a great deal of mention of the abuse of prescription drugs. There has been a huge escalation in the abuse of over the counter prescription drugs. These are drugs you can get quite easily from your doctor. There is a range of benzodiazepines-that is, Valium and Serepax. They are very easily obtainable from doctors and they are currently being severely abused. There is very little mention also of the alarming rise in amphetamine use. That is a serious area of great risk in this community, because you and I can go down to the local shop, buy a whole lot of chemicals, mix them together and start selling those sorts of drugs on the street. On one level, while the report canvasses a range of things, there are glaring absences in what it could do. I want to concentrate on hepatitis C, because I think it is an area that people are ignoring and it is alarmingly dangerous to our community. The rise in estimated hepatitis C infections from 11,000 in 1997 to 16,000 in 2001 shows that hepatitis C infections continue to increase. The report that the government is sitting on says that a range of innovative strategies needs to be introduced if we are to reduce this level of infection. Needle and syringe programs have succeeded in slowing infections, but we need to build on that success. We need targeted prevention strategies for young people-particularly young people who inject or are at risk of injecting-before they become infected with hepatitis C. The introduction of some prevention strategies will require political courage. If this courage is not shown, hepatitis C infections will continue to increase. Clear and unambiguous support of harm reduction intervention is the key to reducing hepatitis C infection. The review of the national strategy notes that the uptake of hepatitis C treatments is extremely low. Approximately one per cent of people with hep C have ever accessed treatment. Access to treatment is a key issue for people with hepatitis C. Factors that contribute to that are the strict eligibility criteria; the restriction of being able to access treatment only through liver clinics and major hospitals; the experience of discrimination in health care settings; social and economic issues such as homelessness, poverty, unemployment and lack of social support; and side effects. The review of the national strategy found that the strategy has not achieved its objective of increasing access to the full range of treatment and care services for people with hepatitis C. Pegylated interferon, in combination with ribavirin, is best practice treatment and is available in countries such as the US, the UK and Canada but is not yet available for hepatitis C treatment in Australia. A partnership approach to hepatitis C is stated as being a key aspect of the national response. The partnership operates on many levels, although at a national level it operates through the National Council on AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases. The review of the strategy says that the existing ministerial advisory structure reinforces hepatitis C as the poor cousin of HIV. But there are far more people with hepatitis C than there are with HIV. The council is currently convened until 30 June 2003, and there has been no indication of a replacement structure. Each month, 13,000 people become infected with hepatitis C, and we MAIN COMMITTEE have no partnership forum. The new ministerial advisory structure needs to address the concerns in the review of the national strategy and needs a clear mandate to advise the minister on issues relating to the hepatitis C epidemic. The partnership approach established by the National Hepatitis C Strategy has worked well, and all parties remain committed to it. However, we need specific funding for the implementation of the National Hepatitis C Strategy, not more talk. The community sector is underfunded, yet it continues to carry the burden of the treatment, care, and support needs of people with hepatitis C, and the discrimination against these people. Funding for organisations such as the Australian Hepatitis C Council has remained static for the past four years and in real terms has decreased. State governments need to ensure the development, implementation and funding of strategies to reduce the impact of hepatitis C within their jurisdictions. The report, entitled Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, which the government has, quite clearly states that there is a major need for reform and a major need to go forward in this crisis. Out of 128 recommendations in the report, four are about hepatitis C and none of them address the issues in the report that the Minister for Health and Ageing commissioned herself. This report stands condemned for that glaring neglect alone. The other area I want to talk about-and I hesitate to use the term-is the ‘ageist’ debate about the use or non-use of naltrexone. The idea seems to be that the miracle cure, naltrexone, is going to help you. You will go on a rapid detox then walk out as a drug-free person and go back to a fantastically normal life. It does not work. It has been demonstrated not to work. Naltrexone only works for those people who are ready for it to work for them. No one program alone works unless the person is ready for that addiction to be cured. Detox is only the beginning. The biggest problem is then to get people back into a structured life so that they can leave their drug related life. You get caught up in it. You get caught up in chasing money, chasing the dragon, getting a score, getting a hit and going this way. Yes, it may sound nice for parents to have a drug-free kid, but if that drug-free kid suddenly goes and scores again after being on naltrexone, that kid will die. It has been proven time and time again that the body cannot cope with a hit again so soon after being on the naltrexone program. I am not sure whether anybody has ever seen people withdraw from methadone, but it is actually scarier than seeing someone withdraw from heroin. It is a fairly violent thing. Methadone is a maintenance program and that is what it has always been; however, some people may need to be maintained for life. If alcoholics who join AA do not turn up to the meetings each month, they will probably go back to drinking. There is no one quick fix. If the government thinks it can say, ‘Just say no,’ and be tough on drugs and take a zero tolerance approach, it is kidding itself and destroying our society. It is not putting the money where it should be put. (Time expired) this debate. It is absolutely vital that we disentangle the good from the bad in the Road to recovery report. There is much that builds on the previous work of this parliament and on previous government programs. Some of the recommendations that go to matters such as continuing evidence based responses are valuable. Regrettably there appears to be a dissonance between what is recommended in the report, which is to proceed on an evidence based approach to drug law programs and to drug strategy, and a recommendation that we should substitute MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Committees
330,Mr Kerr (Denison) (12.05 P.m.),"I commend my colleagues on their contributions toharm prevention for harm minimisation and have, as the last contributor said, the language of, ‘Just say no.’ It is impossible to align those two contradictory elements of a single report. Let us consider an example of where harm minimisation has been particularly effective in Australia, and that is in our response to the AIDS epidemic. Australia is probably the leading country globally in terms of the success of its response on a government level. When the epidemic first presented itself in Australia, the then government had possible options in front of it. Like a number of other countries, it could have turned a blind eye and buried its head in the sand in response to a growing medical problem. As a number of other countries have done, it could have tried to change people’s behaviours to ‘just say no’ to male-to-male sex and to intravenous drug use. It could have advocated that as the government’s response. The countries that did that have had blow-outs in HIV infection rates and they have failed to communicate effectively to those in the at-risk groups. They have proved completely unable to put in place programs that are effective in reducing the harm that goes with AIDS. By contrast, Australia did something quite brave. It recognised that there were people in the community who practised male-to-male sex, and it recognised that there were people in the community who were IV drug users. It spoke directly to those people and to the Australian community. It used simple language and simple methods of communication, and it involved leading Australians in a communications strategy that was blunt but also well focused and well directed. It urged people in those at-risk categories not to abstain, not to ‘just say no’recognising that that was an unrealistic prospect-but to change the manner of their behaviour so that they would not subject themselves to infection. Thus, where male-to-male sex or other sexual conduct between multiple partners was involved, recommendations to use condoms were put forward. In instances where people were using intravenous drugs, there were recommendations on how to ensure that you never used the same needle and that blood products were not transferred. If you only had one needle and needed to share it, there were recommendations on how to disinfect it through bleaching and various other methods so that it could not transmit HIV. As a result, we have had the world’s lowest rate of infection. What we learnt from that was that you can have a program which speaks directly to those who choose certain forms of behaviour which we as a mainstream society may either regard with tolerance or oppose but which we still recognise as existing within our ranks. IV drug use has never been approved of in this society, but the campaign was very explicit in that it recognised that, because there were people who were IV drug users, you had to speak to them directly about their manner of administration. So it did apply a harm minimisation strategy, not a harm prevention strategy. We did not pursue a ‘just say no’ strategy, knowing that that would have been ineffective in reducing the rate of infections in the community and would not have had the desired health and social outcomes. By contrast, we are now seeing real blow-outs in various blood-borne diseases-we have just had a very powerful contribution about forms of hepatitis and the very substantial rates of increase-because we have shifted some of the rhetoric and the approach subtly and slowly over time away from harm minimisation to the ‘just say no’ or the ‘war on drugs’ approach or an approach which essentially marginalises those whom we really need to communicate with. You cannot expect to have effective communication with people in high-risk groups unless you have an honest mode of communication and do not treat them in a way which forces them into further marginalisation. MAIN COMMITTEE Unfortunately, despite the focus of this report on one level-and on saying that our responses need to be evidence based-what we are actually seeing is the triumph of an underlying ideological framework which is based on prohibition, abstinence and the idea that, at the end of the day, success can only be measured if you persuade or compel people never to take drugs. Of course, when societies have sought to do this they have always failed. The most illuminating example is Prohibition in the United States. There, the forces in the community that had seen drink as an evil to be suppressed eventually triumphed and, through legislation which was ultimately passed in a majority of the states of the United States, a constitutional amendment was effected which saw alcohol prohibited. The natural consequence of that was that, instead of the harm being suppressed, the harm was intensified. The harm was intensified for two reasons. Firstly, it was because the trade fell into the hands of those who could make substantial profits by reason of the market being left to only those who were prepared to take the risk of criminal behaviour-that is, the market became a criminal market with very high profits. This created the crime wave that infected the United States and it led to the growth of organised crime in that country. Secondly, it was because the things people were drinking became dangerous. When alcohol was unavailable and was not sold in a transparent, safe way, people were producing wood alcohol and various other forms of alcohol that actually caused death. So not only did it create a damaged society, it also produced deaths. Alcohol produced more deaths, directly because of that consequence. Are we to follow that kind of stupidity in this country? Are we to follow down the US path again? Almost everywhere around the world there are growing strands of approaches coming together along the harm minimisation stream. The path that Australia led on in our response to AIDS is being picked up in different ways in drug strategies all around the world. RecentlyI travelled to Europe, and I went to Spain and Portugal where there are some very innovative approaches where personal possession of small amounts of drugs is not treated as an offence at all. I went to the Netherlands where there is a system of tolerated availability of cannabis. I have recently seen reports out of Canada, recommending a similar approach in that country. I have seen recent parliamentary reports from New Zealand, again recommending a re-examination of legislative approaches to drug laws in that country, particularly around cannabis. The whole drift of policy in Europe is very much towards the Spanish and Portuguese framework. By contrast, we seem to be drifting much more to the United States model. Whilst there is much in the United States that I admire, one of the things that I find impossible to swallow is the way in which they deal with drugs. They have something in the order of a million Americans in jail for drug offences-exclusively for drug offences. Most of those people of course are black and poor. Does that mean that there is not widespread drug use in the United States amongst white middle-class kids? Of course not-they just do not get prosecuted and put in jail. Law enforcement tends to focus on those who are lower down the food chain. Does it mean that the United States is a place where harm prevention has actually succeeded? Of course it does not. Drugs are more available in that country than they are in the main streets of most of our cities-perhaps with the exception of a couple of our major cities. Does it mean that the United States has found some way of rehabilitating people who have serious drug dependency problems? Of course not. Notwithstanding all the drug courts, notwithstanding all the money, notwithstanding all the social, political and legal pressure and the policing and the like, the United States has no answers. MAIN COMMITTEE In this country we actually do have answers. We have better answers. Our programs are more effective, not just in relation to the AIDS strategy but also in relation to our approach towards warning regimes for minor drug use-for example, some of the strategies that have been developed in states like South Australia and the ACT, which deal with providing warnings for possession of small amounts and small numbers of cannabis plants. All these things suggest that there are smarter, more intelligent and less socially destructive ways of doing our business. We do not want to fall backwards into failed strategies. I want to conclude with a couple of specific comments about the so-called heroin drought. I think there is no doubt that many of the claimed reductions do relate to the reduced availability of heroin over the last couple of years. The problem if a government chooses to claim credit for that is the same as the problem you have if you claim the credit for a good summer-you are likely to be blamed for a bad winter. We are now seeing the end of the heroin drought. RecentlyI received a briefing regarding the successes of the injecting room in Sydney. It was quite illuminating to see that over a period of time patterns of drug use have changed substantially. When there was a heroin drought, there was a predominance of or growth in the use of cocaine and other injectable substances of that kind. That has changed. Drugs are now freely available in Sydney again-perhaps not to respectable citizens such as yourself, Madam Deputy Chair Corcoran-and I am certain that if you walked through the streets of any major city and sought heroin you could find it now. The heroin drought, I am told, is over. That will mean that there will be a lot more convictions and statistics will start to change. Does that mean that law enforcement is failing? Of course it doesn’t. It did not mean that law enforcement was solving the problem before and it does not mean that it is failing now. But a government that has claimed credit, on the basis that the lack of availability of heroin over the last couple of years was due to law enforcement, is going to get punished in the future, because these drugs are now readily available. (Time expired) say, I would just like to compliment the member for Denison on what he has had to say in this place. He is very accurate in his assessment of treatment and the needs of people who are drug dependent. As time caught up with him, he was very specifically accurate in the sorts of things that he said about law enforcement and the reduced availability of heroin. This government and this committee, in my view, made a major blue when they started to take credit for what they saw as a reduction in the use of heroin. There were a lot of reasons for that reduction, but if a government takes credit for a situation that occurs simply as a result of reduced availability-if it goes to the public, thumps its chest and says, ‘Look how successful we’ve been’-it is committing the community and itself to the creation of greater problems through false claims of success. We have to look at policies that address substance abuse at its worse-because that is always the bottom of the trough or the pit, and that is where needs are greatest-rather than simply thumping our chests and claiming that things like zero tolerance are the answer. They are not. Indeed, one of the things that this committee found out is that there is no such thing as one simple answer. A range of answers, responses and policies are required to address the issue of substance abuse, particularly when the heroin availability flow begins again, as it apparently has. MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Committees
331,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (12.21 P.m.),"BeforeI get into the substance of what I want toI must say that I was one of those who fought strongly for the establishment of this reference. In the early stages, when it was first raised, one of the reasons I raised the need for us to have a look at these areas was the number of parents, carers and grandparents that were coming to my office and telling me that they had just discovered that their son or daughter or another loved one within the family was caught up in substance abuse. They would say, ‘We don’t know who to turn to or where to go.’ Indeed, in looking to give them advice, I found that there were many gaps in the services, advice, support and assistance available to these families. In talking to others amongst my colleagues in this federal scene, I found that we all shared the same sort of experience. There was very strong support for this reference from both sides of the political spectrum. I remember Brendan Nelson, for instance, being very angry at the fact that the previous minister for health had refused our reference in this area. He, I and others insisted that we send the matter back to the minister because we believed that it needed to be addressed by our committee. I must say that, in the end, the minister saw good sense, saw the need and, I think, saw that the committee could go out and do some good work in the community in addressing this very vexatious issue. That first committee worked very well. Under the chairmanship of the member for Grey, Barry Wakelin, we met a lot of people, we covered a lot of ground and we listened to a lot of heart-wrenching stories from parents, grandparents and carers, and from family members who had seen their loved ones die or suffer or indeed seen their families ripped apart as a result of substance abuse and the lies, the distress and the trauma that go hand-in-hand with it. In my view, that committee worked very well, on a balanced and bipartisan basis, as we endeavoured to come to grips with what was basically an emerging story of horror. It did not matter where we went or what part of Australia we were in, the stories and the depth of the problems were the same. That gave us a measure of what we were up against and it gave us a challenge that we were able to pull together and work together on. Unfortunately that all changed with the election and this parliament coming in, and there was a change in the people who came onto the committee. As far as I am concerned, the conservatives who came onto the committee came onto it with a narrow political focus, with predetermined outcomes and with an arrogant and belligerent attitude. They made the task of the committee difficult. At times it was impossible for the chair to hide her exasperation at what I saw as offensive and loutish behaviour by people whose only response to this massive problem was to cry that the answer was zero tolerance. Of course that is rubbish. I compliment Julia Irwin, the deputy chair of the committee, on her work and on the way in which she persevered in the face of a number of personal attacks by those opposite who should have been, but were not, part of an attempt to find a bipartisan answer to this incredible problem which confronts Australians, particularly young Australians. The member for Grey said that he felt this report would challenge people. To some degree he is right but, unfortunately, in the main this report will not challenge people as much as it will categorise them; nor will it challenge people as much as it will marginalise them. That is a sad outcome from a report which could have been well and truly worthwhile. I look at the years of work and the amount of time that was put into it and I am very disappointed with the outcome. I am disappointed not just with the outcome but also with the way in which the importance of the committee system has been diminished. I like to think that members of comMAIN COMMITTEE mittees should have independent approaches and independent attitudes to committees. I hate to think that committees are going to be dominated by the executive in the future as this committee has been, and dominated in the way in which the parliament has become dominated by the executive. If those opposite are prepared to let that happen, in my view the parliament, the committee system and we as members are diminished in our capacity to independently, vigorously and intellectually go about resolving some of the issues that we put a lot of work into as committee members. That is the disappointing side of the report. We put in a dissenting report, and I am pleased that we did. When I look at the response to this report from important organisations in our community and when I talk to some of the people who are involved in trying to address the issues of substance abuse in Australia and see their disappointment, I am pleased that I was part of a dissenting report. I will quote, for instance, what the AMA had to say about our report. Under the heading ‘AMA challenges substance abuse report’s illicit drugs recommendations’ they had this to say: “According to ADCA (Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia) methadone maintenance treatment has been clearly demonstrated to reduce illicit opiate use. It has been more successful than other options including: no-treatment; drug-free treatment; placebo medication; or detoxification in clinically controlled trials. It is the most cost-effective treatment for opioid dependence available in Australia. “The Report focuses strongly on abstinence. Evidence shows this is not a reasonable outcome for conditions like opioid dependency, which tend to follow a chronic relapse pattern. “The AMA supports the discussion of abstinence within the spectrum of treatment options. “The report seems to replace harm minimisation with harm prevention but there is little explanation as to what is meant by this change in direction. “The AMA is concerned that this change in direction is a push towards the concept of zero tolerance. “The public health implications of such a dramatic shift in national policy would be catastrophic. “Under this philosophy we will see … the spread of blood borne diseases and an increase in drug related crime and drug related deaths. “Zero tolerance or it neo-euphemism “harm prevention” is something the AMA believes the Australian community should be very wary of embracing as the sole answer to illicit drug use in the community. “The zero tolerance option will never be the panacea for all the community’s drug problems,” Dr Yong said. Dr Yong is a psychiatrist who specialises in adolescent health issues. I thought it was worth recording what the AMA, through Dr Yong, had to say. Just as the community should be wary of adopting zero tolerance as the answer to substance abuse, so too should those in the community who have an interest in this whole issue be wary of adopting this report as a panacea. If nothing else, I hope that the report will at least create and generate some discussion within the community. There are a number of recommendations which we agreed on and which others, like the AMA, support. I hope that this committee report will find some value in some sections of the community, but my fear is that this report will quickly drop into obscurity-that is probably where it belongs. It is a disappointment. I am sorry that we could not give leadership to the people who looked to us for some greater leadership, and I am sorry that we could not use the opportunities that we had to perhaps better pave the way in the future for us as a community to address the issues in a way which comes up with a range of options, not just one narrow political focus of zero tolerance as the answer to all of the issues. MAIN COMMITTEE In conclusion, I want to say that I take a strong interest in these issues. I am the patron of a group in Perth called Cyrenian House who do tremendous work in providing support to drug dependent people. They have some live-in programs and they have extended programs. They do tremendous work. Over the last few years, I have come to admire the tremendous commitment of some of the people in the non-government area who work in these areas to provide support, sustenance and advice, and who nurture not just those who have become involved in the issues of substance abuse but also their families who often feel deserted and do not know who to turn to or where to go. The non-government sector in this nation does a tremendously valuable job as they work with people who have become caught up in substance abuse. I pay them a great deal of respect in terms of the work they do. (Time expired) Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. I am pleased to follow the member for Cowan who, as a member of the committee, had a great insight into the submissions and the general approach that the committee took. I was very interested in his comments. I would like to relate a rather sad story about a family who used to live in my electorate, and I do so under the section of the report entitled ‘Strengthening families and communities’. I make these comments as a backdrop to my general comments on the report. For the information of the House, the letter I will refer to relates to a mother who lost her son through a drug overdose. She wrote to me in 2001, possibly only a couple of weeks after her son died. As I was touched by this letter, I put it aside to use it at an appropriate time. In view of the committee’s inquiry, I think this is the appropriate time to refer to her letter. I rang the woman at the time and I spoke to her yesterday to tell her what I intended to do. She indicated that she fully supports my intention to refer to her correspondence. The story is that on 20 December 1999 Gail’s son Brett told his mother that he was using drugs, mainly speed, and that he wanted to stop. His mother indicated that she would support her son’s attempt to kick the drug habit. Brett went to live with his mother for a short while and then went off to live with his girlfriend. On Brett’s birthday on 20 July 2000, his mother called in to see him but was so shocked and upset by his condition that she was unable to speak to him. She called again a few days later and just sat and talked about drug addiction and what it was doing to her son. Brett said to his mother, ‘Don’t worry, mum, we will go and find out about rehabilitation.’ Brett was sent to a specialty clinic and was advised about the great methadone program that was available. There was counselling each week at the clinic and blood and urine samples were taken to make sure no other drugs were used during the rehabilitation course. The doctor advised Brett that each week the amount of methadone would go down so that eventually he would not require any more and would be drug free. This advice sounded great so both Brett and his mother agreed that the methadone program would get him off drugs. Each week when he went to see his doctor, no counselling took place, there were no check-ups and no urine or blood samples were taken. Brett was simply given a prescription for methadone to be taken to a clinic to get his dose. Brett was never examined or counselled. His mother considered that this particular doctor and this part of the methadone program was a failure. While Brett was on methadone he got into trouble through shoplifting and in a two-week period was arrested five times on 17 charges. MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Committees
332,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.36 P.m.),"I rise to speak in the debate on the report,Brett’s mother said that she witnessed the selling of drugs near both the doctor’s surgery and the methadone clinic. Brett was on the methadone program for three months. He begged his mother to find a place that could help him. His mother phoned all the rehab places, counsellors and doctors, but no-one could help because he was on methadone and would have to get his dose down first. After five months of phone calls and rejections Brett’s mother finally found a doctor who could help. An appointment was made and the doctor agreed that Brett was a good candidate for rapid detox, but he would have to get off methadone and back onto heroin for three weeks before detox could start. The cost was $2,700, which his mother was quite happy to pay. Brett went down to get his last dose of methadone and told them that this was his last dose as he was going into detox. The nurse at the clinic said, ‘You’ll be back.’ Everything went well leading to the detox. Brett was on morphine tablets for three weeks, but his mother noticed an improvement in his condition. On1 March 2001 detox commenced. It was the worse thing Brett’s mother had ever had to do, watching him go into withdrawal while he slept, taking him to the toilet and bathing him. Brett was put on half a tablet a day of naltrexone, and he had weekly visits to the doctor for a check-up and counselling. His mother noticed an improvement in his condition. On2 May, Brett’s mother received a phone call from his girlfriend to say that he was acting strangely and had disappeared. After a number of frantic phone calls Brett’s mother received the call she had dreaded, a phone call that will no doubt live in her memory forever. Her 20-year-old son, who had not touched drugs for three months, was dead. Brett’s mother blamed a lot of people, including herself, but she mainly blamed the system. In her view, methadone was a nail in his coffin. In her letter to me she said: I have read the book that the government has issued and found it to be totally untrue, written by people who have not been there, they say the methadone program is great for rehab, this is a lie, they say the naltrexone is free, this is a lie. She continued: Why my son started taking drugs and why he took this last shot that killed him no one knows except for Brett. I will forever ask the question WHY? The reason for my letter is for the government to listen to people who have gone through this heartache and to spend more time, money and effort on rehabilitation. That is her message. I am sure that many members have heard this tale in some form or other from broken parents and grieving loved ones in their own electorates. I am also sure that members of the committee who sat through the many hearings and read the hundreds of submissions that they received have heard similar tales of distress and heartbreak. This is an important report about an incredibly important subject. There are many reasons why people become addicted to drugs, and therefore many solutions are required to solve the problems associated with drug addiction. There is no magic bullet, no single cure. Methadone works for some but it does not work for all. It did not work for Brett. Similarly, naltrexone is a really good treatment for those it works for, but for others it simply does not work and alternatives must be found. The next wonder drug to be invented will be really good for helping some addicts, while it too will not work for others. What is needed above all else in this field are options. The more options available to addicts and to their families, the more people will be saved. Options do not come cheap. The constant investigation into new treatment and new programs will be expensive. Many people who advocate a zero tolerance approach will be MAIN COMMITTEE unhappy with whatever trials take place and whatever programs are funded, but we must not be deterred by these nay-sayers. Drug addiction must be treated as a health issue as much as a law and order issue, simply because to do otherwise would be to fly in the face of reality. Drug addiction is a health problem. Study after study and medical expert after medical expert tell us this, yet for some the information does not sink in and they wish only to punish addicts not treat them. Some people say, ‘Just say no and everything will be all right.’ Unfortunately it does not work that way. We must have programs in place to treat those on drugs. The hardest thing in many cases is not simply getting somebody off drugs but keeping them alive long enough for them to want to give up drugs. That is the nature of addiction. Unless somebody wants to get off drugs, then the chances of them achieving this are minimal. There is a cycle associated with addiction. How many times have you heard that a friend, neighbour or family member has given up cigarettes at least five times in the past couple of years? They have tried patches, gum or cold turkey, but they are smoking again. Hard drugs are exactly the same. Unless the mind is in the right frame, regression will occur and the addiction will not be conquered. I am concerned by this report’s preoccupation with the new phrase ‘harm prevention’ as opposed to the current terminology ‘harm minimisation’. It might not sound like much, but it does signal a shift in policy away from the sorts of programs designed to keep addicts alive long enough for them to want to kick the habit. An example of this is that the report is opposed to any extension of the heroin injection room trial that is currently taking place in New South Wales. I would be hesitant to support such a recommendation, not because I necessarily agree with heroin injection rooms but because I believe in options being available. I believe in studies being done to see what works and what does not. The heroin injection room may work for some and, if it keeps someone alive, it is a positive outcome and should be considered. As I said, there is no single solution. We need to be taking note of studies and trials being done overseas and we need to be conducting studies and trials of our own. What works in Sydney may not work in Brisbane or in country Australia, but then again it may. We must keep our minds open. To quote Henry Miller: Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. We must keep an open mind. We have to address the underlying social issues that lead to drug taking. We have to tackle the issues of poverty, broken homes, unemployment and crime. Not only that, but we must also tackle problems such as corporate stress and job insecurity, which lead to people who are not otherwise socially or economically disadvantaged taking drugs such as cocaine and heroin. As I have said, there are an indefinite number of reasons why somebody takes drugs or commits a crime to support their habit. The mistake is in assuming that only the socially disadvantaged are drug addicts. This is an issue that affects all levels of our society, and the people who pay the ultimate price are the families who have to live with the aftermath. This is an important report and it is detailed and well considered, but it cannot be allowed to be the end. It must be a step on the road, because there will always be other things that we can do. MAIN COMMITTEE ery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. Having spent three years travelling the length and breadth of Australia during the committee inquiry, it is very difficult for me to try and do this report justice in less than 15 minutes. Road to recovery is an apt title, as the honourable member for Grey said. Those of us who have been on this committee inquiry over two parliaments have wandered down this road and, as we have wandered, we have realised that this is an issue that is so complicated for many people in our society. Many of the committee members have had first-hand experience of these issues. Others have had no experience apart from the constituents who rock up to their offices and present them with a problem. I am proud to have been involved in this committee inquiry from day one, and I can tell you it has been a traumatic but very revealing and rewarding experience for me as a human being. Hopefully I can and will contribute to the betterment of many Australians by trying to implement many of the recommendations of this report. It is a good report in that it provides all Australians with a snapshot of what is happening in this area. It is an area that, unless we are intimately involved with it, we do not want to know about and do not want to get involved in. It is a bit like cancer and AIDS: if it does not affect us, it is all too hard. It is out there and as long as it does not come to our neck of the woods we do not want to know about it. As I said in my five-minute statement when this report was introduced into the House, substance abuse has no respect for people, families or social status. It can strike anywhere and at any time. As I said at that time: there but for the grace of God go I. I do not know why my two daughters never took it up-I am glad they did not-but I have seen lots of young people battling addiction, whether to alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs. It really disappoints me that there are some skewed, politically driven recommendations in this report. We worked tirelessly for three years to come up with a report that, if people read it, will give a great snapshot of what is happening in Australia. That snapshot says that there are huge social costs to Australians who abuse legal and illegal drugs. Collins and Lapsley’s report from 1998-99 said that this cost is $34.4 billion. That is a huge amount of money. Of that, 61.2 per cent is due to tobacco, 22 per cent is due to alcohol and 17.6 per cent is due to illicit drugs. The report said that the highest tangible costs associated with the misuse of drugs were borne in the home-$7.6 billion-followed by the workplace, with $5.5 billion. Costs relating to crime were $4.3 billion. Road accident costs were $2.3 billion and health care costs were $1.4 billion. We are talking about huge amounts of money. In the brief time available to me in this debate, I want to give a small snapshot of some of the areas that I am interested in. One issue that is close to my heart is the way that schools deal with substance abuse. Lots of antisocial behaviour is manifest in schools. As a teacher I witnessed that over 23 years. But it bears a relationship not to the school but to the whole society. Recommendations 4 to 8 of the committee’s report encourage state and Commonwealth government departments and agencies not only to put in place a school structure where teachers are trained in counselling and strategic options for children who are at risk but also to expand that into the community, so that everybody in the community is involved when kids break the rules, fall over and are in need of someone to pick them up. A couple of weeks ago a young bloke-whom I will not name and who has a very close relationship with the family-was caught smoking marijuana in the school grounds. He was given 10 days. He was on his own, with no support. Not only was he at risk but the family MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Committees
333,Mr Quick (Franklin) (12.48 P.m.),"I am delighted to be able to speak on Road to recovwas under stress. Where do you go? Recommendations 4 to 8, if implemented-and I hope and pray they will be-will address one of those areas. We are forming young people’s opinion of where they fit into society, and they do take up this challenge. I think most of us in our teenage years enter that dangerous period when we take up the peer group challenge and smoke this, try that and pop this pill. Most of us grow out of it, but there is that small group of people that become addicted. Having a community response, as the committee recommends, will go a long way to addressing that issue. One of the things that impacted on me was hearing evidence over the three years of the impact on families. I would like to thank publicly all the families who have come before us. There were parents who said, ‘I had to go and buy heroin for my daughter and my son because I did not want them to prostitute themselves for the cost of a fix of heroin.’ We have been to jails and we have seen the tragedy there. We have seen young homeless people in Melbourne and Sydney who are destitute and at a loss as to where to go. We have also seen wonderful places such as the Woolshed in South Australia, which is involved in detox and rehabilitation. It is not funded by any government agency. It is out there in the public domain, asking for public support and doing a fantastic job. We have been to Odyssey House to see the wonderful work there. As I have said before, this is a very complex issue. It not only affects us white AngloSaxons but also is having an enormous impact on our Indigenous population. In the grievance debate in the House on MondayI spoke about its impact on Mornington Island. I have visited hundreds of Aboriginal communities and seen the impact of legal and illegal drugs. In recommendations 27, 28 and 29 we have come up with workable, bipartisan solutions, if implemented. If we are not cost-sharing and duckshoving and we have cooperation between all tiers of government we can address some of these things. It is interesting that, by the time you finalise the report, get it printed and introduce it into the parliament, some governments have thought beyond the square. I publicly congratulate the Victorian government on taking the lead in lots of issues to do with substance abuse for a long time. They were the first to introduce the 0.05 blood alcohol limit and random breath tests, and the rest of the states were dragged kicking and screaming after them, so that we now have a national approach. In a news statement on 14 September Andre Haermeyer, the Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services announced: Victoria could be the first jurisdiction in the world to conduct random roadside drug testing ... This testing may begin by mid-2004. The news release went on to state: ‘Victoria Police is considering this device for roadside drug testing. It has the capacity to test for as many as 15 drugs, including cannabis and methamphetamines.’ The testing device has a disposable test cartridge ... which will evaluate a saliva sample for the presence of drugs. Drivers will be asked to chew on the test cartridge for one to three minutes to generate saliva to be analysed. In our reports we suggested that that be done nationally-not just state by state with a rail gauge by rail gauge mentality. I congratulate Mr Haermeyer, who also said: ... almost 30 per cent of drivers killed in road accidents tested positive to some level of drugs other than alcohol. Last year, 211 drivers tested positive to drugs under the existing drug impairment-testing regime introduced by the Government in 2000. MAIN COMMITTEE That regime needs to be implemented straight away. I think it can be, and, hopefully, it will be. This is a good report but it has some weaknesses, and those weaknesses are principally the result of its having been driven by a particular ideological angle. WhilstI respect Major Brian Watters and his role as the Prime Minister’s head man on this issue, I do not believe that his blinkered view of life-where you can say no-will work for everybody. It is totally unrealistic. We are human beings with many foibles and weaknesses. We-as a society and as members of parliament-must put in place a whole range of regimes, treatment programs and options, because no one person fits just one solution to this problem. I have been on this committee for 11 years, and the beauty of it is that it is a bipartisan committee and all the members work tirelessly. But unfortunately in this last report, Road to recovery, we had some dissenting reports. I can publicly say that I did not agree with all the dissentions and that I disagree with some of my Labor colleagues, but, hopefully, the government will see the need to have a holistic approach to this, rather than a narrow, blinkered approach. We have not had many of the 150 members speak on this. Hopefully, it will be on every member’s shelf and they will all read it when they have the opportunity and encourage people in their communities to get copies not only from their local members but also from the Net. It is a good report. I am proud to be a contributor to it. I thank the House for the opportunity today to speak to it. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Reserve Bank of Australia: Reforms (Question No. 878) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 August 2002 (1) Is the Treasurer aware of reforms announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which identifies an estimated $350 million of profiteering by banks and credit card companies. (2) Has the Government accepted the recommended reforms; if so, what action will the Government take with respect to these recommendations; if not, why not. (3) What powers will the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) be given in order to ensure that benefits flow through to retailers and consumers across Australia. (4) What specific powers will the ACCC be given with respect to ensuring that credit card participants do not seek to recoup any reduction in revenue resulting from a lower interchange fee by increasing other fees and charges. (5) What powers will the Australian Securities and Investments Commission be given in order to ensure that consumer protection from foreshadowed changes to the credit card schemes is preserved. (1) I am aware of the reforms announced by the RBA in relation to credit cards that will ensure that normal market mechanisms work in a more transparent and effective way to the benefit of the Australian community as a whole. (2) The Parliament provided the RBA with powers, under the Payment System Regulation Act 1998, to regulate the payments sector to control risk and promote stability, efficiency and competition. This allows the RBA to introduce the standards on credit cards. These standards are not disallowable instruments and do not require any Government action to implement them. In answer to a question without notice from the honourable Member for Cook on 27 August 2002, I indicated the Government’s support for the RBA’s proposed reforms. (3) The ACCC already has responsibility for ensuring that banks and retailers do not engage in anti-competitive behaviour in setting prices in relation to credit cards. (4) The ACCC already has significant powers to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition, as set out in the Trade Practices Act 1974. (5) ASIC already has responsibility for ensuring adequate disclosure of price changes by financial institutions and merchants. Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 1347) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 February 2003: (1) Why is it still lawful to avoid the payment of personal income tax or other tax through the utilisation of bankruptcy or insolvency. (2) Has bankruptcy or insolvency become a business tool to permit individuals to avoid their obligations to pay their fair share of tax. (3) What is the Government doing to change the law to eliminate this rort.",202,Committees
334,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:ing answer to the honourable member’s question: In January 2002, a joint taskforce on the use of bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of tax issued a report (the taskforce report), making several recommendations to strengthen laws to crack down on high income professionals who try to avoid their tax obligations. On2 May 2003, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan and Attorney General, Daryl Williams released an update on the implementation of the recommendations from the taskforce report. The Government is currently working on the recommendations that emerged from the taskforce report and together with changes already made to the bankruptcy laws, these initiatives will go a long way to ensuring that high income professionals meet their tax obligations. The recommendations include changes to bankruptcy and family law, a review of taxation offence penalties and measures to address the provision of information by the ATO to third parties. Recent changes to the bankruptcy law, as outlined in a Press Release by the Attorney-General on 5 May 2003, have made it more difficult for people to abuse Australia’s bankruptcy system. These changes prevent people from using bankruptcy in a mischievous or improper way and encourage people to consider alternatives to bankruptcy. The Inspector-General of Bankruptcy also has new powers to investigate the conduct of debt agreement administrators and to set out circumstances in which a person is ineligible to act as a debt agreement administrator. Taxation: Revenues (Question No. 1852) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) Is he able to identify judgments in which the superior Courts of the Commonwealth, States and Territories, have referred to the intentional deprivation of the Commissioner of Taxation of taxes to which the Commissioner was lawfully entitled; if so, what are those reported and unreported judgments. (2) Is he able to say how often the Judiciary has indicated to the Legislative and Executive arms of government and, in particular, the Treasury, in judgments and elsewhere, of the gravity of the intentional deprivation of the Commonwealth of revenues lawfully owed to it; if so, what are those indications and when were they made. (3) Is he aware of the article titled ‘Now companies bulldoze their money around, and give the taxman the bird’ by Elisabeth Sexton in the Sydney Morning Herald dated 28 March 2003, where it was noted that Mr William John Walters (‘Bill the Brickie’), who owned a bricklaying business, faced the NSW Supreme Court for having “presided over 10 company collapses between 1989 and 1998”. (4) What action is being proposed to toughen legislation to prevent multiple, deliberate and systematic repeat offenders seeking to use the existing licit legal instruments and relying on the leniency of the Criminal Justice system to delay for the maximum term the payment of tax liabilities; if no action is being taken, why not. (5) What action is being taken to prevent the perpetuators of repeat company failures from presiding over new companies or holding business licences of all kinds or otherwise prevent them holding directorships or other responsible positions for life; if no action is being taken, why not. (6) Is he able to say whether ten different company collapses presided over by one person over a ten year period constitutes good business management.",205,Questions On Notice
