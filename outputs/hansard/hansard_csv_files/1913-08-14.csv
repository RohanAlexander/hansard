First of all, it would be interesting to know what industrial and social legislation we are attempting to destroy. The Leader of the Opposition made some reference yesterday to the question of the abolition of preference to unionists in Government employment, and to the further proposal contained in the memorandum with respect to that matter. So far as I am aware, our action simply reverts to the traditional attitude of the Liberal party on this question. since we have been in Parliament we have fought this question of unconditional preference. There is no mistake in our attitude, nor has there ever been. House in 1904, when the first Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed, the question came up. It was then decided by the House-and I think that we displaced the Government in so decidingthat the President of the Court should have the discretion to grant preference only under certain conditions, those conA f t e r three years of ditions being that there must be no suspicion of politics connected with the union concerned, and that preference should be granted only i i a majority of those interested, not in the union, but in the business which the union represented, should ask for that preference at the hands of the Judge.

The Leader of the Opposition last night made some reference maternity bonus, which, I may say, is becoming a serious matter on the financial side. that the cost this year will £650,000. Of course, we feel gratified at any increase in the population; but this, so far as I know, is not a question of in creasing the population. It is a question of "" paying up "" under certain circumstances. The attitude of this Government has always been that necessitous cases should receive sympathetic consideration. charity! pose, is what the Leader of the Opposition referred to last night when he said that, in proposing to revise the scheme, and confine it to necessitous cases, the Government would pauperise those who receive the bonus. If that be so, then, by implication, those gentlemen opposite, when in office, pauperised every one of the old-age pensioners; that is a stigma that attaches to every old-age pensioner ia the country, who has to set for th his need, and establish it by proof, before he can get a penny. old-age pensions as their scheme. is it that of honourable gentlemen opposite? present Prime Minister opposed it . dividual is pauperised when it is said that -the lie that if the constituents dared to he is in need of a g if t or bonus from the vote for the Liberal party they would lose Governmenta payment from the Gothe old-age pension.

I have yet to learn that be this is a contravention of any democratic principle. To do so would be the height of undemocracy, besides being the height of foolishness. Why pay money to those who do not require it? Does anybody in the country believe that 90 per cent, of the mothers of Australia need this money? If so, what a commentary on the three years of Labour government! What a commentary on all the good things the late Government claim to have thus make it a done-o n the wonderful way in which, to quote the Leader of the Opposition, they claim to have made this country a good place to live in . Nobody believes that 90 per cent, of the mothers of Australia are applying for this bonus because they are in need; it would be a libel on the country to say so. And if the mothers do not need the assistance, I recognise no obligation on the part of the Government to pay them £ 5 each. money if they do not need it? Labour Government passed a law, and in vited them to claim it ; and, according to claim the Leader' of the Opposition, if all did not claim it , then, for instance, Mrs. Jones, who does, is a pauper.

General has said that he will not interfere with the present system until a better one has been brought into existence. I have to interpret the first part of the amendment for myself. I am now running over one or two things which are supposed to represent the destruction of beneficial social laws. suppose another thing coming under this category is the restoration of the postal vote. destroy that social law which prevents sick people from voting, which prevents mothers from voting, the mothers my right honourable friend has taken under his own special wing to succour, the mothers to whom he would not give a vote. going to restore that. As to this matter of consistency, which was made so much of by honourable members opposite last night, they got hold of some interjection of mine to the effect that they were granting further facilities to the people of Queensland to vote, that, while they were taking away the postal vote, they were giving them the absent vote. What is there in this to cause hilarity on the part of my friends opposite? I want them, in the workmore ? absent vote is as good as the postal vote, so far as facilities go. No one will question that. Every one will admit that the absent vote gives more facilities than the postal vote, but that has nothing whatever to do with the abuses that take place under a system of voting. It is the abuses we propose to attack, and not the facilities themselves. We want to p u r if y the facilities, to multiply them as we may, but to take care that the facilities do not generate fraud. Honourable members on the other side have been making a mouthful about the way in which the electoral inquiry has turned out. But at any rate it has shown that there are nearly 6,000 cases of apparent duplicate voting. ""apparent."" Honourable members opposite abolished the postal voting without It is a wicked thing to do finding sixty cases of fraud. They did not hesitate to do that without institutin g prosecutions.

They say, "" If the proposed amendments are carried we shall pass legislation to control trusts and combines in the public interest."" Trusts and combines are the bodies they say that are sending up prices. What are the trusts and combines, and where are they ? My honourable friends were in office for three years grappling with these so-called evil and malign combinations, but what was the result of it all? The so-called Sugar Trust was inquired into by a partisan Commission, containing three men on their own side, and only one Liberal, and they reported that the Sugar Trust at present is not injurin g the community to any extent. They simply said that if you were to nationalize the sugar industry to-morrow you could not r u n the machinery as the present company does. the cost of sugar would go up if that were done, and not down. They said, too, that if you bought this machinery you might have to scrap it , and you would be risking good money in making any such attempt. Sugar Commission said as to the sugar monopoly, which is supposed to be doing such damage in Australia. As to the coal and shipping monopolies, about which so much has been heard, the last word for the present has been heard of them, and what my honourable friends are going to do next I do not know. They will have to be quick, for all their props are being knocked from under them, one after the other, by the hard logic of facts. The shipping and coal monopolies have both gone. The highest tribunal in this land, the highest t r i bunal in the Empire, has said that that combination is not injurin g the public at a l l, that it is a lawful and logical thing to do. for the law. say about that combination is that the honourable member had better not go to Newcastle and advocate the cutting down of the price of coal there. the miners will soon give him a short shrift. price being fixed where it is, and they have done their best to fix it higher. getting the profit, and you know it . know is that the result, of the Vend's operations has been to give the miners an increase of Is. per ton in the hewing rate, and they appreciate that very much, and will not have it interfered with.

What action did the late Government take with regard to the Beef Trust? We can find little trace of any action to deal with the malign combinations which have been depicted all over the country as holding within their grip innocent victims. to deal with them ? heard an answer to that question. The fact is that my honourable friends did not find them, and did not even attempt to deal with them, except in one case, with consequences that we already know. The result of all their attempts to bring down rents and prices and deal with trusts and combines has been an unemployed problem, acute in Victoria, and very substantial indeed as affecting the whole of Australia.

Knibbs says that the whole of the wealth of Australia enjoyed within the year by persons receiving over £200 a year would, if divided up, give 6s. 2d. per week extra. The cost of living of the m?.n who is getting £200 a year to-day has gone up from 12s. 6d. to 15s. a week; and, as Mr. Knibbs points out, if he got his equal share of the whole of the wealth, it would give him 6s. 2d. How far would that go to meet the increase in the cost of his living from 12s. 6d. to 15s. a week?

That is the whole extent of per their immediate proposals within the sphere of nationalization-to nationalize just this little ferry-boat service across the straits; and that is supposed to be sufficient to influence the whole economic condition of Australia, and to better the condition of the worker.

We say that an effort ought to have been made to get more capital and get more people in this country to cultivate our lands, which are lying vacant, and which might produce more food than we are producing to-day, thereby increasing the supply of those things the greater production of which would lead to a decrease in prices, and, consequently, a decrease in the cost of living of the people of Australia. That is one of the practical steps we can take. It is the only method of doing any real good that I can think of. But, in addition to that, there are many ways in which the result desired can be influenced. It can be influenced by good government, and by stimulating those factors in the community which lead to production and prosperity. We want capital; we want people; we want security; we want confidence; we want industrial peace if we can get it ; we want more co-operation between Labour and Capital to attack the natural problems which are here to be attacked and to be solved; we want a cessation of this fratricidal strife by both parties joining together and providing social standards such as this country ought easily to be able to afford to establish. We want to tackle this problem of increasing production, and so bring down the price of commodities. We want good, economical government. righteousness. able friend over there says, we want righteous government. I agree with him entirely. There is one other point which I wish to touch in this indictment. It refers to our failure to recognise the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff.

One naturally inquires what they d id do in those three years to alleviate this urgency, so f a r as Australia is concerned. bring about the policy of new Protection.

"" the Opposition say to the country? said at the Hobart Conference that is more to the point. I will tell the House what he said there. A motion was moved that a plank of the Labour party's platform, "" new Protection,"" should be amended to read ""effective Protection."" A fte r several had spoken, Mr Watson saidHe spoke as one who had advocated Protection all along, and he did not think they were justified in disturbing the present planks. The plank of ""new Protection"" was adopted, and, personally, he did not want much of the old idea of protection for the manufacturer only. They are saying now that the question cannot wait.

Mr Watson also saidTo ask the people of Australia to make sacrifices to encourage industries that did not pay fair wages did not appeal to him. If the constitutional amendments were carried, they would be able to scientifically adjust the relations of the workers to the manufacturing industries. The honourable member for Wide Bay went on to explain the difference between new Protection and old Protection. He saidThey set out to Victoria, befpre Federation, had the effective Protection, but it did not affect the workers as did the new Protection which was advocated by the Labour party. Labour stood for a fair and reasonable wage, and an industry that would not pay that did not deserve to stand.

There are many more statements to the same purport, all of them meaning that the party opposite had thrown the question of Protection overboard-heave d it right overboard. They did so at the Hobart Conference. They said so in all their speeches, and yet they now declare that there is nothing in the world so urgent as an immediate revision of this old Tariff. They say, in effect, "" Never mind the worker or the new Protection. They have gone by the board. Since we cannot get our principles carried out, we will put other principles in their place."" They said to the people of this country, "" Only let us remain in office, and if we cannot get the new Protection, we will immediately proceed to give you the o l d .

215,Mr Josephcook,"I regret to sayWe favouritism, and against preference. are for freedom, square dealing, and just relations between all the members of this community. -The Prime Minister has put his side of the case with that assurance, and I was going to say in that inimitable manner, that has always distinguished him in this House. very well, one might have fancied that it was the Liberty York harbour speaking, so many were his references to liberty and freedom, and so complete was Ids evasion of the gravamen of the attack made by the Opposition. But let us look at things a little closely. In considering the Government programme we must have regard to the men from whom it sprang. Ministry has claimed the right to an ancestry. During the campaign the present Prime Minister asserted with much fervpur, and with maddening iteration, that his party stood in the line of a great succession and inherited the traditions of the great Liberal party. England might have been given the idea that this claim was justified, and that the present Ministerial party was in some way the lineal descendant of the great Liberal party of England. Nothing could be further from the fact. The party that we see opposite is a direct result of a fusion betwen two parties that for many years in this country achieved whatever notoriety they had by violently, consistently, and persistently abusing each other, and denouncing each other's policy. Por years I listened in this House to denunciations of the leader of the other section of the party by the honourable member for Parramatta. many years I listened with very great pleasure to denunciations of the honourable member for Parramatta by the leader of that section. I fail utterly to see how a party, with the political record of honourable members opposite, can claim for itself that it ""stands in the line of a great succession,"" that it is a lineal descendant of the Liberal party. That is just what it is not. claim whatever to a legitimate ancestry. It sprang into being animated with but one, solitary idea, and that was to defeat the Labour party-to defeat that are against privilege, against intolerable upstart-that hewer of wood, We and drawer of water-wnic h ventured at last to push aside the master of the house, and to do its own work in its own house on behalf of and in the interests of the people. For doing that we have earned the undying enmity of those who sit opposite, and, in particular, the enmity of those for whom they stand, and those privileged classes If one did not know him whom they represent in this Parliament. We must remember all these things. great Statue of We must never forget, when we view the at the entrance to New programme put before us by the Government, that we have to look not merely at the paper itself and what is printed on it , but behind the paper, and even behind the Government immediately responsible for it . This document is redolent of the great conflict between privilege and the people. We must not forget what has The been and is to be. The echoes of the battle have yet hardly died away. The smoke is not yet cleared from the battlefield. Are we to forget them because we are spoken to in soft tones by the honourable gentleman, who has recently cultivated an urbanity of manner which Peoplei n befits him very indifferently. The Prime Minister smiles in the most ingratiating way, and would have us believe that it is in the spirit of Christian brotherhood that he approaches us. He says, "" Come let us reason together. Here is our programme; it is a most excellent t h in g ; let us pass it into law."" He would t r y to persuade the people of this country that he desires to do so. But nothing was further from the thoughts of the honourable gentleman who framed that programme than that it should be passed into law. It is the gage of battle, and is thrown down here for one purpose, and one alo?ie. It is a mere For posturing to the gallery. There are in it four or five shibboleths, to placate those who must be appeased here and outside, for the party on the other side is made up of all sorts and conditions of men. It comprises men whose ideas are almost on all fours with our own, and others who stand at the very antipodes from us. It is a party which is bound together by no common It has no set of principlesa party which, if it had its own way, would regard the programme put before us as the last on God's earth for which it should vote. The Prime Minister spoke of, and read from a report",27,Irvine Ther E Is No Ments To Show Where Honourable Members
216,Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [4.10].,"of the Hobart Conference. That is one thing in which no doubt we have erred. We conduct our business in the open. Any man may come in and hear us confer. and hear our conferences, but no man from outside the party has ever yet been allowed to attend a Liberal conference, and no report of a Liberal conference is ever published, except that which is handed to the reporter. We, however, conduct our business in the open, because our movement, as it springs from the people, gathers strength from publicity. What has it to lose by giving publicity to its doings ? Have we not gained everything that we have by that very publicity which our friends opposite shun ? But now let us take their programme by and large. It starts with proposals for electoral reform, and speaks of purification of the rolls. that particular point, is almost pathetic. Readingi t , one can imagine Jove stepping down from Olympus, with tears in his eyes, regretting the intolerable state of corruption in which he finds himself. The idea is, of course, to persuade the electors that the rolls were in a very shocking state. Yeti t is all a sham. Por the Government, who talk of purification of the rolls, caused an inquiry to be made, and that inquiry, unhappily for them, has proved abortive. They have found nothing. The Prime Minister said there were nearly 6,000 cases of fraud. just statement. spoke of duplication. amended his first statement, but the fact remains that he uttered it . Praud is a charge that ought not to be made if it is going to be withdrawn shortly afterwards. did not make it . honourable member's assurance. has been no case of fraud, nor any suggestion of such a thing. So far as I can gather from the Chief Electoral Officer, nearly every one of these cases can be explained in a legitimate way. But this outcry about the rolls is very suggestive. During all the years honourable members opposite were in the majority there was no suggestion of fraud . There was then no questioning of the electoral machinery. There was then not even a breath of suspicion about the means that An y man may come in had put them where they were. Now, because the gods have placed them in such an unhappy position that it is only by your benign presence in the chair, Mr. Speaker, that they are where they are at all, they rail like hysterical women against the fates. They say, "" Look where we are ! There must be a swindle somewhere, or else we should be safe on the other side of Jordan."" And so they declare that 5,000 or 6,000 people in this country have been guilty of duplicate voting. The Prime Minister said that I had made a charge against the people of .this country in regard to postal voting. He quoted some remarks from a speech I made at the TownH a l l ; and I do not withdraw Its note, when it reaches one word of that speech. My remarks were based upon extracts from speeches delivered by members of the Queensland Parliament when the postal vote in that State was abolished. Here is what the leading men of Queensland thought of the postal voteMr Kidston, Premier, said : "" Every one of us knows quite well that the way postal voting was carried out in many cases made it to ali intents and purposes open voting, under the eye of some one who"" probably had some power over the person voting "" Mr Hawthorn, Home Secretary "" The postal vote is of such a nature that fraud .is made easy owing to a considerable amount of abuse of the postal vote "" Mr Thos. Mowbray, P.M., Toowoomba "" The general tendency of the voting by post He did not. certainly impairs the secrecy of the ballot in more ways than one. The freedom of the elector is forestalled. Hundreds obtain postal votes through misstatements "" amended it, and P. M . J. McGill, returning officer, Ipswich"" Scores of postal certificates went to one admay have dress, and were taken out to the several electors by the justice of the peace, collected, and posted by him. I am of opinion that postal voting was not secret voting, and is open to very great abuse."" Postal voting was abolished in Queensland because it led to grave abuse. It was abolished here for the same reason. The Prime Minister is now very enthusiThere astic about the postal vote, but he was not always in favour of it . When he and I were in the State Parliament of New South Wales, I was of the opinion that the postal vote was the only way in which nomadic workers could exercise the franchise; and a measure was introduced by Sir George Reid providing for the postal vote.

Owing to the Chairman putting the question hurriedly, it was necessary to move for the recommittal of the B ill in order to reinstate the clause. New South Wales Hansard of 28th October, 1896, page 4453, the division list can be f o u n d; and from this it will be seen that the present Prime Minister was amongst those who voted against the proposal to recommit the B ill in order to provide course, that fact will create neither excitement nor astonishment mind of anybody. Not a smile ripples the opposite. of annoyance, and not of astonishment; everybody is perfectly satisfied that that was just what the honourable gentleman was likely to do in the circumstances. member has done the same. p u r if y the rolls, of which we-hear something now, and to introduce the postal vote in the place of the absentee vote, would lead the public to believe that the franchise has been denied to a large number of people.

The honourable member's idea of humour is such that I venture to suggest to him that he rehearses it thoroughly and systematically before bringing it out in public. I was dealing with this matter in a serious way. member is not able to restrain himself in the chamber, possibly he can find some duties in the Whip's room that will keep him occupied. I conceive this to be a very serious matter indeed. Minister occupies a different position from most, if not all, of his colleagues, in that he is, or was, a unionist himself; and while I can understand the Attorney General taking up this stand, I am bound to say I cannot understand the Prime Minister doing so, for it is inconceivable to me that a man who has been a unionist can take up the attitude that preference should not be granted to a unionist. W h y should a unionist not have preference, ail other things being equal ? So far as I can gather, the present attitude of the Prime Minister is that he will allow preference unsanctioned by law in any case in which the union can enforce it for itself. The strong unions, the virile, powerful unions that manage to get preference by force, majeure, have it ; to the victors the spoils; to the strong what they can get. To those who have misrht on their side the Prime Minister would srive it , but to those who have merely right on their side he would give nothing. This attitude is not only illogical, but is quite opposed to every principle of civilized government. For preference is righ t or wrong. If it is wrong, no man, whether he gets it by his own strong arm or by the force of Here, however, we have the prinlaw, should have it ; but, if it is right, It then the law should sanction it . Nothing should exist in this country unless the law approves or tolerates it . I am The connected with a union that had preference long before the law granted it . And how was it got ? By virtue of lex But in plain talionis, by virtue of their strength. They were strong, they wanted preference, they simply took it . But that is not civilizat i o n ; it is not the method of a civilized community; no man can justify such methods save where the voice of law is silent. If preference to unionists is right, the law should sanction it , and regulate it . If it is wrong, it should not be permitted at all. able member takes up a logical attitude, and I approve it . Let us now consider the question whether a unionist has the right to preference. The basic prinI was serious. ciple of all industrial legislation is that If the honourable strikes and industrial disputes are bad for the community. It substitutes law for force, it offers a means of settling strikes, and so securing industrial peace. No one knows better thaii the AttorneyThe Prime General how ineffective legislation has been, nor does any one. know better the reason for it . Yet handicapped as the Federal Court has been, it has been a power for good. To prevent strikes then is the aim of this class of -legislation. Now, strikes occur through bodies of workmen banded together in an organization stopping work. Whether Jones or Smith stops work is a matter of indifference to the community. But it is quite a different matter when 10,000 or 100,000 men cease work by concert, throwing the whole industrial machinery out of gear. Second to war, industrial strife is the greatest problem confronting civilized society to-day. If anything can promote industrial peace we ought to stretch out our hands and gather it in let them without hesitation. strike, and you make the workers slaves. selves in unions in order to get better",30,Irvine Ther E Is No Ments To Show Where Honourable Members

Leave them that power; do not interfere with it . the world has to-day he owes to himself. thoroughly agree with you. whatever benefits the worker has to-day he owes to himself, and himself alone, as a unit of an industrial organization, and seconded by his efforts as a unit in a political organization or as a citizen in a free country. He owes it to nobody else. Now, one of the rights that every free man has is to cease work whenever he likes. If there is any fundamental right a man has, that surely is one-to cease work. Very well; now the industrial law comes along and says, "" You shall not cease work; it is an offence to cease work. Come to the Arbitration Court and settle your dispute there. If the Judge thinks proper he can give you preference of employment under the new conditions whatever they are."" the position, if that contingent right is taken away 1 a man, "" Do not cease work, because it is bad for the community; the community asks you not to cease work ' ' ; but we give him nothing in return. If we do not give preference, what is the unionist to get for his abandonment of his fundamental right to cease work ? Absolutely nothing. ter says that the unionist is to get preference when he can get it ; that is to say, there is to be anarchy over the industrial field. is only to get preference when he can enforce it by numbers, what is the good of the Court? W h y should he go to it at all ? the right of a unionist to preference is the absolute corollary of industrial arbitration or the settlement of industrial disputes by legal tribunal. Honourable members on the Ministerial side say a great deal about the non-unionist and his rights. what are the rights of the non-unionist? He has the same right as the unionist as a citizen, and no more. The unionist The conditions of the workers all owes his bettered conditions, not to his The being a citizen, but to his being a unionist. He pays his money into his union, and spends his time in his union, and incurs odium and obloquy to get nothing in return. Is the man who stops outside, takes no chances, incurs no risks, who smoodges and does everything necessary to stand W h a t the worker of well with the employers, and who never has done a solitary day's work to l if t up Hear, hear! 1 his fellow-creatures since he was born, to be preferred to the unionist who has I was saying that fought the battle and borne the heat and burden of the day? That would be most unjust. The non-unionist has a' right, as a citizen, to everything he can get; but he has no right to take the fruits of the toil of the unionist. Preference is the just return to the unionist for his organized effort to improve the conditions of labour. These improved conditions are due to his efforts. By what right can the non-unionist claim to sweep him aside ? Preference to unionists is the necessary corollary to compulsory settlement of disputes by legal tribunals. If preference is to be abolished, then let us abolish this law and go back to the "" good old weapon of the strike."" Let us see where the non-unionist will be then. The non-unionist Well, what is is to-day in an infinitely better position because of unionism than he ever was Here we say to before. Unionism has lifted the industrial fabric bodily up, and has made the base of the pyramid broader and stronger. All the industrial classes have benefited by the work of unionists. Preference to unionists is not only the right of the unionist, it is absolutely fair. One^of two things must be The Prime Ministrue-eithe r there are enough unionists to do all the work of the country, or there are not. If there are enough, they have as much right to be considered, man for And, in any case, if the unionist man, as have the non-unionists. If there are not enough unionists to do the work of the country, then non-unionists must get the work that the unionists cannot do. Nothing can be surer than that Man for man, what greater right has the non-unionist for the consideration of the community than the unionist? Society says to the unionist, "" Do not strike,"" and makes a law to punish him for striking. Surelyi t must give him something in return.

The Prime Minister wants industrial peace; yet he throws down the gage of industrial war. One word more on this point. The Prime Minister says that he prefers Wages Boards. He says that he knows nothing better than the Victorian system of Wages Boards. All that I have to say is that Wages Boards, first of a l l , do not attempt to deal with industrial disputes. Sir them. the thing, Wages Boards are limited in their scope. Victoria, have not been very successful. A statement was made by Sir Alexander Peacock during the campaign that the greatest relative increase in wages in any State had occurred in Victoria, where Wages Boards existed, and arbitration courts did not exist. I believe that that is true; b ut the reason why it took place was because wages were lower in Victoria than they had been in any other State. Here are the figures, which show the actual state of things in 1911, the latest year for which we have statistics. The average wage paid in the manufacturing industries in New South Wales was £ 9 2 10s.; in South Australia, £ 9 4 I s . ; in Western Australia, £12 5 10s.; in Tasmania, £ 8 0 7s.; m Queensland, £ 8 3 16s.; and in Victoria, £ 7 8 14s., being the lowest rate in the group-lowe r even than the rate in Tasmania. Judged from that standpoint, there is very little to recommend the Wages Board system, and that they assured good wages is the only thing which can recommend it . In al l other respects it must f a i l ; it has failed. In its very nature it has not the power to deal with the causes of disputes, and, therefore, is quite unsuited to deal with the great industrial problem that faces civilization in this as in every other country. point Prime Minister, in his speech, said something about trusts, and the high cost of living. paign we heard a very great deal about these things. The high cost of living was the pivotal point round which the members of the Government gyrated. They declared that the high cost of living was owing to the legislation ^of the Labour party. They said that the dearness of money was caused by the Labour party; and that, from one cause or other, the people of this country were very much worse off as the result of Labour legislation and Labour rule. In these circumstances, one would naturally imagine that the first point to which my honourable friends would direct attention, after effecting electoral reform, if they thought electoral reform necessary, would be some measure for affording relief to the people. had increased from £ 1 0 to £ 1 2 per headI In the very nature of do not know whether he meant per family.

Of course, sir, as you know very well, the Labour Government did not impose one penny piece of taxation except by the tax on the unimproved value of land. It imposed a tax on the great estates of this country, and it was time that it did. Buti t can surely never be contended that the Federal land tax caused the increase in the cost of living, when 230 persons paid nearly half of the taxation. An Honorable MEMBER And reduced the value of the land of the small man at the same time. tax, not one penny piece of extra taxation did the Labour party i m pose. There were two or three alterations in rectifying some anomalies in the Tariff, b ut they were quite negligible. It cannot, therefore, be too often stated that the assertion frequently made during the campaign by our honourable friends on the other side, that the Labour party had increased the burden of taxation upon the shoulders of the people, was absolutely without foundation. All that we did was to impose a tax upon the unimproved value of land in the case of great estates, and we derived £1,400,000 per annum from that source. It was money that was absolutely necessary; it is necessary now, and the proof of that is that it is not I come now to another proposed for a moment to repeal one of great importance.

What does he propose to do now ? In 1910, he said that it did not matter which side of the House proposed the amendments; if they were right, they ought to be supported. In 1912, he said that he had altered his opinion, and that as long as we remained in office he would not do anything to advocate them. Now, the last barrier is removed. office. most unmistakable way that they desire an amendment of the Constitution. What does he propose to do about it ? The honourable and learned gentleman knows, even if the Prime Minister does not, that there is no other way by which trusts, combines, and monopolies can be dealt with. He knows perfectly the ineptitude of the Constitution as it stands. Prime Minister said that the Sugar Commission and the Courts have found that there are no harmful monopolies in this country. Courts have so ruled. a referendum on certain promoment admit that the Sugar Commission did anything of the sort. It established the fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had a monopoly. I hold in my hand a copy of the judgment of the Court of Appeal of New Zealandi n the case of The Merchants Association of New Zealand v. TheK in g, and shall quote from the remarks of Mr JusticeW i l liams, who delivered the judgment of the Court. He declaredIn the present case, the Sugar Company had clearly a monopoly in the manufacture of refined sugar in New Zealand, and practically a complete monopoly in the sale of it, as the amount of imported refined sugar, so far as regards competition, was negligible. The company wished to preserve that monopoly, and to exclude foreign competition. It also wished to secure the co-operation of the merchants as a distributing agency. The object of the merchants was to secure the exclusive control of the sugar trade, to keep the distribution of sugar in their own hands, and to prevent competition. The charges against the company, and against the Merchants Association, were f u l l y established, and the conviction was upheld. If there were power under our Constitution to make a law by which What is trusts, combines, and monopolies could be effectively dealt with, I say without hesiAre they going to do anytation that it would not be difficult to secure a similar decision in the Courts of the Commonwealth. But unti l the ConWhen our first restitution is amended, it is, in my opinion, waste of time to proceed against them. In regard to trusts, combines, and monopolies, and in regard to company law, and industrial matters generally, nothing can be done effectively unless there is an amendment of the Constitution.

A t the best, all that it will accomplish will be to put the rural workers to the necessity of organizing under a State law, or under the shelter of some great organization which will compel fair and equitable conditions to be granted to them outside the law.

I want to say that I know nothing about the merits of the rural workers' log. But I certainly do know that it does not matter what the men ask for. which the Court grants, and I want to say to every farmer in Australia that it is not what workmen have asked for that matters, but what the Court grants.

So far as the Labour party is concerned, the ideal of its old-age pension scheme is that to every citizen, without any condition whatsoever except that of age, there should be paid a pension. therefore, it is no argument to say that the maternity allowance ought to be put upon the present footing of the old-age pensions. age pensions on the same footing as the maternity allowance. we assumed office when the finances were comparatively a result, we were unable to do that which we would like to have done. have done something to extend and liberalize the operations of the old-age and invalid pension; and I do most emphatically ment nity would imagine that the allowance as it now stands was an iusult to the community, and that it represented an entirely novel proposal. is based upon the very same Education ditions of people, irrespective of whether they have money or not.

If , however, the Government propose a national contributory schemea scheme to be applied to the whole community, and make it compulsoryI think that that cannot be done; and I believe that the Attorney-General will support my view. And now I must draw to a conclusion. There is in this programme a great deal more with which I might deal, but I have covered the main points. That which remains is comparatively unimportant. There is in it a reference to a Postal Commission, but of its nature and scope we are not precisely informed. Whetheri t will be acceptable to this House or not remains to be seen when the measure providing for it is brought down. I shall express no opinion about it any more than I shall say anything in regard to paragraph 5 of the policy statement, from which it appears that there is some prospect of a gentleman being sent Home to take part in a Conference. That, no doubt, is quite an agreeable prospect for the gentleman who is going. I wish him God-speed, and if he is amongst honourable members opposite, then I say that the sooner he goes the better. Paragraph 8 deals with the development of the Northern Territory. It is one of those gentle, inoffensive paragraphs that find their way into documents of this sort-of the kind which you could take home and show to your family without any danger of them in any way. The Government follows very serenely in the tracks laid down by my colleague, the honourable member for Barrier, when he held office as M i nister of External Affairs, and although it does take to itself some credit for doing something, we know very well that it has done nothing more than merely carry out the suggestions of the late Administration. That criticism applies also to paragraph 9. tion at all, so far as the proposals of the Government in regard to the Northern Territory are concerned, is their declared intention to substitute the freehold for the leasehold system.' We shall see to what extent the «hange goes. Meantime efficient nnto the day is the evil thereof. There is in paragraph 11 a prospect of a sort of happy landa resting place or haven for some unfortunate, in a General Works Department. yet too near, nor is it yet too clear what it fs that is proposed. prospects in it , and no doubt it is one of those things that are not without their influence upon honourable members on the other side. We are told that in carrying out public works it is the intention of the Government to resort, as far as possible, to the contract system. That, of course, is another sop to Cerberus. Doubtless those enthusiastic patriots who earn their living by carrying out public work, entirely, of course, from a philanthropic stand-point, will appreciate most sincerely this announcement. There is, too, in the policy statement a reference to the gold reserve which will no doubt restore public confidence, and reassure those timid ones that all is well. But lest there should go abroad the idea that the present gold reserve behind the Commonwealth note-issue is insufficient, I should like to remind honourable members that, whereas, according to Mr Braddon, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the private banks have now a gold reserve of only 22 per cent, of their total liabilities, we have a gold reserve of much larger extent. But no doubt there is something about a private bank in itself at once inspiring and reassuring. Our memories, of course, decline absolutely to go back to 1893. We remember nothing at all about such a dreadful time. And so we will not introduce here any of those disturbing and unpleasant matters. When the measure offending, annoying, or exciting dealing with the gold reserve eomes before the House, however, we shall have something to say about it . And now, sir, taking the programme by and large, and looking at it as the programme of a Government that has come in to inaugurate a new era-to restore honest, sound, economical government, to put an end to an orgy of extravagance, to remit or lighten the burdens of taxation which press so heavily on the shoulThe only point that requires menders of the people, to reduce the cost of living-in short, a Government that has come into power to give freedom, happiness, and plenty where we had slavery and restriction, depression and despair, I ask any man in this House, and any citizen in the country, what prospect of satisfaction, what single ray of hope, they get from this programme ? Whose burden does it lighten? What taxation does it remit? What avenue closed by monopoly It is not or privilege does it open? Doesi t make it easier for the working man to get a But there are living ?

290,Mr Mathews,"There is no doubtknowledge of history or of modern conditions can resist. But what is the claim that is now made, and which is supported in such violent terms by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat ? It is not that persons should have the right to associate or organize themselves for industrial purposes, or even for political purposes. which rest merely on the voluntary action of people who are responsible to no one but their own members should use the machinery them with the legal right to receive preference in employment over those who do not choose, in the exercise of their liberty, to join their associations. Let us investigate this for a minute or two. Who are the people who make this claim ? What is the character of the unions putting forward this extraordinary proposition ? There was a time in the history of modern Europe when there were associations connected w it h industries of many kinds whicli were recognised by the law, which assumed responsibilities with respect to the community, and fulfilled duties towards the community, duties to train the young to take the place of those who went away or died, to bring up apprentices to be efficient workmen, and to protect in the enjoyment of their rights all those who were members of themI refer, I need hardly say, to the mediaeval guildsalso to bring about a condition of efficiency by the inducements to enable the apprentices to become journeymen, and the journeymen tobecome master workmen. By the ambitions in their various spheres which they couraged ciency, and thus fulfilled a service to the whole community. And they had, in effect, a form of preference to unionists, because no one could carry on the businesses-unless they joined the guilds. But are the conditions and duties which those guilds acknowledged and fulfilled to the community fulfilled by the modern militant trade unions? Do these trade unions exist for the purpose, among other things, of encouraging apprentices? MrW . H . IRVINE the activities in that direction been with the view of limiting apprentices? making a statement that is wrong. MrW . H . IRVINE If so, the honourable member will have abundant opportunity of correcting it . Meantime, it is my statement. Have the modern trade unions always insisted upon the f u l l exercise of individual effort by their members? Do they tend towards efficiency? We know it is common knowledge that it It is a claim that associations is by no means an uncommon thing to i m pose a l i m it upon the output of their members. Do these unions exist for the purpose purely of the protection of their of the law to endow members, and to enable their members to get the benefit of the best market, and the best price for their labour ? Are they not in reality political bodies of an aggressive character ? The greater portion of their funds is contributed to political purposes. MrW . H . IRVINE I am unable to bring forward evidence to prove that statement up to the hil t with regard to all parts of Australia, but it happens that the laws of New South Wales and of Western Australia require industrial unions to make a return of their expenditure under different heads. In New South Wales the last returns show that the total income of trade unions in 1911 was £163,44 8 and the total expenditure £146,959. but for all purposes. MrW . H . IRVINE W h a t are these various purposes if they are not political ? MrW . H .

MrW . H . IRVINE I have said that the total expenditure amounted to £146,959, and I find that of this the total amount returned to members in connection with death claims, accident, sick and other benefits, was only 19.65 per cent, of the whole expenditure, or about £28,000. gentleman know that the biggest union in Australia pays £ 1 per week in case of accident to a member?

297,Mr Poynton,"Does the honorableknow, but which he does not desire to hear. When I ask where all the expenditure goes, my honourable friends tell me that the bulk goes in accident payments, yet I have shown that the whole amount spent on death claims, accident and sick benefits was under 20 per cent, of the total expenditure. MrW . H . IRVINE honourable member that I am not accustomed to be submitted to cross-examination. He can obtain the information he seeks from any source he pleases. I have not got it for him, but I am giving him some interesting information, which may be of use to h i m. Where does all the money go? and other expenses amounted to no less than 73.33 per cent. In Western Australia the figures given are-Tota l amount of expenditure £54,905 , and the amount returned to members for death claims, accident, and sick benefits was 27 per cent., whilst the amount spent upon management and other expenses was 69.33 per cent., so that the figures for Western Australia are a little better than are those for New South Wales. In both cases, apparently, the amount paid for "" management and other expenses "" is immensely greater than the expenditure upon everything else. MrJ . H . CATTS -What is the honourable gentleman quoting from? MrW . H . IRVINE returns published under Acts of Parliament in New South Wales and Western Australia. to preference to unionists what the honourable gentleman has quoted from. He has used his figures publicly, and it is only fair that he should let us see what he has quoted from. MrW . H .

IRVINE read from my own notes without submitting them for the inspection of honourable members opposite? man should withdraw his statement. The honourable member for Adelaide did not wish to see the honourable gentleman's private notes. MrW . H . IRVINE The honourable gentleman may ask me for anything he pleases, when I have concluded my speech, and I shall consider whether he shall have it or not; but I prefer not to be interrupted in the middle of my speech by demands for anything. The honourable member for West Sydney contends that the claim for preference to unionists is merely a claim for the right of associated unionI can assure the ists to exist. All that we say in our proposal is that we shall impose as a condition upon legal preference to unionists that those who claim it shall not be purely militant political organizations. That is all. If I am asked for my personal views upon the matter, I shall say that I think we cannot logically or properly stop there. I find that management I say that no law, and no agency of a law, has the right to say to any man whoever he may be, and who obeys the law, that he shall be deprived of an equal chance of earning his livelihood vsjith every other man. honourable gentleman's profession open? MrW . H . IRVINE The honourable member for West Sydney referred to my profession in the same way as those who now interject, and let me say that I am tired of the perpetual reiteration of the statement. The law gives no preference to members of the legal profession. The law requires in the legal profession, as it requires in the case of a doctor, a chemist, a dentist, or a cabman, that a member F r o m official of it shall obtain a certain licence before he deals with the rights and liberties in trusted to his care. I say that it is I want to say, with regard against every principle of right, and against the fundamental principle of I should like to see British justice, that the law should say to any man who is guilty of no offence against the law, and who is merely desirous to retain his right to live according to his own ideas, while obeying the law of the land, that he shall only do so under the condition that, unless he joins an irresponsible political union, he and his family will probably be deprived of the means of livelihood. We must do one of A m I not to two things. The State may say that, under proper conditions, every man who works shall be a unionist. I could understand that. I could understand a rationalman saying that, in the interests of the whole community, no man should be allowed to practise a profession unless he has complied with such conditions as we know are now imposed on",43,Robert Best N O They Prevent The Prime Minister Stated That Taxation

302,Mr Howe,"Then, why not throw thethe members of certain professionsthat he should comply with certain conditions, and show his efficiency; and if you had then unions, associations, or callings created under the law responsible to the community as a whole, and obedient to the regulations imposed by Parliament for their guidance, you might say, "" We will impose upon every person who desires to be a mason, or a carpenter, or a bricklayer, the obligation of complying with those conditions, and becoming a member of that calling."" But what you are doing now is to claim the right to say that a union shall retain to itself the privilege to say who its members shall be. Mr W. H . IRVINE plain position. If I had my own way, I would say that Parliament should wipe off the statute-book as the ugliest blot ever put upon it , a provision which enables a legal tribunal to grant a legal preference to unionists in any shape. This proposal is only one short step. It may be an important step. The honourable member for West Sydney has said that it is an important step, that it will affect practically nine-tenths of the existing unions. I hope that it is so; but it should always commend itself to the approval of every one, e\en on the lowest ground of political justice, that a union which exists as an element in a political party has no right to ask Parliament to intervene and act as a recruiting sergeant for itself. sent provide that before you can get the advantage of arbitration you must be a unionist ?

IRVINE entirely to the people who form this organization to say whom they shall consist of. MrW . H . IRVINE plained my views on that subject, and do not intend to take up any more of my .limited time in dealing with it . I shall conclude that part of my speech by saying that, in my opinion, to the feeling of opposition to this aggressive claim for preference to a section-to a political party-is due more than to anything else the uprising in the community that cost the party on the other side their seats on the Treasury bench. The honourable member for West Sydney dwelt considerably, too, on the second ground that the Government policy indicates no intention of taking steps to reduce the high cost of living. What steps did the late Government take in that direction? referenda carried, and you know it . MrW . H . IRVINE In what direction does the honourable member for West Sydney say that he could, if he had been allowed to remain in office, reduce the cost of living? He did not say so in his speech; but he said from the platform, T h a t is the as did nearly every member of the Labour party during the campaign, that the high cost of living is due to the action of trusts, combines, and monopolies. stand to that. MrW . H . IRVINE Of course, the honourable member will stand to it as the best political capital he has. He has to stand to it . The honourable member for West Sydney, I might mention, occupied for three years the position of Attorney General, charged with the special duty of putting the Anti-TrustA c t into operation. He, although he launched one prosecution launched forhim. MrW . H . IRVINE We l l , he did not launch a prosecution, but he carried one to an unsuccessful issue. There were a great many other allegations of the existence of horrible combines that were No , and that is sucking the people's blood. From every platform, during the campaign, our honourable friends talked to the people about trusts and combines. They said, "" Only give us the constitutional powers and we No ; it is l e f t will abolish trusts and combines. We will reduce your cost of l i v in g ; we will make your wages buy you things which you never bought before, if you will only But is it not a union ? return us with the necessary industrial I have expowers.""

My honourable friend denies that he ever made the statement that there were these trusts. that an allegation was made by some people that there were trusts which had not yet been investigated. A t all events, the late Attorney-General spent three years in office with all these terrible trusts in existence, and during that period his party and his Government were armed with the most drastic and complete antitrust law that existed in any part of the world. too, feeling its point and grinding the point from time to time on the legislative grindstone. But what use did they make of the law? I am going to point out what they did. at the beginning start ? MrW . H . IRVINE tell the House now.

I am having a synopsis of all the facts prepared with that view. That is a matter which wil l take a good many months to complete. But I think it is right that I should now put the Housei n possession of the opinions which have already been formed in the Department concerning those matters which have been investigated. I find that there had been twenty-six cases up to the 21st September, 1911. It is a curious thing that the activities of the Department, which seem to have been very great through the earlier part of that period, went to sleep about the end of 1911, though they woke up again in the most violent condition immediately before the elections. gentleman quoting from? MrW . H . IRVINE place these papers in the honourable member's hands. Every one of the opinions was given by the Crown Solicitor after investigation. Crown Solicitor at the time is now occupying the exalted position of a Justice of I do not know the High Court. Therefore, his opinions, arrived at after an examination of the facts, are entitled to be regarded with He says particular weight by the members of this House. I make no apology for referring to the names, because the matters investigated have become notorious, and it is indeed fair that they should be known. The first case is that of the Colonial Oil Company, which was no less than six times brought before Mr Powers for his opinion. Fresh facts were being continually brought forward, and he was asked to give fresh opinions.

To-read the whole of the opinions would take more time than I have, and would exhaust the I am going to patience of the House. I propose to leave this book for the examination of honourable members on the Library table for a time.

MrW . H . IRVINE No doubt. Ultimately the decision was "" Cannot advise prosecution."" It was the great stock-in-trade of my honourable friends opposite, at the last election, that the Commonwealth was f u l l of blood-sucking combines, but that the Government could not cope with them because the Constitution stood in the way.

I do not wish, at present, to allege that the late Government either did or did not do their duty, because to do that I should have myself to express an opinion as to whether a prosecution ought to have been launched. I say nothing about that. I merely intend to show that all the talk about trusts and combines comes down to one very small matter, to which I shall allude. The Tobacco Combine, as I have said, was shown to be no detriment to the public. That was the ultimate result arrived at by Mr Powers. However, we now come to a serious case. the Confectionery Combine. actually one of the cases in which a prosecution was recommended. a report like that, too. MrW . H . IRVINE about that, because the Beef Trust has not been investigated yet. The Beef Trust was the great political capital of the other side during the elections.

He saidConsidering the papers previously submitted, with the report referred to and the evidence taken by the CommissionThe Commission appointed to inquire into the alleged combineI am of opinion that, although there is undoubtedly a combination of individuals and companies, it is not a combination contrary to the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906. He gives a number of reasons for that opinion, and sums up in this wayThe Combine has secured the greater part of the tobacco trade for the reasons set out both in the majority and minority report of the Commission. Senators Pearce, Findley, Stewart, and Story, I take the following extracts :"" (i) The amalgamation of interests, the centralization of factories, and the concentration of distributing agencies have resulted in great economy of production, and must have consequently largely increased profits to those firms comprising the Combine."" The conclusion arrived at by Mr Powers wasI am of opinion that evidence submitted is not sufficient to justify proceedings against the combination known as the Tobacco Combine for entering into or continuing in a combination in contravention of the Australian Industries Preservation Act iqo6, or for any breach of the provisions of that Act. To return to the Almond Rock case which honourable members are inclined to treat lightly, I would mention that it seemed likely to lead to a most serious constitutional question. It was £27,000. The expenditure found that there was a combination extending over Victoria and New South Wales, and some pages are devoted to a learned discussion as to whether its action in raising the price of almond rock in Victoria by Jd. an ounce, and not doing so in New South Wales, brought it under the Act . Ultimately a prosecution was recommended, though with considerable doubt. What came of the recommendation I do not know. Mr Powers saysI f detriment lo the public as a fact is to be proved, the only staled detriment to the public Speaking of the is the rise in prices. It is only fair to say that he deprecated a prosecution based on a mere difference That was my short statement of of so small an amount in the price of almond rock and other lollies; but he pointed out that there was the grave constitutional question to be determined whether, in the absence of detriment to the public, the existence of a monopoly would not itself be a subject of prosecution, and he recommended a prosecution. Let me now hurry over the cases dealt with on this file. The United Shoe Machinery Company's case had nothing to do with combination, and arose under a provision of the Patents Act which enables the Government to annul a patent in cases where the thing patented is not manufactured in Australia. Then there was the Coal and Shipping Combine. Honourable members are pretty familiar with what was done in that case. It is the only case which was ever brought to a prosecution. That prosecution was not initiated by the late Government, but by From the majority report, signed by the Government which preceded it. In that case, after lengthy investigation, Mr. Justice Isaacs found that there was a combination. But the fact that there was a combination was never disputed. The only question in dispute was whether it was to. the detriment of the public. A majority of the High Court, after reviewing the evidence at great length, came to the conclusion that this combination was not to the detriment of the public-that the freights were not raised to a greater degree than they would have been had there been f u l l and free competition without any combination at all.",47,Robert Best N O They Prevent The Prime Minister Stated That Taxation
321,Mr Thomas,"Ho w much of the lastthe freights 20 per cent, within the last eight months. MrW . H . IRVINE low, because prices are raised by a combination, that it must therefore be to the detriment of the public. No section ought to be more ready than my honourable friends opposite to admit that a combination to get the f u l l value, either of goods or services, is a legal combination. The High Court acted on that principle. It acted on the principle that if a combination does not use illegal or coercive methods, but merely endeavours to prevent cut-throat competition, it is not to the detriment of the public. Then the matter went to the Privy Council, whose judgment has only been received by cable recently; and that judgment supports the view of the majority of the High Court. If we can trust the cable reports, the Privy Council laid it down that to hold otherwise would be to condemn the whole basic principle of trades unionism. The basic principle of trades unionism is identical with the principle which many of these combines are putting into operation for their own protection. The next case was the Artificial Manures Combine. In that case, it was held that there was no evidence of the existence of a combine; but, even if there had been, it would not have been an Inter-State combine. Then there was a Railway Trucks Combine. It was alleged that a corner had been made in trucks in New South Wales. The matter was investigated by the Department; but we know nothing about it , because it proved to be purely an Intra-State affair. Theni t was alleged there was a combine in photographic materials. that case, Mr Powers found that there was no offence and no detriment to the public. Then there was the case of the Proprietary Articles Trade Association, in which he found that there was no offence and no detriment to the public. Further, there was the Flour Combine in the Victorian Mill-owners Association. Honourable members will recollect that amongst the terrible cases brought forward by the honourable member for West Sydney on the eve of the last election was that of the devouring combine which existed in flour. specially. The y have raised MrW . H . IRVINE It was mentioned amongst three or four others, and was put in the very forefront of the honourable member's statements. WhereI t does not foldid he get the evidence on which he made those statements? He may have obtained it from some other source, but certainly he did not get it from the materials here. had better ask the Minister of External Affairs who reported upon it . Mr W. H . IRVINE The facts show that their operations were limited to several particular States, and that there was nothing in the nature of an injurious combine to the detriment of the public. Then there was the case of the Union Meat Company of Australia. Therei t was held by Mr Powers that that organization was a very proper business arrangement on the part of those who engaged in it . NowI come to the great Raspberry Bucket case. I cannot lay my hands on the paper at the present moment; but in regard to this it was alleged that a gentleman named Hay had suddenly, by some means or other known only to himself, bought up all the raspberry buckets in New South Wales. The matter was solemnly investigated by the Crown Law Department, and without pronouncing a final judgment as to whether he had got all or only some of the raspberry buckets, Mr Powers found that it was an Intra-State matter. Accordingly, Mr Hay was allowed to sell his raspberry buckets in peace, without being prosecuted by the Crown Law Department of the Commonwealth. the Crown Solicitor in that case ? I hope that he did not act alone. MrW . H . IRVINE I think he took the responsibility of dealing with it himself. Then there was the combination of wheat-traders in South Australia. If any such combination existed, it certainly was one with which the Commonwealth could not deal for lack of constitutional power; but there is no evidence to show that a combination did exist. of there being no evidence about anything. did not mention it MrW .

The Crown Law Office might have been better occupied than in investigating cases of that kind. Mr W. H . IRVINE this fearful case of a combine in mantles was investigated and reported upon during the time the honourable .member for West Sydney was Attorney-General. MrW . H . IRVINE quite sure about this important matter. Then there was the case of Clarke and Company, in Western Australia"" No sufficient grounds."" also three opinions upon, and great investigation into, the case of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, in which Mr Powers came to the conclusion that there was no detriment to the public. There was, further, the case of the Merchants Association of Sydney. Therei t was held that it was a purely local affair, and that the Commonwealth had no power to deal with it . That being so, the matter rested there, and no inquiries-were made. Then there were three other cases which were investigated, though I am not quite sure whether those investigations were concluded. They comprise the Nugget Polish Company, the Australian Nestles Anglo-SwissM i l k Company of Sydney, and the Michelin Tyre Company. What has happened, or will happen to these, I am unable to tell the House. is the whole record of all those matters which the late Government, having on the statute-book the most powerful and drastic legislation to secure investigation of all these things-havin g behind it all the machinery and all the officers of the Department, as well as a willing band of assistants to give information-hav e been able to rake up in regard to trusts and comi t is about cases concerning bines in Australia. I invite .honourable members opposite, if they have any reliable evidence of any combine or trust in There was also Australia, to bring it before me. If they do, I will see that it is investigated. I In can promise honourable members that, if they can find any breach of the law existTheni t was aling in Australia at the present time, whether I agree with that law or not, the persons responsible for that breach of the law will be prosecuted. But, unti l such matters are brought before the Government by honourable members oppositeuntil they can give us something reliable It only shows what they it would be wiser, and certainly fairer, for them to cease ranting on all the platforms of Australia about trusts and combines, of the existence of which they have no knowledge. The honourable member It happens that for West Sydney spoke also of the late Government being financially embarrassed during their term of office. He repeated the old, old statement, made by the ex-Prime Minister during the last general election, confuted, made once more, confuted over and over again, and repeated I want to be as often as confuted, namely, that they had come into office with a great deficit, and had converted that deficit into a great surplus. That statement was repeated There were again to-night by the honourable member for West Sydney. We were told that, when they came into office, they were met with a deficit of £500,000, but that they lef t a surplus of about £2,500,000, which, they handed over to us. What are the facts? The chief source of revenue of the Commonwealth has always been that of Customs and Excise; and the fact is that, until the late Labour Government came into power, the Braddon section was in operation, and that under it their predecessors had to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue collected by the Commonwealth. No sooner did the Labour Government come into office, however, than they introduced and passed the Surplus RevenueB ill , which enabled them to f u l f i l their obligations to the States by paying them But this 25s. per head of the population. The payments so made amounted to much less than three-fourths of the Customs and Excise collected. Thus, whilst the Customs revenue continued to increase rapidly, the payments to the States decreased, and the Labour Government had a very large sum of money to play with over and above that which was at the disposal of the preceding Administration.",49,Robert Best N O They Prevent The Prime Minister Stated That Taxation
327,Mr Hughes,,50,Robert Best N O They Prevent The Prime Minister Stated That Taxation
328,Mr Roberts,"B e sure.The figures show-and this is a fact that has never been stated by honourable members opposite-that the late LabourA d ministration, during the very first financial year of their administration, had over £4,000,000 of revenue in excess of that at the disposal of the preceding Government. During the second year they had nearly £5,000,000, and during their third year of office they had nearly £6,000,000 in excess of the sum available to their predecessors. The result of the abolition of the Braddon section was that they were endowed, during their three years of office, with a revenue of over £16,000,000 over and above the money which would have come to them if the conditions under which the previous Government carried on had continued. the revenue derived from the land tax.

I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to the honourable member for Flinders on, at any rate, the tone in which he submitted his remarks to the House. Those remarks came pleasant to the ear after the very heavy and loud tones of the Prime Minister. congratulations to the honourable member for Flinders on the terms he used, or his method of procedure, there is, nevertheless, some small blessing left to us in that cusing them of deliberately deceiving the he did not roar at members of the Opposition. I ask the honourable member to cast his mind back to a little while ago when he started his address. His opening words were really a gibe, or rather an attempted gibe, at the honourable member for West Sydney, inasmuch as it was inferred, or stated, that that honourable member had not dealt too lengthily, at any rate with the Tariff question. This raised a laugh from honourable members opposite; and the honourable member for Flinders ventured, in addition, to suggest that there were other members of the Opposition who would not deal too lengthily with that proposition. The honourable member for Flinders resumed his seat just about twenty minutes before there was any real necessity, so far as the Standing Orders are concerned; and I am sure he will not object to my reminding him that he adroitly left out all the deal with the subjects alphabetically, I might suggest to him that "" Tariff"" would come before "" Trusts."" Nevertheless, as is characteristic of honourable members opposite, who allege certain things against us, and taunt us with refraining from certain other things, they themselves do that which they regard as wrong in us. honourable member for West Sydney to refrain from any lengthy reference to the Tariff, what, then, is the degree of crime with which the honourable member for Flinders himself is branded, in view of the fact that he abstained altogether from any mention of the subject ? I venture to use words similar to his own, and ask him what will he say, or what will the Prime Minister say, or what will several other members opposite, of more or less importance, who need not be named, say on the Tariff question? I suggest, again, that if every honourable member remains true to his pledges to his constituents, tlie motion before us will be carried. If there be in this Chamber honourable members who went before the electors and distinctly and determinedly declared they were Protectionists first and Fusionists afterwards, they ought to vote in accordance with their pledge. If, AlthoughI cannot offer my however, when they are put to the crucial test-and actions speak louder than mere promises to the electors-the y refrain from so voting, shall we not be justified in acelectors? Shall we not be justified in saying that they are where they are, behind the Ministry, because they have misrepresented themselves to the electors, who were deliberately deceived into supporting them ? I remind honourable members opposite that, had their opponents been returned to power, an effective Tariff would have been submitted for the consideration of Parliament during this session.

334,Mr Roberts,"Let us clear the situaprotection of our produce, our manufactures, and our people. Nothing could be more clear than the fact that, from 1910 to 1913, we maintained to the letter the promises that we gave to the electors; and had the opportunity been offered, we should have given effect to the promise of two months ago. Further, nothing can be more clear than that, if every honourable member remains quite true to his pledges, we shall be able to give effect to that promise in a very short space of time. shall deal briefly with the subject of finance, which the honourable member for Flinders practically reserved for his peroration. The honourable member sought to convey the impression that our statements to the effect that, when we took office three years ago, there was a deficit of nearly £500,000, and that when we l e f t office two months ago there was a surplus of nearly £2,500,000, are incorrect. The honourable member was careful not to make the assertion, but merely to leave that impression on the minds of those who do not give detailed attention to politics.

General quoted the words "" financially embarrassed,'' but those, words were never used on this side of the House. They are a supposition of the honourable member. There was never the slightest attempt to conceal the fact that the revenue was greater in the last three years than in any previous period of the Federation; there was never the slightest attempt to conceal the fact that the revenue was correspondingly larger; there was never the slightest attempt to conceal the fact that the Braddon section ended a little over three years ago. Every candidate on the platform spoke clearly on that particular point. Each year the Budget speech was submitted to Parliament giving the total receipts and expenditure; each year it was criticised as ably as was possible by honourable members then in opposition; each year they sought for, and obtained, all the information they required, notwithstanding the wretched and infamous statement of one member, who asserted that over a million pounds had been done away with , that there was no record of it obtained in any way what I ever; that we refused to give the information, and that we had passed the Budgeti n spite of the Opposition; and, even you, Mr Speaker, will be astounded when I remind you that it was asserted that we had locked the doors, and not allowed the A u d it Commissioner to enter and see the accounts. MrW . H . IRVINE B y that statement, you cast a slur on every member of this side. Who was the honourable member! made by an honourable member on the other side of the House; it was made by the honourable member for Gippsland. I never said anything of the kind . for Maribyrnong to hand me the newspapers to prove my case. There was no attempt to conceal the fact that the revenue and expenditure were greater. Each year the Budget speech was p u t forward ; each year the Estimates were considered.

Therefore, Why drag in the reI do not now require the honourable member for Maribyrnong to give me the paper wherein the statement was reported.

Does the honourable member disagree with the alteration made to the Braddon section by whicli this Parliament secured a greater revenue than otherwise would have been the case ?

Let them be clear. They shall not escape. Here are the words of the Attorney-GeneralThere are others which, by the powers they have come to wield, and the methods by which they use these powers, are visibly becomingAlthough not so much in this country thereby clearly instancing the fact that he was referring to some in this country a menace to liberty In conjunctiou with his remarks upon American trusts, the honourable gentleman referred to Australian trusts; and, while acknowledging that they were ruinous in America, he said they were nob quite so ruinous in this country. He saidThese irresponsible combinations of wealth which govern the interests of hundreds of thousands of human beings, and whicli govern, to a very large extent, the very interests which should govern them, must, in a comparatively short time, be brought under the control of the Legislature. MrW . H . IEVINE gentleman were moderately honest in debate he would admit ago, when the Attorney-General felt that he was in one of those difficult situations in which the party with whom he is now associated so often place him, he said that interjections are unruly and rude, and he would not adopt them. Now, when he happens to be caught by his own words, hi3 coldness and iciness disappear, and he becomes, according to himself, rude and unruly. I regret very much to have to refer to him so frequently, but the honourable gentleman has brought it upon himself. the then Crown Solicitor, Mr Powers. The honourable gentleman referred to them in detail, evidently with the object of bringing the question of trusts into ridicule. He desired to create the impression that the alleged evils of trusts were t r i v i a l ; and that, in connection with all the researches into the evils of trusts, honourable members on this side of the House were to blame. W ill honourable members believe me when I say that during the whole of the time the Attorney General was quoting from the recommendations and reports of the Crown Solicitor, he was dealing with the period when the party with which he is himself associated was in power. Then the strawberry bucket and almond rock references are evidence of the capacity and statesmanship of the honourable gentleman's own side. Whilst he was directing attention to these points, we heard laughter repeated over and over again from honourable members opposite at what they conceived to be gibes cast upon this side of the House; when, as a matter of fact, the reports with which the Attorney-General was dealing at the time referred to what had been done by his own party. Nothing could be more outrageous or abandoned than the course adopted by the honourable gentleman in his effort to bring honourable members on this side into ridicule because of something which was done years ago by his own party. One trust, in particular, dealt with by the honourable gentleman was the Confectionery Combine. He knew that the way in which he proposed to refer to that Combine would draw the laughter and buffoonery of those behind him. I suppose that the inane laughter which followed his remarks was music to his ears when he said that the investigaI f the honourable tions into the Confectionery Trust had proved that, as a result of the operations of that trust there had been an increase in the price of almond rock to the extent of £d. per oz.

It was the wholesale price that was raised. . able gentleman's statement that there was an increase in the wholesale price; but I have never yet heard of an increase in the wholesale price of an article without a corresponding increase in the retail price of that article.

For did we not have, even yesterday, an attempt on the part of the Prime Minister to discount any reference to trusts? D i d he not attempt to have us believe that, in Australia, there were no trusts inimical to the interests of the community? Why, sir, even he made a reference to the Meat Trust, and he alleged, by implication-that is a word of which he is very fond-that the Meat Trust was not a danger to the community. It seems to me that I am justified in quoting once again a paragraph from a book by Mr Russell, one of America's greatest economic writers, in reference to this particular Meat Trust, which is now receiving, I am pleased to say, attention from the I m perial Parliament, and from the Argentine Parliament, but which for years has been able to defy the United States Parliament, because, constitutionally, that Parliament is as weak as we are. [7] attacked the Meat Trust. Russell says in his book about the greatest trust in the worldHere is a great criminal organization, utterly illegal in its inception, utterly illegal in its operation, defying the Courts, an active and pestilent public enemy. The works of this organization are to increase to every household I accept the honorthe cost of living, to decrease to a very large number of producers the normal income from their toil. Yet the Prime Minister yesterday made a reference to the Meat Trusti n terms and tones which sought to indicate that it was not inimical to the interests of this country. The Attorney-General referred to the question of trusts in a somewhat lengthy manner. I ask him, in the circumstances, are there any trusts ? When he was on this side of the House, he said, in effect, "" Put me in the Ministry and 1 The increase was will then urge the people to give to this Parliament power to deal with these comproduced the inane binations of capital."" But as Attorney General, what did we have from him today ? We had a sorry spectacle, and a lamentable display of weakness, of ineptitude, when he said, "" Please, gentlemen of the Opposition, come and give me evidence, and, if you do, I wili prosecute."" They are welthe honourable gentleman knows-and no one knows better, for I highly respect his legal attainments-that there is no use in power to effectively prosecute. MrW . H .

In other cases, he said, there are combinations, but they are not acting detrimentally to the public. What is "" detriment to the public "" in the legal sense? Only what some Parliament has made illegal; and if there be a Parliament here to-day which has not constitutional power to make some wicked thing illegal, how, then, I ask, can we prosecute these individuals?

If an increase of from 75 to 80 per cent, in the cost of a commodity is not of concern to the public, then heaven help them in their unconcern. That is what I say to the AttorneyGenerali n the circumstances. We proved that the Coal Vend monopolized and had control over 90 per cent, of the coal; that they had acted in collusion with the Shipping Combine, which controls 90 per cent, of the shipping. that they raised the price of coal from 14s. to 24s. per ton, and the Court came alongI am not questioning its decision -and said, "" Yes, you have proved t h a t , yes, they have done t h a t ; yes, they act in collusion; but we say that, according to the law, that is not detrimental to the public.

In New South Do honourable memWales that offer was availed of, but in that State, I am sorry to say, the percentage of voters was weak, and somehow the Labour party seem to have failed of these soulless and for a time. In Victoria, the voting individuals deceiving strength was stronger, but the hospital authorities did not take advantage of the Honourable suggestion. Why? Because those who control those institutions are supporters of Commonwealth my honourable friends on the Government side, and did not like the idea of polling Are booths in public hospitals, where possibly the numbers of the sick in support of tlie Labour party would be greater than those the in support of the Liberal party. In my own constituency, the Adelaide Hospital is situated, and application was made to system was not the State Liberal Government for permission to have a booth there. That Goof the postal-voting vernment, in order to hide behind a hospital board, referred the request to the latter body, which, after consultation It will enable the with the medical men, recommended that of the a booth should be permitted. Then, The system certainly does however, this beautiful State Liberal Goto vernment, which says that it believes in When canvassing in justice, in equality, and in giving facilielectorate-and ties for voters, point-blank refused the sick, and maimed and infirm, in this and other hospitals the opportunity to record their votes.

I understand that the Government propose to interfere in some Are honourable members oppoway with the maternity allowance, but I do not know what the outcome of that proposal will be. I understand that the estimated expenditure under this head for next year is £650,000, representing some 125,000 mothers. This proves that 125,000 of the best of Australia's population-thos e who bring to us the immigrants through the cradle, honour us as men, and elevate us as a nation-approv e of and believe in this measure. The Liberal party and Government, under the guise of preventing that class of people who indulge in gold bangles from accepting the allowance, say that it must be granted only to those who declare that dire necessity demands it , and thus seek to interfere with this beneficent piece of legislation. I u other words, they will not pay £ 5 from tlie Public Exchequer to, in the first place, protect the mother in her greatest hour of need, irrespective of whether she is in dire necessity or not, and, in the second place, to give the new arrival a reasonable opportunity of a healthy and vigorous infancy, and a strong manhood or womanhood. Buti n conjunction with tlie State Parliaments they will readily give £ 5 or £ 1 0 per head to bring strangers into our midst from other shores, when, as a matter of fact, we have an unemployed difficulty ourselves at the present time. I sincerely hope they will pause before they interfere with this legislation. afford the Liberal Government the strongest support do not, apparently, mix with that section of the community which is the real base and foundation of the social pyramid, and without which the apex could not be gilded as it is in one or two instances. working, no man would be able to live on an income. will pause or not I do not know; but if , as I have already said, every honourable member will vote in accordance with his promises to the electors-tha n which no promises on earth ought to be more sacred-the Government will not be given an opportunity, even in this Chamber, of interfering with this beneficent legislation. marks of the Prime Minister yesterday. I had expected a dignified utterance and some explanation of proposals of a progressive and statesmanlike character. A t any rate, I had expected that the honourable gentleman would refrain, so far as he could, from personalities, and from drawing red herrings across the t r a i l. I had hoped for an utterance of which, re[3J gardless of all political differences, we might all have been proud, and which might have gone for t h as a reflex of the stamp and standard of those who have the honour to represent the intelligence of Australia in the National Parliament. But what we had were personal references to honourable members on this side. We were told that, although the Labour party had been three years in office, the millennium had not arrived and Utopia had not been realized. There were references to the unemployed, and we had the in sinuation that their presence is due to the fact that a Labour Government had been in power three years. There were no utterances of a constructive character -al l were destructive-and the Prime Minister is welcome to the speech with .which he favoured us. It is not my province to offer advice to the honourable gentleman after the many years he has been in politics, the many sides he has taken, and the many directions he has faced. I sincerely hope, however, that if, by the breaking of pledges to constituents, the Prime Minister continues on the Treasury bench there will emanate from him something of a different character of which, in tbe circumstances, we may feel more proud. We could not, of course, in three years Those who undo all the wrong that other gentlemen had subjected the country to in fifty years; we could not remove every evil that the body politic suffered from . We are proud of the work we have accomplished, and we find from the statements of Ministers themselves that there is no If there were no men big measure of great national importance they intend to interfere with other than Whether the Government social and industrial legislation, with which they are forced to interfere because of the power and influence behind them. However, I feel justified in taking exception to one statement, and one only, in the limited time at my disposal. The Prime Minister said that we had charged them with reducing wages. A statement to that effect was made by two I now come to the general reor three honourable members, and I expected that the Prime Minister would have been able to refute it , and disprove the charge, but he was not able to do it any more than he was able to disprove the references made to his administration which has thrown a number of men out of work in New South Wales without a scintilla of justification.",61,Robert Best N O They Prevent The Prime Minister Stated That Taxation
389,Mr Joseph Cook,"D o you say that?were thrown out of work in the dockyards, and the Prime Minister sought to make out that it was due to the lax administration of the Fisher Ministry. As a matter of fact, if there were any defects in the boilers, they could have been repaired one at a time; had necessity arisen those boilers could have been overhauled one at a time, as is the practice in private life, and if necessity arose for dismissing a few men connected with a particular boiler no blame could be found; but to peremptorily, on the spot, so to speak, suddenly dismiss a large number of men from their employment on the statement that there were certain boilers that were not safe was certainly wrong. When we took over the yard we knew that some of the plant was not up-to-date, and might be defective, but what did we do ? Worksi n New South Wales all these boilers were subjected to a practical test and examination last Christmas. over the yard we employed the services of an outside professional gentleman in private practice, a qualified civil engineer, to make an examination and report to us, but his report did not come in u n t i l we were out of office.

The Prime Minister said there were a number of men who had one-sixteenth of an inch of iron between them and heaven. The innuendo was murderous in its inference. If our Administration lef t only one-sixteenth of an inch of iron between certain men and heaven, the Administration of the honourable gentleman will leave nothing between these self-same men and hell, because it is hell to an honest workman to be thrown out of employment.

IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) [9.50] I do not often desire to make a personal explanation, but the honourable member for Adelaide just now quoted a passage from a speech of mine dealing with irresponsible combinations of wealth, and he inferred that that statement was made with regard to combinations and trusts in Australia. When I asked him whether it was so, he said, "" Yes, in Australia "" ; but I find that immediately before the passage he cited, it appears, quite plainly that the reference According to the Minister for was to combinations in America.

397,Mr West (East Sydney) [9.52],"IThat is one reply I wish to make to Dr. Paton. I have never said anything either for or against vaccination, and I have not put myself up as an authority on vaccination; but I still maintain that, owing to the scare created by this proclamation unnecessarily issued by the Minister of Trade and Customs, a large number of people in Sydney have been vaccinated, and a large number have been taken away from their homes by medical men because of this mild attack of small-pox in Sydney. Dr. Robertson, of Melbourne, saidThere are so few medical men in this State who have had an opportunity of seeing secondary vaccination on a large scale. it is better to use lymph that is six weeks old. As Dr. Cumpston explains, these troubles have been due to extra potency; instead of one vaccine mark, you get it all over your body. That is what we have maintained. I believe that the press have been misinformed in this matter, and have been led to believe that all these people have been suffering from small-pox. I refer honourable members to what Dr. Paton has said in connection with the Mongolia caseIt is an extremely suspicious case. Probably it is small-pox. The man is to be examined tomorrow. I am sending down my senior officer, and a Federal officer is also going. I do not know yet whether there has been a previous successful vaccination. vaccinated, he should not have small-pox. And as to whether it is actually small-pox-the Fedelying on my own knowledge. Drs. Macral quarantine officers have diagnosed it as small-pox, but the State (Board of Health) officer has diagnosed it as an extremely suspicious case. Here we have two medical officers, one acting for the State and the other a Federal officer, and while one says that the case is one of small-pox, the other considers that it is a case of chicken-pox. I invite honourable members to listen now to this statementOne of the medical men connected with the case says that it appears to be a very mild one. The man has been vaccinated, but his vaccination did not appear to have been successful. "" He may,"" this doctor said, "" have had the disease on him when he was vaccinated; or perhaps he rubbed his arm after vaccination, in order to avoid a take.'"" 1 Some of them do things like that, you know. That is an intimation to the public that persons who have been vaccinated have removed the lymph from their arms, and have by some means infected other parts, and, an eruption showing, they have been held to be suffering from small-pox. It is time the Minister of Trade and Customs made some inquiries into this mat[«]-* ter, and dropped his habit of disregarding all that people have to say on the subject. The matter is a serious one, in view of the number of people who are suffering, and in view also of the stigma cast upon Australia. We are shortly to have a number of members of the British Parliament visiting Australia, and we find that the Ministerial Whip has had to send telegrams to the ports at which these visitors will touch to warn them, because of what is occurring in Australia, to have themselves vaccinated. What a fine opinion they will have of this great country, and what an opinion they will Probably form of the incapacity of those charged with the administration of public affairs in Australia when they are told that there has been no true case of small-pox within a radius of 15 or 30 miles from the Sydney Post Office. I would ask the Minister of Trade aud Customs not to regard the fact that I have been the person to bring this matter under the consideration of the House. Let me inform the honourable gentleman that I am as much a representative of the people as is any other member of the House. When no other honourable member from New South Wales or from a Sydney constituency had the courage to stand up and say something in the interests of the If he was successfully people of that city, I took it upon myself to do so. I am not in this matter rekellar, MacLaurin, Paton, and Foreman issued a report on the 9th August, which appeared in the Daily Telegraph of 11th August, with a view to induce people to undergo vaccination, but in the report they maintain that the disease which has broken out in Sydney is only a mild form of small-pox, if it be small-pox at all. An error has been made by the Federal authorities, and it may be that the excitement of coming new to office is the cause of the lack of judgment displayed by the Minister of Trade and Customs. I think the time has now arrived when he should realize tlie true position. Dr. Reid and other doctors have tried to impress upon the public the seriousness of small-pox, with a view to make them realize the necessity of vaccination. I have not a word to say against the medical profession on this account. Dr. Paton, in his reply to me, says there is hardly a medical man in New South Wales who is not in favour of vaccination, but I might as well send a letter to all the bookmakers in Australia, to ask them if betting is a good They would, no doubt, reply, "" Betting is a good thing, dear boy."" are not going to say that vaccination is uot a good thing, and they may honestly believe that it is. told me that he considered it so necessary that he had vaccinated his wife and all his children, and that, to be quite safe, he had vaccinated the cat. desire in this matter is to consider the interests of the vast population whom I live, and, if possible, to have the restrictions imposed upon them In his reply to-day, Dr. Paton referred to tlie statement. I made in the House about an elector. what I said about the elector was true. I can assure him that no death from smallpox in Sydney has been reported; there has been a death from and I pray to God that there will not be a death from small-pox. It was reported in the press one day, with big headlines, that there was the possibility of a death taking place. the report, but I do not think that the writer intended the report to read as it did. not have been published. press upon the Minister of Trade and Customs the urgent necessity for taking some action to remove this restriction, l repeat, is wholly unjustifiable. has happened so far to warrant such a large section of the people of New South Wales being put under the stigma they are not fit to travel to other portions of Australia. carried out, it should be carried out properly; but if quarantine is not necessary in Sydney, the area in question be released, and people allowed to move about in the ordinary way. that the Minister of Trade and Customs was somewhat elated at the position he had attained, and therefore did not give adequate attention issuing a proclamation. relied upon the advice of his officers. Unfortunately, long, and perhaps he may be excused for being anxious to serve the His officers may have great knowledge, but they do not possess that practical knowledge men of the world acquire. Government have told me that they were not aware that so much importance was attached by Dr. Cumpston to the cases Mr West. thing. at Sydney, or that he went away from Melbourne with the idea that quarantinMedical men ing would be necessary. He recommended the issue of a proclamation on the 5th July, but D r .

Whether it is a fact that the honourable member has stated that "" the trend of economic I was shocked when I read thought, and even of popular thought, realizes the iniquity of the recognition of private property in land. It is the one thing above all others that has cursed this country, and has In fact, I consider that it should cursed every other country of which we have I wish to imany knowledge, and, unless it be abolished, it will curse these countries in the future as they have never yet been cursed?"" 2.

Nothing That question did not appear on the notice-paper, to my great amazement, and I wrote a letter to the Clerk, from whom that I received this replyDear SirI am in receipt of your letter of If quarantine has to be yesterday's date. The question you refer to seemed to me one that I should submit to Mr Speaker. I did so, and he decided that it was should not a proper question to appear on the notice paper.
