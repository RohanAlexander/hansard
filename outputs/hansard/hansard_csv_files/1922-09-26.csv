30,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [3.14],"I should not be obliged to question M in isters as to what is going to happen. The Government should indicate straight out what they propose to do.. They should s take honourable members into their confidence as to whether the Constitutional amendments are to be considered or not. If we knew all these things we would know where we stood, and how to act. The business-paper does not indicate any necessity for the House to meet on Wednesday mornings at 11 o'clock. Unless the Government know considerably more than honourable members, there is no par* ticular reason why we should sit to-morrow morning. I am prepared to concede a certain amount of prescience to the Government in connection with the forthcoming election; but not otherwise. It would appear that the Government are exhibiting: indecent haste. Honourable members would have no objection to Wednesday morning sittings if we were going to transact genuine business for the commun it y ; but so f a r as we can judge there is no urgency. If Parliament is to r u n its usual course there should be ample time for the consideration of all the measures on the business-paper. We members of the Country party are quite prepared to face our constituents, but have no desire to do that before we have completed the business which we were sent here to do, as far as the Government will allow us to do it . This Houss has become accustomed to being treated as though it did not count. This motion is only another instance of meted out to honourable members of late. vernment should give some indication of their intention. The Royal Agricultura l Show now being held in Melbourne is of such importance that honourable members should have time to visit it-the y can well stand some education along the lines of primary production. It would be very much better if honourable members had more time to seriously and thoroughly consider the measures on the business paper. Before we finish I intend to bringsome proposals before the Housei n connection w i th one particular B ill . It seems, however, that the Government are determined to rush business, so that honourable members will have very little chance of dealing properly with any of the measures, including the Superannuation B ill , that are set down for consideration. We would have no objection to meeting on Wednesday morning if the purpose was to look after the interests of the community. If the Government would only give some explanation as to why it is necessary we should meet on Wednesday morning, we would be satisfied. It will not be outside the merest statement of fact to say, of the Superannuation B ill , that not half-a-dozen members of this House can state definitely where that measure is going to lead us; but, like everything else, it is to be rushed through. The Government simply, come along and say,"" in effect, that they are going to meet early, apply the guillotine, and destroy all opportunity which should be given to honourable members to safeguard the interests of the community. I am disappointed at the action of the Government, and I feel that, on a v it a l question, I could almost be persuaded to vote against them, although, as every one knows, in the past I have given them a cordial, if somewhat discriminating, support, on the well-known principle that by sparing the rod you are likely to spoil the child. I was particularly disappointed with the answer which the Acting Leader of .the House( Mr. Greene) gave to my question as to the facilities to be given to honourable members to visit the Agricultura l Show now being held in this city. It ill-becomes the honourable member for Richmond, and a Minister who is supposed to be the patron and protector o i the primary prothe treatment that has been ducing industry, thus to contemptuously It is only fair that the Godisregard this great agricultural achievement. H is attitude, I fear, is likely to create for h i m a bad odour in his own electorate. I remind h i m , as a f r i e nd and a brother, that tbe Country party is making a "" dead set"" at h i m in New South Wales. W it h this introduction, T suggest to the Minister, in association w i th my Leader, ( Mr Charlton), that the House should be treated w i th a greater measure of respect than we have received from the hands of the Ministeri n moving this motion. If the Government desire to complete the session by a succession of applications of the "" gag,"" of course, it is within their power to do so. But if they wish honourable members to have sufficient time to do the work we were sent here to do, then I suggest they should conduct the business of the Housei n a reasonable",16,Telephone Mechanics Hours To Day And There Will Be Another Half Day

This aspect of the case, I feel sure, appeals to honourable members. I do not propose to submit with perfect docility to this proposal to meet on Wednesday morning. I am not clear whether tiie Government mean to sit every Wednesday morning, or if this motion Telates only to to-morrow morning. creasing the hours and reducing the wages. member for South Sydney has summed up in a few words what I have been endeavouring to say in a number of words. Therefore, little remains for me to say, but I must add that, although it is not generally believed that we are a hard-worked body of men, if we are to meet on Wednesday morning it will be impossible for honourable members to attend to their routine work satisfactorily. I protest against the habit that has grown up in this Parliament of rushing most important business at the end of the session. I am entirely at one with the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr tion. The fixing of that is entirely the Fleming) in this matter. We never have a session without a bunch of important measures being hurried through at the very end, when honourable members cannot have an opportunity to digest all the Bills; indeed, it is very doubtful if they have opportunity to even thoroughly read them. That is very unfair to the House and to the country. are passed in a hurry during the last days of the session are of as much importance to the people as are those passed with due deliberation in the early days of the session. Indeed, they are usually more important, because a discriminating Ministry, such as that now in office, -usually selects the last days of the session for the most important work, especially that class of work which is controversial, and would in the early days of ithe session meet with a great deal of opposition. The Minister, having reHour of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Meeting. ceived this kindly advice from me, he will, I hope, act upon it, and tell us when the election will be held, so that we may in a proper spirit of repentance order the remainder of our parliamentary lives and bend ourselves to the task that lies before us. With one exception, the remarks of the ton) impressed me as being eminently reasonable. The exception was his statement that he would like an early election. That remark was not only exceptional; it was quaint. affectation by the Leader of a party who does not desire to disclose his distaste of the"" prospect of an early appeal to the The honourable country. But, generally speaking, every .word which the honourable gentleman urged is worthy of the consideration of the Leader of the House. Having already in the middle of September agreed to an additional sitting day, we would not be justified in ordinary circumstances in superimposing morning sessions on .three of the four sitting days. If there is ground for urgency which demands the taking of this exceptional course three months before the session usually closes, the House generally should know it. I do not mean that the House should know the date of the elecprerogative of the Governor General, -acting on the advice of his Ministers, but when we are asked to extend the sitting days in these exceptional circumstances -exceptional , at any rate, so far as the last eight or nine years are concerned-we should know what it is for, and approximately the programme which ParEnactments that liament will be expected to deal with before it rises. If , for example, the Government declared their desire that we should leave these premises within a -month, and that we should in the meantime pass the business already on the notice-paper and some other important measures to which allusion has been 'ttnade, or notice ""of .which has been given, the House would be better equipped to decide whether or not it should pass this motion.

I am one in this House, to secure a declaration of the Government's intentions, but both parties, as well as individual members pf the House, are entitled to know as early as possible the programme we have to discharge, the reasons for increasing the sessional days and hours, and generally how long the House is expected to sit. support the motion, and shall be prepared to assist the Government in every possible way to sit as often as is necessary to enable them to deal with the business which they regard as important. ber will not vote for every measure which the Government will introduce? vote for many of the measures which the Government will bring down.

I hope that even at this late hour the Minister in charge sider the advisability of asking the House to meet at 7 p.m. instead of 2.30 rji.m. on Thursday, so that honourable members may make themselves acquainted with the very fine display of agricultural products which is to be seen at Flemington.

I support the plea urged that the Ministry should at least postpone the meeting of the House on Thursdayu n t i l 7 p.m. There would be little actual loss of time by that arrangement. particularly those on the Ministerial side, realize the necessity for education cn rural matters. The Show is held at a choice spot, in a choice electorate, and I desire the members of the House to see the display. I can assure the Ministry that nothing would be lost by submitting a motion to-morrow night that the House adjourn u n t i l 7 p.m. on Thursday. amendment to that effect. dication of the view of the Government. As* to the proposition now before bhe House, how is all, the business to be disposed of, even if such a motion is carried ? As the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) has stated, the majority of the matters on the notice-paper could be disposed of in a very short space of time; but, in addition, there is a sheaf of business to be dealt w it h before the session closes. Practically the whole of the Budget debate has yet to engage our attention. If there is one item more than another on which the House should apply itself w i th industry and intelligence, it is on the financial statement of the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce). apparently, is to be l e f t u n t i l the eleventh hour, when the Budget will be forced through, Department by Department, by use of the guillotine. If the Government indulge in tactics of that nature, they will brand themselves before the electors as a Ministry and a party who are not prepared to give serious consideration to the great financial problems that confront us. It is all very well to say, "" We shall remit these questions to the electors."" The Treasurer has presented a most important statement, and it should be discussed in all aspects. In my opinion the Budget contains many items that ought not to be in it , and there are many matters missing from it that ought to be included. The Ministry would do well to give ample opportunity to the House to discuss it in detail. I feel disposed to vote against the present motion-, and I hope that honourable members on the Ministerial side will take the same view. To simply blindly vote with the Government' would be supporting a policy of "" hurry up "" and "" hush u p . "" I oppcse the motion. There is one thing for which we can admire the Government, and that is the AU honourable members, consistency of their policy. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr. Riley) stated, by interjection, that the Government had increased honourable members' hours and reduced their wages. I suppose that, for the same reason that actuated the Government in bringing about a reduction in honourable members' salaries, they now propose to increase their hours of labour. I am not personally favorable to the suggestion to adjourn the House to enable honourable I would like some in members to attend the Agricultura l Show, because there is ample opportunity for any member, 'who wishes, to visit it , just as members can absent themselves from the House on other occasions. If they wish to go to the Showi t is their owm affair, and there is no reason why the business of the country should be hung up.

The necessity for increasing the hours of labour in Parliament does not seem to Y e t this subject, be very apparent. As has been stated by previous speakers, the date of the election is wrapt in mystery. Various newspapers have essayed to fix the probable time. Some say it will be held on the 9th December, and others predict the 16th Decembei. We are told, also, that the election may possibly be held on the 25th November. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) stated that it was for the Governor General, on the advice of his Ministers, to fix the date, and the honourable member expressed the opinion that it was not desirable to acquaint honourable members with the date. I believe that the people most concerned ought to be informed on the point, and no body of men can be more concerned, w itb the exception of the electors, than honourable members themselves. I fail to see what the Government have to gain, or what possible party advantage there is, in adopting this policy of concealment.

There has been no official statement by the Ministry as to when the election is to take place. The only official announcement made so far is that it is to be held as early as possible. It may be that the Government, taking advantage of the fact that honourable members are anxious to return to their electorates, thinking that the people are to be consulted speedily, intend with the help of the guillotine to put their programme through in a thin House. guarantee that an election will take place immediately after the House adjourns. into Ministers' minds. so.

71,Mr Prowse (Swan) [4.111,"Th eney-General) [4.15] I -move That the following new sub-clause be inserted :(lA.) An employee whose salary does not exceed Two hundred and eight pounds per annum may elect to contribute additional units or half units to make up a total number of two and a half, three or four units. This is one of those provisions whicli, if it is agreed to, will have the eflect of in creasing the amount involved by the B ill to a sum over and above that contained in the original Appropriation message. However, it w ill not increase the estimated amount which I put before honourable members when presenting the report of the actuaries. ' In the original d r a f t of the B ill , as placed before the actuaries, there appeared a clause which proposed to give greater privileges to employees in respect of taking up additional units. The sum thus involved was included in the estimates of the actuaries. I have now been advised that my proposal willnot increase the total. The actuaries were unable to provide me with the specific sum; but it waa undoubtedly allowed for in the general estimate. of the new sub-clause is intended to meet tbe case of employees in the lower ranks of the Service. TheB ill , as originally drafted, placed the pension rate for these at about £ 7 8 per annuma sum which, on th© face of it , would be only about equivalent to the receipt of old-age pensions by husband and wife. However, there is now offered this opportunity to secure a higher pension, in addition tot which there are the rights of pension in cases of invalidity. If an employee who has been the prescribed period in the Service takes advantage of the new subclause, and becomes invalided shortly after making his first payment, he w i ll receive a pension during the whole period of invalidity. Then there are the further privileges to be bestowed upon the widow and children in the case of his death. I am hot quite satisfied with the provisions of clause 13. Upon the second reading I pointed out that this measure might bear harshly on a great body of those employed in the Public Service. Perhaps, half the total of our public servants have no hope of ever rising beyond the £208 stage. Their opportunities of promotion from the General to the Clerical, Division are remote, quite apart from their ability or otherwise to pass the necessary examination. The trouble is that there are not sufficient openings in the higher division, and the position has become even more acute since the war. Only a few months ago about 400 returned soldiers passed their examination for entrance to the Clerical Division. Two hundred have already been appointed, but if the other 200 are not placed' within six months or so, they will not be eligible, as the regulations provide that a person who has passed an examination qualifying h i m for entry into the Public Service must be appointed within a certain period after passing an examination. There are so many returned soldiers awaiting appointment that men already in the Service have little hope of entering the Clerical Division, no matter how qualified they may be, because there w ill be many returned soldiers who, under the present policy of the Government, w ill have preference. These men must be first absorbed, which means that the general body of applicants w ill not have any opportunity. If that is so, and we provide The provision that publio servants must contribute from 1 \ to 4 units, some in the Service whose salaries do not exoeed £ 2 0 8 per annum will take up four units, which ia the maximum, and will receive £ 1 0 4 per annum as a pension on retiring. It w ill mean that they will have to contribute approximately £ 7 or £ 8 per annum from, the time they enter the Serviceu n t i l they reach sixty-five years of age, which will represent a fairly substantial sum. When such officers retire, either in consequence of having reached the age l i m it or through any other cause, they w ill get only £ 1 0 4 per annum, whereas if they did not contribute to the Superannuation Fund at all, when they reached the age of sixty-five years, if married men, they would be entitled to the old age pension, and their wives would also be entitled to a pension, which would amount in all to £ 7 8 per annum. Should Labour be returned to power after the next elections, the pension rate w ill be increased to 20s. per week; the man and his wife would then receive £ 1 0 4 per annum. It w ill be seen, therefore, that although a publio servant contributes from £ 7 to £ 8 per annum in order to obtain the benefits outlined in this B ill , he may not be any better off at the expiration of forty or",23,Superannuation Bill

We have, however, to consider the position that confronts us to-day. and realize the benefits public servants are to derive under this B ill .

I cannot imagine a man who has to contribute £ 7 or £ 8 per annum for the whole of the time he is in the Service, and who receives a pension on retirement of only £ 1 0 4 per annum, being any better off than an old-age pensioner. publio servant who does not contribute anything at all would receive an old-age pension which would be worth £ 3 9 per annum when he reached sixty-five, and that a similar amount would be payable to his wife without making any contributions at a l l . not possess anything. I hope so, and receiving a maximum, salary of £20 4 per annum would not be able to put aside much for a rainy day when the cost of living is so high, particularly if he has to pay rent. member losing sight of the fact that a public servant's contributions to the f u n d would provide an insurance which would be of benefit to his wife and family in the event of his death? ° vants have already made provision in that direction. die before he reached the retiring age. we have to consider whether it would not be cheaper for a public servant to take out an insurance policy instead of paying such a heavy premium to a Superannuation Fund.

If you make the entry or withdrawal of contributors voluntary, you load the scheme with bad lives. The basis of the scheme has been fixed after an actuarial investigation which has taken into account the strength of the Service and the data available in mortality tables and the like. The larger the area to which calculations thus made are applied, the nearer the average computation is approximated. of the kind, the young properly carry the 0 old. full working order, each man will carry his own burden. The benefits to be conferred are on 'the basis of contribution. No doubt these benefits are not what the honourable member for Hunter( Mr five years? Charlton) would like them to be, but we must provide, not in accordance with our individual wishes, but in accordance with the actuarial computation of what we can give. It must not be forgotten that for every £ 1 contributed to the Superannuation Fund by a public servant the Commonwealth Government pays another £1. What chance would a man on a small salary have of buying from an insurance society benefits equivalent to those given by the Bill? A man whose age is 30, and whose salary is, say, £157, will be entitled to contribute for 4 units of pension, for which he will pay according to the prescribed scale, and the benefits to which his contributions will entitle him are these: First, a pension on attaining the age of 65 years, or, should he be called on to retire on reaching the age of 60 years, the actuarial benefits then accruing. Should he be retrenched, he will get certain allowances. Should he, having been in the Service for the prescribed time, die, even within twelve months of the payment of his first contribution, his wife will get a pension of £52 a year for life, or until she rethe Public Service at the date of tbe commarries, and for each child under the age of 16 years there will be an allowance of £13 a year until it reaches that age. The knowledge that, should anything happen to himself, his wife and children will be provided for, must be of great comfort to any man.

We are making an exemption in their favour, and, under the circumstances, I ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. I have served my purpose in moving the amendment, namely, tb place on record the fact that, in my opinion, this clause is not quite so lenient as it might be towards the lower-paid public servants. Prior to the statement by the Minister( Mr Groom), I had thought that the amendment might interfere with the actuarial computation, and the Minister has now definitely shown us that it would so interfere, and' would mean the wrecking of the Bill. wreck the B ill ; on the contrary, I am in favour of it, but I wish to improve it as much as possible in the interests of the lower-paid men. It is a pity that the measure as it stands will press hardly on those who are in receipt of small salaries, and who really have no hope of advancement. have been iu the Service for years, and who, so far as promotion is concerned, are practically at a dead-end. in the interests of those men that I submitted my amendment. view of the statement by the Minister, I propose, with the concurrence . of the' Committee,' to withdraw the amendment.

We are dealing with a great measure which will, probably, be in operation for generations. break down! on a sound actuarial basis it would last for centuries. But we have as a guide the experience of Victoria and New South Wales, and we know what 1 ecame of the Victorian scheme, and how the New South Wales scheme has come short of success. exactly the same as this was abandoned in Victoria? Ley, the State Minister for Justice in Naturally we wish to be as New South Wales, the basis of the New South Wales scheme was faulty. out more than once that this scheme is entirely different from that of New South Wales. Victorian Minister, when introducing the State scheme, said it was actuarially sound, as no doubt the Minister in New South Wales did also. Members of Parliament then knew very little about the matter, and had to swallow what was told them, the public being left to pay afterwards. That is just what I think will happen with the scheme now under consideration. Various nations of the world have attempted similar schemes, Germany leading with one, not to deal with the I have no desire to public servants, or any particular class, but with the whole of the people. I have no objection to benefiting the Commonwealth public servants, but I desire an insurance and superannuation scheme for the whole people.

The scheme, so far as concerns clauses 12 and 13, may be right or it may not. The Committee is not in a position to know, because there has not been sufficient investigation to enable us to form a sound opinion. Under the circumstances, the Minister ought not to unnecessarily hasten the passing of the measure, for we shall have a long time to repent if it proves to be wrong. Both the Government and the publio servants admit that it will be necessary to appoint three gentlemen to inquire into the whole subject periodically in order to put the scheme on a, business footing. actuaries, who investigated the whole scheme, and their report is here. apply to the Publio Service, which the Government admits needs revision.

All Acts of ParliaI suppose I am as competent as the next man in this Chamber to investigate a matter of this kind; but I do not feel competent, under the circumstances, to arrive at a decision in regard to the scheme. I have not had time to thoroughly investigate it, and I again ask the Government to refer the Bill to a. Select Cfcwnmittee in order to insure that it is on a sound basis. opposition to this measure will come from me. I can assure the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) that the action of the late Sir George Reid and his party, when in power in New South Wales, was most disastrous to the public servants and the superannuation scheme of that State. With that the honourable member agrees; but, unfortunately for him, if I may say so without being offensive, he is a misfit, so far as this measure is concerned. For twenty-five or thirty years the Labour party has been in favour of insurance under the Government. I am like Pussyfoot Johnson, the prohibitionist, who said that if we wish to deal with a great measure we must go to the "" breeding ground "" ; and I regard the Bill before us as the "" breeding ground "" for the insurance of others besides public servants under Government supervision. I invite the honourable member for Swan to go on to the platform with me and seek to return a Government which will promote a scheme of general insurance. The clause before us is based on actuarial investigation, and the three actuaries appointed to make the investigation well know their business. Under, the circumstances, I pin my faith to them, for we are not competent to go into such calculations. I remember that once I undertook the job of finding a basis for superannuation and insurance in connection with a friendly society, and after working on it for two years I found that the cost would be too great for any persons to contribute without some assistance. The late member for Maranoa( Mr James Page), in the early days of Federation, was a consistent advocate of a superannuation scheme for the Commonwealth public servants, and in this he was supported by members of the Labour party. I am now somewhat following in that gentleman's footsteps; and I think we should do well to make no attempts to hinder the passing, of this measure at ment, after they 'have been in existence for a period, disclose anomalies which call for an amendment of the law; indeed, it is not possible to test an Act except in actual operation. No doubt in the future we shall find that some amendments are necessary, but I think the Government are doing well in introducing this Bill now, after the promises made to the public servants and the length of time they have been waiting for it. I am a member of the Opposition, but merely because of that I do not feel called upon to oppose a measure which I personally approve.",27,Superannuation Bill

Last week I took exception to the fact that the Government were not going to meet their obligations-that they were prepared to enter into obligations which would f a l l , not on themselves, but on their successors in future years. The Minister has told us, as he told us last week, that this B ill has been examined by actuaries, who report that it is actuarially sound. But was that guarantee by the actuaries given on the basis of immediate payments by the Government, in accordance with the payments of the public servants, or was it on the basis as now disclosed in the Bill? If it was given on the supposition that the Government would pay their share as the scheme went along, just as the contributors to the f u n d w ill pay, it is on an utterly different basis from the proposal before us. On what basis did the actuaries give their report? I have here the opinion of a very competent actuary in New South Wales. name made public, but I shall give it to the Minister privately. He writes as follows:The Commonwealth Superannuation Bill forecasts what appears to be a perfectly Bound scheme assuming that the country is prepared to pay the cost, with one exception. The exception is the provision that the Commonwealth is not to pay its share by periodical .payments, as will dts employees. It is to meet its liabilities by paying one-half, or, in the case of employees entering the fund over thirty years of age, more than one-half of the pension payments, as and when they become payable. That is to say, in the case of a young man of twenty-five, he will make substantial payments, which will be accumulated, less certain subsidiary payments, at interest for forty years if he lives to enter on his pension at sixty-five, while the Commonwealth will pay nothing until the end of forty years, but then becomes liable for half the pension payments. That is the case just as I stated it last week when speaking on the second reading of the B ill . The actuary goes'on to stateIn other words, this section of thu lliil means that the Commonwealth undertakes to grant its employees pensions of equal or greater amounts to those purchased by their own payments without making any provision for them. be such an accumulation of liability that it needs no prophetic sight for one to foresee that the scheme will break down of its own weight, and bring disaster on the Government that has to meet the demands on uhe f u n d . The actuary continues furtherI t is reported that the Prime Minister .has stated that, if the proper payments were made, the yearly cost to the Commonwealth would be £500,000.* In the future, therefore, an appalling annual cost will be laid upon the Commonwealth by these yearly payments behiff .withheld. For this £500,000, less certain items*of outgo provided for in the Bill, if paid and accumulated at interest, would amount to a huge sum in the period between now and the time when the heavy charge for pensions arrives. If this sum were then in hand to pay the pensions falling due, the Commonwealth would only require to continue its yearly contribution to provide for other pensions falling due in .the then future. If no provision is made from the commencement of the fund (£500,000 per annum, or more or less), the ultimate call on the public exchequer may well be many millions annually. There is no doubt about that. This is exactly the f a u l t that I found with the measure last week. I should like to know now how the matter stands, and if this position was placed before the actuaries.

Their report on this scheme states'The proposal to amend the original scheme so as to provide for the Government payments to the fund to be made in arrear instead of being made in advance was carefully considered, and the Committee is of opinion that such a proposal is actuarially sound. The scheme so amended may be said to provide in general for a contributory scheme supplemented by a £1 for £1 subsidy by the Government, to be made as the allowances accrue; special concessions to be made by the Government in respect of all officers aged thirty and upwards at the initiation of the scheme. Besides stating that the scheme was actuarially sound they furnished tables showing the position of the Commonwealth for the next for t y years on the basis of the present numerical strength '9",28,Superannuation Bill

The actuaries after investigation of the proposal in this B ill , declared it to be actuarially sound. New Zealand has a somewhat similar scheme in operation. not pretend to set my opinion against that of the actuaries mentioned by the Minister( Mr Groom); but I have had some experience of superannuation funds,' and I know there is always a tendency to postpone payment of to-day's liabilities t ill to-morrow, amounts may be required to meet a deficiency in the f u n d . I have some doubt as to whether it is actuarially sound to postpone Commonwealth contributions to this Superannuation Fund. The simpler way, and one that would appeal to an ordinary man, would be for the Government to make contributions to the f u n d in the same proportion as any public servant. But the Minister has told us that this is financially impossible, and that this scheme is actuarially sound. I cannot say. I am willing to accept his assurance and the opinion of the actuaries. I realize that they know a good deal more about figures than I do, although my experience is that actuaries, like other experts, will argue both sides of the question. Amendment agreed to.

I think it should be struck out. A public servant may have a thousand and one reasons why he should not be required to contribute for more than two units of pension, b u t in his own interests and in the interests of his family he should be required, by means of, this the Government scheme, to make adequate provision for the future. He should have due regard to his family obligations. An employee, at t h i r t y years of age, may have a family of only two children, and on that basis he may persuade the Board to exempt The original scheme him from contributing for more than a minimum of units; b u t if his family increases subsequently his pension privileges will then be quite inadequate. In such circumstances, if , unfortunately, the head of a family is taken, the widow and children will suffer severely. There should be no exemption. Every public servant should contribute to the f u n d according to his salary. [5.15] -Usually I am in agreement w i th the financial proposals of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West), but I hope the Government w ill not listen and then increased to his suggestion for the negativing of this clause. Many public servants, having lost hope of a superannuation scheme being brought into being to benefit them, have already undertaken heavy obligations in order to make provision for their future. If the honourable member's suggested amendment were carried those men would be further burdened by being compelled to take four units in the superannuation scheme.

The proportions' contributed by the Government and vants Wales Railways Superannuation Act are approximately the same as the proportions to be contributed by the Commonwealth and the public servants under this B ill . Under the New South Wales scheme, w i th 41,448 contributors and 2,029 present annuitants, it is estimated that the State will, within a year or two, be paying £1,000,000 in benefits. The public servants who will come under the Commonwealth scheme will number more than 41,000. the Commonwealth Service is 24,759. There are some other Departments, such as Navy, Defence, Railways, and Parliament, with not more than 4,000 employees, making a total of, possibly, 30,000. of increase what will the total be twenty years hence?

I am anxious that this scheme shall be placed on a safe basis for the sake of the Public Service, 1 and also on account of the tremendous burden that may be imposed upon the people in future. The Minister quoted the New South Wales Railways Superannuation Act as affording a good basis' upon which to work; but he said that the rate of conThe Commonwealth tribution originally fixed was much too small, and that the f u n d got into difficulties in consequence. I repeat that although the contributions from both the employees and the Government are to be higher under the Commonwealth scheme, the respective proportions will be much the same as under the New South Wales scheme. The number of contributors to the State scheme is not as great as will be the number under, the Commonwealth the . railway serscheme twenty years hence; yet the State under the New South authorities can foresee a liability of £1,000,000 per annum. That information comes to me from one of the best actuaries in New South Wales. TheA t torney-General has said that the New South Wales scheme has broken down of its own weight. We do not wish the same fate to befall the scheme we are now considering, and the Minister would be well advised to look further into the matter. member that before the actuaries were appointed Treasury officials were working on this scheme for months. the opinion of the actuaries, all the superannuation schemes of which we have exA t the present rate perience have broken down, and the proposal now before us seems to resemble too closely those others which have failed.",30,Superannuation Bill

140,Mr Fleming,"Whateve r may bemember say of the British scheme, which requires no contributions from the public servants ? pare what is done in the Old Country with what is done here, where the conditions are entirely different. England is a country of accumulated wealth. The Commonwealth is undeveloped, and we require all the money that is available for the improvement of our property and the increase of production. Too often I have heard arguments in this chamber based on similar false premises. If a man has a complete property, with all improvements made, he may do what he likes with his income; but a man whose property has to be improved and made productive has to conserve his resources. In this country, which is awaiting development, we would have to be more careful with these schemes than has an old country with a vast amount of accumulated wealth. If the Government are basing their scheme on what has happened in England they are looking for trouble. The past experience of superannuation in Australia is such as should make us extremely careful. I urge further investigation, not because I wish to do any disservice to the public servant-o n the . contrary, I desire his future to be made secure-bu t because I do not wish the future development of the country to be hampered by liabilities under a badlybalanced scheme. [5.291 I understand that the contributions from the Commonwealth and the public servants will be paid into a fund. public servants will be i>aid into a fund, and as benefits fall due the Commonwealth will subsidize £1 for £ 1 the amounts paid out from that fund. The Commonwealth will not in .advance pay a large sum of money into the fund to accumulate. tributed by the Public Service to be invested ? that members of friendly societies in Australia are paying too much, according to English actuarial calculations. All societies, except those dealing only with miners, are accumulating enormous funds. If the payments to the fund are as high as they would be according to English actuarial calculations, they should be quite sumcient, judging by my experience of friendly societies. It is to be expected that actuaries who have not been consulted would differ from .those whose advice has not been obtained. other actuary has said that the Government's proposal is actuarially unsound. have taken that objection. In the light of past experience, surely the Government and the officials advising them would not trust to the actuarial calculation on which the New South Wales Railways Fund was based. We should also remember the peculiar position that arose in that State in. connection with the Police Pensions Fund. I regret that critics of the scheme have not paid attention to the South Australian system. I am familiar with the Act that applies to the Education Department in that State. I know more about that system than any other, because at the time the superannuation scheme was introduced in Tasmania, Mr Neale, formerly of the South Australian Education Department, helped us in every way. He suggested to usI thought at the time that his advice was wrong, and I think so now-that no Government money should be paid into the fund, because. then the Government would not have power to retire officers when they came on the fund. The Tasmanian Government, unfortunately, acted on that advice, and consequently officers in the railways service do not receive very large pensions. I have not made special inquiries, but if the Tasmanian Railway Retiring Fund had broken down from an actuarial point of view I would have heard of it. Nor has the South Australian Superannuation Fund proved actuarially unsound. The Commonwealth Government have had actuarial calculations made, and they are prepared to subsidize the fund to be established under the Bill. I fail to see how it could break down from an actuarial point of view, because it is eminently sound. It is quite a correct policy for the Government to refrain from contributing to the fund imme-",31,Superannuation Bill

The Government will be able instead to devote the money to reproductive works, which will result in increased population, and when Australia has been more fully developed it will be easier for the Governoffered to him to serve the Commonment to contribute their share to the fund. outside who have criticised the Bill fail to appreciate the benefit the measure will afford to the Government and to the country. It is simply a case of helping men who are willing to help themselves. Quite a number of private firms are adopting exactly the same course. An obligation rests on the Government to look after the interests of the Public Service, and the fact that officials will have provision made for them on retirement will be an inducement to them to remain in the Service. It is often said that there are men in the Service who could do much better for themselves in private employment. would like to be in the Service. of men are they? member ever becomes Treasurer, he will find that, notwithstanding his business training, he will need to rely to a very great extent on the services of officials who have had many years of training in ,that particular Department. If our public servants are worthy of the salary paid to them, by l'eason of the responsiworld, drew up a scheme which made bilities intrusted to them, the Commonwealth should be prepared to remunerate them adequately, ancl part of that remuneration should take the form of provision for superannuation. I know of .a case where an official who was receiving ducted with the assistance of friendly £300 a year in the Government service was induced to leave it because a large Melbourne firm offered this officer £500 per annum. This firm appreciated the value of the service given.

British firm of Brasseys, contractors, Do they throw their employees upon the world when their services are no longer It would be most unwise to required? Have Lever Brothers, Cadburys, or Frys taken that attitude? Not one of them. I do not look upon the Bill as a proposal to give a pension to an officer on retirement. The payment to -be drawn by the officer at the end of his term should be regarded as portion of his salary and part of the inducement wealth. The people of Australia are Honourable members and people relieved of a great responsibility by this measure. not opposed to superannuation in regard to the Federal Public Service, but I do not want to provide it for the, Service only. The ACTING CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable member's remark is more applicable to the second reading of the Bill than to the clause under consideration. bution to superannuation funds has occupied the attention of almost all countries, and not many of them have acted similarly. Countries like the United States of America and France have found that they could not devise auy compulsory scheme which they could regularly mainI f the honourable tain. Very few countries have aimed at the establishment of a scheme for any particular section of the community.

The administration of the fund was consocieties, which for centuries had had the handling of such work.

I do not think that delaying the present Bill for the purpose of introducing a national scheme would handicap. * If this Bill is to be delayed with that object in view, T Take the great should like the Public Service to be assured that it will not bo the loser thereby.

The honourable member has been fortunate if he has not had brought under his notice during his par-, liamentary term many complaints of dismissal from the Public Service for very small matters. Pew honourable members have not had a list of complaints in this respect brought under their notice. A man dismissed in these circumstances may have been paying into the fund for a lengthy period, and may have been looking forward to the time when he would be called upon to retire. He may have given the'whole of his life-time to a certain occupation in one Department, and it may have physically handicapped him from taking up any other class of work. And his only compensation is the return of his contributions to the superannuation fund. There are very few men in any avocation who go through their service without making a small mistake at one time or another. But, because a man He pays premiums which allow happens to incur the displeasure of certaiu people in control, he may be dismissed and deprived of all the advantages lhat would otherwise accrue to him under the superannuation scheme, except the repayment of the contributions he has made to it. Most likely, not being fitted to follow any other occupation, he is placed at considerable disadvantage. I do not know whether ' anything can be done in the Bill to meet the case, but I draw the Minister's attention to the case of dismissed men. It should be pointed out to those in control thatunless some big mistake has been made by the official *he should receive fairly lenient consideration. He should not be dismissed from the Service because of merely a small offence. missed in any case for a small offence. Quite a number of such instances occur in our Publio Service, especially in the case of employees in receipt of less than £200 a year. We hear of such cases in connection with letter deliverers, and in other branches of the General Division of the Post Office. When a little thing goes wrong the ,man concerned is dismissed, and such dismissal is hard upon a man who has given the best part of his life to the Service, and has arrived at",34,Superannuation Bill

Even under the present law an employee can only be dismissed for a very serious offence.

Under the Public ServiceA c t the Public Service Commissioner has the right to call upon anybody to retire after he has reached the age of sixty. If an employee© has been in tbe Service for many years, and has paid into the Superannuation Fund for twelve or eighteen months, First, there or two years, and is then called upon to retire through no, f a u l t of his own, he wou?,d not get a pension, but would be limited, apparently, to an actuarial Disamount calculated on the amount he has is only ordered in very actually paid in . It seems to me to be Under the B ill it most unfair that some senior men should be treated in this way, while others are put on a much more favorable footing.

A man who is sixty years of age, and is compelled to. retire, can only receive a pension fixed actuarially upon his payments for a limited time. Another question also arises in relation to a man who wishes to retire at the age of sixty because he feels that he is not fit for the work. I was going to suggest to the Minister( Mr Groom) that such a man should be allowed to pay in a lump sum equivalent to what he would havepaid if he had continued in the Service unti l he was sixty-five years of age, and, if he did that, he should be entitled to the f u l l benefits of the scheme. enables that to be done. We give as much as we actuarially can. The clause I refer to is clause 12, which saysProvided further that a contributor who elects, or is called upon, to retire on or after attaining the age of sixty years and prior to thc maximum age for retirement may contribute, in a lump sum or in such smaller sums, and at such periods, as the Board approves,'the actuarial equivalent of the amount necessary to complete his payments to the fund up to a later age (not exceeding the maximum age for retirement). privilege of contributing whatever the actuarial amount may be. The point I am trying to make is that actuarially, if he has only just come under the f u n d , he may be called upon to pay a very large amount in order to bring his payments up to a sum which would entitle him. to 'a. pension at sixty-five years of age. mous amount Government would treat him as though these payments had been made up to sixty years of age, and say to him, "" You would pay uncier the scheme so much, but because you are drawing a pension so many years earlier you ought to pay a little more."" That might not be a very large amount actuarially, but if we take the amount which is actuarially necessary to make his payments, which cover only a few years, up to , an amount which would entitle him. to a pension at sixty-five years of age, it would be a sum which it would be impossible for him to pay. We can compel a man to leave the Service at sixty years of age, and under this Bill we may pay him only a trifling few pounds a year, equivalent to the amount which he would be entitled to as a contributor to the f u n d for a few years. I do not think that is fair, and some provision ought to be made to meet such cases. The Minister ought to leave out the words, "" called upon to retire before attaining that age."" If a man chooses to retire before the age, he has himself to blame to some extent; but if we make him retire I think the least we can do is to give him the same privileges that we give to the men who have already retired, or have nearly reached the age of sixty-five. ney-General) [6.11] -Benefits can only be given which are actuarially, sound. Any benefit a man gets must be according to the actuarial basis of his contributions. The scheme is based upon the general provision in section 73 of the Publio ServiceA c t , which saysEvery officer, having attained the age of sixty, shall be entitled to retire from the Public Service if he desires so to do; but any such officer may (unless called upon to retire, as hereinafter provided) continue in the Public Service until he attains the age of sixty-five years. There are two things we could have done. We could have made the retiring age for all members of the Public Service sixty years. If we had done that we would have had to do two other things. We Would have had to increase the amount of the contributions, because contributors would automatically f a l l upon the pension scheme five years earlier, and would contribute for five years less. That would It would be an enorhave increased the payments very greatly, as happened in New South Wales. The provision in the B ill was the proper It would, but if the course to take. It is only in exceptional circumstances that a man is called upon to retire at sixty years of age. The provision relating to the retiring age is in the Public ServiceA ct in the interests of the public. It is the rare exception; and not the rule, for a man to be retired at sixty years of age. All that we can do is to estimate actuarially the value of a man's, pension, and take into account the number of years he has been in the Service and the amounts he has contributed. We cannot create an exception and say that a man called upon to retire at the age of sixty years shall get greater privi leges and benefits .than if he continued",36,Superannuation Bill

If we alter the basis of the scheme in cerbe penalized as I have indicated. There tain casss we must alter its whole basis. It is impossible to tell whether a man will be called upon to retire thirty or forty years hence. We have, in fact, given him a concession in the clause to which I have referred the honourable member. There are two factors to be considered in connection with a pension, and they are the age at which a man is retiring and the amount of the pension. The second proviso to sub-clause 2 of clause 12 makes provision for him to get an increased pension. All we ask him to do is to make contributions up to an amount not exceeding that specified for his age, which will give him an increased pension. still maintain that those who have been for a very long period in the Service should receive more generous treatment than that to which they are actuarially entitled. pension to which they are actuarially entitled. before he has reached the age of sixtvfive he is thrown right back upon the actuarial basis. He is entitled only to that which is the actuarial equivalent of his contributions. On the one hand, this measure treats an officer, if he remains in the Service until he is sixty-five, with greater generosity than his contributions actuarially entitle him to receive; but, if for any reason he goes out of the Service before reaching the age limit, he is thrown back upon the actuarial basis, pure and simple, and that is not fair. Further, if an officer is incapacitated betributions. cause of invalidity, he is entitled to the full pension. The only reason which I can conceive for a public employee being called upon to retire between the age of sixty and sixty-five is that he has become incapable of continuing in the performance of his dut'es. There may be those who, while not in an actual condition of invalidity, have so deteriorated in general capacity as to be no longer fit to carry on. In the interests of the Service they ought to be retired at that stage rather than be kept on until they have reached the age of sixty-five. In such circumstances, however, they would are not many such cases, I am sure, but the least the Government can do is to treat them in the same way as if they were entitled to come under the invalidity clause. I stress the view that these older men should be entitled to the full pension if their services must be dispensed with after they have reached the age of sixty. [6.20] I ask the Attorney-General( Mr Groom) to sympathetically reconsider this phase of the Bill. The Government should be in a position to know how many public servants are likely to be involved. there are very few. employee's faults must be very glaring before he is discharged. But I have kndwn of certain peculiar cases. For example, I have heard of the spleen of a superior officer being responsible for the retirement of an old servant who has got beyond the stage of giving his best, but has not yet reached the retiring age. It is possible for an officer to remain in, the Service for very many years, paying his contributions right up to the age of sixtyone, and a little longer, and then to be told that, for some cause over which he has no control, his services are to be dispensed with. the public servant would have his pension worked out actuarially, and he would receive what he was entitled to get. He would be given the full value of his consuch would be the case; but that .would be of little consolation to the unfortunate officer. The Government should carry such a person on for the brief period up to the age of his retirement, seeing that he has possibly paid his pension contributions for forty years and longer. The aim of the Government at all times should be to secure a contented Service. This provision will not have that effect. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.",37,Superannuation Bill

I consider that the psriod of ten years is too long.

W h y should they be cut off from the benefits of the suDerannuation scheme merely because they have not been in the Service for. ten years?

Mr MoGRATH (Ballarat) [8.28] According to the definition clause, an employee is a person employed in a permanent, capacity in the Public Service. In the Military Forces the colonels, majors, captains, and other commissioned officers' are permanently employed, and will come under the Bill, but there is a doubt whether the instructional and warrant officers in the artillery and other branches of the Service will come under it. They are men who are permanently employed, although their engagements are for three-years periods, which are constantly renewed. I ask the Minister to see that these men are included. torney-General) [8.29] -The Bill covers In the Naval Forces, the naval ratings engage for a certain period of service, and can then re-engage.

Forces the non-commissioned officers, I think, enlist for five years, and may engage non-commissioned officers-warran t offifor three years, and then re-engage until they have reached the age of fifty-five years. These men do not come within the Bill. This scheme is based on the regular contributions of a permanent service. Obviously, Navy ratings could not come within this scheme, because the men are there for only short periods. We could not include a body of men whose periods of employment do not exceed twelve years, and give them all the privileges enjoyed by men who contribute to the fund up to sixty-five years of age. Therefore, the actuaries recommended that Navy ratings should not be included. rant officers? given the Minister for Defence( Mr been employed at the Victoria Barracks, Greene) and the Government some concern. We feel that these men ought to receive special consideration, but they do not fit in with this scheme. Many of the men engaged for five years go out at the end of that period, and we could not think of giving them the same rates of pension as are given to permanent men who contribute over a long series of years. However, we are looking into the matter, and, in consultation with the actuaries and others, are trying to devise some legislation to enable us to meet the case. fca do that? considered now. brought down this session ? cover those men who are permanent? the Permanent Forces, but they are really not permanently employed.

It is remarkable that in all legislation affecting the military there is no doubt about the treatment In the Military of the officer class-the y are always well, treated. Here, again, is the case of the cers, sergeant-majors, and so forth-wh o are willing to be permanently employed, and who are permanently employed today, but cannot obtain from the Government an engagement for a longer period than three years. Some of these men have worked from ten to twenty years and longer for the Government, and worked much harder than many of the officer class.

W it h all due respect to those in the higher positions, the most important officer is the warrant officer, who does the training of even the officers themselves. I am surprised .that they are l e f t out in the cold. If 'we interpret the word "" permanent "" in a narrow sense we shall exclude from the benefits of this B i ll a number of men who perform most valuable functions in the defence of this country. I know of no body of men, if we are to have military training here, who perform more valuable work than the area officers, some of whom, I believe, are permanent, though most of them are not, but are on a three years' basis. A t the end of the three years they are re-employed, and they may be continuously employed for over thirt y years; yet, according to the interpretation of the Minister( Mr Groom), they are excluded from the operation of this Bill. This seems to be making a very invidious distinction, one likeW to create, in certain circles, a feelinpthat ought not to exist. I wonder if the Government have considered that aspect of the question.

It is cruel to deny them the benefits of this legislation. quite in accord with the two previous but I think there' is a means of getting sneakers.

They are temporary men belonging to the Permanent Forces, and they have their terms renewed in such a way as to practically make them permanent. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) is quite right when he says that some of these men have been employed by the Government for many years, and look upon themselves as permanent employees from the day they were appointed, and make their plans accordingly. To describe them as temporary emnloyees is, strictly speaking, correct, but, as has been suggested, the description rests on a mere technicality. believing that their positions will be as permanent as those of the officers, and in many cases they are so. Of course, they are not bound in precisely the same way as are the officers, but they join, with the intention of making the work their life-long calling; and something should be done for them. If the Minister( Mr Groom) cannot see his way to meet the case, the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) may possibly be able to do so.

They have just as meritorious a case for consideration as those officers who were retired after 31st December, 1920. They want to know why they are going to be left out, and why that date was fixed. That is the vital point. Clearlyi t is not the date that was first suggested, because the Bill was promised away back in October, 1919, when the Government announced, as an act of policy, that they were bringing in a superannuation scheme. the Minister tell us how the Government arrived at this date? Wasi t to cover some obligation, or was it merely an accident of circumstances when the Bill was first prepared ? ney-General) [8.58] -The date fixed waa, as nearly as possible, the date of the closing of the first session following the general elections of 1919. It is true that the scheme was under consideration before the general elections of 1919, but it was only definitely promised, during that election, as part of the Government's policy. ' Owing to certain circumstances, it could not be dealt with in the first session. Naturally, members of the Public Service expected it to be in operation (106] not later than a year after the general elections of 1919, and so the Government fixed the date in accordance with expectations. pect nothing. monwealth publio servants were -expecting something. As I stated, by way of interjection when the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was speaking, the choice of date will operate more harshly upon the older men in the Service. I think any reference to the date should be excluded altogether. The condition is that the Like all officer shall have been at least ten -years in the Service and shall have attained the age of sixty-five years. It follows that persons who retired prior to 1921, upon having attained the age of sixty-five < year3, and are still in the land of the living, are old men whose merits are quite equal to those of the men who are to receive the pension, hut they will be excluded. It follows also, from the weight of years that persons have to carry in order to win this pension, that their numi bers will be small. I am not in a position to say to what extent the omission of the date would add to the appropriation, but I have been reminded that I would not be in order in moving an amendment to that effect. I do propose, however, to test the feeling of the Committee by' asking honourable members not to accept the clause in its Will present form. The Minister( Mr Groom) may have information before him which will enable him to say how much would be added to the appropriation by including all those who had attained the age of sixty-five at the date of their retirement and had been in the Service at least ten years, but who are excluded from the benefits under the Bill because they were retired before the 31st December, 1920. One feels inclined to go a little further, and say that the age of sixty-five years is too high. But, hopeless of having that view accepted, I think the Committee should seriously consider the extension of the benefits of this pension scheme to persons of the class I have mentioned.

The Bill provides that anybody who has retired since 1920 shall receive a pension without contribution. There cannot be many of those who retired at sixty-five before 31st December, 1920. By way of illustration I shall montion the circumstances of one man who has come to me. This man joined the Service in the days before pensions were abolished by the State Government. With a number of others he was retired on "" Black Wednesday "" ; he was subsequently re-engaged about two months after the pensions scheme had been cancelled, and before compulsory insurance had been introduced. He is what is known in the Service as a "" Twilighter."" He has neither the advantage of a pension under the old Act nor compulsory insurance under the modern Act, and he I do not think it would add much to the cost of the scheme if he and a few others who retired before the 31st December, 1920, were included in the scheme, and given a small pension for the few remaining years of their lives. A t any rate, I ask the Attorney-General to investigate the number of such persons who will be affected, and the probable cost of their inclusion in the scheme. I think he will find the numbers and cdst so small that he will agree to make this concession. The persons for whom I am appealing must be over sixty-seven years of age now, and they must have been ten years in the Service; there cannot be many of them. children will have to be considered also. be, I still say that consideration should be given to those old men who retired before the arbitrarv date mentioned in the Bill. persons who, having reached the age of sixty-five years, and retired since the pension without contributing to the fund will be on a better footing than will those other officers who will be obliged to contribute.

Prowse) did not suggest that the omcers who have already retired should actually pay anything into the fund; what he proposed was merely that the actuarial equivalent of what they have not paid into the fund shall be deducted from their pension. And that is the most equitable policy that could be adopted. The Minister may claim that it is an uncharitable policy: but he places a wrong complexion upon the suggestion when he says that it is a proposal to ask these old men, who have no salary, to contribute to the fund. in December, 1919. If the Bill had equivalent of contributions from a pension of £104, how much will the man have to live upon ? be too great; but it is not right to say that the honourable member for Swan is proposing that these officers should be asked to contribute. from the Minister that the widows and children of officers who retired since the 31st December, 1920, and died later, will be provided for. The Bill provides for a penaion of £13 for each child, and £26 for the widow of a retired officer. I understand that what the honourable member for Nepean( Mr the earliest year in which the measure Bowden) has in mind is that the pension payable to the widow would be granted to the children in the event of her death. That is what, should be provided. A payment of £104 a year to an officer will mean a pension of £26 for his widow, and £13 for each child.

329,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Attorthe benefit of the scheme. I know another official who retired in 1919, after having given forty-seven years' service. He was one of the most capable and self-sacrificing public officers we have had in Queensland. It has been found necessary, however, to draw the line somewhere. There is much to be said in favour of the argument advanced by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) and honourable members on this side, that the B ill should be made applicable to all aged servants of the Commonwealth. by the fact that the person to receive the benefit must be sixty-five years of age on retirement. We propose to make the measure retrospective for two years, meaning that officers sixty-seven years of age would come under it . It is unfortunate that other men who have rendered good and faithful service should be deprived of the benefit of the scheme simply because they happened to retire a few years, or perhaps only a few weeks before the date on whicli the Act is to come into operation. I am acquainted with men who have given good service in the Commonwealth, and who retired three or four years ago. A t present they are not in very good circumstances. Probably the Minister( Mr Groom) will urge that the cost of the scheme would be increased too much by extending the benefits to all old employees of the Oommonwealth. It is obvious that, by adopting that course, the cost would be increased, but there cannot be a great many retired officers for whom the Bill does not provide. Not many of us pass the allotted span of three score years and ten, and from thepoint of view of equity, I think we ought to make the measure retrospective, to embrace all officers who have given service to the Commonwealth up to the age of sixty-five years. Mr GaooM.T-There would be quite a number of them. fair number, but the question is whether we should not do justice to them. State pensions. duce the number of whom the Minister speaks. It is not the fault of these officers retiring allowances. that they have been left without provision; it is the fault of Parliament. Had they remained in the service of the States, they would have been well provided for under the State Acts. Simply because they were transferred to the Commonwealth, and the Pederal Parliament has made no legislative provision for their superannuation, many of them now have to depend on old-age pensions. I know men who have served up to the age of sixty-five years under the Commonwealth, and they are now drawing those pensions. The Government ought to be ideal The clause is governed employers, setting an example to private employers. The Minister would be well advised if he gave a little more consideration to this provision. If he postponed the clause for the time being, to enable him to look into the question raised, it could be dealt with at a later period. I do not think any very great additional cost would be involved by extending the benefits of the Bill to all those officers who have served up to the age of sixty-five years, and are not in receipt of a State pension. pect. The whole matter has been very carefully considered, and we cannot see our way clear to extend the Bill. move an amendment, but there seems to be a consensus of opinion that something more should be done to meet the case of these officers The Minister would gain by agreeing to the suggestion for the postponement of the clause, because it is quite possible the other clauses will go through very quickly. practice to introduce the retrospective principle into legislation. already incorporated it in the Bill we .are discussing. little more generous.

Many private firms give pay in lieu of holiday allowance. That principle is followed in the Police Force in many of the States. As a matter of fact, many of the Commonwealth officers who have retired were actually entitled to two furloughs accordloyal. ing to their period of service, but only drew allowance for one furlough. During the war many of our public servants did additional work without extra pay, and did not take the holidays to which they were entitled. offering their lives. ment for the honourable member to advance against men who were doing good work for their country in their proper sphere. In any case, those who would be affected by the present proposal were over the military age. It is very unfair for thc honourable memher to speak as he has done concerning men who have given good and faithful service to their country, possibly just as much as the honourable member himself rendered during the war. doing so at such a reflection upon men in our Public Service who gave extra time to their country to assist during the war, and did all they could in their 3phere of work. However, I appeal to the Minister, to give this matter a little further consideration, and see if he cannot meet the wishes of the Committee by postponing the clause. By doing so he might get the rest of the Bill through at this sitting. It is the only clause which seems to give honourable members concern. of the Chamber think that the provision should be made more liberal. The Attorney General( Mr Groom) has suggested that the people to whom the Committee is anxious to extend the benefits of this clause will have paid nothing, but I recall his mind to the fact that the late Sir Samuel Griffith was given a pension of £1,750, although he had not contributed anything towards it out of his salary of over £3,000 per annum. ney-General) [9.36] I do not think the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) intended to reflect upon the Public Service in any way; in fact, I am sure he would concede, as readily as any other honourable member would, that during the period of the war the Commonwealth Public Service was true and The question with which we are now dealing was given a good deal of earnest consideration, and I am assured that if we were to do as has been suggested, namely, to sweep away all restrictions, and make the benefits of the scheme apply to all persons, it would mean a very considerable increase in the Commonwealth expenditure, especially during the next two or three years. idea of what the additional cost would be? here, but I can assure the Committee, without troubling them with the details, that the additional cost would be considerable. At any rate, if we were to sweep away all restrictions as regards the old men, why should we not also do so in regard to the men who have been retired on account of invalidity, many of whom are, perhaps, more in need of assistance than are those over the age of sixty-five? If we start nibbling in the way suggested, the whole scheme will get out of gear. A logical date has been set down to which we should adhere. For one thing, our actuarial estimates have been based upon it. Naturally we would all like to be generous and vote money out of the Consolidated Revenue. It would be very nice to dispense moneys in this wav, but we have a responsibility Quite a number on both sides to undertake. and 1 ask honourable members not to try to extend it so as to exceed what is a reasonable anticipation of possible expenditure.",50,Superannuation Bill

I hope that the Minister( Mr Groom) will not expect the Committee to be affected taken into consideration, but I claim that by the sophistries he tenders as argument. For instance, he declares that if we extend the benefits of this measure to the limited section of old and faithful servants of the Commonwealth we seek to have included, there willi be no logical reason for not extending it also to those who through illness or infirmity retired in the years gone by. I would not be afraid to support an extension of the scheme to those particularly deserving public servants, but the Labour party to-night have been more moderate in their request, and have asked the Minister to meet the argument we have put up on its merits, and not suggest that there are many other equally deserving people who might be benefited. So far, our contention has not been met. The persons conbe? He made some inquiries, hut they cerned must, as has been said, be at least sixty-seven years of age. In fact they must be more than that, because this pension will be payable only, under this clause, from the passing of the Act, and will carry widows' and children's benefits in accordance with the Act. As the Minister was looking for what he as a lawyer would recognise as ad captandum We not point out that if we were to accept the proposal which I made when first speaking on this clause, it would also involve additional expenditure in making provision for widows and children. We would like to put the acid test on the Minister in this way. If he is not prepared to give the benefit of his suggested amendment to others, such as those who have retired through invalidity, or if he is not prepared to extend it to the wider area involved in applying it to widows and children, we ask him to bear in mind that there are a few old and faithin number and very advanced in age, who have an unanswerable claim to a pension whom he proposes to give it. We claim that the pension should be given to this small number of persons, unless the. Minister cau advance some reason other than the miserable pretext of expense why it should not be done. I would like to soothe those who laugh when I use the words ""miserable pretext of expense,'"" by assuring* them that I do not ignore the matter of finance in connection with this question. I realize that it must be it must not be used as an argument in support of palpable injustice. In a matter of this kind, we should have the courage to do right in scorn of consequences, namely, by extending the benefits of this measure logically to those for whom honourable members of the Committee on both sides of the Chamber have made a plea to-night. The Minister has not even promised to reconsider the clause. He tells us that he does not even know to what extent it will involve an extra expenditure of public money.

If the Minister changes his mind on this subject it will not be because of the speech of the honourable member for Batman, but the thanks will be due to Sir James Barrett.

In the absence of any such estimate I do.not accept the statement that the adoption of the proposal would cost a lot of money. sixty-five years of age two or more years ago, and, therefore, many of them entered the Service just after the payment of compensation was abolished in the States. When I hear honourable memhers, particularly those of the Corner party, who seem to be very anxious about the cost of anything relating to the working section of the community, speak of the cost of the proposal, I am reminded of the wonderful support which the Government has received from the Corner party, and the slavish following it has had from members like the honourable member for Denison, in reducing taxation to the rich. of the House come forward with a proposal to do justice to old people who have served this country faithfully for many years, and have reached the evening of their day, we arc met with questions of cost, jusi as we were when the payment of old-age pensions was before the House. It was only last week that the Government passed >a measure to remit £400,000 of taxation from the large land monopolists of this country. On that occasion the Government were supported by the honourable member for Denison. Other proposals for remitting taxation were outlined in the Budget speech. Por the benefit of the big Plinders-lane warehouses of this country, and all big businesses, there is to be a remission of income tax amounting to 10 per cent. The Government are proposing to remit £3,000,000 a year from the taxes paid by the big landed interests and the big business houses. The point at issue is whether this country can afford to do justice to these old people. If we are so bankrupt that we cannot find a few pounds to pay these people £2 a week for the remaining days of their lives, we are not in a position to remit £3,000,000 of Mr Scullin. taxation to the richest people in the community. I am surprised that the Minister should come down with a statement. I that the cost would be too heavy in the face of what has been happening in this House during the last week: It is a pity that the Minister has not heen able to find a sounder argument.

He knows it . cannot be true. There is no party in this House, and there are no honourable members in this House, who have done more to assist the Minister in getting the measure through than have members of the Opposition, and I believe the Minister would support that statement.

I regret that we cannot test the opinion of the Committee by moving an amendment on the clause to wipe out the limitation as to date. Such an amendment would be ruled out of order, as it would involve an increase in the appropriation. I believe that if 6uch an amendment were put to the vote, the sense of justice of the Committee would prevail, and these aged men and women would get their rights. This measure has been promised to them for many years, and, because they have been denied justice in the past, that is no reason why we should not start now to do justice to them. If others are to get the pension without making any contribution, then these men are not less entitled to it . This measure does bare justice to the lowerpaid men in the Service, while it deals generously with those in the higher branches, I agree w i th the principle that the Government should contribute half of the f u n d to be provided. On the one hand, however, certain persons in the Service who have been drawing high salaries will be able to retire on a pension of £ 4 00 a year; while, on the other, the great mass of retiring public servants, who have been receiving low salaries, will be entitled to only a small pension. Omcers who have been in receipt of big salaries are to be handsomely treated; but when honourable members ask for pensions of £ 1 0 4 a year for officers who have reached the age of sixtyseven years, and even seventy years and more, the Government reply that the cost would be too great. I can only urge that the argument is a weak one.

Tliose resolutions have not been embodied in any Act, and the payments made under that authority are not a legal right, neither are they retiring allowances within the meaning of the Constitution. In order that the omcers transferred to the Commonwealth should not, by reason of their transfer, have to bear the loss of these gratuities, it was arranged with the State Governments that the payments should, from time to time, be made 'by the Commonwealth as an act of grace, subject to the State Government first concurring before any payment is made. tbese payments as a matter of grace are entitled to the benefits of the B ill , but it is doubtful whether the Treasury w ill continue them.

The other two members of the Board may or may not devote all their time to its work. In New South Wales the three members of the Board devote a l l their time to its work, but inasmuch as the cost of administration will have to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, there w ill be a natural desire on the part of the responsible Minister to keep down expenditure as much. as is reasonable, and the two members of the Board other than the President may be asked to devote only a portion of their time to its work. be an actuary. of the Board need not devote all his time to its work.

I agree with the Minister that it is necessary to economize as much as possible in The omcers who are getting the working of the Act , but I am doubtf u l whether the member of the Board who represents the employees of the Public Service may not be prejudiced both as a member of the Board and as a departmental officer, if he is asked to give two or three days a week to the service of the Board and the rest of his time to the duties of his departmental office, with a substitute filling his place during his absence at the Board meeting. It mighthappeh that exception might be taken to an officer employed thus intermittently in two offices^ and that he might thereby incur some damage. The drawing up of regulations w ill entail a great deal of work on the members of the Board. presentative will probably be chosen from a number of nominees recommended by the Public Service. dozen names may be submitted, and the officer chosen may be one occupying a very important departmental post. Such an oflicer could not give satisfaction both as a member of the Board and as a departmental official, since in the latter capacity a substitute would have to do his work for much of the time, and the public interests might suffer in consequence. It seems to me that it might be advisable to require the members of the Board to devote all their time to their duties, though I would not wish for that arrangement to be made if there were not sufficient work to j u s t if y it . work w ill be routine work.",57,Smith Denison Rises I Think I Should Say In Justi

I do not like (he manner in whioh the Attorney General( Mr Groom) has placed this matter before us to-night. I cannot see that theire will be any large amount of work for this Board to do, because public servants who retire each year will not number many thousand. Certainly the whole administration will call for considerably less effort than that involved, for instance, in the payment of old-age and invalid pensions. The great trouble with Boards is that they have a tendency to grow in size and cost as they get older, and I think we are entitled to a little information before we consent to this clause.

( Mr Hughes) took office, [108]' and, fearful of giving that association a shook, I wrote back to-day giving only a few. What will be the effect on the association when I tell it of the cost of the various Boards, I do not know. What does the Minister really intend by the appointment of this Board, with its chairman at £2,000 a year, its members at proportionate salaries, with its clerks, messengers and lady typiatee 1 I suppose, however, that the appointment of these Boards finds positions for eome people. A t the present moment, we have not an idea within £5,000 of what this Board will cost' per annum, and in my opinion the clause ought not to.be passed until we have further information' in order that we may safeguard the publio I purse. I am not the only member of the community who is concerned at the enormous increase in the public expenditure. [10.49] I should, like to know from the The Treasurer Minister( Mr Groom) whether the employees' representative on the Board will be a "" full time"" member of the Board for seven years. I ask that question because there is a doubt in the minds of some people, and in my own mind, aa. to whether that is the case or not. As the public servants will pay about £300,000 'per annum into the fund, they should be represented on the Board by a permanent full-time member. In the earlier stages, there Will be a great deal of administrative work to do, and, therefore, the Minister should consider the expediency of making the appointment on the lines I have indicated. stage, to say whether the work will be of. such a character as to require the appointment of whole-time members.
