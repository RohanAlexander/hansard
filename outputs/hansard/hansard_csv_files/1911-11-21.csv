Minister of Trade and Customs been drawn to two paragraphs appearing in the Age of 18th instant under the heading, "" Australian Pork. Inspection again at f a u l t "" ? The first paragraph readsThe experimental shipment of -Tasmanian pigs brought to London by the steamer Essex was successful, with the exception that five carcases were condemned on account of the presence of tuberculosis. Although the carcases carried the Commonwealth export certificate, the glands had not been cut. The London, medical officer dealing with meat shipments states that in future he will treat Australian pork as being without a certificate. It is further stated thatIt is strange that every condemnation of Australian meat in London finds immediate publicity. The Customs Department has evidence that meat exporters from other countries are not subjected to similar betrayal of secrets. It is admitted, however, that at several of the largest ports in Australia the inspection is lax. The Comptroller-General, Mr Lockyer, stated last night that the Department's first proceeding would be to sheet home the offence to the inspector. The inspection was now being tightened up, and an expert was being sent' to London. One lax inspector could do enormous lately I have taken exception to the reading of long paragraphs by members wishing to ask questions of Ministers, and I am sure that the honourable member could frame his question more shortly.

There may be a serious difference of opinion as to whether the attitude which the Prime Minister has taken up on that subject is correct, seeing that he is passing over the head of his own Commission entirely, and placing that matter in the hands of a State Government. portunity will be given to the House this session of dealing with any matter which is not brought forward by the Government. Last session the honourable member for Capricornia had on the notice-paper a very important motion for the appointment of a Royal Sugar Industry, and the Prime Minister, before leaving for South Africa, promised the honourable member that the House should have an opportunity of dealing with all private members' motions then on the paper. day of the session'those motions were called on, and member after member simply had to rise and ask that they be postponed. That was a breach of faith. have a distinct understanding that there will be no repetition of that fiasco this session. now that an opportunity will be given to the House before the close of the session to [102] deal with all the private members' business on the paper. I should not object to the motion. Unless that promise is given, I shall have to vote against the supreme surrender by members to the Government of the whole of the time of the House. I have never been able to understand why, if Ministers find the time getting short, they do not ask Parliament to sit for the whole of the week. Why not sit on Mondays, and on Friday evenings? A number of members from other States have to lemain in Victoria for the week-ends throughout the session, and it is not asking too much of the members from New South VVales and South Australia to ask them to give up, towards the end of the session, the privilege of going home at every week-end. of my The motion practically means that i i i private motions on the paper will be absoThere lutely expunged. I hope the House, before allowing the motion to be carried, will obtain a distinct promise that every notice of motion on the paper will have an opportunity of being decided after reasonable business. There is on debate. In Federal politics a motion of this kind does not come so prominently before us as it does in State politics. I endeavoured once in the State Parliament to avoid the necessity of Ministers having to take action of this kind. My plan was to appoint one night in the session, to be known as division night, upon which any member could have a division taken on any question without debate. By that means as many as It we carry this motion no optwenty divisions could be taken on important questions, and honourable members could then see if it was worthwhile for them to take up time by having any particular question debated. by consent. that. I have never yet heard a logical reason urged against the proposition. I understand that the passing of this motion will give the Government the only chance they will have of bringing in this session a In the afternoon of the very last Bill to rectify anomalies in the Tariff. Therefore, in the hope that that .Bill will be introduced this session I propose to vote for the motion. Knowing, however, that We ought to the Labour party, as a party, have always been willing to meet every month in the year if needed, I cannot see why, should If the Prime Minister will sav we be unable to finish our business before Christmas, we should not have a special session, if only to rectify Tariff anomalies.",16,Order Of Business

The best thing that could happen -would be for us to ease off a little the work that is being done now, and give the country a rest. nothing. ment are doing nothing useful. That is why 1 suggest that the party opposite should cease from doing the foolish things in which they are engaged at present. I altogether dissent from the proposal of the honourable member for Franklin that the House should sit on Friday evenings and Saturdays, and I do not know on how many other days, to complete the work of the sescourse, the Referendum., That is a sion Parliament sits now one day a week more than any State Parliament, and four days a week is as much as any Parliament ought to sit, having regard to the responsihowever, the question of the Customs leakbilities of the Administration. We had a taste last session of working twelve hours a day in the House; and the result was that we did not get any further forward with legislation, while the administration pf the Departments was very sadly neglected. The Government rightly said that they were, not able to keep pace with the growing administrative requirements, owing to their being tied to the House practhe difficulties besetting this much plagued tically from getting up in the morning until Department, and placing it on a sound all hours of the night; and I hope to see no repetition of that during the present or any other session. Of course, the sessions might be made a little longer; and that would be infinitely preferable-if we must have more legislation-to indulging in such legislative orgies as we have done on occawill contrive to find a day or two later on sions during the continuance of this Parliament. The business in the name's of private members is, I venture to say, of much more importance to the country-and that is the peculiarity of the positionthan a great deal of the legislation in the name of the Government. There are several motions in the names of private members of outstanding importance; and on these we ought to have the mind of the Government indicated very clearly. Nothing could be more farcical than to postpone a number of motions of the kind till the last day of the session, and then vote without giving them the slightest consideration. For instance, there is the motion in the name of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in regard to the pay and pensions of the Defence Forces. sitate more taxation. Mt. JOSEPH COOK-Then all the more need for a little consideration; and I do not think that such, a motion ought to be summarily disposed of on the last day of the session, as though it were a matter of no consequence. Then what is to become of the motion of the honourable member for New England in favour of the nationalization of the means of distribution? Has that motion to be put to the vote on the last day of the session, or has it already served its purpose? Federal Capital Referendum.. matter which, with the honourable member for Herbert, I think might be postponed for the next twenty-five years. There is, age in Tasmania, and one or two other proposals for which the Prime Minister might very well provide opportunities for discussion. . Something ought to be done in regard to the Post and Telegraph Department this session-somethin g must be done, though I do not pretend to say now in what direction. There is no more important question than that of smoothing away foundation. If all these motions are to be placed at the bottom of the list, does it mean that they must go over until next session? If so, let us understand what is being jettisoned by the motion before us. I hope, however, that the Prime Minister for the discussion of one or two of these important matters, so that they may be cleared out of the way. I shall not oppose tlie motion, which, I think, is a very proper one when the stssion is nearing its close. I think we might put on a little pressure in order to close the session as reasonably early as possible, but I hope there will be no attempt to dragoon the House, as previously, into working twelve or fourteen hours a day. That leads only to prolonged talk, and does not in any way lead to celerity in legislation; at any rate, that is my experience extending over a great number of years.",17,Order Of Business

This Royal Commission was appointed by the present Government, and has presented a unanimous report; but the Prime Minister now tells us that before he does anything he desires to hear the Premier of Tasmania. When listening to the Prime Minister, it seemed to me that he thought the Tasmanian Premier ber must not discuss that question. ister thinks the matter over, he will agree with me that this House could discuss and deal with the matter without asking the chief representative of a State to send in a petition. able member must not discuss that question. say that the Prime Minister ought to try to provide a day when this question may be discussed, and to show the right honourable gentleman that he is going too far in asking the Prime Minister of Tasmania, in consideration of what has been done [3.38] I am very chary indeed about giving up to the Government the time allotted to private members' business. We ought to be very jealous of any invasion of our privileges; and when such a request is made, it should be acceded to only when some particular urgency exists. I recognise, with other honourable members, that -a number of the motions on the paper are of great importance. The honourable member for Riverina spoke, of one matter in particular which he was very anxious to see re-submitted to the House, with a view of obtaining a decision. He complained that the motion to which he referred was passed in a thin House. I was wondering whether he hoped that on the next occasion the motion would be dealt with by a full House; because it would be a mast unfortunate thing for temperance men, in my opinion, if the matter were dealt with in a "" f u l l "" House! I consider that honor[102]2 able members are right in insisting on the Prime Minister giving us some assurance of a more definite character, that time will be allowed for private members to bring forward their business. It will be within the recollection of honourable members that on a very recent occasion a similar request was made in regard to private members foregoing their business on a certain day, and they were promised that another opportunity would be given to them. But unfortunately, after the Government had taken up private members' time, the whole of the time that should have been given to private members by way of compensation was occupied by Ministerial supporters. We do not want to be led into a trap of that kind again. I do not say that a trap was intentionally laid, but the opportunity was taken by Ministerial supporters to the disadvantage of the Opposition and of other private members. On another occasion, last session, when a promise was given that a day would be set apart for the consideration of private business, the day selected was the last on which the House sat. Naturally, every honourable member was anxious to get away, and there was no time for dealing properly with private busir ness. We do not want that kind of thing to happen again. Members of the Opposition, in common with other honourable 7 members, recognise that it is necessary, at this late period of the session, that some sacrifice should be made in order to facilitate the passage of Ministerial measures. 1 would suggest that, as the paper is very much overloaded, the most sensible thing to do would be to jettison some of the Ministerial cargo. If we are to get through anything like the amount of business set down, there will be nothing left for next session. Therefore, the most business-like course would be to deal with one or two important measures that have a chance of being properly considered, and to allow the remainder to stand over. If that were done it would not be necessary either to increase the hours of sitting or to add to the sitting days or to interfere with private business. I trust that the Prime Minister will state specifically that he will give private members another clay than the last of the session for the consideration of their business. I intend to oppose the proposal of the Government to take the time at present allotted to private business.

The proposal simply means robbing them of the few hours that are allotted to them, whilst the time taken will be of very little use to the Government for practical purposes. In all probability we shall sit only five weeks longer. At the outside, four hours per week are allotted to private business. Consequently, the Government are proposing to take twenty hours. They can easily ask the House to sit in the morning on some days if necessary to help them to make up that time, and get through their business, t protest, however, against private business being set on one side altogether. Ministers ought not to propose to take from private members the few privileges which they possess in regard to submitting questions for discussion. Besides, there are certain matters contained in motions on the business-paper that cannot be decided merely by taking a vote. It is neither fair to an honourable member who has charge of a motion, nor to other honourable members, to decide such questions without debate. I am prepared to say that the majority of honourable members are not prepared to vote concerning some of these subjects without explaining their position. We ought to be honest with ourselves, and say frankly that there are some questions in regard to which we are not prepared to be placed on record as voting on either side. A few motions will inevitably, under any circumstances, be talked out. hesitation in saying that the motion of the honourable member for Riverina able member must not discuss that question. can support that outside, but he must not support it here. motionswhich I am prepared to stone-wall to the last ditch. motions upon which I am prepared to vote straight away.

I shall vote against the motion if it goes to a division, but I shall support the Government if they ask the House to sit » few hours extra on any given day or days. protest against this proposal to wipe out the privileges of private members with respect to their business. There are sixteen or seventeen motions upon the business-paper. Some of them are of the highest importance and interest. Not many opportunities have been afforded of discussing such questions this session. Private members' day affords the only opportunity on which seventenths of the members of this House can bring forward any matter of public interest for discussion. Now the Government propose to restrict that opportunity. I fear that if we permit this kind of thing to be done, the privileges of private members will be taken away from them altogether. Such opportunities become fewer and fewer every session. There seems to be no valid reason why a day should not be set apart for giving honourable members a reasonable opportunity for discussing resolutions, and taking votes upon them. time limit to enable that to be done. a time limit on debate for such a purpose.

The effect of the amendments is merely to extend to a part of a dispute the subject of, but not wholly covered by an agreement between the parties, the power which this House gave to the President of the Court in clause 12, in regard to the whole of the dispute. It has been found on various occasions that an agreement has been 'made between parties with regard to a part of a dispute, but not with regard to the whole as the law stands. This amendment is. intended to give the President of the Court power in regard to that part which is not covered by the agreement. It is a necessary corollary of the amendment of the law already made in this House. It involves no new principle, and breaks no new ground. Senate proposes that the clause should readI f an agreement between the parties as to the whole or any part of a dispute is arrived atWas it not just such an agreement that was arrived at between the wharf labourers and ship-owners in a very recent dispute? sion that will render the repetition of such a lawless breach as that, if not impossible, much more difficult than it is at present? If I remember aright, the Attorney-General stated that the only remedy as against those who broke that agreement would be a personal action against each one of the strikers. gentleman will agree, after our experience, that this is an utterly insufficient guarantee. It is perfectly certain that the ship-owners, having given their guarantee, were subject to a control which could have reduced them at once to obedience had there been any attempt on their part to rebel or break away from the agreement. It is only fair that the same treatment should be allotted to both sides. The guarantees of the law should be impartially adjusted, so that there shall be an equal obligation on each party. I am perfectly aware that it is idle to ask the honourable gentleman to deal with this difficulty at this stage. It is a not desire to interpose it here; but I do think that this session ought not to close without some attempt being made to remedy the obvious defect of the law which has been disclosed by our recent experience in Sydney. Such a defiance of good faith should be provided against in future. I do not wish to revive any memories, or to take any political advantage, but to suggest that, as a matter of simple justice, we must do what is necessary to give effect in an equitable manner to the principles of our arbitration law. It is clearly futile to pass legislation unless the sanctions on the one side are equal in effect to those on the other. It is not a question of form. It would be easy to adopt, in regard to the settlement of such a dispute, a form which would weigh heavily upon the employees, and let the employers go practically free. That would be absolutely unjust. We have just discovered in our industrial machinery a defect of that type of a very serious character, and it ought to be repaired. WhatI ask the Attorney-General to do is to say that, before this session closes, the House will have an opportunity of seeing that the balance is adjusted with absolute equity between the parties to agreements of this kind. I not only admit, but assert, that of all the methods of settlement which we have provided, those which embody an agreement are the very best. They should Is there any provibe encouraged and fostered in every way. It would be an immense advance if , either with or without an appeal to a Court,",20,Order Of Business

68,Mr Deakin,"I think the honorableagreements were entered into wherever possible. So that I am not directly or indirectly taking any exception to the principle of agreement. On the contrary, it is one of the very best principles in the Act. It is real conciliation and arbitration, and ought to be supported. Having made any misapprehension on that account impossible, I again ask the Attorney-General to take such steps before the session closes as will put those who sign an agreement, whether on one side or the other, under obligations which shall be not necessarily the same, but equally effective for the maintenance of order, thus preventing a lawless strike conducted by either side at the expense of the other. ney-General) [3.58] -In reply to my honourable friend, I desire to say that the enforcement of an industrial agreement is provided for in section 78 of the principal Act. non-observance of the agreement is liable to a penalty not exceeding such amount as is fixed by the industrial agreement; and if no amount is fixed, to a penalty not exceeding, in the case of an organization, £ 5 0 0 ; in the case of an employer, ,£250.; and in the case of an employee, £ 1 0 . I doubt utterly the scope of these industrial agreements. We do not know to what extent they are constitutional. Although the Act says that they are to be treated as awards, clearly they are not awards. They are attempts at the settlement of industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. in section 78 are not those which are affected by the amendment under consideration. case-referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, in regard to the later ebullitions, the men declined, not only to obey the executive of the federation, but of their own union. In such a case, what could be done but proceed against individuals? Unless the whole dispute was covered by the agreement, there was no advantage to be gained by the agreement as to the part, Court had to inquire into the whole matter. It was very unfortunate, for, as I have said before, in my opinion, when an organization enters into an industrial agreement, it ought to do so with its eyes open. There is no obligation upon any union to enter into such an agreement. Unions do not now occupy the position which they used to.' occupy when they had to approach employers as suppliants, with cap in hand. To-day, they are powerful organizations, and when they enter into an industrial agreement, they ought either to abide by it during its currency, or to move the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for its rescission. However, the amendment of the Senate does not touch that question, although its adoption will strengthen the hands of the President of the Court very materially. think that the proposed amendment touches industrial agreements at all. It merely seeks to make the effect of the clause, in respect of portion of an industrial dispute, the same as its effect in respect of the whole of a dispute. simple point is that, as it stands, the law is ineffective. The Attorney-General has inUnder that section any breach or dicated that when we are dealing with individual members of a union, the position becomes an extremely difficult one. But surely it is not beyond the scope of his ingenuity to devise a way in which those members can be dealt with in an effective fashion. For instance, it might be legitimately held that the members of a union who refuse to abide by an agreement intowhich the organization has entered shall cease to be members of such union, and shall thereby be taught one salutary lesson. honourable member, I think that that is a questibn for the organization itself to decide. a majority or minority of any union in open defiance of the' union itself, or of an agreement into which it has entered, surely it is incumbent upon us to provide a remedy. The balance must be re-adjusted so that a sufficient restraint may be imposed upon the employees as well as upon the employers. There is no difference between the position of the two parties, either from the moral or legal aspect of the case. But we must face the difficulty of dealing with a number of men who are not really unionists, but merely use the unions for their own and the purposes, reckless of their agreements. Will the Attorney-General give the matter his consideration, and inform us at a later stage whether he can see his way to adjust the scales of justice evenly in this relation ? Motion agreed to.

84,Mr Glynn,"I remember pointing outcrises in America would never have arisen, because his principle was that currency is really a matter subject to the law of supply and demandThe prime essential in any sound currency system is that the volume of the currency be subject only to the influence of the natural operation of the law of supply and demand. In other words, the volume of your note currency, like that of cheques and bills of exchange, which are generally referred to as deposits in the terms of banking, is determined by the commercial needs of a given moment, and the relation of the forms of a mixed currency to one another is determined by similar factors. We are told by writers, such as, I think, Herbert Spencer, that the balance of a mixed currency is necessarily self-adjusting. The trouble of the United States, as I have said, has arisen from the want of a proper appreciation of the significance of this fact. It may help honourable members if I refer to one or two authorities who have dealt with this matter recently. In one of a series of articles in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Mr Melon E. Siles, a banker, who was formerly Assistant Secretary to the Treasury, saysIn the main the national system has worked well. It has unquestionably furnished a perfectly secured and a uniform bank note circulation, but it has failed in one important respect. contents of the deposits which they reCirculation has never been responsive to the business requirements of the country. It has almost invariably expanded when it should have diminished, and contracted when it should have expanded. Related as note issues are to -Government bonds, circulation has followed the price of these securities in the market and not the volume of business. Lack of elasticity is the vital effect of our issue independent of a bank, or an issue bank currency. bankers' associations, Congressional committees, controllers of the currency, and secretaries of the Treasury have for years sought the solution of this problem. The remedy is yet to -be found. Perhaps the Monetary Commission will find it. An expert writing in March, 1908, after the crisis, saidWhat is wanted is not an increased issue of permanent inelastic currency, but the authority for banks to put into circulation, in response to the demands of trade, a bank note that will return to the bank of issue, and be cancelled as soon as the need is satisfied. In other words, we ought to 'fall back -on the principle so freely stated by Hamilton, who showed that issue, whether a deposit or a note issue, was a function of banking. AlthoughI have read authorities to the contrary, my conviction is that it is a great mistake to separate the note issue from the bank, as the Bill proposes. The nearest approach to anything that may be called a State currency is, I suppose, the currency of India established in 1861. There were only three banks issuing notes, banks doing business in three of the presidential towns, and, owing to the prejudice of the natives against bank paper, circulation was confined chiefly to those towns. Consequently there was great difficulty in transferring indebtedness from one place to another, and in making payments, because silver had to be dealt in largely. For one reason and another, the Government had to step in, the country being only partly developed commercially, and issue a currency with a circulation in defined circles. In that case you had a currency to some extent divorced from banking. Again, the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of Hamburg were institutions started as banks of issue. There was at the time a great deal of clipping and attrition of coin, and provision was made for the deposit of gold, for which, when it had been weighed, a certificate was given. These certificates became bankers' money and bills of exchange were drawn very largely on banks of the class referred to, whose certificates were known to indicate a certain value, being based on the metallic presented, which had a fair constancy for exchange purposes. It is only in countries of imiperfectly developed commercial) organization, or before banking had developed to its modern significance and complexity, that you find a Government Chambers of Commerce, that is divorced from true commercial banking. If you make issue a function of banking, no special reserve is necessary. All that is needed then is a certain amount of fluid assets, of which the chief is gold or bullion, against liabilities on demand. Coming over in the train this morning, I was looking through some of the lessons of the financial crisis, in connection with which the great name of Hamilton is referred to with very great respect. PerhapsI might read to honourable members what he said in his report on banking in general. Dealing with what issue really means, he showed that there is no difference between a note issue and deposits, bills of exchange, and cheques, which constitute 97 or 98 per cent, of the currency of London, and, I believe, a still larger percentage of that of Australia, where banking is very highly developed, and very sound. Hamilton said, in 1790Every loan which a bank makes is in its first shape a credit given to the borrower in its books, the amount of which it stands ready to pay either in its own notes or in gold or silver at its option. 'But in a. great number of cases no actual payment is made in either. The borrower frequently by use of a cheque or order transfers his credit to some other peris largely a .matter of opinion. When son to whom he has a payment to make. This man in his turn is as often content with a simiyou separate issue from banking, you lar credit, because he is satisfied that he can whenever he pleases either convert it into cash or pass it to some other hands as an equivalent for it. In this manner the credit keeps circulating, performing in every state the office of money until it is extinguished by a discount with some other person who has a payment to make to the bank to an equal or greater amount. For a State issue you must keep an artificial reserve, there being no other fluid assets to fall back on. Issue should be a matter of demand and supply from day to day over thecounters of the bank, not a matter of ultimate solvency. The solvency of Australia can never be questioned. This is a country of marvellous powers of recuperation .after any exceptional stroke of disaster. It is merely a question of meeting on demand the obligations imposed by the issue pf notes. For that you must, if you divorce issue from banking, hold an exceptionally large reserve You must, in effect, have, as they have in Canada, gold certificates. We started by copying Canada.

According to the Budget papers the note issue in circulation on 30th June lastwas £8,031,217, and the gold coin held was .£3,352,281; so that, as a matter of fact, there is now no opening for reducing, within the limits of safety, if the Government desire to do so, any of the proportion of the reserve to the issue.

The bank gave notice of suspension one afternoon, and the Bank of Montreal, on behalf of six other banks, all members of the association, next morning took up all its liabilities. effect of private co-ordination and co-operation in Canada-the system to which I have been referring. I would again ask the Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to gain the light of Canada's experience, and the recommendations from the United States of America, before we deal finally with this proposal. 1 am not going to say that it may, or may not, succeed. It is our duty to make this institution as perfect as possible, if it is going to be a common one, and, whilst I have my own opinions against it, I recognise that a critic should be helpful. The second failure in Canada since 1890 took place in 1908. It was that of the Sovereign Bank, which was established in 1903, and was based upon an American principle. Twelve of the associated banks, however, took up all its securities, and paid all its debts. Nothing of that sort is possible in the United States. ber argues that, under the present system nessa very risky one-that calls for great of banking in Canada, there is hardly any expert knowledge, and a profitable class of prospect of failure in the ultimate stages. recent authorities on the subject that is so. intermediaries My own impression is that many of the who looked forbetween articles in the Annals of the American of interest. Banking, as carried on in AusAcademy dealing with banking, & c , have tralia, seems to be a cross between this prineither been contributed by members of the ciple Commission, or are almost verbatim exexpounded by Macleod. It is by authorities of tracts, and properly so, from the reports, so this class considered a fallacy to say that a that they come with very great authority. banker In one article it is statedThe history of currency legislation in the United States during the last forty years has not presented a story to which any well informed and intelligent American can point with pride. At the end of the Civil War we found ourselves encumbered with an inconvertible paper currency issued to defray the expenses of that great war, and for fourteen years.therea credit in his books or a right of action for after this currency circulated at a discount while successive legislatures proposed varying plans for its retirement and for the resumption of specie payments, only to modify and repeal them. It was not in fact until 1879, or nearly a generation after the issue of the greenbacks, that the Government fulfilled its obligation and reason, that it is really a form of insurance. undertook their redemption. From that date for another generation successive Congresses dealt with the problem of silver coinage with equally inapt vacillation, and it was not until the year 1900 that the world was finally' assured that this country would continue to use as its monetary standard the metal which had been the undisputed standard of all the other leading nations for a quarter of a. century. We are confronted to-day with the third great currency problem of the last fifty years. We are looking for the means of improving our banking system so that we may avoid for the future the wide-ranging catastrophes with which American business has been periodically distressed, That is the and through which the respect for this country abroad has been impaired. Having established our standard of value on the world's basis, we are now trying to devise a banking system more worthy of our position in the world and better adapted to further the uninterrupted development of our great resources. It is their wisdom that I ask that we should wait for a little longer, and apply. The Bill is undoubtedly, as the Treasurer mentioned, a Bill to carry on the whole system of banking. Let us inquire what the systems of banking are. I have referred to the money dealing principle, or what is called the scriveners principle, of merely seeking a profit between the rate at which you borrow and the rate at which you lend. That is the trust agency principle; it is the commission business, and it is the principle on which most of our savings banks carry on their operations. This bank is not going to confine itself to that class of business, which is not very profitable. It is going banking. In the little pamphlet which I have mentioned it is stated thatAt first bankers were dealers in capital; mere borrowers and lenders, their profits to the differences and the perfect theory to which the English banks approximate, and which is clearly is a dealer in money, an intermediary between the persons who want to lend and the persons who want to borrow, making his profits out of the differences between the rates at which he borrows and lends. Such men were formerly called money scriveners, but they are not true bankers. What a banker really does is to buy money with his own credit, so that when he takes deposits or discounts bills of exchange, he merely gives in exchange to his customers a sum of money. For this reason Macleod defines a banker as "" a trader whose business it is to buy money and debts by creating other debts."" Commercial banking is profitable for this It is known, as Macleod points out in his",27,Fisher
114,Mr Fenton,"Then the honourable memto be a commercial bank, which is a busi",28,Fisher
115,Mr Glynn,"According to the mostTheory of Credit, that the demands from day to day in connection with current accounts and other liabilities at call are a certain percentage of the total current liabilities. It is considered by him that in London one-tenth of the liabilities would be sufficient to meet the current demands from day to day, so that, if a deposit of £10,000 were made, it would be sufficient to keep £1,000 against it. But the banker does not carry on his operations in that way. What he does is to keep the whole £10,000, and to discount bills to the tune of-much more. He does not necessarily do it to the extent of ten times the £10,000, because, as in insurance, you do not always absolutely balance your risk with the payments, but keep a margin. Instead, then, of discounting £100,000 worth of bills, he discounts perhaps £50,000 or £60,000 worth, and he thus gets a big profit. received £10,000, and on that basis he discounts bills up to eight or even nine times that amount, because he knows that the £10,000 will be sufficient from day to day to meet tlie current demands. This, it is pointed out, is the method of commercial banking which is more or less carried out in Australia. A very large percentage I do not know what it is, because I have not been able to find it out from any bookof the profitable business is that class of commercial banking, and it is practically the whole of banking in England, where, as a rule, they do not invest in "" dead "" securities-o r much even in landed securities. So far, then, as to what we mean, and that is the measure to some .extent of the likelihood of success or failure. Now as to the powers. This commercial banking is a business. Have we the power to do it? Paragraph XJII. of section 51 of the Constitution deals with more than' the incorporation of banks. In America, where the Constitution is silent on the subject, it has quired as an instrumentality of government. been decided that Congress has power to incorporate a bank. that to be so in McCulloch v. Maryland in 1.819. Hamilton foresaw it, because Marshall's judgment was based largely upon the reasoning of that great man Hamilton. What Marshall said in effect was that, so long as the means is necessary and proper, and conducive to the end, and is not expressly or impliedly prohibited by the Constitution, it may be adopted, as an aid to Government, by Congress. The extent of the expediency or desirableness is a matter purely for Congress, and not for the Courts. In his judgment in McCulloch v. Maryland he saidThe choice of means implies a right to choose a National Bank in preference to a State Bank, and Congress alone can make the election. So long as the means is justified-and it must be necessary, and properly conducive to the end, the extent to which it is conducive being a matter for the Legislature' then you may, if you like, adopt that means. In America it was held to be valid to incorporate a bank. Our powers are more express, and, without labouring the subject or presuming to exhaust it, I think we are certainly entitled to establish a State Bank, if it can be shown to have any reasonable connection with the governmental business-that is, if it can be shown to be to any extent an instrumentality of government. I do not mean merely one that is He has indispensable, but even one that is, to some extent, necessary, because a distinction is drawn between what is indispensably necessary and what is necessary and conducive to the end. This proposal, then, may or may not be valid; on the whole, I believe it is. The difficulty all arises from the fact that we are introducing the risky principle of commercial banking, and that, so far as I can see, has nothing to do with the instrumentalities of government. Assuming the Government can show the policy to be sound, my feeling is that they are at perfect liberty to take the risk as to its validity under constitutional law. explicit on the point? tains an express provision, but it is not quite so clear as honourable members think. We may, as in America, incorporate a bank; but the point is whether we can go into the banking business. To do that it may be necessary to show that it is reI do not say that that is so, but it may Marshall declared be; and I suppose the Government have looked into the question. In regard to the management, I do not know what the mind of the Government is; but we have it given nominally by two men or, as one might say, one man in the person of Jhe Governor. Clause 11 provides that the bank shall be managed by the Governor, while clause 12 says that the Governor and the Deputy Governor shall be appointed by the Governor General. Clause 14 provides that the Governor and the Deputy Governor shall respectively have such powers",28,Fisher
116,Mr Fenton,T s our Constitution not,29,Fisher
117,Mr Glynn,"The Constitution conand perform such duties "" as are prescribed by this Act or the regulations."" I am not quite sure what the Deputy Governor is to do. As a rule, a Deputy Governor is a man who represents the Governor when the latter is away for a time. Evidently what the Government mean is .that the Deputy Governor is to be a continuous officer, performing practically idena private member, provides for a very large tical duties with the Governor, but that the final word shall rest with the Governor as chief. vernor be a sort of assistant? do not think that the draftsman knew exactly what he was driving at; and hence my appeal for delay. For instance, the first provision is that the Governor shall be absolutely independent of political interference, and this is followed up by another that he shall hold office "" during good behaviour for a period of seven years."" Our High Court Justices do not hold office in this way. They are not so free from our control; nor would the InterState Commission be, nor is the Auditor General. In the case of the officers 1 have mentioned the term is during good behaviour, but the officials are liable to removal by a vote of both Houses of Parliament, which is practically the tribunal which decides when there is a breach. a different position from that of any other public servant. ence between the two.

I do not wish to say that the position in the Bill is not as good or better; but the Government have, in this measure, expressed the opinion that the Governor should be an officer independent of political control ; the clause means that or nothing. The duties and powers of the Governor and the Deputy Governor are to be as prescribed by the Government over a large area. Thus we have independence in one clause, and, in another, subjection to Ministerial control. I know of no bank in which an official is invested with such powers as those proposed by this Bill. Al l great banks have directorates. The Aldrich Bank Bill, which was drafted, I think, by advisory directorate of forty-five, divided into sub-committees. In Canada there is an expert general manager, but he has associated with him a body of directors to whom he has to furnish periodical reports on the management, for their guidance. Further, every manager is helped by banking opinion as expressed by the Banking Association. In the United States Report, Vol. 36, page 31, we find the following reference to the Canadian system and the necessity for expert knowledge: The general managers are, without exception, men who have been in the banking business since .boyhood. They have worked their way up through all the grades of employment by the force of brains, industry, character, and good health. They know from experience the task of every employee, and they know it is well done. They are, in other words, professional bankers. Untrained outsiders cannot break into the banking business as they do in the United States. This is a matter which it would be just as well for us to consider. In France, for instance, there is a very important body to aid the Governor. The bank's affairs are managed by the Governor, two subGovernors, nominated by the Government, and qualified by shares, fifteen regents, and three expert controllers, or, as they would be called in America, examiners. For this, there is no provision in the Bill before us. We are giving one man tremendous powers and responsibilities; but the Government do not give up their power to interfere with him. Under the circumstances, I do not know what is the Government's idea, because it appears to me that both the ideas I have suggested are open under the Bill. The duties of the Governor and the Deputy Governor are to be such "" as are prescribed by this Act or the regulations."" Clause 64 is as followsThe Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, prescribing all matters which are required or permitted to be prescribed or which are necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act, and in particular for making provision for(a) the issue, inscription, transfer, transmission, and redemption of inscribed stock of the bank, and all matter* incidental thereto.",29,Fisher

That is a very wide power of political control. The honourable memBer for East Sydney mentioned the Auditor-General, whose duties are prescribed by Act. They are laid down definitely there; and I say that the duties of the banker, whether they are to be carried out independently by the Governor and his Deputy, or whether they are to be controlled by the Executive, ought, as far as possible, as a protection to the public against both, to be prescribed in this Bill. But that is not done. There are some other clauses which show what an absence of clearness of conception as to policy seems to have marked the draftsmanship of this measure. find, for instance, in clause 34, that the bank may invest any moneys held by itIn any Government security approved by the Treasurer, or on loan and on the security of landThere is no direction from the Treasury there.

We do not know really what the Ministry want, but they may mean that they want political control. While over a considerable area of banking operations they would have it under the B ill , for some purposes they would not have it.

It is proposed to adopt for the purpose of this Bill provisions which the evolution of the existing Savings Banks systems has shown to be necessary for efficient management. As regards the existing Savings Banks, I say that it can be shown that they are sound, and meet all the reasonable requirements of the public. Taking them as a whole, they are sound. It is said that we require uniformity. I do not know what that means. What virtue is there in uniformity of management throughout Australia? Perhaps the uniformity mentioned may be the possibility of drawing in. one State moneys deposited in another. uniformity was the cause of failure in the American system. sent under the existing Savings Banks system. It is possible by arrangement, and even by telegraph, to make deposits in Victoria to be paid in South Australia. to pay for it. has to be paid for. Of course, a bank must be paid for its services. We shall by this competition be killing the mutual system of banking. We are going to compete with that which is not based upon profit, by introducing the principle of profitable Savings Banks, and to render the profits of the Savings Banks that are already in existence liable for the mistakes made by the Commonwealth Bank which it is proposed to establish under this Bill. I wonder did the public of Australia know enough about that before they gave this alleged mandate to the Government to deal with phrases that were never explained to them on the hustings ? Not only that, but a sphere of local government is a great safeguard of efficient management. loans are sought within a particular State, a knowledge of the industries and conditions which obtain in that State is much more likely to be possessed by men who reside there than it is by a one-man government sitting in Yass-Canberra, which may have to determine the rate of advance on certain securities away in the north of Australia. America, not merely commercial, but constitutional experts, as well as English authorities, have lately uttered a warning note against this tendency towards centralization. I would refer honourable members to the recent work of Professor Koyce on The Philosophy of Loyalty, in which he says that what we really want to develop is a healthy provincialism in these matters. I would also refer them to the works of Professor Maitland, whose collected papers have recently been issued, in which he points out that we do want centres of local industrial government, as well as of parliamentary government, for effective business management, as well as effective Government control. The Athenaeum, in writ' ing upon this question, points out that such centres are the very essence of effectiveness and liberty, and that if we are not cautious we may fail, as Rome did, from excessive centralization. In my opinion, the Bill is, if I may alter a hackneyed phrase, a step in the wrong direction. I have already mentioned that . the profits of the existing Savings Banks may be drawn upon to make good the losses incurred by the proposed Commonwealth Bank, if it sustains any. The Treasurer mentioned that in America there is a very limited field for the Savings Banks. His statement is not quite correct. This is what an article in the American Academy, page 640, saysProbably, comparatively few of the readers of this newspaper realize the immense amount of money deposited in the Savings Banks of the United States. In addition to the institutions which are known as Savings Banks, a vast amount .of money is undoubtedly held by national and State banks in States where the mutual Savings Banks are unknown. In Massachusetts alone there are about 180 Savings Banks, all of which are conducted upon the mutual principle. T. am aware that last year Congress passed an Act for the establishment of a Post Office Savings Bank. But that is not a Savings Bank in the ordinary sense of the term. The Prime Minister kindly handed me a copy of The Times, which makes referIf ence to this matter.

However, the Commonwealth Bank has to start with a capital of £1,000,000. I think that it wants to draw its funds from the small investor, who at present deals with the Savings Bank, because the Savings Banks have nearly £55,000,000, according to my return, which was made up to September of this year. All the Savings Banks, I think, use the post-office agencies, but they are not to have the use of them in the future, I understand. thought it would be difficult for the two to work in the same building. Prime Minister knows his mind in this matter. orable member does know his mind, and has expressed it, he means to take away these agencies. Let us see what he said last week. One of the recommendations for his Savings Bank principle is thisThe Commonwealth will have an advantage over all the States inasmuch as it has postal buildings where Savings Bank business can be carried on. How can the Commonwealth have that advantage unless it is taken away from the States? As regards all Australia, accordhis-33 6 in every 1,000 of the population have deposits in the Savings Banks. In the case of South Australia, according to him, the number is 482. I ask : Are we justified in interfering with a success such as that, and risking a loss in rates and conings Bank business either on the part of veniences of the State mutual institutions? I do not think that we are. That affects over a third of the population of Australia, and very nearly 50 per cent, of the population of South Australia. As regards the cost of management, is there anything to complain of? The cost of management in South Australia is 6s. 4jd. per cent.; in New South Wales it is ios. 3d. per cent., which is the highest rate, and, strange to say, it occurs in the case of The Savings Bank, which is most under Government management. institutions in New South Wales? Savings Bank of New South Wales costs ios. 3d. per cent, for management, while the Savings Bank of New South Wales costs only 7s. id , per cent. The private 1 management shows the better result. In South Australia the Savings Bank was managed, until a few years ago, when they brought in some political interference, which was quite uncalled for, on private lines, on the voluntary principle, as in most of the successful cases in America, by private individuals, without fee or reward. Latterly we have appointed men on the Board at a salary of £100 a year. But .1 do not understand that it has made any difference to the results beneficially. The bank is still a sound one; the proposed interference was never called for. appointing these men? there was a screw loose somewhere. loose. One of the great facts shown by the South Australian Commission in 1889 was that the Savings Bank, unaided by the Government, conducted its business absolutely well. It never had a real loss. It had a property left on its hands. I forget the value of the property, but the bank got rid of it eventually. was the capital provided? I think that in 1857 a guarantee for ,£50,000 was given by the Government, though it was never called up. As regards mixing the two things up together, I wish to refer honourable members to the experience of America. There, in some States, they will not allow the mixing up of SavGovernment banks, or on the part of trust companies, which do general banking. The reports are against it. The laws in some of the States are against it. Owing to the experience of Massachusetts in this matter-the small investor being hit by blunders in relation to the large investor -it has a law to prevent it. Here is what a writer on that law says in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science for last DecemberSegregation is, and probably will be for a long time, unpopular with the trust company or national bank man, the great majority of them looking upon it with distrust. I feel, however, had they viewed it rightly five years ago, that they would not have had the Postal Savings Bank forced upon them. I firmly believe, as was expressed in a recommendation",35,Fisher

The ties as experience has shown to be amply safe, and that such investments should be held for the special benefit of the savings depositors. The profits in these Savings Banks are necessarily small. I shall take the experience of South Australia on that point, because that is tlie only case in which I have up to-date returns. Out of a total investment of £7,333,231, the amount on mortgage loans was only £1,630,362. Now, see the significance of that. Landed security gives the best results, and what are these trustees of the small earnings of the men of moderate means obliged to do? Owing to the lack-in the present state of ' development -of solid investments in land throughout AustraliaI mean investments which they ought to take if they safeguard the interests of their depositors-the y are not able to place the whole of their money on loan. They can place only £1,630,362 out of a total sum of £7,333> 3 2 I The rest is at a lower rate of interest, on Government or corporation securities, or fixed deposits of the banks. Has the Government looked into the matter from the point of view of the opening that there is for a bank which is to be a borrower and a lender of borrowed moneys? The sphere is limited. The trust companies will tell you the same thing. There is a glut of capital seeking legitimate investment here. The Board of Trade, about twelve months ago, published a statement of the amount of our total indebtedness found by local lenders, compared with the amount ten years previously, which shows a large increase of local lending, and an increase in the money seeking investment. The difficulty is not to get money. Any one who has security, such as that of the Commonwealth, can get money; the difficulty is to do business, profitable business, with it. Some honourable members seem to think that a bank must succeed if it gets money, but it will succeed only if it can place its money in good and remunerative investments. The worse thing that could befall a Government bank would be to have money and be unable to find securities on safe lines. We have a plethora of capital at present, and the tendency hereafter may lie to place it in doubtful investments to get a result. What else does political management mean ? The money lent to the bank must be got out. be worse management than that of the banks prior to 1893. banks since then have profited through their purgation. The point I am now making is that there is no real scope for a Commonwealth bank as regards landed investments. If such an institution is to succeed, experience and a thorough knowledge of the complexities of commercial life are necessary in its management. To complete the last of my quotationsI can conceive no better advertisement for Savings Banks than that the poor people's money is safe any way regardless of what might happen to the bank. The advice is to keep the funds of a Savings Bank clear from the funds of a general bank. may have it in his mind, but it is not expressed in the Bill.

I said that it is not in the Bill. in the Bill. deposit rate is 3J per cent, for two years.; Does that show a very great opening for a new bank? I find that the percentage of advances Ito total deposits is declining, being, in 1901, 102.43; and in 1910, 74.74. A bank does not want large deposits unless it can place them remuneratively. The advances of the banks have shrunk, while the deposits have increased, because the money cannot be placed in the safest classes of investment. The position is quite sound, but our development has not taken place at the rate necessary to make further advances safe. Again, in 1889, there were twenty-nine banks, and now there are only twenty-two, some having had to close down or to amalgamate in consequence of the smash of 1893. If banking were very profitable, there would not be fewer banks now than in 1889. Further, the profits are only moderate in proportion to the risks. The Prime Minister picked out",36,Fisher

On their combined capital and reserves, they return only 9 per cent., though I shall not enter into a discussion as to whether the percentage should be taken on the paid-up capital or on the reserves. Probably both should be considered. If instead of taking four leading banks, you take all the banks, the percentage on the paid-up capital shrinks to 7.74. and according to an article in the Argus of n t h of last month, taking into account the reserves, to £ 5 7s. 7d. per cent., which is not a large profit for a risky business. Furthermore, one of the banks referred to in the tables cited by the Treasurer is the Bank of Western Australia, which makes a profit of 20 per cent, on a paid-up capital of only £175,000. Thus an analysis of the figures does not support the contention that banking is very profitable. It must be remembered, too, that one of the leading banks mentioned by the Prime Minister was established as far back as 1817, and, in banking, as in everything else, prosperity grows. I find that, according to the financial Review of last mail, the average dividend paid in 1910 by forty-six of the leading banks of the United Kingdom was 14^ per cent. That profit was made in commercial banking, pure and simple. We have in Australia nearly five times the banking facilities that exist in the United Kingdom. The actual figures are given by Knibbs. Another point to be remembered in considering the question of profits is that these dividends of 16 per cent, in the case of four banks, and of 9 per cent, in the case of others, have been declared in times of exceptional prosperity when we are on the very crest of the wave of industrial progress. JButi f we go back to the years succeeding the banking failures we find that the 16 per cent becomes 4.4 per cent, in 1894, 3 per cent, in 1895, 8 per 2 I c e n t i 1896, and so on. n These figures show how necessary it is to secure an average in respect of, not only all the banks, but of a decade if we are to have a comparison upon which we may rely. so deep in the mud again. any danger, but solvency does not touch The Reichsbank of Germany is a central the question of profits. Very often when the profits of a bank are large the bank itself is very shaky. were large before the "" smash."" of loan money had been spent in Victoria alone within a few years, and that expenditure was followed by a land boom which caused the banks, like many other bodies, to speculate. But, as I said, they have had their purgation. I have no interest in the banks, save that I am a very small shareholder in one, but I venture to say,. from my own reading, that the banks of Australia are in as sound a position as that of any of the banks of Europe. Let us look at their position. If they still had a note issue, and it amounted to £8,500,000, their investments in convertible lands, municipal securities, and government securities alone, apart from other assets, would be sufficient to meet the whole demands of that note issue. Their note issue was a charge upon all their assets which amounted last year to £139,000,000, or £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in excess of their liabilities. Let us look now at their power to meet demands at call. The coin and bullion, held by twenty of the typical banks on the Continent is about 54 per cent, of the liabilities at call; our percentage is over 51 per cent., and, in America, it was something like 7 per cent., or 8 per cent., in 1906. In these circumstances where is the danger herewhere is the necessity for Government interference? I do not know what will be the effect on the banks of divorcing from the functions of their business the function of issue. Their liabilities at call, in 1910, amounted to ^£58,982,000, and their coin and bullion to ,£30,149,000, or 51.12 per cent. We are now taking away their issue, and to what extent we shall affect the bullion basis for deposits, which is part of our currency, I do not wish at present to estimate. We should not have experimented in that direction in view of our perfect system of banking, and the fact that the result may be, as it will be ultimately, the transfer of the profits from the States to the Commonwealth. I do not know what the Government mean by a central bank. Unless the term is explained it has no'importance. I have endeavoured are the directors which control, as our bank",37,Fisher

I would point out to the Prime Minister that, to the extent to which the Government has interfered in Germany, it has, in a sense, failed. A Committee last year presented a report in which it was pointed out that all their management does not always secure sufficient gold for their operations. It is unsafe to think that we politicians have all the wisdom of the universe. issue is, I think, so high as to be a penal impost. amount; but they do tax the issue beyond a certain amount. That scheme, however, is not perfectly effective, because the German Banking Commission reported last year upon the irregularity with which gold goes in and out in proportion to the demand. However, the Reichsbank is not a State bank. It is stated by a writer that it was decided that the Empire should not put any capital into the enterprise. We have that statement, I think, in the report of the United States Commission. It is a central bank of issue only. As I have pointed out, the Canadian banks have an association, and the merit of that system is, not that it brings about a central bank, such as has been mentioned, but that it affords a joint security and joint advance. The American Annals states that if a Canadian bank fails to meet any liability as it arises, it -forfeits the right of independent management, and it is taken charge of by a curator appointed by the Canadian Bankers' Association. The Bank of Montreal is the central bank, and it occupies that position simply because it does the biggest business, its volume of business being about 20 per cent, of the total of all the other banks. It is the depository of the Government funds, and amongst the people is commonly referred to as a Government bank. I do not know what this Government means by "" central bank,"" because we are not to have a central bank of issue. Issue is to be divorced from it. We need more information. What are the average Government balances, and of what use are they to the banks?

He proposes, I think, to validate or copy the private banking association which was established in America in 1907, to have one central bank of issue, and to establish some method of having bigger reserves, or of interchange of reserves between the banks. As I mentioned at the beginning, at the smash in 1907 there were plenty of reserves to meet all liabilities; but, there being an independence of banking, the reserves of one bank could not be used to meet the necessities of another; and England, Germany, and France came to the rescue, where isolated banking was ineffective to attain the same result. In that sense, Aldrich suggests a central bank, which, however, another writer regards as a public curse. I can refer the honourable member for Maribyrnong to another writer, who says that the central institutions must be ineffective in management, if they cover a wide or Continental field, and that they are a step back in efficiency by an abandonment of local government. struck me hi connection with this measure: That the bank is an experiment without precedent in general banking. Of course, that is not final; but when it is without prethe line of argument he has taken up, becedent, there ought to be conclusive reasons before it should be established. The management is in the hands of one man without conditions, subject only to political control. There is no provision for expert inspection or examination, the functions of the Auditor-General being essentially different from inspection. To make substantial profits you must succeed in commercial banking; otherwise the bank will be simply a mere money-dealer or investment agency. The bank is"" not required, as banking is not a monopoly, and the present facilities seem to be more than adequate. So far as it affects the Savings Banks, the public may suffer, and must suffer, so far as the mutual principle is beaten in competition. The uniformity aimed atI do not know what its limits are-is not required, because reciprocity in recent years has been established between the eight Savings Banks of the Commonwealth. funds are in the name of one man, and so is a very large part of the policy, even, it may be, in connection with redemption. If bad seasons come, there may be loose investments, and the Government may be pressed or tempted to abate business demands. I could cite examples in recent years of that; but I have said sufficient upon the point by merely suggesting it. These are some considerations, not all, that struck me. AllI would say to the Prime Minister in conclusion is this: I have endeavoured to help in the matter. 1 have put with the force of personal conviction some points. My whole desire is to point out that there is a danger in risking profitable commercial banking; that there is not a very substantial opening for the other; and that there is a very serious danger to about one-third of the population through the possible defeat of the Savings Banks in the competition that is opened up. If the bank is established, I hope it will be a success. I am not against it on any abstract principle of the limits of State interference. The question to me is one of power, common sense, and expediency. If I have, to any extent, helped honourable members to grasp the conditions of the problem, I shall be rewarded for the excess of trespass which I may have committed upon their attention. These are the points that -We are, I think, indebted to the honourable member for Angas for giving us a great amount of valuable information upon the subject which we are debating this afternoon. I am not at all surprised at cause many years ago, in another place, he held very similar opinions, and does not seem to have altered them in many directions. He never was in favour of the State banks, and he does not seem so to-day. In fact, the whole tenor of his remarks seemed to be that he has some hesitancy or doubt about the proposal, but that, after all is said and done, it is very possible that the Government policy might be right. I contend that the Government policy in this matter is right. I am not going to say that in a great and important subject like this there may not be matters of detail upon which it would not he just as well for the Government to modify their ideas.

I look upon the suggestion that we should turn our attention to America with regard to banking as simply a monstrosity. The Americans never have tried to understand banking since the days of Hamilton. There is no doubt that Hamilton and those who agreed with him were on sound lines, and it would have been a happy day for our American cousins if they had decided to continue on the lines laid down by that great statesman. England with Hamilton's bank, and you will find, as you will always find with statesmen all the world over, that Hamilton was building on a plan that he saw in England, but varying it according to the requirements of his own country. It does not require any explanation for honourable members to grasp the reason why the Americans did not want Hamilton's system of banking. world's banker. so? That is the position with regard to America-the land of enterprise, the' land of freedom, where roguery and enterprise are so close to one another that you cannot separate them. Is it at all likely that in that country they would be very anxious for a State bank, or any institution of that there is necessity for a National Australian character? They never wanted it, and do not want it to-day. There may be a strong section of the American people who want banking placed on a sound footing, the proof of which -lies .in the fact that the Congress Savings Bank has been ratified by the people. They had confidence in the Congress Bank, which gave them the guarantee of the American Union behind their money, and so they brought along their savings. lower rate of interest. therefore take no notice of the American authorities, or American wisdom, or antiwisdom, in regard to banking, because they are out of the question altogether. There is, therefore, no necessity for us to go upon American lines. ever, that Canada and Canadian experience does count. banking is a good and sound one, and has been shown to be a great success; and any country might do worse than follow its example. I hold that we are going on better lines. What do we all believe in? This may be looked upon as a party question. There are those who hold the opinion that I have held for thirty yearsI have not just now awakened to the discovery. This is a policy I have advocated in season and out of season in another place; and a State Bank of a limited character in South Australia is the result, somewhat, of an agitation of myself and others.. We have built up a National Governmenf for Australia; and, while we may differ on lines of policy, we are all working for the Compare the Bank of best interests of the Australian. If ever there was a day it is now, when the Australian nation is ten years old, that we should establish a National bank, which, in. days to come, will do for Australia what the Bank of England has done for the Mother Country. I do not think that the proposed Commonwealth Bank is going to kill all the banks in the Commonwealth, because I fancy it will have a pretty '' hard row to hoe.'' It cannot be supposed that the present banks will treat the Commonwealth Bank with loving-kindness and generosity, but, rather, on the other hand, that they will do their best to ""hammer"" it.

It could not be started in better times than to-day, when a wave of prosperity is passing over us.

Let us look at the history of such institutions, and see if there is any reason why we should not act on precedent, always, of course, considering our varied conditions. What is a bank? had several definitions; but I have always understood that a bank is a dealer in credit. In the Roman, Greek, Assyrian, and other ancient civilizations, the banking business was as efficiently managed as it is to-day amongst ourselves; wherever there is trade and commerce, the ingenuity of man is equal to the occasion. In olden days, in London, a man deposited his gold with the goldsmiths, and on their certificate he traded. The first bank, which was practically a State bank, did all that we desire the Commonwealth institution to do. That was the Bank of Venice, which issued certificates in the same way as did the gold-. smiths of London. I dare say, if we could ascertain the true cause of its failure, it would prove to be that the bank was not conducted on sound banking lines. There are certain principles in banking which have to be followed, and which, if followed, are bound to lead to success. did regular banking business, as we understand if. say that the Bank of Venice did the up-todate banking business that we have been talking about this afternoon, but it is recognised as one of the historical banks. nature was quite different from our banks. tion was the Bank' of Genoa; in fact, that bank did the very business we do in modern times. We know the history of the failure of that bank. It advanced tremendous sums of money to Philip II . of Spain, and his failure to repay burst up .the institution. We hear a great deal now about political inCommonfluence and political control, but there was then neither. An ancient maxim of banking was, "" Never have anything to do with the King, or his paper, when he is on the war rampage."" The Bank of Amsterdam followed on the same lines, we might say, as did the Bank of England. The latter I am not averse to that, was started by two sections of the community. There were the merchants of the I have no quarrel City of London, who saw the necessity of creating a bank similar to those ancient institutions to which I have referred. The Bank of England was started by Non-conformists of the city at an opportune time, because the Revolution took place in 1688, and it was impossible, for obvious reasons, to conduct a bank when the Stuarts were on the throne. Montagu was very anxious, for the purpose of carrying on wars and We have financing Government business, that the Crown should give to the promoters of the Bank certain concessions in return for which they were to make certain advances. When we are told that the Bank of England is not a State Bank, but a privately^owned institution, I ask, Why? Because in 1688 it could not have been started on other lines. I am quite willing to recognise that even to-day there are certain varieties of enterprise that may well be left in private hands. But to argue that,. because the Bank of England 200 years ago was built on such lines, therefore the Commonwealth of Australia in this age must build on no other, is neither logic nor common sense, nor does it pay any heed to the teachings of history. 1 There is no need for us to copy the structure of the Bank of England in any respect, though we can copy it when we consider it to be advantageous to do so. It will probably be said that the Commonwealth Bank will have very little business to do. I do not care. I do not care if it does less business than any bank in Australia for the next twenty years. Buti t I do not mean to will grow. It will become the biggest banking business in Australia. The circumstances of the times are tending in that direction. I should like honourable members opposite to tell me why it is impossible but its that the Commonwealth Bank should succeed? Let them, with their learning and their great logical keenness, answer the argument that I am putting. Why can we not build a bank for Australia on the lines of the Bank of England, as far as stability is concerned? There is no reason that I can see why we should not.

Consequently, I cannot see any force in the argument of my honourable friend that a danger is to be apprehended from interfering with the Savings Bank in the direction to which I have referred. To my mind, it is not a bad thing that the National Government should have command of the savings of the people. strongly held that view; and I am speaking now as a depositor in the Savings Bank. To me it does not matter two straws what becomes of my money, so long as I am paid interest upon it , and can withdraw it when I need it. The guarantee of the Crown insures me that position. If the Government can . utilize the Savings Bank deposits for national purposes, I have no objection to their doing so, and I would not tie their hands. There is an historical incident in this connection which is worth stone, England's great commoner, established the Post Office Savings Bank in Great Britain. Since then that institution has grown, until to-day the masses of the people have many millions sterling deposited in it . Now the world has beaten a big drum, and journalists, when hard up for a job, have written leading articles with a view to showing what a great financier was Mr Goschen. In fact, I wonder that they have not erected a monument to his memory for the marvellous feat he performed in connection with the conversion of British consols. They forget that he was enabled to do what he did because Mr Gladstone had established the Savings Bank. Had there been a general demand made for money at that time, it was the funds of the Savings Bank which would have met it. It was the knowledge of the existence of that reserve which caused the holders of British consols to take them up on the conditions which were imposed by Mr Goschen. That circumstance should afford an object-lesson to all public men, and to every Chancellor of the Exchequer, and every Treasurer. They must recognise that a time may arrive when it may be necessary to renew great financial obligations, and that at such a time the existence of a bank of this character will prove of great value. Honourable members opposite may not relish the idea of the savings of the people being dealt with in that manner. But what objection can be urged to it, apart from a lot of abstract speculations that the money could be better utilized in other directions? It is not a difficult matter to ascertain who are in favour of establishing a National Savings Bank. If we do not adopt the course which I have suggested, we shall be shirking our obligations. The portion of the Bill which relates to this phase of the matter is, to my-mind, a very good one. In Committee we may be called upon to decide whether only a portion of the funds I have always of the bank shall be used for the purpose of making advances on real estate. I have heard that some States of the Commonwealth are utilizing the savings of the people for the ordinary purposes of government. I do not know whether the statement is true; but if it be I doubt the soundness of the judgment of those who are responsible for such a course of action. The savings of the people have been of great service to the Mother Country, and can be made of great service to the Commonwealth Government under proper safeguards. Another point to which I desire to direct attention has reference to the relation of the proposed Commonwealth Bank to the Associated Banks. I think it would be a good plan if the former were to work in co-operation with the latter. I have previously pointed out that probably there will be an attempt on the part of the Associated Banks to give the Commonwealth Bank a bad time. I shall not quarrel with them for so doing, because I recognise the law of competition. Bankers are not persons who go about preaching. They are shrewd business men, who cannot have any love for a rival which enters the banking field. But that fact should not prevent us from co-operating with them as far as possible, because I believe that when the Commonwealth Bank becomes strong, it will be of great value to the Associated Banks during bad times. Let us go back to a page in modern history-to the banking crisis of 1893-whe n a large number of our financial institutions were tumbling about our ears. Some of them weathered the storm; but thousands of our best Australians lost their money, and went down the hill through no fault of their own. again. was a calamity, and this Parliament will not be worth its salt if it does not endeavour to prevent a repetition of such an occurrence.

Australian banks as a body, I have a very great respect for them. they are a very able, honourable, and upright lot of men I wish that I could say the same thing about the directors of those institutions. that if the history of these banks during the past thirty years were known, it would be found that the trouble which befell them was not due to their management so much as to their directorates. We have heard a good deal in regard to the evils which will follow the establishment of the proposed Commonwealth Bank. well from history that if the directors of banks themselves did not get big advances on very flimsy securities, those who were asother States, as it might have been, it sociated with them did, and that accounted for much of the trouble that occurred. I do not believe that the bank managers of Australia were to blame for the crisis of 1893. parent. In a crisis we do not want to have I am speaking now on the authority of a retired bank manager, who had great experience, and who has passed away since he spoke to me on the subject. I told him on one occasion that I did not think very much of the judgment which was exercised in regard to the advances which were made bald, it was not the fault of the Australian managers. The money came out from London, with instructions that we had to get it out. When protests were sent from here that the banks could not get out the money on safe lines, the managers were led to understand from London that if they could not get it out they must go."" Practically, they were told that they would be superseded if they could not carry out the instructions from London -It is a matter of history that a tremendous amount was sent to Australia and advanced, but the people in England got frightened, and decided to withdraw it. .We know what resulted from the withdrawal. I had every reason to believe the statement of the retired banker, because he had had every opportunity of knowing the facts. inner circles in Australia for about thirty years, and knew just as much of the game as any of the bank managers whom we had at the time. That accounts very largely for another of the causes which brought about the crisis in 1893. We all remember how, UT. Archibald. in Victoria and other States, the money was practically forced out in all directions. If that was the system on which banking was carried on in Australia, it could only work out in one way. A bank of the But taking the managers of the character which it is proposed to build up would have a steadying influence in the I believe that event of any crisis occurring, in that manner. What we really want in a time of crisis is a steady and cool head. If there is one man who saved thousands of famiI have a strong suspicion lies from ruin, and exerted a tremendous influence in steadying the crisis of 1893, it was the Premier of New South Wales, who, in addition to being a statesman, was a banker. The very fact that Sir George Dibbs proclaimed as legal tender the bank notes issued in New South Wales practically put those notes on a level with the notes We know pretty of the Bank of England. His act saved the credit of New South Wales, and if his example had been followed in some of the would have materially saved the credit of those States, and done a great deal to avert the crash which took place. The necessity of having a steadying influence must be apto go to the Governments. The more we leave the Governments alone in these matters the better it will be. was not a banker. made a mistake. But it does not matter very much what occupation Sir George Dibbs followed. All that he is worth in the argument is that, as Premier of New South Wales, he had the sagacity and the foresight to discern the best thing which could be done, and did it, to the benefit of the State. My complaint at that time against other statesmen in Australia was that, if they had taken similar action, much of the ruin which fell on many Australians would not have occurred. The object of my reference to Sir George Dibbs is not so much to recapitulate a chapter in modern history, but to bring home to the House the steadying influence which his act had. A Commonwealth Bank, having a steadying influence, would do similar good He had been in the work if the necessity should arise, and the chances are that it will.

263,Mr Archibald,"Then I haveby what is technically called "" overproduction."" When trade is brisk, business men and manufacturers see great opportunities of improving their positions and extending their trade. Credit is given, and presently the bankers begin to realize that they have given over-credit, and that there is a necessity for all concerned to be careful. bankers begin to feel; there is a danger signal ahead, and they decide to draw in and notify that bank advances in the future will have to be of a very different character. That is generally the start of a panic. There may be other contributing causes, but panics have occurred over and over again, and are likely to recur. That is one of the reasons why we should be on our guard to have a steadying influence in the community to deal with a panic when it occurs. I do not worry very much about newspapers, but I noticed in a newspaper to-day a statement which, perhaps, it is worthwhile to refer to, as it may be mentioned in the debate. I believe that it would be an advantage if a bank of this character were associated with other banks. There is a good deal in the idea of the National bank associating with other banks, and having a steadying influence in the community. But I am not prepared to recommend to the House and the country that if the banks were tumbling down, as they did a. few years ago, the National bank should come to the assistance of all of them. That would be a very bad doctrine to adopt. What would it mean? The banks could practically go in for all sorts of reckless business if they knew that, in a crisis, they would only need to appeal to the Governor of the National bank to come to their assistance. There is no doubt that with a bank guaranteed by the Crown, and having the full power of the Commonwealth behind it, this Parliament would never allow a panic to do a very great injury in this community. The National bank could be of assistance to a bank which had been conducted on sound business lines, and found itself subjected to a rush and a panic. But that is a very different thing altogether from the proposition that, given a National bank associated with other banks, we should carry all the broken-down cripples we could find. If that is the idea entertained outside the House, I certainly do not think that it will have very much weight here. It is only worth mentioning to point out the utter fallacy of the proposition, not that I would assume for a moment that any honourable member would entertain an idea of that character. For the reasons I have given I do not think that we should do very much harm by establishing a. National bank. Its management will, I think, call for a great deal of serious consideration. Something occurs which the management. provides that the bank shall be managed by a Governor and a Deputy Governor. It is not well to dogmatize regarding the details of the measure, which ought to be thoroughly thrashed out; but there is a good deal to be said for having the management of the bank in the hands of one man. There is, however, a danger in this course. Infinance,as in other affiairs, there are men who possess great ability, and a very sound judgment on the average; but occasions might occur when, if left entirely to himself, the manager of this bank might make a grave error of judgment; while, were he able ,to consult with one or two others as able as himself, the chances are that things would be looked at from different points of view, and sounder results and greater security would be obtained. Therefore, unless strong arguments be advanced to the contrary, I shall support tlie government of the bank by a Board of three. Whoever is appointed manager must be paid on what I call union principles, that is, according to the standard rate of wages. For bank managers, as for boilermakers, the standard rate of wages should be paid; and if £2,000 or £3,000'a year is what a manager of a private bank is receiving, we should pay our manager as much. Indeed, we could not get a good man for less. I do not believe in cheap brain labour, any more than in cheap manual labour. What is spent in salaries to managers means little, because thousands of pounds can be made or lost by good or bad management. As to the objection that the bank will be politically controlled, that does not amount to much. The Bank of England is politically controlled, though the British Government have nothing to do with its management. The bank's charter may be suspended by the British Government, and the bank authorized to issue as many bank-notes as the Chancellor of the Exchequer may give authority for. But there is no interference by the Government with the control of the bank. Of course, it cannot be doubted that matters are discussed, and that the Government know",46,Fisher

Whilst investors in banking companies have been doing remarkably well, there has been no corresponding increase in the prosperity of their employees. If bank clerks feel that they are too superior to come within the purview of the Court, well and good; but no harm can be done by giving them the right to approach the Court, so that they may exercise it if they desire to do so. The Court' fixes a minimum wage, and it would have power to review from time to time the improved conditions of banking and the general prosperity of the country, as well as the fact that the salaries of the managers increase, whilst there is a tendency to decrease the salaries of those on the lower rungs of the ladder. That is the present position, and I do not think we should prevent bank employees from obtaining an award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. public servants will be paid so well that they will not want to go to the Court. to drive them before the Court. All that we propose to say is, in effect, "" If you have a grievance, take it to the Court; do not bother us with it. If you can satisfy the Court that your labour is worth more than you are receiving, then we are prepared to be bound by whatever award the Court may make."" There is nothing derogatory to any man in going to the Court in an honest way, so long as he is ready to be bound by the award which the Court gives. In that respect, therefore, I cannot agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Angas. In conclusion, 1 wish to emphasize one or two points to which I referred before. I do not expect honourable members on the other side to agree with me, but whatever may be the fate of this Bill, we shall be none the worse, and I do not think Australia will be any the worse for having a good debate on its merits. We all recognise that one of the best banks in the world-if not the bestis the.Bank of England. We are still creatl>3] ing a system of national government for Australia, and I put it to honourable members : What is there to prevent us from seeking not for the advantage which we may gain to-day, or six months, or ten, or even twenty years hence, but so that it may become a bulwark and strength to the nation of Australia long after we have passed away ? We should follow the lines of the Bank of England as closely as we can, because the closer we keep to it, so far as our existing conditions of industrialism and capitalism permit, the better. We cannot find a safer guide in regard to financial matters. Let us give our bank the note issue, and give it power to do all that the Bank of England has done. It is worth something to us to attempt this, and the Parliament that creates a bank of that character will have done much for Australia. I admit that the press, and the average member of the Australian public outside, will say, "" Oh, yes, they are wasting their ""time there; they are not doing much; they are just referring to the question of a State Bank."" That is very true, and it is possible that when the Bank of England was founded there were men who said the same thing. In fact, we know that there were men who said that Parliament was wasting its time, that Montague was wasting his time, and that the merchants of Grocer's Hill were wasting their time; but look at the result. It is . worth our while, then, to consider this proposal carefully. I hope that if any fair and reasonable proposition is made to bring the bank on to the lines I have indicated, the Government will be prepared to entertain it, so that this Bill may become an Act which will redound to the credit and honour of the National Parliament of Australia. The honourable member for Hindmarsh began by saying that the honourable member .for Angas had, all through his speech, been expressing doubt and hesitation, and was not sure of anything that he put forward. In approaching this subject, I should like to say at the outset that the deeper we go into it the more we read about it, and the more we study it, the more doubtful we shall be. I feel convinced that it is the one subject above all others in regard to which we should hasten slowly, and be sure of our ground in every possible way before we take any definite step. Into the great field of credit, of which banking is the living expression, it is impossible to. thrust",48,Fisher

272,Mr Greene (Richmond) [8.39],"any system which is antagonistic' to the scientific principles upon which credit rests, without the most disastrous effects. WhilstI think, with the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that it is possible in Australia to build up a great bank, which shall be part of a wide scheme embracing the whole of the financial relationships of the Commonwealth, I do not believe that the project which the Government have put forward will accomplish what the honourable member desires. starting on the establishment of a National bank-if the need for such a bank can be clearly demonstrated-that, lished, it will commend itself to the financial authorities of the world. not, it will not answer the purposes for which the honourable member for Hindmarsh desires it to be set up. BeforeI deal with the bank itself, I should like to refer to the Commonwealth Savings Bank which it is proposed by the Government to start. Prime Minister, when introducing the B ill , endeavoured to show that the first advantage therefrom would be the securing of uniformity throughout Australia. I do not see where the advantage of uniformity comes in . I cannot understand how it would be of any benefit to a man in Western Australia to pay into a bank which he knew was conducted on exactly similar lines to a Savings Bank in Queensland. When it comes to the matter ' of exchange, which some honourable members mentioned to-day, it must be remembered that, after all is said and done, the working expenses of these institutions have to be met. Exchange is one of those very reasonable means to this end which banks, and even Governments, have adopted. The Commonwealth adopts it to-day in regard to money orders and postal notes, charging a small amount for transacting the business and facilitating the obtaining of money at the other end. After all, exchange is a reasonable payment for services rendered. cash a cheque in Melbourne I do not like to pay rs. exchange upon it, and would rather not. remember the service rendered, it is only fair that we should pay for it. on a note. . pends.

At present the banks do not charge' exchange on notes; but when they did there had to be a minimum, so that the charge had to be 6d. on either a £ i o n o te or a _£i-note. The Prime Minister seemed to indicate, though he did not state so very distinctly, that, in his opinion, a Commonwealth Savings Bank would afford the possibility of higher interest. In the Savings Banks of Australia at present there are 1,483,573 We should be very sure, in depositorsa large number, considering that our population is only 4,500,000-and at the end of 1910 the total amount to their when estabcredit was £53>ri7>49 8 Mr W.

The Prime Minister seemed to The suggest that, with one Savings Bank for the whole Commonwealth, there would be sufficient economy in the management to enable the payment of higher interest. I have calculated that an additional \ per cent, would necessitate a saving of £ 1 3 2 , 7 9 2 ; an addition of & per cent, would necessitate a saving of £ 6 6 , 3 9 6 ; and an additional i i 6 th per cent, would necessitate a saving of £ 3 3 , 1 9 8 . We can, therefore, I think, dismiss altogether the idea that, by any saving in the management, it will be possible to pay the depositors a higher rate of interest. The honourable member for Hindmarsh expressed the hope that, if the Savings Bank grows, the whole of the moneys deposited will eventually be employed by the Government. That, in my opinion, would be very dangerous, and for several reasons. The principal reason is that the assets of the bank will not be sufficiently liquid to enable the Government to realize, in the event of their so desiring, a large sum of money at any particular time.

I pass on from that, however, to what the Prime Minister said when he was introducing the Billa passage which, I believe, gives the real reason for the proposed Commonwealth Savings Bank. The Prime Minister carefully refrained from telling us what the reason is, though I think it is disclosed in the following sentence of his speech: It will probably have a common stock; But it looks like it. I venture to say, howand in course of time, as the bank develops, ever, that in a great country like Australia, interest-bearing debentures or bonds of every with an enormous amount of development kind will probably be available in every part in front of it, we should endeavour in all of the Commonwealth. I read that sentence very carefully a good before me a volume of the writings of many times, and I am not sure now that I Hamilton, containing a passage written know what it means. Minister knew what was in his mind at the time. It seems to me that he had an idea that eventually the Government were going Honourable members to get the use of these moneys by inducing the depositors in the Savings Banks to invest their savings in bonds or debentures. If I am right, and debentures are issued at s i per cent., when the time of stress and trial comes, and the investors try to place their debentures on the market, they will not get £100, or anything like the £100 they paid into the bank. I am simply dealing with a conjecture. It appears to me from what the Prime Minister said that my assumption is correct. He saidInterest-bearing debentures or bonds of every kind will probably be available in every part of the Commonwealth. thing if they were available? point out that the Prime Minister is putting it forth as one of the advantages arising from this measure, that bonds or debentures will be available all over Australia. ter then dealing with the issue of debentures ? passageA Commonwealth Savings Bank, as compared with the State Savings Banks, will at least provide for uniformity, and also, I venture to think, for a cheaper exchange in every part of Australia. Then he addedI t will probably have a common stock; and Government do not in the course of time, as the bank develops, interest-bearing debentures or bonds of every kind will probably be available in every part of the Commonwealth. If that passage bears the meaning which I place upon it, the depositors in the Commonwealth Savings Bank will eventually find that they have struck a very poor bargain indeed. Probably the Prime Minister hopes that the Commonwealth will be saved from going on to the London money market. I do not know whether that is what he is endeavouring to secure. legitimate ways to extend our credit. I have when he was about to start a National Bank in America.",50,Fisher

Credit, upon this hypothesis, of every kind, is nearly as necessary to us now as it ever was. But, at least, it may be affirmed with absolute certainty, that, to a country so situated, credit is deposited in the State Savings Banks. peculiarly useful and important. I think that those words of Hamilton,, written towards the close of the eighteenth century, are particularly applicable to Australia at the present time. WhilstI do not advocate any wild and reckless system of borrowing, I do say that Australia should endeavour in every legitimate way to extend her credit. The credit of a country is, perhaps, the most sacred thing that a Government have committed to their charge. It should be their first care to see that our credit is good all over the world; and not only so, but that we make every legitimate use of our credit. I will not deal any further with that point, but should like to direct attention to a few things in the Prime Minister's speech in which, as it appeared to me, he made it perfectly clear that he, at all events, hopes that,the Commonwealth Savings Bank will eventually lead to the closing up of the State Savings Banks. He saidI desire to say quite frankly that I think that the passing of this B ill will mean that there will be ultimately only one Savings Bank in Australia. The Prime Minister is proposing to start this new bank, therefore, with the ultimate idea that there shall be only one Savings Bank for the whole of Australia. How does he propose to arrive at that? withdrawing from the States the facilities which their depositors have at the present time to deposit money in .State Savings Banks through the post-offices. He was careful to say that he did not propose to close the State Savings Banks up immediately. Minister is going to "" deal it out "" to them, as my honourable friend suggests, in homoeopathic doses. He does not propose to do anything in a ""jarring manner"" ; and he did not say that he proposed to withdraw from the State Savings Banks immediately the facilities which their depositors at present have. But he stated quite frankly that, in his opinion, the State Savings Banks would be closed up. He saidI think it is impossible for two Savings Banks to be carried on in the same post-office without some difficulty arising. My own individual opinion is that the advantages of a Commonwealth Savings Bank will be such that probably, in addition to securing new depositors, it will obtain some of the money now I do not desire to say anything further on that point, except that it seems to me that it is the settled policy of the Government of the day to cripple the States financially. First of all the Commonwealth took from tlie States, to a very great extent, the opportunity of using land taxation as a means of revenue. Then we have taken from them the note tax. Now it is proposed to start this scheme, which the Prime Minister seems to hope will eventually result in depriving the States of those funds which they at present use to make advances to struggling settlers, enable working men to establish homes, and assist in the agricultural development of the States. ings Bank depositors will be any better off? deal with that point already. I do not think for a single moment that the depositors will have any more security than they have at present. If there ever comes a time in our history when the credit of our States is so bad that the depositors in the State Savings Banks will be unable to obtain their money, I venture to predict that the credit of the Commonwealth will then be no better than that of the States. I wish to pass on now to the far more important matter of the establishment of the proposed Commonwealth Bank. So far as By the principle of the Savings Bank is concerned, there is nothing to object to. Near the conclusion of his speech, the Prime Minister saidThis proposal deals with a matter of serious importance, and may affect our national life and progress more than we can see at present. I thoroughly agree with the right honourable gentleman in that. I think that this is a matter of the most serious importance, and it may affect our national life and progress more than any of us can estimate at the present moment. Yet we are entering upon its consideration in circumstances very different from those in which any Parliament has previously been called upon to consider a question of such importance.

300,Mr Greene,"I have endeavoured tosat to consider a great financial proposal such as this in similar circumstances. In April, 1909, a Conference of the Labour party met in Brisbane, and adopted a platform of nine planks, one of which was the establishment of a National bank. We are in this position to-day that, no matter what arguments may be adduced, or what reasons may be shown, why we should stay our hand at this time in regard to this particular -subject, a majority of honourable members in this House are pledged, whether they like it or do not, to vote for this Bill. -circumstances in which we are asked to enter upon the consideration of this great question. The Prime Minister was bound, whether he liked it or did not, to obey the orders of the Conference to which I have referred, and bring this proposal down to the House. Labour platform ten years before that. my statement in the slightest degree. I say that, whether the Prime Minister believed in this particular proposal or did not, he was bound to bring it before the House, and every honourable member opposite is bound to vote for it whether he likes it or does not. I venture to say that there is no question upon which we should enter freer from party considerations than this. It is far too delicate a subject, if I might put it in that way, to be forced through this or any other Parliament. It may affect our progress and prosperity in a way that none of us can foretell. I have already stated that, in my opinion, the great system of credit rests upon an absolutely scientific basis. We cannot ruthlessly interfere with it or do anything which is not absolutely in accord with the scientific principles upon which it is based without inevitably causing trouble, the extent of which may be infinitely greater than the actual disturbance of the system which is made. affect the principles to which the honourable member refers? explain that to the honourable member. I believe that in one fundamental and important particular this proposal does interfere with those principles. It is an important particular which it is perfectly possible for honourable members to alter, but it will invojve the alteration of the whole structure of the system, and will make the widest possible difference when trouble arises. ThoughI have yet to be convinced of the necessity of this bank at the present time, I think that if it is altered it will make such a material difference that, in all probability, a very great deal of the opposition to this proposal, as we have it from the hands of the Government to-day, will disappear. However, that is anticipating. I do not believe that there is a subject with which we could deal that is more highly technical. It is exceedingly complex. To thoroughly This is one of the extraordinary understand it, one requires a knowledge of the most abstruse branches of law and of commerce. It requires a life-time of experience to put it into operation with safety to the depositors and the public. These are reasons why I think honourable members should, quite apart from any party obligations, consider the proposal absolutely on its merits. There are two questions which I think the Prime Minister might have answered in his speech, but on which, so far as I could discover, he gave us very little, if any, light at all. The first is: What is the need for this bank? and the second, What is it proposed to accomplish by means of the bank ? I think that to these two questions we should have had a full, clear, and explicit answer. In regard to the first-What is the need for the bank?-ther e are two things which the Prime Minister mentioned. The right honourable gentleman seemed to think that existing banks are making too much money. He mentioned the profits of four of our very large financial institutions, and gave us the rate of profit they made last year, taking the paid-up capital alone as his basis. He gave us, also, a full tabulated statement of the profits of these banks for twenty-six years. I have taken the trouble to very carefully prepare a statement showing the average profits on the average paidup capital over the whole of that period. First, I have taken into consideration the paid-up capital alone; secondly, the whole of the shareholders' funds-which , of course, represents the real capital invested -and , finally, the loss upon the total capital subscribed during that period. The results at which I have arrived are very peculiar. I find that the average paid-up capital during the period indicated was 17,660,114, whilst the average reserve was 6,258,416. The. average rate of profit on ,the paid-up capital was 6.87 per cent., but including the whole' of the shareholders' funds it was only 5. n per cent. I find,",52,Fisher

302,Mr Greene,That does not affect,53,Fisher
303,Mr Howe,Ho w will this proposal,53,Fisher
304,Mr Greene,"I shall endeavour totoo, that whilst the paid-up capital invested in 1896 was £23,221,426, in 1905 it had decreased to £17,261,022,' or a loss of £5,960,404. The reserves during the same time had decreased from £7,976,767 to £4,500,152a reduction of £3,476,615, making a total loss in capital and reserves of £9,436,019. If I allow only£6,ooo,ooo of that loss to be debited to the capital reserves-becaus e I do not know exactly how the reserves were handled, and, of course, everything depends upon that -it will be seen that the actual rate of profit made by our banking institutions during the whole of that period was 4.1 per cent. That is not very much. When we recollect the risks which are incurred in connection with banking, it will be readily agreed that 4.1 per cent, is not a very big profit for our financial institutions to make. That rate of profit, too, covered the early ninetiesa period in the history of our banks when they were paying very large' dividends indeed-dividend s which were partially responsible, no doubt, for the financial crash which occurred in 1892 and 1893. learned wisdom, and, as a consequence, their dividends to-day are very much more within the limits Than they used to be. ' There is just one other point with which I should like to deal. I think the honourable member for Angas mentioned the number of banks that there are in Australia at the present time. There are 1,924 branches of ordinary banks, and 1,838 Savings Banks. It is now proposed to add to these a very large banking concern whose ramifications will spread all over the Commonwealth, and also to superimpose another Savings Bank on top of the existing Savings Banks. At the present time, there is one ordinary bank in Australia for every 2,273 persons, and if we include Savings Banks, there is one bank for every 1,363 persons. Now, in the United Kingdom, there is only one bank for every 5,015 persons. It will be seen, therefore, that Australia has nearly four times as many banking facilities as are possessed by the Old Country. In fact, I think I am right in affirming that the Commonwealth is, in all probability, the best equipped country from the standpoint of banks, in the world. There were two other matters which the Prime Minister mentioned with a view to showing the need which exists for the proposed Commonwealth Bank. He saidThe slightest reduction in the rate of interest measure which strikes me as rather peculiar, should, if properly applied, add to the productivity of the country, and, therefore, be of Mr Greene. distinctive advantage to the Commonwealth. If dividends are reasonable all is well. I should now like to say a word about introducing the Bill at this time. This is the time to legislate a time of prosperity and financial calm. We are singularly fortunate in that we are able to deal with a banking proposal of this kind under such conditions. This bank is to be conducted on business lines, as I have already told honourable members. There must be absolute security for all investment, and we propose to meet public requirements at the lowest rates of interest. This matter of the possibility of reducing interest I leave on one side for the present. He also saidThe question has been asked of me, and I express the hope that while the bank may deal in land securities and other securities, it will in time grow to be rather a bank dealing in ordinary bills of exchange and liquid securities of the kind-that it will ultimately become the bank of banks rather than a mere money-lending institution. Now, if the Prime Minister had had a little experience in banking institutions in this country, tie would know that one of their greatest difficulties is that there is not sufficient discount business to go round Since then, our banks have them. All through the piece, there has been an insufficiency of this class of business. The honourable member for Hindmarsh expressed the hope that the time will come when the proposed Commonwealth Bank will transact exactly the same class of business as is transacted by the Bank of England. But I would point out to him that we have not the field to enable us to do that. The Bank of England is an institution which deals pretty well with the foreign exchanges of the world. It does an enormous amount of discount business, and, naturally enough, it prefers to do that class of business. If our banks could transact a similar class of business, they would be only too willing to transact it, and no other. But they cannot do it, because it is not to be done. Though they all transact a certain amount of discount business, and a certain amount of London business, its volume is not sufficient to occupy their capital and resources. As a result, they are obliged to fall back upon other business. That is one of the reasons why they keep such a large gold and bullion reserve. They are obliged to do so, because their assets are not in a sufficiently liquid conditiona great deal of their money being invested in land-to enable them to carry on with the amount of gold with which the Bank of England can manage to carry on very well. There is one point in connection with this and it is that the Labour party should be the. party to endeavour to establish a bank to deal with the discount business. I have always understood that our honourable friends opposite were pledged to the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. stand that? their platform. of the State. I did not mean that it is on the platform of the Federal Labour party inasmuch as the Constitution does not give the power to nationalize the means of production, distribution and exchange. If it appeared on their platform it would be a mere placard, but it appears on the platform of the State Labour party, and I believe that my honourable friends opposite believe in the proposal. I have no reason to think that they do not. Every bank which deals successfully with this class of business is, to that extent, another rampart added to the fortress within which the capitalistic system is securely entrenched, and 1 venture to say, another insurmountable obstacle in the pathway of those who would march forward to the realization of the dream of the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. moment that you set up the nationalization of those means your discount business will vanish into thin air. must be perfectly evident to everybody . These are merely superficialities, if I may so put it, of a very big subject indeed. present we shall be satisfied with discounting most of what you say. do 1 mean, that the matter of the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange was a superficiality. I mean that the matters with which the Prime Minister dealt as showing the necessity for establishing this bank are the merest superficialities of a very great subject. I want to deal now with the system of credit, and to show why, in my opinion, the bank should not be started on the credit of the State. That is the fundamental objection which I have to the proposal. State Bank? orable members calling it a national bank, or whatever they like. I do not object to the Commonwealth buying some of the stock of the bank, though, I think, as I shall be able to show directly, there are reasons why it is wisest not to do so. The bank, if established, should not rest on the I believe that it is on credit of the State. credit of the States the private banks would Of course,.as citizens have been in a peculiar muddle in the nineties. tant point with which I shall deal later, and it is the reason, above all others, if I may so put it , why the bank should not rest on the credit of the State. saved the private banks. distinction, and it is, I admit, one of those nice distinctions which abound right through this great subject, but one which makes all the difference in the world when the time of trouble does arrive. The first point I want to take is that we have had no inquiry. We are dealing with this great subject more or less in the dark, and though I , in common with a great number of honourable members, have, Because the from time to time, read a very great deal about the matter, and dealt with it in various ways, the more we read, That the more we realize that it is a subject of which we know very little indeed. That there is room for inquiry I am quite willing to admit. An era of great prosperity, such as we have in Australia at present, is probably the best time to think about, if it is possible, making all due preparation for a commercial crisis. 1 I did not mean, nor agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that it is impossible to predict when a commercial crisis will arise. I have already stated in the House this session that, in my opinion, commercial crises are inherent in the system of credit. They will arise, no matter what we do. I have also stated, I think, the reasons why I believe it ' is almost a necessary evil that, from time to time, commercial crises should arise, not only in Australia, but in all parts of the world. What we can do, what we should endeavour to do, is to prevent them from developing into monetary panics. A strong central bank may be the best means in our power of achieving that object.

Again, I say that I do not know, but I do think that there is room for an inquiry covering the field of the actual need of the bank. I hope that the Government will see the wisdom of withdrawing the Bill from the consideration of the House this session, and holding it over for a few months while an inquiry is held. Then, with all the advantage^ of the knowledge which we should gain in that way, the measure could be brought forward again. If an inquiry should point out to us an absolutely sound method of establishing a national bank, and also that its establishment is, if not actually necessary, advisable, I should give the Government every possible assistance to make the Bill perfect. But I contend that an inquiry is an essential before we commit ourselves to this or any other scheme. Let us, by all means, for the time being, hold our In this matter, above all others, we should be cautious, and hasten slowly. what I have read,' there is a good deal to be said for the establishment of a bank here somewhat upon the lines of the Bank of France, though the circumstances of the two countries are widely different. France, for instance, has an enormous note currency. reserve. part of it is in silver, which is held at its full face value. The French note issue runs into many millions, while ours is very small; because our community is in the habit of using cheques, and is likely to -continue to do so, it being handier to pay by cheques than to carry notes about. To tlie banks it does not matter whether they distribute their credit in the form of notes, The Bank of Germany is entirely under the or whether their customers distribute it for them in the form of cheques. There are uses for a note issue which, in my opinion, make it essential to the fulfilment of the true function of a bank; but with that I shall not deal now. While there is a good deal to be said for the establishment of a bank here on the lines of the Bank of France, I doubt the wisdom of associating the credit of the State with that of the individual. The closer the association of the State with the basic credit of the bank, the less secure the bank. We have had, in comparatively recent history, two occasions in which heavy strains have been placed on national banks, and I shall illustrate, by extracts, the manner in which tlie banks affected have met them. Every one will remember that, at the end of the Franco-Prussian war, France had to pay to Germany an indemnity of 200,000,000' francs. That gigantic operation was carried out by the Bank of France without shaking the"" credit of the institution, without interfering with the development of the country-becaus e France grew by leaps and bounds immediately after the war-and , so far as was possible, without any disarrangement of the money market. Pierre des Essars says, in his History of the Banking of All NationsThe culminating stage of the career of the Bank of France was reached when it emerged from the trials of the Franco-German war with a clean credit, after the most formidable test that any institution of its kind had ever been forced to endure. Never before, in any country, had there been afforded a like example of an institution exercising such power, hands. There is no haste. inspiring such implicit confidence, contributing so decisively to the recovery of a people that seemed crushed, performing more than its duty From with impressive grandeur and simplicity. In that supreme struggle, a State Bank would not have been able to resist the exactions of the Government, and its credit would have become confused with the credit of the State. That is an important point. In times of stress, if the credit of a bank is confused with the credit of the country, the bank must suffer. President Thiers said that the Bank of France saved France because it was not a State bank. That is an important point, as I shall show later. The other bank which has had to bear a national strain is the Bank of Germany, or the Reichs-bank, which is not entirely a State owned institution, although the Government controls it. In the case of the Bank of France, the Government is connected with the management, but the management is really in the hands of the shareholders. control of the Government. The Imperial Chancellor directs the administration, under the Rules of the Bank Act, precisely as our Prime Minister proposes to do under the Bill, some of whose clauses have been taken from the German Act, or, at any rate, resemble them very closely. The Imperial Chancellor publishes the directions for the bank directorate, and the rules and instructions for the bank officials. ' The wisdom of bringing in men who are in con-",55,Fisher

These reports are submitted reguown notes; and that as recently as on the larly to the bank directorate, which is under the control of the Chancellor. Germany recently experienced a very mild crisis compared with that which France went through a good many years ago. There was a possibility of an outbreak of war between Germany and England and France, and almost simultaneously with the news getting abroad there was a run on the German banks. The reason for this was that the credit of the State and the credit of the banks were intermixed. The German banks, and particularly the Reichsbank, found themselves in such a tight corner that they had to discount in foreign countries German paper to the extent of £14,000,000, and to import that amount in gold to save the credit of the Imperial Bank. VVhere did they get the money ? England. of England, and partly from the Bank of France-fro m the two countries with which there was a possibility of Germany going to war. That is an illustration which deserves serious consideration. The Bank of France was able to meet the enormous payment of £200,000,000 without disturbing its credit, whilst it was at the same time assisting materially in the development of France; whereas when there was a possibility of Germany going to war with England and France, a German bank, more closely associated with the credit of the State had to go to England and Francetbe very countries with which there was a possibility of Germany going to war-to secure assistance to prevent, possibly not the closing of its doors, but a very severe strain being placed upon it. If honourable members take that point into consideration they will realize the danger of even associating the credit of the State had no faith in their own banks. They ment of a bank.

333,Mr Archibald,"That is why the Bankthe Bank of England rests on the credit of the Government. The British Government is heavily indebted to the bank, and is in no way associated with the credit of the institution itself. There is no Government guarantee. If the honourable member goes carefully into the position of the Bank of England he will find that there is plenty of room for improvement even in its case The honourable member smiles, yet that is not only my own opinion, formed after considerable research, but one which he will find amply endorsed by manywriters to-day. up to date. not saying that the Bank of England is not a great institution; it is. All I say is that there is room for improvement. Let me quote a few passages from the writings pf Alexander Hamilton, a gentleman for whom the honourable member for Hindmarsh does not seem to have much respect, although I have. him. seemed to think that, because Hamilton lived 130 or 140 years ago, his opinion was not worth much to-day. Certainly, when Hamilton wrote, the system of credit was not as clearly understood as it is to-day, but no one could read his works without being impressed by his wonderful foresight. American that understood anything about deemed at the rate of forty to one of the honest banking. that is so. I wish to quote his opinion as to the absolute necessity of associating prithe State currency of America had been vate credit with the State credit for the depreciated.

I wish to than integrity, readily perceived that no plans touch very briefly upon the question of the could succeed which did not unite interest and whole of the credit being that of the State. credit of rich individuals with this State; and upon this he framed the idea of his project. It cannot be said that And with regard to the National bank which he was advocating at that time, Hamilton saidBut when I consider, on the other hand, that the scheme stands on the firm footing of public and private faith, that it links the interest of the State in an intimate connection with those of the rich individuals belonging to itAt page 360 he statesA plan must be devised which, by incorporating their means together and uniting them with those of the public, will,, on the foundation of that incorporation and union, erect a mass of credit that wil l supply the defect of moneyed capital, and answer all the purposes of cash. Again he says, at page 378The truth is, there is not confidence enough in any funds merely public. All through it will be found that Hamilton impresses upon the Government, first of all in his letters and finally when he reports to Congress, and over and over again in his writings holds strongly and firmly, that if the bank is ever to be a success, if public confidence is to be retained, there must be the association of the credit of the individuals in the State with that of the State itself. At that time he was faced with a very peculiar state of affairs in America. Everywhere the credit of the State was, so to speak, discredited, and the moneys which the State had issued were at a very heavy discount. between that and Australia, is there? He was the only proposed that the old notes should be renew notes of the National bank, which, he said, would be issued on a sound credit combining the individual and the State.

Hemere association of the credit of the State with that of the individual as the foundation of the bank, the position is weakened in comparison to what it would be were the bank established on private credit, but it is made infinitely more weak when we establish the bank entirely upon the credit of the State, as we shall virtually do in this case. It is true that the Government will not own any stock in the bank as it is proposed to float it, but that does not alter the fact that the bank would have no credit whatever were it not for the credit of the State behind it, because it has no capital. We cannot dignify with tlie name of capital the Joan which it is proposed that tlie bank shall raise to carry it through its initial transactions. It is proposed to start the bank wholly and solely upon the credit of the State. Two or three honourable members have interjected during my speech references to what the Government did in 1893 to retain the credit of the banks. I admit that there is something in the contention, but it has nothing to do with the subject which I am endeavouring to put before the House. If the bank starts wholly and solely on the credit of the ""State, and carries on ordinary -banking business, it will be just as open to financial panic and rush as any other bank. There is no reason to suppose that, because it is a State Bank, it will be free from that loss of confidence which may attach to any banking institution. We have had ample evidence from time to time in the history of the world that once public confidence goes, it does not matter in the least whether a"" bank is State-oWned or private. If such a rush is directed against a State Bank, who is going to restore confidence? After_ all is said and done, as the honourable member for Angas pointed out, banking is a species of insurance, conducted on the probability that all the depositors will not want their money at once. Just as insurance is based on the probability that so many houses will be burnt down every year, so banking business is based on the probability that so much casfi will be wanted every day. It is a species of insurance which rests absolutely on confidence; credit rests entirely on confidence, and banking rests entirely on credit. I ask again, if there is a run directed against the Government Bank, who is going to restore confidence? why, in my opinion, it is unwise for the is to happen in time to come. bank to be established on the credit of the [104]2 State. It is of no use to say that confidence will not be shaken in the credit of the State; because it has been shaken recently in Germany, and over and over again in different parts of the world. Even the Savings Bank in the State of the honourable member for Hindmarsh was subject to a run on one occasion. We can never say that, because a bank is established and owned by the Government, it is not going to be subject to a run. of England do when it is subject to a run ? ber asks that question a little later on, I shall answer it. swer to the question of the honourable member-ther e will be no run on the Commonwealth Bank. ing to point out is that we can never say that the proposed bank is not going to be liable to a run; and, if a run does set in, who is going to stop it ?

The State cannot do so, for the simple reason that the State's credit is involved. is talking like a child ! that what i ain advancing is sound argument. an answer to the question the honourable member is asking! may try to answer me later on. Once a run sets in on a State Bank, the State is not in a position, without practically doing, what amounts to repudiation, to assist the Bank in any way. ber tell us what is likely to shake the credit of the State? shake the credit of the State, as I have already instanced in the case of the German bank. with us !",58,Fisher

If an engineer is building a bridge, he tests every piece of steel; and on a great proposal like this, we should put the test of any reasonable strain it may have to stand. The reason why the State was able to come in and restore confidence in 1893 was that the State's credit was not involved. All banking really rests on confidence. member suggest that private banks are able to withstand that nameless something which may shake the credit of the State institution ? depends on how the bank is managed. When a great financial panic takes place, in nine cases out of ten it is 'not because the banks are not solvent; it is not a question of whether the banks are solvent or not. The trouble is that in a country like Australia, where we cannot keep all our assets in liquid condition-wher e we cannot invest our money in that particular way-w e are bound to tie it up more or less in the banks; and the State Bank will be no exception to the rule. As I have said, the whole thing rests on confidence; and if confidence be shaken, it does not matter whether the banks are solvent or not. ber tell me what is that nameless thing which the private institutions can withstand, but which will shake the credit of the State? Supposing that the private banks are solvent, but unable to meet the extraordinary 'drain put on them, all that is necessary to do is to restore confidence. I desire to make this point perfectly clear, because there is much misconception in the minds of honourable members about it. It is not a question of the solvency of the banksit is a question of their being able at any moment to meet the particular demand. If any one can step in, and restore confidence, everything is all right, because the demand for money ceases. Buti f they cannot restore confidence, there is no saying how far the panic may extend. Practically every .panic in the world has been arrested by some very simple expedient, which has enabled the bank to get money for the time being. But when the credit of the Government itself is involved in a bank, the Government is not in the same position to restore confidence. The honourable member for Hindmarsh asked me a little while ago what the Bank of England does when a run sets in, and how it gets out of the difficulty. I will quote what McLeod says on this point. He writesA Committee of the House of Commons was appointed, who reported that the sudden discredit of so large an amount of bankers' notes had produced a most inconvenient deficiency in the Circulating Medium : and that unless a Circulating Medium was provided, a generai stoppage must take place. They recommended that Exchequer Bills to the amount of j£5,ooo,ooo should be issued under the directions of a Board of Commissioners appointed for the purpose, in sums of ^100, ^50, and £,20. that incident? In the several other instances since the Act of 1844, which the honourable member for Hindmarsh mentioned, the Bank of England finding itself in difficulties, the charter under which it was working had to be suspended by the Government of the day. The particular part of the bank's charter under which the note issue is regulated, had to be suspended. In not one single instance has the bank beenable to carry on in the event of a run without the Government coming in and suspending the operation of the conditions regulating the note issue. By this means the bank has been able to issue notes over and above the actual amount of gold held in the issue department. That part of the bank's procedure seems to me to be unscientific and to need to be amended. I now wish to deal with the question of the reduction of the rate of interest. The Prime Minister, in his speech, saidThe slightest reduction in the rate of interest should, if properly applied, add to the productivity of the country, and, therefore, be of distinctive advantage to the Commonwealth. If dividends are reasonable all is well. He also saidThere must be absolute security for all investment, and we propose to meet public requirements at the lowest rates of interest. I do not know whether the Prime Minister will be successful or not in reducing the rate of interest. I cannot say. But it is doubtful whether cheap money would be in the interest of the people, and whether it would not encourage rash speculation. 1 am not dogmatizing on the point. I can only put my opinion forward with the knowledge that the subject requires the deepest investigation. But I should like to submit that it is worthy of the consideration of the House whether the low rate of",59,Fisher

I believe that the increase in the amount of credit which may be brought about by the establishment of a big bank, such as this, at the present time, might lead to the very thing honourable members opposite are so anxious to avoid, and that is a financial crisis. I think that is possible. Honourable members will recognise that we are probably on the top of a wave of prosperity. Things are booming. I do not know how soon tRis bank is going to be started. I do not know how much credit it will be able to issue. Probably it will be able to issue a very considerable volume of credit straight away, and I am not at all sanguine as to what may happen afterwards. In the first place, I do not think that booms .are started by banks. Speculation is not started by banks, and in a certain sense it is not aided by banks. I do not think that banks are really responsible for monetary panics. Rash speculation and booms always start with the public. When a man comes to him for an overdraft, and offers him good security, a banker cannot possibly tell to what purpose his customer proposes to put the money. The latter may use it to buy property which will help to boom property alongside of him. He may use it for trading purposes. He may use it for a hundred-and-one different things. banker to know what he intends to do with it. He may ask his customer to what use he proposes to put the money, and the customer may tell him, but, on -the contrary, he may not. This overtrading always starts with the public.

I would have liked 1 another hour to-morrow in which to express my views upon this Bill, but I am too tired to continue my remarks to-night. days, but of time. point with which I intend to deal, namely,, the question of the control of the proposed: bank. It is to be in the hands of one man, but I do not intend to discuss that. I shall deal only with the possibility of political influence being exercised in regard to its management. The Prime Minister, during, the course of his remarks, saidIn our case we have what is equal to a Board, but without the information. WhatI mean is that Parliament meets at least once a year. that Parliament is to be a Board of Directors? better than a Board of Directors. If any failure should occur through want' of ability, or from some other cause on the part of the Governor of the bank, provision is made to enable Parliament to be informed, and Parliament can by legislation provide a remedy. It will be seen that the powers and duties of the Governor are prescribed by regulation. for keeping accounts in the Savings Bank? It is impossible for the with by regulation on the authority of the Treasurer, but were I in office I should veto such a proposal. expense of the Savings Bank business? criminate ? at the head of this institution, and, though it seems unnecessary, I may say that, so long as there is a safe, steady party like our own in office, there is nothing to fear. That quotation shows that the Prime Minister anticipates that there will be a considerable amount of interference with the affairs of the bank by Parliament, by regulation, and by the Treasurer of the day. For myself, I am strongly of opinion that if the institution is to be a success it should be entirely divorced from political control. Its management should certainly not be in the hands of one man, but of several, and it should be altogether dissociated from political influence and control. There isone more quotation which I propose to make from Alexander Hamilton. It is a very significant one, and one which puts the case much more clearly than I could possibly put it.

To attach full confidence to an institution of this nature, it appears to be an essential ingredient in its structure, that it shall be under a private not a public direction-unde r the guidance of individual interest, not of public policy; which would be supposed to be, and, in certain emergencies, under a feeble or too sanguine administration, would really be, liable to being too much influenced by public necessity. The suspicion of this would, most probably, be a canker that would continually corrode the vitals of the credit of the bank, and would be most likely to prove fatal in those situations in which the public good would require that they should be most sound and vigorous. It would, indeed, be little less than a miracle, should the credit of the bank be at the disposal of the Government,, if , in a long series of time, there was not experienced a calamitous abuse of it. 'The writer very clearly expresses what I feel may happen at any time. If the proposed bank is to be practically under the control of the Treasurer of the day, the political exigencies of the moment may induce him to bring such pressure to bear upon the Governor of it, that the latter may give way at a time when every consideration of safety demands that he should stay his hand. If the bank is to be a success, I say again that it must be entirely divorced from political control. There is just-one other matter that I will mention, in closing. It is an established principle in connection with banking that a banker should never be a trader. Yeti t is proposed that tbe Commonwealth shall go in for a good deal of trading of one sort or another. There is a possibility that that may be extended very materially in time to come. It often happens that the -interests of .the trading community and the interests of the banking community are diametrically opposed. The bank will probably .be used for financing the trading operations of the Government; and there may come a time when the interests of the trading part of the Government business will be diametrically opposed to the interests of the bank. Just when, possibly, the trading interests require the .greatest amount of assistance, it may be absolutely opposed to the best interests of the bank, as such, to grant that money. .That.is an element of danger in the scheme which I see. I am sorry that, owing to the fact that I had to start my speech at a very late .hour, I have not been able to deal with the subject as f u l l y as I should have .liked, and owing to the numerous interjections which have come from the other side, I have prohably strayed considerably from what I originally intended to say. But I do impress upon the Government that, before we are committed to this'scheme, for which there is no precedent in the history of the financial world, it would be advisable, in the interests of Australia, not to pass the measure into law this session. I have already stated that, in my opinion, it may be found needful to create a great central banking institution; I do not know. I do almost beg of the Government, before they finally commit themselves and the House to this particular scheme, to have a thorough inquiry made, because I feel sure that if it is made they will find good reasons for modifying their proposal. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, and as I indicated at the beginning of my speech, there are connected with the proposal questions the result of which it is impossible for us to foresee. We cannot tell when this may be found to be the worse possible proposal which Australia could have adopted. must be for the benefit of Australia. considerable doubt about it. I think that the basis of theissue of credit is wrong. I believe that the bank should rest purely on private credit, and not on the credit of the State. I do hot care if the capital is subscribed by the individuals. I would not object to see -the interest on the shares definitely fixed. A t the same time, I feel that, in starting the bank purely on the credit of the State, the Government are taking upon themselves the responsibility of initiating a scheme which, in all probability, will be found to be the worse possible one which could have been adopted. I do not know. I confess that I have very great doubts on the subject; but I do ask the Government, in conclusion, before they pass the Bil l through the House, to take .time to consider the matter. Let there be a thorough inquiry made, and-when the House has obtained definite information, given in the light of Australian conditions, on which so much depends -every thing connected with banking varies in different countries-if it is found necessary, or advisable, to proceed, I , for one, would not be slowto support tbe Government -in any such, scheme. journed: House adjourned at xo.50 p.m.",62,Fisher
