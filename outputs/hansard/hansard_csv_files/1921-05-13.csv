As I explained last evening, this is a farmers' co-operative organization in simple alteration to the Westralian Western Australia to erect terminal silos. Farmers' Agreement Act. The effect is to make the scheme upon which the farmers of Western Australia propose to embark for the bulk handling of their wheat a more modest one. It will relieve the shareholders of the necessity for collecting £60,000 more capital, and also relieve the Commonwealth in the meantime to the extent of £110,000 of its obligation. I commend the measure warmly to o honourable members. It h in k the farmers of the western State are acting wisely in proceeding, in the circumstances, with a modified scheme, and in confining their operations for the present to the building of terminal silos. This House in August last passed a measure confirming an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the farmers of Western Australia, who were about to form a co-operative concern for the purpose of handling their wheat in bulk. It provided for a capital expenditure of £800,000, and' stipulated that the 1 farmers should allot at least 300,000 shares at 10s. a share. A f t e r they had country districts, or at terminal points, the Commonwealth was to lend them £ 1 for every £ 2 expended by them.

35,And Treasurer) Mr Charlton,"I was about toIn order to do that, it is necessary to amend the agreement so that we may advance to the society a certain proportion of the money originally arranged for, notwithstanding that they have not been able to fully comply with the terms of the Act. In view of the fact that the Federal Government is not asked, in this amending Bill, to incur further obligation, I cannot see that any great objection need be offered to the proposal. We are simply reducing, as it were, the amount provided for in the Act. That is to say, because the farmers were not able tp take up the whole of the 300,000 shares, they have approached the Government for the purpose of having the Act amended so that they may proceed with the erection of terminal silos as portion of the whole scheme for the preservation of their wheat. The amount to be advanced by the Commonwealth Government is to be reduced, proportionately. Instead' of being called upon to advance to the society £550,000 the Government, in the terms of this amending Bill, will be authorized to advance up to £440,000, which is the true proportion of subsidy to the farmers' capital investment in the venture. urgent need for the protection of the wheat crops of Australia. It would have been much better if the proposed silos were built on land owned by the cooperative' society. If I remember aright, during the' debate on the scheme some little time ago, it was stated that the site of the terminal silo at Fremantle was owned by the State Government; but, nevertheless, the Commonwealth is amply protected by mortgage' over the securities of the society, which moreover has to expend £100,000 of its own money before the Commonwealth is required to advance anything by way of subsidy. say it , but I believe there is a bad time ahead, and that neither the Federal Government nor the State Governments will be able to get all the money they require for public works. This will mean a large amount of unemployment I fear in the near future, although I hope I am wrong in that supposition. If this co-operative society can undertake the expenditure of £100,000 on its terminal elevator it will provide employment for a good number of men in the western State, and to that extent the Commonwealth Government will be relieved from its obligation, because it will not be called upon to expend one shilling of subsidy until the society has spent £100,000 on the scheme. The rate of interest on the Commonwealth subsidy will be 6 per cent. last loan. in respect of this-subsidy would represent 6£ per cent. if the necessary charges were added. It is very advisable that every effort should be made to find employment during the trying period that is ahead of us, and this is one way. courage production. we encourage production we must also make provision for the protection of our primary products from deterioration. This may be regarded as an urgent matter. Another subject to which, perhaps, I may be permitted to refer as equally urgent, is the question of increasing the allowances paid to our old age and invalid pensioners. I hope the Government will consider this matter. I beThe war demonstrated the lieve the House is favourably disposoel towards it,and also towards an increase in the exemption of the Income Tax Act. Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) is to be congratulated on the manner in which he has dealt with this B ill ; but the position is scarcely as he stated it-that the farmers of Western Australia undertook more than they were able to carry out. What is now sought is a temporary modification of the Act passed last August. Experts have unanimously advised that the first work to be I am sorry to have to undertaken should be the erection of the terminal elevator, because the money so expended will immediately come into utilization. It is regarded as the wisest' course, and it is therefore pot necessary to call the whole of thc money until the terminal site has been erected. There is another reason why it is not advisable simultaneously to go on with the whole scheme. Materials have come down in price somewhat and will drop lower, and the advantage thus gained will be shown over the entire scheme.

I can quite understand the financial institutions not "" r u s h in g "" the proposal; because there is not that sound security behind it that there would have been if the State bf Western Australia had been a guarantor. .should have found not only the banks, but insurance and trustee companies contributing the necessary money, which would have obviated the humiliation to -which the representatives of Western Australia are now subjected. scheme had been a sound business proposition there would have been no necessity for this B ill , and' members would be very well advised to hesitate before supporting it . Other States do not ask the -Commonwealth to advance money on security that is not of the best. In financial matters, the Government ought to show an example and not take risks; it ought to offer an object lesson to those inclined to enter into speculations of this character. A f t e r all, this B ill has in view only a terminal port ; the wheat will have to be bagged from the country districts I am speaking as the to the silo, so that that branch of the work w ill not be obviated. My own opinion is that the silo will not be used, and that, I take it , is «one of the reasons why those interested in the wheat industry have not' subscribed the necessary ton), with that -affability .so characteristic of him, .has intimated that he raises no great objection to ""the measure. TheB ill provides for the expenditure of a lesser amount than -was contemplated The honunder the original Act. Our only consolation, therefore, is that the Commonwealth w ill suffer a smaller loss. In my judgment the scheme is not a sound one. The State of Western Australia ought to guarantee the Commonwealth against all loss in connection w i th the proposed undertaking. If the scheme were an ordinary business one, the person who had to advance the money would require the feesimple of the land upon which the proposed silos are to be erected. is a great believer in freehold titles. There is no excuse ever to do with the question which we are now considering. I am prepared to debate the question of leasehold versus freehold w it h the honourable gentleman upon any public platform. I am thoroughly satisfied that the undertaking upon which we are now asked to embark is not a sound one. when the Commonwealth handed over W it h good security, we £7,000,000 of loan money to New South Wales? talks so rapidly that I am quite unable to follow him. In addition, I am not If the good at answering conundrums.

83,Mr West,"The honourable memberof loss as is that which we are asked to approve in this Bill. unhesitatingly support the measure enabling the Commonwealth Grovernment to make an advance by loan for silos to be constructed by cooperative farmers in Western Australia. It represents a move in the right direction. I agree with the encouragement of the principle of co-operation, and in new countries like those of Western Australia and Queensland, the people are badly in need of that encouragement. It is all very well to say that they should lean upon their State Governments. A t the present time the Queensland Government have no money with which to proceed with any of their enterprises. In such circumstances the parent Government ought to go to the primary producers' assistance so as to promote the growth of our primary industries, and with a view to settling as many people as possible in the great States of Queensland and Western Australia. There are 419,000,000 acres in Queensland, of which 400,000,000 acres aTe still unalienated. It is our duty to encourage settlement upon Crown lands, and to achieve that result the settlers must receive either from the State or the Commonwealth some measure of financial assistance. If that assistance can safely be granted upon co-operative lines, as it can be in this case, it should be granted. I hope that, in the near future, Queensland farmers will come to the Commonwealth Government with a request for assistance by way of loan in the erection of silos for the maize industry, which is destined to become a very important industry, not merely to returned soldiers, but also to immigrants. I intend to oppose the Bill at every stage. Ever since the opening of this Parliament honourable members of the Country party have been doing nothing else but preaching economy. wheat, and not of wool. upon the other side. The wool industry has not asked this Parliament for a single copper. All that those who are interested in that industry have said is, ""Leave us alone. We can pay our taxes and we can pay our creditors 20s. in the £1."" merely asked us tofixthe price of wool a little bit higher for him. able member think that 8d. per lb. is a high price to pay for wool ? he make that remark? As a matter of fact, the wool-growers of Australia did not need even the small consideration for which they asked. What was done by this Parliament has merely had the effect of stabilizing; the industry. But we have nothing for which to thank honourable members. We want nothing from them. All that we ask of this Parliament is that we may be left alone. Only last night the honourable member' for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) pointed out what taxation the man upon the land is really paying. My principal objection to the Bill is that it is not in the interests of the country at all.

Only yesterday the Treasurer told the House and the country that there was no money available to settle returned soldiers and Imperial soldiers on the land in the Burnett district, which the honourable member for Wide Bay represents, yet he had nothing to say about that. He sat in silence, but when a proposal comes forward to spend money lavishly in Western Australia, he says it is a good thing. He had not a word to say for his own State and for the district which he represents. He sat there smiling, and why?

I want State-aided boots in Batman, for one thing. Boots are dear, and many of my electors are in need of them. I propose now, as I have before, that the Government favourably consider the suggestion made by me to form a boot manufacturing company in the district of Batman, which will be able to come with confidence to the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) for support, with the object of producing good and cheap boots for the people of Australia, and especially those in the electorate of Batman, which I represent. I criticised a similar measure upon these lines. I congratulated the Country party originally, and remarked then, as I now remark, that it is a somewhat unpleasant and sinister aspect of our political activities to-day when a Nationalist Ministry, so opposed to anything in the nature of State Socialism, should turn to the Country party when they ask for assistance in a local industry, and say this company is designed to assist the primary producers and make the land blossom like the rose, as contemplated by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) when discussing the Tariff'proposals.

Those are the imposts in respect of spirit made within the Commonwealth; such spirits when imported would pay the additional duties provided in paragraph g. I want to make sure that .the sick man requiring medicines in the preparation of which spirits are used shall not be called upon to pay a higher duty in respect of that spirit than is the man who desires to use with his food wine or vinegar in the production of which spirits are used. these rates will not be continued. for Trade and Customs) [2.18] I think I can give the honourable member„ the information he desires. The spirit""used in pharmaceutical preparations is dealt with in the Excise rates, and I propose when we reach them to meet to some extent the honourable member's views. I have been looking into the question for some time, and desire to do something on the lines which my honourable friend suggests when we come to the Excise Tariff. We must, however, have regard to the duty resting upon us to protect the revenue, and to prevent the spirit being used for other than pharmaceutical purposes. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 4Amylic alcohol and fusel oil, per gallon, British, 27s.; intermediate, 28s.; general, 28s.

Will the Minister state why the provision in the old Tariff for the free admission of denatured spirit under departmental by-laws has been dropped? for Trade and Customs) [2.23] -Amylic alcohol and fusel oil are by-products of the distillation of Bpirit. Amylic alcohol is made from fusel oil by a process of distillation, ind both are used in the manufacture of paints, varnishes, lacquers, and so on. The Australian requirements can be met by the by-products of the local distilleries. The provision in previous Tariffs for the free admission of amylic alcohol and fusel oil when denatured has been omitted, and an item inserted in the Excise Tariff providing for their free delivery where denatured. There are no importations of the denatured article. That, I think, gets over the difficulty raised by the honourable member in the latter part of his speech. I desire to make sure that refer to anything used in medicinal preparations, I have nothing more to say with regard to it. Item agreed to. Item 5Collodion, per gallon, British, 5s.; intermediate, 6s. 6d.; general, 7s. 6d. I intend to move a reduction of the duties for which this item provides. In respect of collodion, which I understand is only used medicinally, honourable members will find that the former duty of 3s'. per gallon, has been increased to 5s. per gallon. The Government, having established a laboratory here, are endeavouring apparently to protect that laboratory by increasing the duties on medicines, and indeed everything that is required in cases of sickness, and everything that is required in.hospitals, whose expenditure must then be greatly increased. Is it not desirable that the best of patent medicines should be allowed to come in, I do not say free of duty, but without being subjected to an unreasonmust have of the best, and in the interests of the health of the people it is desirable that medicinal preparations should not be too expensive. Since the establishment of Government laboratories These increases the duties in relation to vaccine serums, ore., have been enormously increased'. In one case, the increase amounts to over 9.000 per cent. There can be no reason for such additional imposts, unless the Government are anxious to show by the imposition of such duties that a Government laboratory is worth having. I move That the item be amended by the insertion after ""5s."" of the words, ""and on and after 14th May, 1921, 3s.""",33,Divisioni Ale Spirits And Beverages

164,Mr Gregory (Dampier) [2.27],"for Trade and Customs) [ 2 . 2 9 ] the Committee will not' agree, to this amendment. It is true that collodion'is used as a dressing after surgical operations; but I think it will be admitted that the quantity so employed is so small that tiie actual increased cost to the patient, as represented by this duty, will be almost infinitesimal. It is.very.desirable that collodion should be manrxfactured locally. It has important uses in the surgical treatment' of wounds. Prior to the war, practically all the collodion used in Australia was imported, and 75 per cent, of our importations came from Germany. ' When the war"" came-down on us, and' the source of sup^ ply, which wasalmost entirely German, was cut off, wecould not obtain any collodion, and it was not until local manufacturers came to our rescue at a very critical time that we were -able to secure a supply. The rate of duty proposed is, I think, about 35 per cent, on what we may consider the normal value of collodion. That, in my opinion, is not an excessive duty. it would, as the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) suggests, represent cost _ to even the In view of the circumstances, and of our experience during the war, in regard to this particular chemical', I suggest that the duty proposed is only fair and reasonable. much of' collodion as of the general requirements of hospitals. value of the amount imported ? the year 1913, the year immediately before the war. were 314 gallons. By 1916 they had fallen ,to 89 gallons, and in the year 1917, when, the war was at its height, they, were 26 gallons. Honourable members will see to what an extent the local manufacturers, who took up the manufacture of this article at a critical time, as was the case in regard to a good many other things, came to our rescue. I have not heard from any source any complaint as to the quality of the collodion supplied locally, but 1,-have had from more than one source excellent testimonials.

The effect of this amendment is to. give a slightly increased duty on the lower grades of perfumed spirits, while reducing the duties on the higher grades. found, after some experience of the working of this Tariff, that the ad valorem duty pressed unnecessarily heavily on the high grades of perfumed spirits, which are not manufactured in this country, with the result that, in all probability, we were losing revenue.

If the Minister could see his way clear to make the difference sufficiently marked, many buyers, w i th the object of saving a few pence on each package purchased, would smoke the Australian-grown tobacco and thus give greater encouragement to the local grower. I perceive what the honourable member for Oxley desires, but the Minister is evading the question.

In connection with this item there has been much correspondence in the press, having for its basis the price of cigars and the matter of relief being afforded to the local manufacturer in respect of Excise duty. I do not propose to raise the question of Excise at this stage. I am one of those who believe that, in treating a luxury of any sort in these times, it does not matter how high a Tariff is placed thereon. If I purchase a cigaras I doI am prepared to pay highly for that luxury. But I have a great objection to the Minister giving Protection to a phase of industry which could only live under a great deal of nurturing. It would pay the country far better to award pensions to all persons employed here in the manufacture of cigars. We raise a great cry about having to compete against Hack labour; but all the time we are wanting tobacco grown by black labour. I wish to know if there is any proposal to increase the duty upon cigars. for Trade and Customs) [2.56] I do not propose at present to increase the duty on cigars.

I would also point out at this stag* that when the first Commonwealth Tariff was framed there was in the schedule a list of free articles, which, showed precisely and emphatically what was free. I do not wish to bring up the question of the powers assumed' by Ministers of Customs in the past, but at a later stage I desire to thresh out the question whether this Tariff, as framed by the Parliament, is to be the Tariff of Australia, or whether the Minister shall have authority to alter the schedule in any manner he may wish. I call attention to the phrase, "" as prescribed by departmentalby-laws."" Will ""Black leaf 4 0"" come within this provision ?

I have been a member of Parliament during the consideration of every Tariff that has been introduced since the inception of Federation, and it has been my experience that the Departmental interpretation of items is often entirely different from the intentions of Parliament.

The Japanese are sending in, for broommaking purposes, an inferior millet which is being largely.used. I have two letters, which I shall read to the Committee, in order to show that our farmers arc dissatisfied with the present duty. Here is one written by Mr Cunningham on behalf of the farmers of Nelson Plains, shortly after the Tariff schedule was laid on the tableNelson Plains Progress Association to ask necessity of raising the Tariff on imported broom millet in order to save an Australian industry from absolute extinction. We understand that the Tariff will be dealt with immediately Parliament reassembles, and would respectfully urge that you use your best endeavours to have the Tariff raised at least fourfold. As you are not, perhaps, familiar with the subject, I will try briefly to make the matter plain to you. The areas in which broom millet is grown in New South Wales are the Lower Hunter, and Manning and Eichmond Rivers on the coast, and smaller quantities inland at Yanco and Tamworth districts. The amount grown in these districts is quite sufficent to supply Australia and New Zealand in any season, and consequently there is no need to import any from outside. At the present time millet is quoted at £50 per ton of 2,000 lbs. in Sydney, but very little is being sold for that, the average price being from £30 to £40, which is altogether too low a price to pay farmers at the present high cost of living.

263,"Dear Mr Charlton,","I am directed by the120 tons-from Italy, although there are ample stocks of Australian millet awaiting sale in all the millet-growing districts. Last year they succeeded in inducing the Federal Government to place an embargo on the exportation of millet to New Zealand, although then, as now, there were ample stocks to supply both countries, and this action was taken without consulting the growers, who were certainly entitled to have a say in the matter. To show you how the manufacturers score at the expense of the growers-The price of millet is no better, or hardly as good, as before the war, when you could buy a broom-retail-in any shop in the State for Is. 6d., whereas at the present time brooms range from 3s. Od. to 4s., and the cost of production to the grower has gone up 200. per cent. Trusting you will do your best in this matter, Yours respectfully, M. CUNNINGHAM. P.S -If you require any further facts or figures in this matter'I shall be happy to furnish them -M.C . Most honourable members are familiar with this district, where a great deal of millet is grown. I have also a letter from a resident of Miller's Forest, where probably more millet is grown than in any other part of New South Walesmers of the Hunter ValleyI wish to draw your attention with a view of having it placed before the Federal authorities of the treatment meted out to the millet-growers of this locality, as to importations of millet from other countries. Owing to the cost of labour, the price paid for the cultivation, raising, and cutting of this crop was nearly 100 per cent, more this season than in past years, and when the first millet was harvested, as early as December last, the price offered for this millet was £80 per ton at the shed. This is just a payable price, and nothing more. A few weeks later what do we find ? The"" profiteers "" have got their heads together, and to-day we are very lucky if we can get £40 per ton for it at the shed. Do you not consider this an injustice, and on top of this the Federal Government is allowing foreign countries to simply flood the country with so-called Italian millet. Is this a fair go? The past seasons may have been good to some farmers, but others have simply to depend upon this crop to meet their rents, &c, and what is to become of the poor struggling farmer when, on the 1st of July this year, he has to sacrifice his crop for the paltry sum of £40 per ton when it costs him nearly £30 per ton to raise same* We consider it a grave injustice, and I think you would earn the esteem and appreciation of all the millet-growers in New South Wales if you would ventilate this matter on the floor of the House. What we want is to get the Tariff increased, and an inquiry made into this matter. Hoping to ,hear from you in the course of a few weeks, A. J. O'BBDSN, Secretary. Mr Charlton. I ask the Minister to increase the duty on this item. It is far too small at present. should be the amount? ficient to prevent effective competition by the inferior stuff from overseas, which threatens to kill the millet-growing industry in Australia. Manufacturers get hold of it, use it for the trade, and then they charge the very highest prices for the product as if it were Australian millet. is killing the local industry. member for East Sydney( Mr West) has just told me that the manufacturers mix this inferior stuff at the factories, but the fact remains that our farmers are growing enough millet for the whole of the Australian and New Zealand requirements. much pleasure in supporting the remarks made by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). I have rather intimate knowledge of the conditions under which millet is grown in the northeastern districts of Victoria, an'd recently I introduced a deputation to the Minister for Customs asking for a higher duty in this schedule. The gentlemen who comprised the deputation furnished me with a number of facts which I should like to place before the Committee. They are to the point, and tell us just what the growers want. The growers sayBroom millet is grown in Victoria principally in the valleys of the King and Ovens Rivers in the north-eastern part of the State, and in New South Wales in the Hunter River district and similar country. The output annually averages 250 tons in ""Victoria, and 550 tons in New South Wales, of fibre. The land most suitable for its cultivation ' is a rich alluvial loam. The cultivation method usually adopted is to plough the ground as soon as conditions permit after winter,' harrow twice, then subsequently either plough a second time or utilize a cultivator, and again harrow to produce a fine tilth before seeding. Seed is sown by drilling as soon as warm weather sets iii, say, from the middle of October to the middle of December, in rows 30 inches apart. It is usual to fertilize with superphosphate during growth of crop, and cultivation between the rows is carried on in order to retain moisture and capillarity, and develop root growth. The harvesting of fibre commences when seed heads begin to ripen, and is done by manual labour. The plants are bent down,"" and the",43,Groceries

The fibre is laid down on the prostrated plantsto dry unti l carted in, in small sheaves, to the drying sheds, where it is spread out until completely cured. It is then ready to be threshed. Threshing is accomplished by a crew of seven or eight men. It consists of holding the fibre in handfuls on a spiked roller which is revolved at high speed, and tears off all seeds from fibre. The roller machine is generally worked by means of an internal combustion engine of from 4 to 5 BHP. When threshing is completed the fibre is compressed into bales, wired round, and ts then ready to despatch to factory, where it is made up into ' the linished broom. The cost of production is estimated as follows:-Assuming it to be a good crop of broom, and basing its yield at 1 ton of threshed fibre to 3 acres, which is above the average on Government Statistician's figures, the production costs on lowest possible estimate are :Rent of land, per acre Ploughing seeding 5s., manuring 5s. Cutting crop,employees 15s. per day, or contract price per acre Carting into shed, threshing fibre, engine hire, baling, wiring, and carting per ton cost £7 10s., equals per acre Total per acre . . added to which are railage, commission, storage, and handling charges, and cost of production to growers wil l amount to £25 or £26. This is the estimate of a good crop; but on reviewing figures supplied by Statists of Victoria and New South Wales, it was found that over the triennial period of 1917-1919, the yield was 5 cwt., 5 cwt., and 24 cwt. respectively, and with prices fluctuating from £28 to £71 per ton, and averaging throughout £49 per ton, the gross return to the grower amounted to £9 8s. I d . per acre per annum, which, on estimate of aost, left little margin over expenses involved. The work of growing and harvesting broom is mostly done by settlers on small holdings, assisted by their families or hired labour. Of the total cost of production, i.e., £25 per ton, rather more than four-fifths is paid out for T h is labour alone, and estimating the yield of the fibre' in the K i ng Valley this season to be 200 t r y was started in Queensland years tons, it means that £4,000 is spent during the ago,, and was successful u n t i l d u m p season amongst the workers engaged, which in g took place, and numbers of growers gum is of considerable importance to them in f o u n d t h a t they could not get a n y t h in g making up a living wage.

It is of r i c e seed for testing purposes, and the recognised that a price lower than £40 per ton Is hardly remunerative to thc grower. It is pointed out in this connection that when instituting inquiries into the manufacturing processes and costs, it was confidentially stated by a manufacturer that factory costs when the price of fibre was £70 per ton were about 2s. per broom, made up as:-Cost of fibre, at £70 per ton, Is. 2d.; cost of handles, wire, varnish, and making broom, 6d.; overhead factory charges, 4d.; total, 2s. These' figures were given when cost of material was at high war-time level, and, pursuing the inquiries further, it was found the retail price to the consumer averaged 5s. per broom, so that cost of distribution amounted to more than primary and manufacturing costs combined. It w ill be seen that for every £10 per ton paid to growers for fibre, the cost of fibre in each broom would be 2d., in other words, at £40 per ton fibre, per broom 8d.; at £i>0, 10d.; at £60, Is., and so on, which is proportionallylow to cost of broom. to ultimate consumer.

In the Argus this morning there is a report ef a speech by the honourable member for Cowper and the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) delivered at a meeting of country press delegates in this city. The report contains the following:Dr. Earle Page said that during the last three years £60,000,000 had been practically squandered in repatriation. In several years he did not suppose there would be more than £3.000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of tangible assets. A t the present time we hear a great deal about economy; but I think that honourable members who have knowledge of the facts connected with the various repatriation schemes of the Government ought to make their meaning quite clear when they' speak of the. squandering of £60,000,000. I am sure tliat I am not prepared to admit for one moment that this money has been squandered. Of course, in connection with repatriation, as in other matters, errors of judgment may have been made. It is not to be expected that we can place 300,000 men in the industries of the country without errors, or a certain amount of overlapping between Commonwealth and State. But to say that the whole of the money to be expended has been squandered is to use language not justified by the actual facts. I should like to ask the Leader of the Country party whether he is correctly reported, because I do not wish to belabour hin> unnecessarily or unduly. ported to the same effect on another occasion. to initiate a debate on the-whole administration of the Repatriation Department, I think that the honourable member should say exactly what he meant when he referred in this sweeping way to the squandering of public money. ber has made the same statement in the House.

Instead of endeavouring to be of assistance and encouragement, they are denouncing every action of the Government in their endeavour to disparage our efforts to fulfil the nation's obligation to returned soldiers. It would be far more fitting if these persons were to offer common-sense advice rather than mischievous and self-aggrandizing criticism. responsible member of this House, and he the Leader of a party, to say that an expenditure of some £60,000,000 will be reduced to an abiding asset of only about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 is a statement which no child would take notice of. Such a remark brings more denunciation upon its maker than upon those at whom his reckless and ill-considered accusations are aimed. stand the purpose of the honourable member. I am prepared to listen to and, if necessary, to combat any criticism of an honest and well-intended nature concerning any branch of administration with which I bave had to do. AndI am certain that the Minister for Repatriation would be readily prepared to say the same for himself. I invite the honourable member to investigate the plight in which men with life-long experience in the building trade have been finding themselves. choked with dear material, and have been unable to sell it , or in any way, in fact, to get it out. certain stock in hand which has cost much money; but there is no trader of any magnitude in Australia who is not in a similar position. With respect to land settlement, I have pointed out that a sum of £25,000.000 has been spent in the acquisition of land. In that regard, the Commonwealth Government cannot accept the entire responsibility. self said the other day that there should have been some Commonwealth control. But a huge co-partnership was entered into between Commonwealth and States, in which the former undertook to find the money on loan, and the latter to find the land and generally administer and organize its settlement. Is the Commonwealth Government to be held entirely responsible for every purchase made by each State, and for every phase of activity in each State? Commonwealth Government found the money, they surely should have secured some control. ment should have, exercised some closer form of supervision; but it would have been impossible to have overlapping control and clashing authority. I ask the For a honourable member not to be specially concerned with what is, after all, a passing phase of Australia's difficulties. I am one of those who believe that the bottom has not dropped out of the situation. I think I can see the elements of a great post-war revival throughout the world. The settlement of the reparations question with Germany may mean the inauguration of a great trade revival which Frankly, I do not underwill astonish the world. Our present troubles are an inevitable phase of the world's post-war crises. I repeat that the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper were not worthy of him and of his position. The procedure adopted in connection with this matter was grossly unfair to myself, to my colleagues of the Country party, and to the House generally. It was not proper for a Government Whip, practically without notice and in the last hour They have been metaphorically of the week's proceedings, to bring forward a matter of this nature, or for the Miuister to make a reply such as he has The Commonwealth has done. To begin with, I repudiate the Minister's assertion that my statements have been made with any desire to secure personal notoriety. As for that matter, I invite the House and the public to judge between the Minister and myself concerning our respective war-time activities, and in the matter of our repatriation activities since the war. I also repudiate his statement that my utterances were either incorrect or ridiculous. I was substantially right when I remarked that, approximately, £60,000,000 had been spent upon repatriation generally, apart from pensions, and that within a few years there were likely to be only a few million pounds' worth of tangible assets left. In passing, I desire to mention that the newspaper reports of my remarks to the country press were condensed. I stated that the city press had always created public opinion in Australia, and that, by reason of that fact, matters had been permitted to go on to a degree which would never have been",47,Repatriation Benefits To Ex Austbalian Imperial Fokce Men
