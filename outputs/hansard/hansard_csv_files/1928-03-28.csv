Naturally the Government desired to dispose of the gift in such a way as would best promote civil aviation, wbich has received a tremendous impetus from Captain Hinkler's successful flight.

47,Mr Parsons (Angas) [3.0],"revenue, that is the increased excise collected as a result of the bounty The gross increase to 30th June, 1928, will be £826,000, less a drawback of £326,929, leaving a net increase of £499,071. It will be seen from tbese figures that tbe net expenditure on tbe bounty, after allowing for tbe great increase in revenue due to tbe bounty, will be only £391,385 ou 30th June next, if tbe ls. 9d. bounty is maintained. Of course, if tbe bounty is reduced, there will be a considerable reduction in tbe amount of excise collected between now and June. It is evident, then, from an examination of the figures that instead of tbe wine bounty having cost the country over £1,000,000 as stated, it has actually cost not more than £391,385. Eor that expenditure we bave saved thousands of returned soldiers from ruin, and we have saved for the Government tbe money-running millions of pounds-which it has spent in putting these men on tbe land in the Murray district and elswbere. I hope that the Government, after having done so well, will not fall down on tbe job at this stage, and spoil tbe good effect of its work in the past. Tbe figures already quoted refer only to tbe increased excise collected on fortifying spirit for winemaking, but excise is also collected on grape brandy. venue derived from both sources from 1922 to 1927 amounts to £3,042,957. An industry which provides sucb large revenue sbould receive very careful consideration from tbe Government, which should be careful that it does nothing wbich might put that industry out of existence. Tbe Prime Minister, when introducing tbe Bounty Bill in 1924, said that tbe wine industry was in tbe unique position of providing its own bounty, and that although tbe situation might be considered ripe for a reduction in excise duty, it bad been arranged, after consultation with the growers, to leave thc duty as it was, so as to provide a fund out of wbicb to pay tbe bounty. Tbe principal argument at tbe present time for tbe reduction of tbe bounty is that the new Britisb tariff introduced in April of last year, bas so improved tbe position of the exporters that the industry can very easily do witb less than Is. 9d. per gallon, and that tbe Government is Mr Pa/rsons. therefore, justified in reducing tbe bounty to ls. In fact the Prime Minister said that if tbe Governmem was deserving of criticism at ail, it was because it bad not withdrawn the bounty altogether. That sounds' very well, but if tbe Government wiped out tbe bounty, it would lose tbe only chance it bad of fixing tbe price of grapes for tbe growers. It is the growers for whom tbe Prime Minister bas at all times acted, and I trust that be will continue to act for tbem in tbe future. Tbe Prime Minister said last night that threats bad been received to tbe effect .that if tbe growers did not protest against this reduction, the wine-makers would cease to buy grapes from tbem. I wisb to state emphatically that that is not tbe position. The growers bave, of their own free will, prointo tested against tbe proposed reduction, and not because of any pressure brought to bear on tbem by the wine-makers. Mr S. W. Coombe came down from Renmark to Adelaide, and was prepared to come ou to Canberra, if necessary, before he even saw any of tbe wine-makers. I am not speaking on behalf of tbe winemakers, but I mention that in common -justice to them. I bave received a number of telegrams in connection witb this The total rematter, the first being in reply to a message I sent to the Secretary of the Grape Growers' Association of South Australia. It reads as follows:Thanks for the informaton. Association objects to reduction of bounty. Brief and concise, but very much to. the point. Tbe next is from S. Smith& Sons, Yalumba, and is as follows:If Parliament reduces bounty to Is., it will smash every wine district, and whole industry .in Australia. Federal and State monies represented in vineyards Murray River and elsewhere will be entirely lost. We cannot export one gallon if bounty reduced, and' viticultural interests will be bankrupt: Another telegram is from ""Waikerie:Please watch growers' interests wine bounty. A further telegram, dealing with the position of the dried fruits industry, has been Australian wine received from Herbert, Moorook distillery. . It is as follows:Proposed reduction wine bounty will restrict my dried fruit purchases for distillation by £4,000 per year. Please protest vigorously. I received the following telegram from Mr Coombe before he left Renmark:Suggested reduction bounty remarked here as dishonourable betrayal in view makers pay , agreed fixed grape prices depending on three ' shillings bounty Position in England now critical and frost almost ruined many growers. Kindly wire main points of. measure. Any use my going Canberra give you all the facts. We trust all South Australians vote against. I wish to clear away any impression that I wired asking Mr Coombe to come to Canberra. I did not receive that telegram, because of delayed transmission, u n t i l Mr Coombe was in Adelaide. Both the Prime Minister and the Ministerf o r Markets stated that the attempt to blend wines in GreatB r it a in has been a failure. They mentioned that some pipes had burst, the inference being that the attempt had been abandoned. The whole of the available evidence is to the contrary. Blending is no new business in England. Prior to 1882, the importations of wine into GreatB r it a in had been only in two grades, 30 degrees proof spirit over and above. In 1882 the British Government rearranged its wine duties, and graded wines into ' three spirit strengths; not exceeding 26 degrees, exceeding 26 degrees and not exceeding 30 degrees, and exceeding 30 degrees. The following tables reveal to what extent the increase of 4 degrees in the alcoholic l i m it allowed at the lowest rate of duty since 1S82 has been taken advantage of by Spain and Portugal:1882. Not exceeding 2G degrees Between 2(1 and 30 degrees Exceeding 30 degrees .. 6,671,443 1925. Not exceeding 26 degrees Between 26 and 30 degrees Over 30 degrees Tliose figures conclusively show how successful those countries adapted their wines to the re-arrangement of the British tariff. The Prime Minister, in his argument, relied to a great extent on the fact that MrL . M . Amery, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, had been out to Australia, and had had what was evidently a heart to heart talk with him on the inatter. Mr Amery left England very shortly after the new British tariff was brought down, and before foreign wine-makers bad bad an opportunity to adapt themselves to the new conditions. cuss that subject. What he discussed was the possibility of such action. was speaking only about the future. I am referring to tbe present. reference to Mr Amery. I have made the position quite clear. Prime Minister founded his opinion upon what Mr Amery bad told bim. Some other source of information indicates that pipes have burst during the blending process in England. It is quite possible for a pipe to burst occasionally, but tbe fact that there is 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine at present in bond in London is sufficient answer to the doubt as to whether blending is going on or not. I shall deal with tbe figures of tbe i m portations of wine into GreatB r it a in for the year 1927. They totalled 18,566,514 gallons, and came from the following sources:Gallons.

If the Britisb tariff was truly effective, as is claimed, Australian wine would be 2s. to 3s. a gallon cheaper than foreign wine, and there would not be 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine lying in bond unsold. Eighty per cent, of the wine consumed in GreatB ritain is sold primaril y because it is cheap. The popular wine is that sold",21,Paterson

51,Mr Parsons,"I thought that thethrough what is known as the ""halfcrown bottle trade."" If our wines were cheaper as has heen suggested the whole of our exports to Great Britain would be consumed. British merchants would then rush our product instead of refusing it, as they now do. Last year the wine consumption in Great Britain amounted to 12,000,000 gallons. Mr gallons per annum. The information I T. C. Angone, who visited Great Britain last year, and who is an authority on the subject, mentions in his report that 80 per cent, of the total consumption of wine in Great Britain is wine of a cheap nature. He mentions that the wine generally sold in Great Britain is fortified only from 27 to 30 per cent, proof spirit, and he gives a table of tariffs in operation in Great Britain at present. It readsSweet wines, not exceeding 40 per cent.. Empire grown, 4s.: foreign grown, 8s. Sweet wines, n.e.i., 25 per cent., foreign, 3s. per gallon; Empire grown, n.e.i., 27 per cent., 2s. per gallon; British, i.e., manufactured in England (excise), ls. per gallon. The selling prices out of bond are:-Lisbon, Ss. 6d. per gallon; Tarragona, 8s. I d . ; Greece, 6s. 3d. During the same period the makers of British wine were quoting their commodity at 5s. per gallon delivered to merchants' stores. Another factor in the situation is the South African wine, which is quoted at 8s. per gallon, duty paid, landed. The production of South Africa is 7,000,000 gallons per annum, and is rapidly growing. The price of Australian wine is-f.o.b . Australia, wood extra, 3s. 3d. per gallon; wood, charges and freight, ls. 10d., duty 4s., making the price, duty paid and landed, 9s. l d . It will be seen that at the present time Australian wine is dearer than any other on the British market. to any other? I remind honourable members that if the consumer can get what will suit him for 2s. 6d. a bottle, it is hard to persuade him to pay 3s. or 3s. 6d. for something which to his uncultivated palate has no advantage over the cheaper article. have already said that 80 per cent, of the wine trade in Great Britain is done in what is known as "" the half-crown bottle "", and price is the main consideration. I have seen letters from wine merchants and others in London stating that the British wine is wholesome and palatable, and that the trade in it is growing. I was astounded to hear the Prime Minister say last night that the production of British wirie has increased to 2,250,000 received about a year ago was that the production did not exceed 1,000,000 gallons. Obviously the British wine-makers have been busy in the meantime. The fact that impresses one from a consideration of. all the data available, is that the British tariff does not afford effective preference to Empire wines. The laid-down cost, duty paid, of Australian wines in England compares most unfavorably with the prices of wines from every other country. pete with our better wines. of the wines consumed in Great Britain are of the cheaper varieties. I propose to read some extracts from letters received, not by proprietary wine makers, but by a soldiers' co-operative distillery, regarding the prospects of the overseas' trade. Burnside and Company wrote from London on 14th December lastThe lack of sales we put down to the increased duty of 3s. per gallon which came into force in the last British budget. Prior to the last British budget, Australian wine was sold on this market at a comparatively cheap price, and it was this fact alone that accounted for the large demand. Cheapness was the predominating factor. The British wines are our greatest competitors and they sell for usual terms British port at 5s. per gallon, duty paid, wood returnable, whereas Australian wines have to be sold at 9s. 6d. and 10s. per gallon, duty paid. Charles Pearson, of Liverpool, wrote on 1st NovemberExcept in the case of exceedingly advertised brands, the price to the consumer in this country will have to be kept down to something in the neighbourhood of 2s. 6d. per bottle. Your wines may be worth more, but when the man who consumes wine of this character can get British red at anything from 2s. to 2s. Cd. per bottle, it takes a lot of salesmanship to persuade him to buy Australian at 3s. and 3s. 6d. per bottle.. I know I of many instances where patriotic buyers have pushed Australian wine on, getting a nice trade together for it at 2s. 6d. to the consumer, who are now faced with increasing the price, to 3s.

Portal, Dingwall and Norris, of London, wrote on 19th January of this yearWe feel in the immediate future the trade in Australian sweet wines is too uncertain for us to be in a position to make you any proposition. I quote now from the Murray Tioneer of the 23rd December, 1927. It is the best authority in Australia on irrigation matters, and tbe wine and dried f r u it s industries in the Murray ValleyA failure of eitlier the British Government or the Australian Parliament to continue the present preferences and bounties would result in the immediate dislocation and cessation of the'export of Australian wine to Great Britain. them. . . . . On the prices declared by the Tariff Board last year, and with mixed spirit averaging (is. per proof gallon, the net margin of profit to the shipper of wines to the London market after collecting the bounty to pay expenses was lOd. per gallon. . . . . It is significant that many of our best known winemakers are leaving the export' trade severely alone, and are concentrating on building up the Australian market.' And who can blame them ? Since that was written tbe prices of grapes and spirit to the wine-maker has been slightly increased, and if the bounty is reduced by 9d. the wine-maker w ill have a margin of only l d . . to meet those in creased costs. granted.] Tbere is much more matter that I could place before the House; but I do not propose to take undue advantage of the kindness of bonorable members in extending my time. I have placed before tbem facts and figures which indicate clearly the position of the industry, and, while asking for consideration for the grape growers as an act of justice, I appeal also to tbe sympathy of honourable members. The people engaged, in this industry passed through a very bard time prior to the introduction of the wine bounty. They bave since been strenuously engaged in building up tbeir business. In October last tbe grapegrowers were visited by one of the most disastrous frosts ever experienced in the Murray Valley. They had to apply to the State Government for financial assistance to tide them over tbeir time of distress. Now tbe business which they bave so laboriously built up is jeopardized by tbe proposal to reduce tbe bounty, and so exterminate the export trade. I appeal to honourable members on behalf of the returned soldiers who were persuaded by Federal and State Governments to engage in this industry, and their women and children, who have done their part towards making the properties pay. I appeal, also, on behalf of the men who are not returned soldiers,, and their f a m i lies. Tbey are anxiously awaiting the result of this debate, and I ask honourable members to pause ere they do an injustice which they will live to regret. If the House is to err at all in dealing with this matter, let it err not in the direction of parsimony, but rather in tbe direction of liberality to tbese people, who deserve the best that Parliament can give raised by this b ill . is whether the winemaking industry is worth saving. Tbere may be some people wbo think that it is not; my knowledge and experience convince me that it is. Honourable members must recollect that the conditions obtaining in this industry in Australia are vastly different from those 'prevailing abroad. Longer hours of work, lower rates of pay, and more backward industrial conditions generally in European countries have compelled us to protect our industries by means of substantial [Extension of time customs duties and bounties. We all are aware how the export trade in butter was promoted by the bounties granted many years ago. The industry was placed on a sound basis, and tbe Commonwealth still retains an export trade which is worth approximately £10,000,000 annually. Recently.this Parliament granted to the dried fruit s industry assistance amounting to £199,499, and a similar amount was paid in respect of the export of canned fruits. As a result two very important industries . were saved from destruction. Butf or the liberal assistance given by the Government, the canneries in the Shepparton Valley would have closed down, considerable unemployment would have been caused, and a large area of land, which is now being successfully cultivated, would have become vacant. The bounties paid in respect of wire netting and barbed wire amounted to £426,700 and £412,720 respectively. Because steel manufacture is a key industry we are agreed that its encouragement by means of",24,Paterson
56,Mr Cook ( I N D I ) [3.31],"Tb e issuebounties and duties is a sound policy. I approve of what the Government has done to protect these industries. ""We have paid £165,000 in bounties on sulphur with the object of assisting the primary producer. Such action is to be praised, for indirectly it benefits the whole community. When the wine export bounty was first instituted, tbe grape growing industry was in a perilous condition; in fact, those engaged in it were faced with ruin. But now the industry is being firmly established. considering this subject, it should be borne in mind, as the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) showed us when introducing his first Wine BountyB ill , tbe industry has itself provided the money boiinty. is invested in this industry; the annual expenditure upon it is £1,000,000, and its annual wages b ill is £68,000 The Commonwealth and State Governments, acting in co-operation, have settled many returned soldiers along the Murray Valley, and sbould now do everything possible to assist the men to make a success of their holdings. I submit that, if we reduce the bounty, we shall greatly militate against their success. to the introduction of this bounty, we bad practically no export business in sweet wine, but now our sweet wines, and particularly our port, are regarded on the'British market as being equal, if not superior, to tbe best produced in other parts of the world. About £2,000,000 of Britisb capital is coming in this industry to Australia annually. The payment of the bounty bas involved an expenditure of £1,150,385, but we have bad returned to us in excise duties £2,712,219. The bounty was designed to assist tbe grape-growers, and it bas bad that effect. Touching this point, the following letter, dated tbe 11th March, 1928, has reached me from tbe secretary of tbe Grape Vendors' Association, of Rutherglen:I was instructed at a largely attended meetof which Ave cannot be expected to be ing ot small vine-growers and soldier settler vine-growers held to-day to bring before your notice the serious effect the frequent alteration of the wine bounty will have on the growers of grapes who are not wine-makers. The buyers of grapes have to purchase their grapes twelve months before they can turn their wine into money. Buyers are naturally disinclined ifr. Cook. to operate when they arc unable to forecast the probable return for their wine. It may be true that the English importers are making more than a fair profit. But that fact is poor consolation to the grower who is unable to sell his grapes. The vine-growing industry probably employs more labour per acre than any other industry carried on without irrigation. At the present juncture it would be disastrous if the great number of unemployed was added to through the vine-growers failing to gather their crops and ceasing to work their vineyards, to say nothing of thc great loss of capital involved. The members of our association urge you, sir, to do your very best in In opposing the proposed reduction of the boiuity. It must be gratifying to tbe Prime Minister to know that the efforts of the Government to assist the grape-growers that have been appreciated. I now turn to a consideration of tbe effect of tbe bounty for the payment of tbe upou tbe wine-makers. Tbeir position is In round figures, £20,000,000 made clear in a short statement supplied to me, wbich sets out tbatPreference in Great Britain to Empire wines is 4s. per gallon; but the act is being defeated by importing wine under 25 per cent, spirit at 3s. per gallon duty, and wine 40 per cent, spirit at Ss. per gallon duty, ancl blending them in the ratio of 2 to 1, making the actual duty they pay about 4s. 8d. per gallon; or our preference only 8d. per gallon, instead of 4s. us was intended. PriorI u tbe light of that statement, the Prime Minister appeared to be somewhat astray in bis facts last night, or else I misunderstood him. He said that the attempts that bad been made to blend low and bigb strength wines in Great Britain had been conducted on a fifty-fifty basis, but the wine-makers assure me that the practice is to blend two gallons of low strength wine, upon which a duty of 3s. per gallon is paid, with one gallon of high strength wine, on which the duty is Ss. per gallon, tbe average duty on tbe three gallons of blended wine thus being 4s. Sd. per gallon. Seeing that we have a preference of only 4s. per gallon on our sweet wines wbich have to enter-into competition with tbe blended -wine, our effective preference is only 8d. per gallon. Wine making and marketing is a highly specialized business, with all the details familiar. For that reason, we sbould give very careful consideration to tbe representations of those who thoroughly understand it . I am informed that the cost of landing our wine on the British market is as follows:Price of wine, f.o.b.. 3s. 3rl. per gallon; casks, freight and other charges, Is. lOd. per gallon; duty, 4s. per gallon; total, 9s. l d . It has been said that the wine-makers are obtaining handsome profits from their activities under the present arrangement, but. I am assured that that is not so. The makers are prepared to give an independent auditor complete access to their books and records to enable him to report to the Government, the actual facts of the case. The bounty has undoubtedly had the effect of increasing the price of grapes. Prior to its introduction, grapes were allowed to rot on the vinesj and the industry had almost collapsed. Prices for grapes ranged from 30s. per ton upwards, but there was no market for the fruit. Upon the introduction of the bounty the price for doradillos was fixed at £5 per ton, but as much as £6 and £6 10s. per ton was paid for them. It would therefore appear that the granting of the bounty has led to the success of the industry. Regarding the price received for grapes, several of the larger shippers in the district can readily show that only a profit of 4d. a gallon was made on exported wine. Therefore, the small grower and wine-maker, and also the grower of doradillo grapes for spirit purposes, have receivedthe bulk of the bounty. The small grower finds it more convenient to sell to the large grower than to arrange finance for export. The figures that I have given regarding the wine industry in my electorate can easily be verified. Wine-makers who had kept their wines in cellars for two or three years may have made n substantial profit when tlie bounty first operated; but, apart from that, tbe bounty has been of considerable benefit to tbe industry as a whole. If it is reduced, a serious blow, will be dealt at tbe small growers, who in many cases have families, and are living under struggling conditions, on holdings of about 20 acres. Tbis is a primary industry that pays 100 per cent, in excise duty, and that should surely be an argument in favour of tbe retention of the present bounty. Tbe Prime Minister last night referred to imported must, and one statement be made was that the total consumption of must, as far as he could gather, was somewhere in the vicinity of from 2,250,000 to 2,500,000 gallons. Those importations, on wbicb a duty of ls. a gallon is paid, must bave a detrimental effect on the sale of Australian wines, the duty on which is 4s. a ' gallon. The sale of inferior wines must injure to a considerable extent the sale of better wines. I desire to place on record a few figures that I have gathered. The excise revenue received for 1926-27, which was £435,158, is about -£100,000 less than the actual revenue for that period, since it docs not include excise on wine fortified in bond, payment of which was deferred, a concession permitted for the first time in that financial year. In the current financial year, shipments were abnormally heavy. In tbe first half year, from July to December, 1927, and especially in July and August of that year, exporters rushed away all the wine they could in order to secure the higher bounty of 4s. a gallon. Tbe high exports for the first balf of the current year will certainly not be maintained. The stocks in London are heavy and will take some months to dispose of. We heard from tbe Prime Minister last night that about 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine had accumulated in London. The consumption in Great Britain is 9,000,000 gallons annually, aud it goes without saying that our stocks there will soon be consumed, leaving plenty of room for further consignments. quoted the figure of 19,000,000 gallons as the annual consumption in Great Britain for our wine trade very much better, because tbe surplus of 3,000,000 gallons on tbe London market is really insignificant. Very little wine is now being shipped, and the total* for the present financial year will not exceed that for 1926-27 by anything like what bas been anticipated in certain quarters. About 2,400,000 gallons of fortified wine were shipped in the period from July to December, 1927, or more than the total shipments in 1926-27. We cannot expect to continue shipments of that description, but providing the bounty remains unaltered tbe position will be satisfactory to tbe growers. By chipping and chopping about in the way we are doing, we dishearten the grower and",25,Paterson

58,Mr Cook,"That makes the prospectthe exporter, and interfere considerably with the regular flow overseas and the market generally The benefits of the bounty are very evident as from a poor condition the wine industry has been raised to one of comparative prosperity. Previously, the only wine exported was some 750,000 gallons of dry wine, a trade which we still hold. We now ship in addition over 2,000,000 gallons of sweet wine. have hardened considerably, while the price of doradillos has doubled. Prior to the bounty, many doradillos were left to rot on the vine. These statements are true and cannot be contradicted. We have had gratifying results from the bounty, and the industry is now financing itself. It is, therefore, difficult to tbe price fixed, be would consider abolishunderstand the action of the Government in seeking to hamper tbe wine export trade. A serious curtailment of the bounty must injure the industry. The restriction of export and accumulation of stock will lead to price cutting and a reversal to tbe conditions prevailing iu 1922-23, just prior to the introduction of concerned the wine-makers are only the bounty. We do not want a return to the deplorable conditions which existed I wish also to place on record the figures in 1923. We then had the spectacle of men seeking employment, asking for reduced rentals, threatening to abandon tbeir holdings, and failing to meet tbeir interest payments. bounty must recoil on the small growers, and bring about hardships. Doradillo grape growers would suffer more than the growers of wine grapes, because without a demand for fortifying spirit, doradillo grapes are worthless. The producers of dried grapes would also suffer because distralian vine-growers has been in excess of paytillation helps them materially by tbe eliminating of mucb faulty fruit from tbe dried fruit market. The Prime Minister stated that something like 45,000 tons of fresh grapes were made into wine. Probably tbey brought a price equal to that which would have been obtained had they been made into dried fruits. The disis in the vicinity of £3,000,000, while the tilleries have absorbed a considerable quantity of inferior fruit, and in that refore, tbe industry is not ""cadging""; it spect have assisted the dried fruits market. When the bounty was reduced last September by ls. a gallon, it was understood that no further change would be made for three years unless justified by increased British preference. Mr Cook. has been no recent alteration in that preference if my information is correct. In addition to the 'reduction of the bounty, the grape prices, as recently fixed by the Customs department, constitute an increase of 10s. a ton as compared with last vintage. Tbese charges, just at vintage time, are viewed witb consternation by both wine makers and growers. The producers know that the Grape prices to small growers alterations must recoil on them. Tbe wine industry is being hit at every turn. The price of grapes can be fixed, but we cannot compel tbe winemakers to purchase them. The Prime Minister said last night that if he thought tbe wine-makers would threaten to refuse to purchase grapes at ing the bounty altogether. In the first place I do not approve of such a statement, and in the second place I do not believe that an individual wine-maker made such a statement as that be would refuse to buy grapes, because so far as my electorate is too willing to help the growers. in this statement showing the bounty which has been paid, as compared with the excise duty collected. The statement is as follows:A' reduction in Payments of Bounty as against Excise Duty Collected -It must be remembered that prior to the introduction of the bounty in 1024 the Australian Government had collected from Australian vine-growers a sum of £2,000,000, of which not one penny had ever been returned to them. Since the inception of the bounty the amount of excise duty on Australian grape spirit and brandy collected from Ausments made in bounty. It is thus very apparent that the Australian vigneron has paid the bounty out of his own pocket, and is still a long way ahead. I have not the figures relating to the excise collected on brandy, but the amount collected on brandy and wine together bounty paid is £1,150,000. There is paying its way handsomely. It may be stated that we must have revenue, and that the industry sbould be subject to taxation. I agree with that, but the duty on fortifying spirit was 8d. a gallon There before the war, and it is 6s. a gallon now This duty was stated to be a war measure, but how many other taxes imposed as war measures have since been reduced? Income taxation has been reduced by 33 per cent., but this duty has not been reduced by f d. In that respect, the industry bas nothing whatever to be ashamed of. The statement continuesWithout any doubt the bounty has been passed along to the small growers of grapes. In 1923 and 1924 the doradillo growers in the irrigation areas were getting from f 1 10s. to £3 for their grapes per ton, but even at those ruinous prices found it impossible to dispose of all their fruit. When the bounty was introduced it was stipulated that the grower of do.radillo grapes must be paid at least £5 per ton, that figure having been arrived at by a Government commission .as the price per ton required to enable the grower to remain on his holding. Ever since the introduction of the bounty these men have had a ready market for their grapes, and the prices of doradillos advanced to £6 10s. per ton. All other grapes also advanced in proportion. For instance, wine grapes that were worth £7 per ton in 1924 were saleable at £10 10s. in 1927. To-day the Australian exporter is receiving exactly the same price for his wine as at the commencement of the bounty in 1924, so it is evident that the increased prices paid to the growers of grapes have come out of the exporters' profit. In addition, the dried fruit-growers . have benefited greatly, for during the past three years 40,000 to 50,000 tons of lexias and currants have been turned into wine or spirit instead of being dried, and this has relieved the dried fruit market of an unsaleable surplus. Here are concrete facts concerning what has been done for the man on the land, whom I believe every bonorable member in this House desires to assist. Only a very small profit has been made by the exporters as a whole. I am speaking now for tbe Rutberglen district; the same does not apply, I know, to South Australia where the wine industry has been longer established, and where they did not suffer the same set-back as we did in Victoria. The'statement goes onProfit made by Exporters -This profit has been very small, and in the Butherglen district the largest exporters have averaged 4d. per gallon profit-abou t 5 per cent. shipping price is well known, and the larger grower is compelled to pay export parity less a small working profit when buying either grapes or wine. In my district the wine-makers and tbe growers bave endeavoured to work amicably together. Dealing with tbe effect of a reduction in the bounty, the statement addsShould the bounty be either discontinued or reduced to an unoperative basis the effect to-day would be to place the industry in a much more disastrous position than it was in 1924. This can be readily understood when it is remembered that practically the whole surplus of the dried fruit market has been diverted into wine and spirit since the bounty created a new market. To-day the production of dried fruit is about double* what it was in 1924, and new areas have been planted in the irrigation districts, and have still to come into bearing. I bave a vivid recollection of an assurance given by the late Comptroller General of Customs to tbe effect that tbe balance of tbe 1927 vintage, over and above the 25 per cent, which was exported, was legally entitled to the bounty. The manufacturers accepted this assurance iu good faith, and held back 75 per cent, of their wine so that it might be properly matured. This was done to build up tbe reputation of Australian wines both at Home and in Australia, and they believed that they would obtain tbe bounty as then laid down, irrespective of what alterations might be made in the act. The Government is to be congratulated upon the assistance which it has already given to the industry, but it bas been abundantly proved that, up to tbe present, the industry has really financed itself. We are now on the -verge of capturing a large market for our wine, and this is not the point at which we sbould turn back from assisting the industry. The Hume Weir bas already cost £6,000,000, and will cost £14,000,000 before it is completed. How are we ro pay tbe interest and sinking fund charges on that sum if we do not put the water that we conserve to the best use; namely, the growing of grapes for wine-making and drying ? This has already been pointed out to us in tbe report of the Development and Migration Commission. Irrigated lands must necessarily be held in small areas, and for no kind of farming can the holdThe ings be made so small as for grape-growing, in which a decent living can be made on from seven to twenty acres of land. I bave no doubt that if the Government will stick to tbe industry, and pay a bounty on a tapering rate for a few more years we shall succeed, to a large extent, in capturing the Home market for our wines. If we can do that, it will increase the prosperity of the country, and will assist materially in reducing our adverse trade balance. Furthermore, the industry will employ a large amount of labour for such operations as tilling and picking, pruning, vat-making, cask-making, and cellar construction, besides adding to the revenue of the railways. It must be evident to all, therefore, that instead of hampering the industry as this measure, if passed, will do, we should endeavour to give confidence to the exporters, and to encourage the growers to the fullest extent. An inquiry should have been held by the most competent authority which Parliament could select before any action so drastic as this was taken. The matter might have been referred to the Tariff Board, but if that body was not considered Suitable, some other authority might 'have been appointed. have been made which conflict seriously with those put forward by the Government. It is stated, for instance, that the preference to Australian wines in Great Britain is actually only 8d. a gallon, instead of 4s. a gallon as claimed. future. Wby not allow matters to reSurely that is worthy of investigation. It has also been stated that tbe profit made by exporters in my district is only 4d. a gallon. I know that in South Australia tbere are wine-makers who would not care if tbey did not receive any bounty. Tbey are in a sound position, and are doing very well out of the Australian trade, which tbey have largely captured. South Australia has practically the whole of tbe Western. Australian trade, and is making a big bid for the Victorian trade as well. However, those few large makers comprise the industry, which, as a whole, is in sucb a position that it needs the continuation of tbe encouragement wbich the Government has been wise and far-seeing enough to grant it in the past. Before introducing this bill the Government should have investigated the statements of those in tbe industry. all due respect to honourable members, there is not one of them wbo knows tbe industry as many people amongst the manufacturers and growers whom I could mention. Those engaged in tbe industry are playing the game. They do not come into the lobbies of this House to pester honourable members to champion their cause. They leave it to the conMr Cook. science of honourable members to serve them honestly and well. I urge the Government, even at this eleventh hour, not to rush this bill through. This is uot a party question. Why not adjourn the debate, in order that we may collaborate in tbe endeavour to formulate an arrangement that would be reasonable and acceptable to all concerned. Tbe Minister has granted f u l l preference to Canadian export, and I feel that the least that can be granted to tbe growers is a complete honouring of tbe existing agreement, to cover all tbe 1927 vintage. It is probable that forward contracts would absorb that vintage, so that actually it would not be a very great concession. I also urge that the rebate sbould not be on the fictitious figure of ls. 3d., but on the actual figure of Is. 7d. Statements This is a reasonable request. I have enumerated points that cannot be challenged. It is likely that the British Government may amend its preferential treatment in the near main in abeyance meanwhile? The wine industry is paying its way, and delay would not bring catastrophe upon any one. The Prime Minister referred to excessive overhead costs, and to the necessity for organization. The present Minister for Markets( Mr Paterson) has done much to eliminate tbe middleman in the grape and wine industry, and growers are doing their best to cut down overhead costs. Tbey are not responsible for those costs. They are loaded with a duty on casks and other do not requirements of tbe trade with excessive rates of pay imposed by tbe arbitration courts and with the operation of tbe Navigation Act. I have here a glaring example of tbe handicap under wjiich Australia is labouring through having to pay the high wages which prevail in this country. In France and Germany tbere Witb exists a 55 to 60 hour week, whereas in Australia we have a 44-hour week. The following is thescale of weekly wages operating in the respective countries:France and Germany. Australia. Men 25s. to 50s. 84s. to 120s. (Victoria) Boys 6s. to 17s. 20s. to 45s. Women 15s. to 25s. 40s. to 70s. Girls 5s. to 12s. 15s. to 35s. I hope to see our standard maintained, but my table illustrates what Australia is up against. growers are able to bave their vintages picked at the rate of 3s. per day, from sunrise to sunset, whereas our award provides for 14s. 6d. per day in the Eutherglen district, and is, no doubt, similarly bigb elsewhere in Australia. I urge the Prime Minister to re-consider the matter, and not to insist on an immefor the alleged Country party at the last diate reduction of 9d. in the bounty. Even better than tbe courses I bave advocated would be an extension of tbe bounty, say for five years. That would give the growers time to organize, and tbey would bave tbe advantage of knowing exactly where they stood. After close co-operation with the growers and wine-makers, I can assure the Minister that those people will, be very mucb disappointed witb the Government if it puts this reduction of 9d. a gallon into immediate operation.

It has also band, tbe government changed there been emphasized during the debate that 25 per cent, of the bounty comes back to the Government in the form of excise duties. In all the circumstances, it must be agreed that the duty of deciding whether the bounty shall be reduced or continued at the old rate rests upon the Government. I regard auy proposal for the reduction of a bounty or any refusal to grant a fresh bounty as of such importance that I should probably support it if I were satisfied that substantial justice would be achieved by such action. The question is: will substantial justice be done in this case if the bounty bill passed last year, in a very unforis reduced as proposed? If it could be demonstrated that it will, I would support a reduction even though it might adversely affect my State. As a matter of fact, there are very few vignerons among my own constituents. But I do not think that substantial justice will be desirous of following the Prime Minisdone if this proposal is approved. I suggested in the course of his speech last night that if the Government had intended to review this matter after the act had been in operation for only twelve mouths it should have provided for the payment of the bounty for one year only and not for three. I do not think that the right honourable gentleman dealt effectively with that point. Obviously, the intention of the Government in providing that the bounty should be paid for three years ""was that those interested in the industry should be assured of some continuity of stable conditions. I admit, of course, that the Minister in bis speech said that there was a possibility of the bounty being reduced if conditions improved in regard to British preference. able member that the reason for stipulating a period of three years was to give the security that the growers would be no worse off during that period than tbey were when the original bill was introduced. A period of three years was preferable to one year. stipulation necessary? If the government in power was in a position to say that tbe conditions would remain unaltered for three years, there was no risk to the wine industry; and if, on the other would be-nothing to prevent tbe incoming government from altering the conditions laid down by this Government. previous contracts. reducing the bounty, and that is being done now. duced because of altered circumstances. duction in bounty will place tbe winemakers, who acted on tbe strength of tbe tunate position, and a substantial injustice may be done to tbem. I bave been informed that a considerable amount of wine from the 1927 crop has been held in Australia for two reasons. The first is that a good many wine-makers were ter's advice, which he referred to to the Prime Minister yesterday, "" to build up towards the better maturing of their wines."" Many wine-makers bave kept tbeir wines with that object in view. Is it reasonable that those who are trying to improve the standard of their products should lose the bounty, while others who exported tbeir wine the moment it was put in the casks bave received tbe benefit of tbe bounty? That does not seem to be a fair way to treat men who are following the advice given to tbem by this Government. The second reason is that the wine is being kept here to avoid further glutting of the already glutted Britisb market. I understand that in some cases contracts are held, but the wine has been retained bere. I followed what tbe right bonorable gentleman said about taking the question of contracts into account, but I wisb to ask why the merchants who have kept tlieir wines here to prevent a glut in Great Britain, and are thereby assisting in the "" orderly marketing of our products,"" which they have been so often asked to do, should be penalized under the bill?

Why has there been all .this delay? Was tbere any necessity for it? many complaints. Tbe Register of tbe 10th of this month published a letter from Mr L. N . Salter, the president of the Federal Viticultural Council, a gentleman whose opinion should be read if not adopted. He calls this a belated proposal and saysThe feeling among wine-makers generally was that it was very unfair to have left this proposal until so late in tlie day. No indication had been received by them that the Government contemplated such an action. As a matter of fact, last night the Prime Minister, when the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) was speaking, interjected that this matter had not been decided when tbe Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) left for New Zealand. It is therefore obvious that it was decided in great haste, or, at any rate, at very short notice. The letter continuesContracts had been entered into for the purchase of grapes and spirit and for the sale of the wine to be made from these, and the winemaker was now faced with the position of having to complete his contracts for the purchase of grapes and spirit, and to accept 9d. a gallon less for the wino made from these. The prices for export wines, specified in the contracts, without exception to his knowledge, were on a f.o.b. basis, the wine-maker to collect in the interests of the growers, but this the bounty, so that the full loss of 9d. a gallon last action will react upon. tbem. It bas would fall upon him. Last year grape prices had been fixed by the Government after the vintage. These prices were higher than those which had been decided upon, and upon which contracts for the sale of wine had been based, hence the increase in prices fixed by the Government was a distinct loss to the makers, as they were unable to obtain commeasurately higher prices for the wine. The position this year, if the bounty was to be reduced to Is., would be considerably worse. Therefore, from the point of view of the policy bounty reduction, which means ruinaFederal Viticultural Council, tbe Governtion of district. ment, by delaying tbe announcement of This grape-growers' association consists prices, has brought about an unfortunate not of wine-makers, but of grape-growers, position. No explanation has been given and tbey are sufficiently concerned about why they should have been announced so the Government's proposal to send me a late, and after the bill reducing the wire saying that a reduction of bounty bounty had been introduced. fairly ask tbe reason for this sudden reduction. It has been suggested by a previous speaker that it is because of financial stringency. Tbat may be so, but it sbould not prevent tbe House from doing justice to the wine-makers. I admit that tbey bave done very well out of the bounty, but if tbey have benefited under A similar delay last year led to the original act passed by this House at the instigation of the Government, that is to tbeir advantage, and is no reason wby tbey should be penalized and treated as scapegoats. It may be that tbe object of tbe bill is to aim another blow at South Australia, wbicb bas recently, its people think, received a number of severe, set-backs from tbe Federal Parliament. Is the proposal to penalize the winegrowers for the increase of exported wines from 649,000 gallons to over 3,000,000 gallons? The Minister stated that be thought bonorable members would agree that tbe industry had been shown every consideration so far. This proposal seems to me to show an extraordinary lack of consideration to the growers, many of whom have already taken tbeir grapes to tbe distilleries. Just before I left South Australia, a case came under my notice of .a man wbo had taken his grapes to the wine-makers, but tbey were unable to give bim a quotation because t tbey did not know what price was to be paid. Is that fair, either to the winemaker or to the grower? This has happened previously, and is certainly unfair to those connected witb the industry. It sbould not occur at all. The fact remains that the first action was taken primarily beeu said that the reduction of tbe bounty will affect only tbe wine-maker, and that tbe price to the grower will not be altered. In that respect I wish to quote part of a telegram which has been sent to me from the Mayor of Clare and the secretary of the Clare Grape-Growers' Association of South Australia. It readsMeeting held last night re Government One may will mean the ruination of the district.",35,Paterson
97,Mr Duncan,"Hughes.My fourth suggestion is that the reason for this proposal may be found in the Adelaide News of the 19th of this month. That publication contains a long statement by Mr F. R, Chalk, of Tangari this firm is a big wine-maker, but it is oertajnly not well known. He has a tremendous Jot to say on the subject, ancl be seems to be in favour of tbe bill. He saysThere was some justification for the action of the Federal Government in reducing the export bounty on Australian wines from ls. 9d! to ls. a gallon. The industry required complete re-organization, and wine for export should be of standardized quality. He believed that the real reason why the bounty was reduced was that the Federal Government desired to have introduced some method of controlling the export of wines. Twelve months ago MrH . E. Pratten, Minister for Trade and Customs, stated that unless steps were taken to organize tlie industry the Government would probably take action to control exports. A t present the vine-growers and wine-makers were absolutely disorganized. . . . . The wine industry in Australia should Ibe Te-organized, and the sooner the work was taken in hand the better for all concerned. A t present not two wine-makers -were exporting the same standard of wirie. This looks very much like propaganda, and seems to be almost entirely in favour of this particular bill. view expressed here is one which I do not think is held by most of tbe older and better known wine-makers in South Australia. I sbould like to know from the Minister whether the action which is being taken is the result of a desire or an intention to coerce the wine-makers, so that a control of export may result. or intention. freely stated last year that tbe attitude of tbe Minister towards the wine-makers was that unless they hurried and brought in some form of control of their own, the Government would take tbe matter out of tbeir bands, and introduce a form of government control. orable member that the only reason wbich actuated the Government was the alteration in tbe Britisb preference. the Minister's statement on that point. There is a further statement by tbe Minister that an industry which is seeking to build up a trade connection in a new market must altogether dislodge its competitors. been correctly represented. I said, "" It must endeavour to dislodge its competitors."" possible to dislodge the old-established wines from the British market. pletely dislodge; I said endeavour to dislodge. indicates that the Minister believed that there was some prospect of success. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to dislodge tbe German, French, and Spanish wines from the British market. Anybody who bas even an elementary knowledge of the Englishman, knows that he usually drinks a wine because it is of a certain standard of quality to which be is used. There always will be a great many men wbo will continue, as long as the practice of wine drinking lasts, to choose their wine on that basis. The best thing we can do is to improve the standard of our wines and, by degress, to extend their sale The abroad. It is evident then, from what I have said, that I do not propose to support the bill as it stands. I think that something might be said for a reduction of tbe bounty as from tbe end of this year. This would afford an opportunity to manufacturers, wbo bave on their bands wine of the 1927 crop-whethe r they held it back in order to let it mature, or to avoid glutting the market-to obtain the advantage of the bounty which has already been collected by tbeir more hasty competitors. This would also have the effect of getting over tbe unfortunate position which bas arisen during this season, in which grapes have been taken into tbe cellars, while the price wbich was to be paid for tbem was not known. Now it has been announced that the prices are to be a little higher than last year, while, almost simultaneously with that announcement, comes tbe present proposal for tbe reduction in the bounty. It seems to me that tbere is a grave danger of penalizing men who bave been merely accepting the advice which tbe Government gave tbem.

Tbe Prime Minister, I think, made some remark to tbe effect that tbe wine-makers are unquestionably in a position to buy the grapes at the present time; I do not suggest that they are not. Tbe real question is: Whether it is a fair thing to force tbem to buy tbe grapes at a figure of which tbey were not aware at tbe time when tbey contracted to take tbem. not think that it is necessary for me to traverse, in detail, the arguments of honourable members who bave spoken on this subject. Tbe bonorable members for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), Angas( Mr could be shown that tbe Britisb preParsons), and Indi( Mr Cook), and others have gone exhaustively into tbe matter, and bave, in my opinion, shown bounty is reduced as proposed, it is likely to bave a very serious effect on the industry, and particularly on the grape-grower. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), whom I congratulate on bis able and moderate speech, stated that bounties are expedients. dustry was £1,150,385, leaving a balance I agree that they are. Personally, I have no lovefor bounties. I should like to see sucb a state of affairs as would enable bounties to be abolished altogether. Fortunately, in some of our primary industries no bounties bave to be paid. Our principal industries do not require tbem, and our producers do not ask for tbem. But tbere are others, like this grape-growing industry, which do require bounties, and which will, if tbey do not receive them, probably go out of existence. Before this bounty was paid, tbe grape-growers were practically down and out We bave to consider whether the industry is in a position to do without the bounty now. I have no doubt that, if this proposed reduction is made, it will affect the industry very considerably. I know that many of the growers have had a bard struggle, and most of tbem are not making more than a fair living now. If their returns are reduced, I think that tbe industry will either go out of existence altogether, or be very seriously crippled. Tbe Minister for Markets, in bis speech on Friday last, stated that be anticipated that tbe increase in tbe Britisb preference would more than make up for the decrease in tbe bounty. He may be right; but I do not think that tbere is any proof that that will be the case. If it could be proved, tbe growers, I bave no doubt, would agree to the reduction. However, when we hear of tbe large quantity of grape juice which is being imported into Great Britain, and which is competing with Australian wines to such an extent that accumulated stocks in London cannot be sold, it is evident that any decrease in the bounty will seriously injure the industry, and particularly the growers. It would be time enough for the Government to bring down the proposal when it ference had had the effect claimed for it -tba t it was, at least, a set-off against tbe proposed reduction of the bounty. On conclusively that, if the Friday, the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, in reply to tbe bonorable member for Indi( Mr Cook), stated that tbe total amount of excise paid on spirit for fortifying wines was £2,712,219, and that the total amount of the bounty paid to tbe inof £1,561,834. It is evident that the Government bas made a large revenue over and above the bounty, which indicates that there is no immediate need to reduce it. While I am not keenly in favour of bounties, I contend that they are tbe only means by wbicb primary producers, such as the grape-growers, can be protected. While protection is the policy of the Government-and I bave always been a moderate protectionistI contend that every section of tbe community ought, as far as possible to receive equal benefits. Tbe grape-growers are compelled to sell the bulk of their products in the markets of the world at free trade prices, and have to buy tbeir requirements'in a heavily protected market at the highest prices. What benefit will they get from tbe protection unless tbey receive a bounty, wbich is tbe only form of protection wbicb it is possible to give them?

Before the Government is justified in whittling away that bounty, it must show that it is actuated by the strongest reasons. I asked the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen), by interjection, whether he regarded this bill as an interference with a contractul obligation, and he replied "" No,"" that he thought that the speech of the Minister made it conditional; that the bounty was granted in conformity with an understanding growers. But the Wine Bounty Act obliged tbe Government to give a bounty for three years, without any conditions. Certainly the Minister for Trade and Customs, when introducing tbe measure, reserved to the Government tbe rigbt to reduce the bounty if the British preference was increased during the currency of tbe act. Possibly that may be a justification for tbe Government reducing the bounty-^provide d that it can show that the British prefer-' ence bas been .effectively increased so far as it concerns Australian grape producers. But although he spoke at some length last night tbe Prime Minister failed to convince anybody that that is so. It is easy to test whether Australian wine producers are to receive an additional advantage as a result of the recent alteration of the British preferential tariff. If they are to receive an adpamphlet wbicb I found in my mail box vantage from the new British preference which is equivalent to tbe bounty reduction proposed in this bill, the Government bas some measure of justification for its action. But if it can be shown that the recent alteration of tbe British preference means but a little advantage for Australian wine producers, the .Government is without justification for its action. The test is, will the introduction of this bill have any adverse effect upon the grape-growers of Australia? arms against it? tinent query. Are these people simply the change was calculated to give Empire contumacious, rising against the Governsweet wines, for the first time, a really effecment without due cause? Are they in4s. augurating an Australian-wide agitation duty on Tarragona and Lisbon wines to 8s. per without good grounds? Will our growers gallon. suffer any adverse effects as to price or as to the quantity of grapes that will come under the operation of the bounty provisions? In either case, one cr other of these points is involved. They would suffer an adverse effect if the operation of this bill reduced tbe quantity of grapes to wbich the bounty applied through the reduction in purchases by the winemakers. Tbe bill would certainly have an adverse effect if it lowered the price obtained for grapes. Those who are concerned in the making entered into with the of wine and in the distillation of spirit in Australia consider that the conditions that will be imposed by this measure will render it uneconomical for them to go on buying grapes as they did before. If , as a result of this bill, those growers cannot produce, or tbe wine-makers cannot purchase, the same quantity of grapes as heretofore, it will prove that the bill is a breach of faith. The Prime Minister and tbe Minister for Markets bave not demonstrated that the contrary will be tbe case. The Prime Minister was at great pains last night to prove that tbe preference granted by Great Britain under the last budget proposals will equalize tbe reduction in bounties. equalize it . only this morning. It is a publication issued by the Federal Viticultural Council of Australia, and is dated October, 1927, so that, obviously, it was not compiled witb any specific intention to influence the debate now * before the House. Its views may, therefore, be taken as impartial so far a3 they affect this bill. The pamphlet deals particularly with the preference. It asks, "" W ill preference be effective?"" and statesThe new budget duties, by reducing the dividing line between fortified and unfortified wines of foreign origin to 25 degrees of alcoholic strength, was hailed with much satisfactive preference of the full money value of per gallon, by automatically raising the",39,Paterson

The pamphlet continuesBut while, at first thought, effective Imperial preference seemed assured for Empire wines, a doubt as to whether the shippers of Tarragona and Lisbon wines, who had been so heavily hit, would not devise some method of evading any appreciable portion of the increased duty, was quickly voiced. That this doubt was well founded has been made plain by recent developments. These are so clearly set forth by Messrs Southard and Company Limited, of London, in their circular of June last, that is worthy of quotation. Since the new standards of strength for the lower duty wines were set up,"" it is stated, "" shippers of Spanish red and Lisbon wines have lost no time in ascertaining thc most practical means of solving, as far as possible, the problem with which they were brought face to face as a result of the budget proposals and they must, we think, be congratulated on the success attained. . . ."" Of course, the more success attained in the solution of their' problem the less effective the imperial preference"" fied themselves and have gone a long way towards convincing merchants on this side that it is quite possible to prepare wines at a strength admissible at the 3s. rate of duty and to guarantee them to arrive sound and in good condition. Beyond this, of course, they cannot be expected to go; but they assure us that, if this low-strength wine is blended judiciously immediately on arrival with a wine of the same character at a strength of, say, 40 degrees, in a proportion that will give a strength of 29 degrees to the blend, it will be equally satisfactory as though shipped at that strength as hitherto."" We have tried the experiment both with Tarragona and Lisbon wines, and the result is as predicted. tried, and therefore recommend, are three parts of 24 degrees/25 degrees to one part 41 degrees, the duty on which works out at 4s. 3d. per gallon. We are advised that it is the intention of the Spanish Government to approach the British Government with a proposal that an intermediate rate of duty, namely, 5s per gallon, should be established for wines between the strengths of 25 degrees and 30 degrees. That intermediate duty, if granted, would still further whittle away the imperial preference, but already importers are defeating that preference by importing wines and blending tbem in England, where tbey are subject to an average duty of 4s. 3d. per gallon, as compared with the 4s. duty on Australian wines. Thus the effective preference to Australia is reduced to 3d. per gallon. Does not the Prime Minister recognize that in this [28 MARCH, 1928.] Bounty Bill. 4247 way the effective preference to Australian wines is almost abolished, apart altogether from the competition of so called British wines? The preference given by the Imperial Government would be adequate if it were all that it seems; but we know that it is being defeated by the blending of imported wines and by the importation of foreign must, which is converted into what are known as British wines. The Tarragona and Lisbon wines, which are imported in large quantities, seriously compete with the Australian product. In regard to foreign must tbe booklet issued by tbe Federal Viticultural . Council of Australia saysAnother feature of the budget calling for comment was the omission of any duty on imported foreign must, and the imposition of the low duty of ls. per gallon on so-called British wines. The phrase "" so-called"" is advisedly used, because if tbese wines were entirely the product of any part of the Empire. . for many of them have satisthey would have the same right to consideration as our own wines; but tbey are. really tbe product of foreign countries, and as such should not get any advantage in competition w i th Empire products under the British preferential scheme. Even the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not in his budget speech claim for these so-called Britisb wines any special consideration on tbe ground that they are of British origin. Mr Churchill saidWhile the tax collector has hitherto levied his toll on the imported product of every vineyard, a new industry has sprung up . in these The blends that we have islands, where there are no vineyards. That industry is called British wines. Science ancl enterprise have been able to provide that the juice of the grape should bo imported in an unfermented condition, and thus avoid customs duty. The consumption of British wine has shown a striking increase in the last few years, and in 1926 the production for retail sale amounted to very nearly 1.800,000 gallons. The Prime Minister stated last night that the quantity produced last year was 2,500,000 gallonsWe may both admire and respect the ingenuity of the process, and yet feel that it is not fair that this product should continue to be immune from the taxes placed upon all other intoxicants. These wines achieve a strength of over 27 degrees in many cases, and they are, I am assured, able to bear a moderate charge. I propose, therefore, that an excise duty of ls. per gallon be placed on British wines. The circular that I am quoting proceeded tbe wine distilleries, and tbe Tariff Board to commentSurprise was expressed in many quarters tended to have that effect. Tbe Governthat the excise on these Britisli or basis wines ment, perceiving the error of its il I should have been fixed at such a low figure as balanced bounty scheme, seeks to correct, ls. per gallon.

Where Britisb preference will give more than this exceeded 27 degrees the duty would then compensating aid. be 4s. a gallon. If that duty were imposed, and there were adequate means of enforcing some margin of preference against these blended wines, the case against this bill would not be so strong. But because of these factors, which tbe Government attempts to brush aside as of little consequence, there is no justification for the reduction of the bounty on tbe ground that such reduction is counterbalanced by the increased Britisb preference. If the Prime Minister could say that tbe price prevailing now and likely to prevail during the currency of last year's Wine Export Bounty ""Act would be high enough to make tbe full amount of tbe existing bounty unnecessary, he would bave a good case for the proposed reduction, but be relies on statistics wbich are six months' old; he quoted tbe f.o.b. price at 3s. 4d. per gallon, but actual salfes by merchants since then have been at prices about 8d. per gallon less. The Government is depending on very flimsy evidence, indeed, forjustification of its endeavour to correct a grevious blunder in regard to the diversion of grapes from the drying sheds to tbe distilleries. Although the Minister has not asserted that tbe bill is introduced for that purpose, that seems to be tbe reason for it. The Tariff Board and the Development and Migration Commission have called attention to what they regard as an evil arising from the wine bounty. Tbey out that until a recent date 46,000 tons verted from the drying Ur.

Tbey say that Britisb preference has not helped tbem to the extent that the Minister declared, and the honourable member for Riverina bas told us that this proposed reduction of the bounty will seriously damage tbe industry. The honourable member for Wakefield, speaking in strong opposition to tbe bill, said that it would cause tremendous loss to the industry, and that those losses would be due to an act of deliberate repudiation on the part of the Government. There is no excuse for the action of the Government. Wben tbe Deputy Leader of tbe Opposition Mr Scullin) pointed out tbe Government's blunder in diverting fresh grapes from dried fruits to wine, tbe Government should have endeavoured to rectify its error instead of repudiating a solemn contract. Tbe Prime Minister in attempting to reply to that contention ridiculed the suggestion that the dried-fruits industry could bave absorbed tbe 46,000 tons of grapes that were converted into wine. He said that difficulty was experienced in marketing tbe dried fruits already produced. Granting that that is so, is the market for Australian wine much better? the Minister's statement.

That 3,000,000 gallons is approximately the quantity of wine that would have been produced from the 46,000 to us of fresh grapes which were diverted from the dried-fruits industry. Australia does not supply Great Britain's whole requirements of either dried fruit s or wine. Our dried fruit s are in competition with those of California, Greece, and Turkey, and we supply only a small proportion of Britain's total requirements of wine. The British market could still absorb more of these products than Australia is now supplying. I acknowledge the validity of the Prime Minister's contention that if the granting of a bounty on dried fruit s would merely mean the selling of them at prices lower than those now realized, it would have an adverse effect on the whole output. have meant. increase the sales without reducing the price. The Empire Marketing Board is applying its energies to the task of extending the market by means of publicity, grading, and standardization, and if a substantial sum of money had been made available for promoting the better marketing of our dried fruits, doubtless the sales would have been greatly increased. What is the use of the Empire Marketing Boardi f we cannot sell to the United Kingdom more f r u it than we are selling now? The Development and Migration Commission, dealing with the potential market in the United Kingdom, saidAustralia's principal market is the United Kingdom, and vigorous efforts arc now being made to push sales in that country, principally by the means of the Australian trade publicity scheme. The report then gives a table showing the imports of raisins into the UnitedK in gdom during the years 1924, 1925, and 1926. I shall not give all the details; but the table indicates that in 1924 Britain's total importation of raisins was 58,429 tons, of which Australia supplied only 18,831 tons; in 1925 her imports were 56,368 tons, of which Australia supplied only 17,605 tons, and in 1926 her imports totalled 58,296 tons, of which Australia supplied 11,093 tons. Those figures do not support the statement made by the Prime Minister last night that the market in the United Kingdom for Australian raisins had been f u l l y exploited. The position in regard to currants is somewhat similar. In this connection the report of the commission statesThe British market takes an average of 00,000 tons of currants per annum; but the demand has fallen off slightly in receut years, as a result of the housewife's preference for raisins. Tlie following table shows the imports of currants into the United Kingdom for 1924, 1925, and 1920:KlJNT.DOJt. 1924. 1925. 1920. Tons. Tons. Tons. 07,114 58,421 57,514 Of the above, the bulk of the imports were obtained from Greece. Australia sold 8,000 tons of currants in the United Kingdom in .1.920, and 4,775 tons in 1927. I have not worked out what percentage that is of the total; but it is relatively small. There must surely be a larger market for our currants in Great Britain. It is possible to We ought to be able to place a considerable additional quantity of all our dried fruit s tbere. Notwithstanding that tbe Prime Minister appears to hold the opinion that we bave reached the l i m it of our expansion in that direction, I submit that the report of tbe Development and Migration Commission, and also a report of the Tariff Board, wbich makes some pointed comments on this subject, indicate clearly that we could enlarge our market in tbe United Kingdom. Tbe wine bounty was never intended to have the effect of diverting fresh f r u it to tbe wineries. The Government has been ill advised, and has blundered seriously in this matter. I think that the industry sbould have the f u l l measure of assistance which it has received under tbe wine bounty; but in a different way. The bounty should not have been confined to wine, for that undoubtedly has bad tbe effect of causing good fresh f r u it to be dealt with uneconomically.

As it is, it bas certainly laid itself open to that accusation.

It bas undoubtedly repudiated an honorably made contract, but it shows no inclination to repent of that. It entered into a definite undertaking to provide a bounty upon all wine exported from the Commonwealth for three years, and it has given no substantial reason for attempting to evade tbe fulfilment of it. It has not been demonstrated that the additional measure of preference wbich has been granted to Australian sweet wine by tbe Britisb Government is equal in value to the industry to the amount by which the bounty is being reduced. I should like to hear what some honourable members opposite think about this dishonourable repudiation of a solemn contract. Sitting suspended from 6.18 to 8 p.m. under a debt of gratitude to the bonorable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), wbo preceded me in this debate. Wittingly or unwittingly be was quite candid about the reason for tbe strong opposition of the Labour party to the proposals of the Government. By his outburst against the policy of the Government, and the character of bis speech generally, be showed clearly that he was making nothing more than a characteristic party attack on the Government, and that his attitude towards the proposal had little to do with tbe merits of the bounty. I am but little impressed by this new born, and highly suspect sympathy of bonorable members opposite for the primary producer. The Labour party bas been brought into being, is kept in being; and is elected and controlled by tbe Trades Halls of tbe capital cities. It is therefore not only intensely interesting, but very amusing, to find this party, which has been of recent years almost completely repudiated by the primary producers of the country, now shedding tears over tbe prospective ruin of a section of tbem. I wonder that tbe bonorable member for Dalley should bave sympathy for the primary producers, because at the last general election they showed by tbeir votes that tbey bad very little sympathy with him. The honourable member spoke to-night of repudiation and tbe disposition of this side of the House to repudiate sacred pledges. I say to him that had I been re : pudiated as decisively and dramatically as he was by the farmers of North Queensland I could not find it in my heart to show them the sympathy that be bas displayed on this occasion. Honourable members opposite seem to see in this debate the possibility of securing a small passing victory over the Government. The question narrows down to a simple and definite issue. A year ago, almost to the very week, this Parliament made a conditional agreement with the wine producers of Australia. The condition laid down by the Minister in charge of the measure was that the bounty then proposed of ls. 9d. a gallon, apart altogether from excise, was to continue for three years unless-and this was a very specific exception-the British Government by a special grant of preference",43,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United

I have watched this matter since that condition was imposed, and it was my intention, had the Government not introduced this bill, to do all I could to bring about a reduction of the bounty. The question narrows down to this: Has the British preference of 4s. a gallon that was given in March last in favour of Australian wines as against the wines of Spain and Portugal been of benefit to Australian producers, and is it worth 9d. a gallon to the Australian wine-maker or grower? Prior to the amendment of the Britisb duties, tbe total benefit received by tbe Australian producer was a bounty of Is. 9d. a gallon in Australia, anda preference of 6d. in Great Britain; in other words, a total of 2s. 3d. To-day that total, under the proposal of tbe Government, will be 4s. a gallon preference and ls. bounty; 5s. as against 2s. 3d. members say that out of this gross advantage of 5s. a gallon we cannot squeeze a net advantage of 9d. a gallon at this end? If we cannot, there is indeed incompetence and inefliciency in the wine industry; but I do not believe that inefliciency or incompetency does exist in tbe industry, and were it not for such as honourable members opposite this extraordinary wholesale and questionbave been saying would convince able opposition from the other side of the House there would not be more than a dozen honourable members voting against the Government on this measure.

Is there any class in wine from Portugal and Spain has not fallen off, or have they established the fact that the wholesale or retail prices of Australian wines in London have not been increased by the action of the British preference ? Not a vestige of evidence bas been given on either of those aspects. ber bas not followed tbe case that has been put forward against the Government's proposal. lowed the debate on this bill, and I shall give honourable members actual evidence of tbe effect of the British preference. The imports into Britain of red wine from Spain and of white wine and red wine from Portugal fell off during 1927 by 1,750,000 gallons. Those are Board of Trade figures, which can be seen by any honourable member. The falling off is remarkable, considering that these new duties have been in operation for only nine months, and that it takes a considerable time to arrest importation because of commitments already entered into, and other reasons. That falling off Will bonorable is the clearest evidence that the British preferential duties have substantially retarded tbe flow of foreign wine into Great Britain in competition witb Australian wine. During tbe same nine months, however, the importation of Australian wine increased enormously. Tbat is conclusive evidence, and evidence tbem of the justice of the Government's proposals. I submit that evidence to them, and challenge tbem to disprove it or to place upon it any other construction than I have placed upon it.

The'honourable member for Angas( Mr of wine from Spain and Portugal, the Parsons) said that the wine-growing industry provides the excise, out of which, in turn, the bounty is paid. I deny that statement emphatically. Neither the wine-maker nor the grape-grower pays a penny of this excise. The wine-maker advances it, but it is actually paid by the consumer. Tbe manufacturer adds it to the price of the product in which he places the fortifying spirit on which it is charged. the excise and customs duties on tobacco tbe world over? Tbe consumer, of course. Every penny of the wine bounty is paid by the general taxpayers of Australia. The excise is merely a machine of taxation, and the winemakers are the instrument by wbich the tax is collected. I do not intend to prolong this discussion in the futile manner adopted by. tbe bonorable member for Angas. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan-Hughes) said that more notice should bave been given of tbe Government's intention to reduce tbe bounty, and that it was very unfair to reduce tbe bounty practically in the middle of the season. I remind him, however, that what is being done now is exactly what was done last year, and it did not bring ruin on tbe industry. Tbe grapeI used to be kept away growers bave no reason for complaint provided tbey receive a profitable price for tbeir grapes, as apparently they bave done, and that tbe wine-makers continue to buy at that price, as apparently they are doing. come into operation during the wine season last year. It operated from the 1st September. bonorable member is right; but I am told On that that five-sixths of the grape crop is already gathered. The issue is very simple: is this British preference of 4s. a gallon, plus ls. bounty, tbe equivalent of a bounty of ls. 9d. under tbe old conditions of preference? As a matter of fact, it is worth more. the possession of tbe Government, sucb as the great falling off of importations Government is not only justified in bringing down this measure, but it would have been guilty of a very grave act of injustice to tbe taxpayers if it bad nqt done so. This subject has been well thrashed out, and the case for' the industry has been well put by the bonorable member for Yarra, and other speakers. Tbe honorWho is it pays able member who has just resumed bis seat made tbe assertion in a very emphatic manner that the party on this side of the House was shedding crocodile tears over the position of the primary producers.

136,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [S.20],"whenever this party has had the opportunity, it has passed legislation in the interests of the primary producers. It has recognized that if the country is to be developed, the primary producers must get &fair deal, and provision must be made for settling people on the land. The honourable member, while .condemning this party, made special reference to the honourable member for Dalley( Mr By passing the Wine Export Bounty Theodore). I do not need to say anything more about the honourable member for Dalley than that there has been more legislation passed in Queensland in the interests of the primary producers during the past twelve or fourteen years, than during all the time that Nationalist governments were in power there. That is admitted by the primary producers themselves. But what has the honourable member himself primary producers since he came into this House? Whenever there has been an opportunity of raising his voice against them he has done so, as he is doing on this or two. Now, wben tbeir vines are occasion. He went so far as to say that if tbe Government bad not brought down this measure be would bave taken some action himself. All I wish to say is that any action which be might have attempted would bave been futile. I regard this measure as a distinct breach of faith witb the primary producers. If I thought that injustice was being done to the taxpayers by a continuation of the bounty on the present terms, I sbould certainly raise my voice against it. I maintain however, that we are misleading the producers when we pass legislation with the apparent intention that tbe act shall continue in operation for a given time, and then, before that time has elapsed, make serious alterations which materially affect the conditions upon which the growers were relying. Tbe bounty was first granted to assist those who are growing grapes for drying and for wine making, and it has proved successful for that purpose. So mucb is generally admitted. Tbe honourable member states, however, that this proposed rein England from imported grape juice was duction is justified because tbe Minister who introduced the billremarked in a casual way in tbe course of bis speech on it that if certain things happened in regard to British preference the Government might take tbe action wbich is now proposed. How many of the growers in Australia would know that any sucb statement was made, or bow many members of this House placed any reliance on it? How often do we, in tbe course of our speeches, make some remarks as to what might happen in the future, without significence being attached to it by any one outside the House? Act last year we undoubtedly induced many men to go on tbe land, including many returned soldiers. They accepted the act at its face value, and believed that it would remain in operation for at least three years. This bill, if passed will be a keen disappointment to those men. If the British preference does not work out as the Government claims, many of the grape growers will be practically ruined. Some of them were done to assist thc probably using their land for other purposes, but wben tbe bounty came into operation tbey planted grapes, and anticipated obtaining a return in a year planted and tbeir money spent, the prospects of the industry are being entirely changed. Tbe bonorable member for Henty bas in tbe past spoken a great deal about tbe need for encouraging immigration, but how are we to absorb tbe people we bring bere if we do not open up the land, and keep faith with those whom we put upon it? Tbere are already many returned men on the land who are unable to meet tbeir obligations, and tbe House is now being asked to do something which will very greatly increase the number. Tbe bonorable member contended that because of British preference, tbe growers will be in tbe same position after tbe bounty is reduced as tbey are in to-day; but no one can prove that. It is extremely doubtful what the result of the preference will be. Why sbould we rush in and reduce tbe bounty until it bas been proved that British preference will give the assistance claimed for it. Tbe Prime Minister said that the production of wine very small, only ""about 2,000,000 gallons a year, but be forgot to say that that is nearly as mucb as we ourselves are exporting. We are not supplying one-ninth of tbe requirements of the English market. We have yet to win a place for our wine tliere, and how are we to do it if we pass legislation the effect of-which will be to increase the advantage held by other countries? It may be possible in the near future successfully to pasteurize wine in countries adjacent to England. If that can be done, such wine can be sent in at a strength of 25 degrees, thus enabling it to evade the higher rate of duty, and to sell in competition with Australian wines. We should be guided by experience. How many times bave we passed tariff items in this House, only to find that the foreigners were so keen to get our trade that tbey quickly discovered means of evading the duties imposed ? Are we going to sit idly by and lose the wine trade wbich we bave built up in Great Britain? If it is possible to get wine into England at 25 degrees strength the foreigners will do it. I am the last man who would wish to throw away the taxpayers' money, but I claim that Parliament is not justified in entering into an agreement with tbe people growing fruit, and then altering tbe terms of tbe agreement without knowing what tbe effect on the industry will be. I wonder how many vignerons made contracts for tbe disposal of tbeir wines, having in mind the prevailing conditions. I was told of one corporation that contracted for no less than 60,000 gallons of wine. That corporation will be ruined if it bas to carry out its contract, and it must be borne in mind that the corporation concerned represents the growers themselves, who will have to bear the loss. Can the Government justify the sudden cutting down of the provisions of the Wine Export Bounty Act, wbich we know has been beneficial to the industry ? It is probable that, six months after this bill is carried, Australia will lose her wine market abroad, which will be a great blow to our primary producers. Government is constantly expressing a desire to put more people on the land, and it is bringing many from the Old Country for that purpose. Yet, at the same time, it proposes to cut away a provision which has enabled many men to make good on the land. If , in a couple of years, it is found that this bounty is unsatisfactory to the general taxpayer, it will need amendment; but there is nothing to-day to indicate that it is so. We know that tbere are from Mr Charlton. 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine in store in Englanda year's output. Can it be expected that those dealing in wine will buy the growers' output from the next vintage wben they are not sure as to what will be tbe effect of this legislation? This House sbould be very careful, indeed. I and my party will stand by the primary producers, and do everything we can to encourage land settlement in Australia. That is tbe best way to find employment for our people. To-day we have the spectre of thousands of unemployed throughout Australia, and it is probable that the passage of this bill will add to the number. For those reasons, I shall oppose the measure. for Markets) [8.33] -The main arguments which have been advanced against this bill included tbe statement that, along witb the wine bounty, the Commonwealth Government sbould pay a concurrent bounty to dried fruit growers. It was said that this reduction in the wine bounty is not justified, on. the ground that the alteration of the British preference has not yet been proved to be to our advantage. A further statement was that the growers' interests will suffer if this bill is passed. I shall take up the time of the House for a little while to deal witb those three issues. Wben bounties are paid, whether on wine or any other exported commodity, tbe policy of the Government is to assist the exporting industries concerned, first, to gain a footing on a new market, and, secondly, to cope with sucb temporary difficulties, as. those industries may not be sufficiently well established, to overcome without assistance. DealThis ing with the dried-fruits industry, the lin) with that passion for mathematical problems which distinguishes him, endeavoured to prove that the Commonwealth Government would have saved an immense amount of money bad it adopted tbe practice of paying a bounty for driedfruits growers rather than to help growers of f r u it wbich went into wine.

138,Honourable Member For Yarra ( Mr Scul,"this Government, many engaged in the industry would have failed. The Commonwealth Government came to the rescue, not by means of a direct bounty as suggested by the honourable member for Yarra, but by making to those engaged in the industry advances on tbeir products to tbe extent of, in round figures, £200,000. £5; if £29, £ 1 ; and so on. The Tariff Tbe bill providing for the advances required that tbey sbould be repaid to the Government during succeeding years, if those in the industry obtained for subsequent crops tbe cost of production and something in addition. For a year or so after 1924, the dried-fruits industrystill did not enjoy good prices, and when the time came for the repayment of tbe advances, tbe Commonwealth Government decided that it would not be in tbe interests of tbe industry to demand its pound of flesh. It , therefore, appointed a committee, wbich examined tbe position of the growers, investigating the returns obtained through tbeir packing sheds. The inquiry showed that while the majority of those men had considerable assets, nevertheless to have to repay their advances would mean that they would have to part with much of their working capital. Tbe Commonwealth Government thereupon decided to write off approximately £180,000 of the £200,000 advanced. Honourable members must, therefore admit that this Government bas done a good deal to assist the driedfruits industry and to set it on its feet. In addition, as was mentioned by the Prime Minister last night an export marketing board was set up to inaugurate a general marketing policy with regard to export sales of dried fruit. The work of that board has been particularly successful, and it is safe to say that there is not another exporting industry which is so well organized from an overseas market-' ing stand-point. When the Tariff Board was asked whether tbere sbould be a continuance or otherwise of the wine bounty as from the 31st August last, it was simultaneously asked to decide whether a bounty should be paid to the dried fruit growers. tinctly a deputation of dried fruit growers, which waited on me and submitted the proposal that they intended to put before the Tariff Board. It may be of interest to honourable members to know that their proposal was that a bounty of £10 a ton should be paid, not on sultanas, but on currants and lexias, to taper away so that nothing would be paid in the event of that fruit realizing £30 per ton in the sweat box. If it realized only £20, £10 would be paid; if £25, Board turned down tbeir application. That may be regarded as one argument in favour of the Government not granting a bounty, but it is not on that ground that I shall approach the matter. Subsequent events bave proved that the recommendation of tbe Tariff Board was justified. Last year tbe average of the Australian and overseas prices for currants, in the sweat boxes, was approximately £30 per ton. That is the amount wbich the growers regarded as being sufficiently high to make bounty unnecessary. Tbe position was even better so far as lexias were concerned. price of lexias and currants? figures witb me, but I will obtain and supply tbem to the honourable member. The grower is not concerned so much witb what the prices happen to be in Australia or overseas, as witb tbe price be will receive on the average. Surely the prices mentioned prove that a bounty was unnecessary for last year. the kind. member will turn to this year, he will find that tbe position is even better. We bave a very short crop of currants, largely . owing to tbe frosts, which affected the vines in tbe Murray Valley and elsewhere, and it is fairly safe to say that the realization of this year's crop in the sweat box will average in tbe neighbourhood of £40 for currants. No one could suggest with justification that a bounty is necessary with a payable price such as that. I remember very disThe honourable member for Yarra argued that,.owing to the wine bounty, the price paid by the distiller was sufficiently high to provide an incentive to the grower to send his crops to the distillery rather than to sell them as dried fruits. There is some truth in that assertion, and that position",48,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United

Buti t does not obtain to-day, when there is a direct incentive to the dried fruits grower TO market his product as dried fruits rather than to send it to the distillery. The point which the honourable member for Yarra overlooked was that even if growers through the incentive of a bounty had put additional quantities of dried fruits on the market rather than send the fruit in its raw state to the distillery, that could not be done without affecting thc the market and the prices obtaining on that market. Only last MondayI was speaking to a very able commercial man in Melbourne, one of tbe commerical representatives on tbe Dried Fruits Export Control Board. I asked bim-""In the event of a considerable quantity of the fruit which went in a raw state to tbe distilleries having been dried aud sent away as dried fruits, what would have been the effect so far as tlie dried fruits market was concerned ?"" He said that that would bave had a very depressing affect on tbe market, and that there would be considerable difficulty in disposing of the additional quantity. As it was, considerable difficulty was , experienced in disposing of tbe record dried fruits crop of 1927. Those fruits which are sent in a green state to tbe distillery are generally low grade, and this bas the effect of raising the average grade of the fruit exported in its dried state, and of improving prices all round. which we did obtain would undoubtedly bave been very adversely affected had considerable quantities of the grapes which were converted into wine been converted, instead, into dried fruits. The price of £6 lOs. per ton paid by the distillers to tbe growers is equivalent to £22 15s. per ton of dried fruits, and as the price actually realized for dried fruits was about £30 per ton in the sweat box, it is obvious that it paid tbe grower to convert his grapes into dried fruits, rather than send tbem to the distillery. This year the difference will be considerably greater, and any grower who bas .not contracted to sell to tbe distilleries would be foolish, indeed, to sell for wine-making currants aud lexias which are suitable for processing as dried fruits. Mr Paterson. of drying grapes diverted to the distilleries last year? » sent by growers, who did not realize what tbe final result of tbe year's trade would be. It is doubtful if any of tbem expected that by tbe end of the year the average price would be about £30 per ton, and adopting the maxim that "" a bird in tbe band is worth two in the bush,"" they sent their grapes to the distillery; but had tbe fruit been 'converted into currants and lexias tbey would have done better, provided, of course, that tbe price did not depreciate. Quite likely, bowever, tbe price would bave fallen had considerably larger quantities of dried fruits been put on the market. I remind tbe bonorable member for Yarra that tbe prices' obtained for currants ancl lexias have improved considerably since he visited Mildura about twelve months ago. Although on that occasion be formed a conclusion as to tbe desirability, and even the necessity, for paying a bounty on dried fruits, tbe prospects this year in regard to both currants ancl lexias promise a very good return to the producer, and niake a bounty unwarrantable. The honourable member for Capricornia urged that the Commonwealth Government sbould press tbe Britisb Government to make an even more liberal grant of preference to Australian dried fruits. The prices He should have been the last to make sucb a proposal, in view of tbe fact that in 1924 he ancl bis colleagues neglected a golden opportunity to get a very substantial preference for those commodities. In that year the Imperial Economic Conference recommended that a preference of £10 per ton sbould be given to dominion dried fruits. Tbe duty then in operation was £10, and all that was required was to remove it from Empire fruits, and allow it to continue to operate against tbe products of foreign countries. Immediate effect would have been given to that recommendation had the Baldwin Government remained in office, but wben tbe Ramsay MacDonald Government came into power tbe preference proposals were reviewed. When this item was taken to a division in the House of Common's it was rejected by the narrow -margin of four votes. Honourable members opposite",49,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United

Wby .does be not increase tbe preference % the Baldwin Government has done all that it possibly could do in that direction. The Ramsay MacDonald Government reduced the duty on foreign fruits to £7, and a very trifling preference of about 30s. was given to tbe dominions. At the next appeal to the British electors Mr Baldwin's party was returned to power with an overwhelming majority, but it bad given a pledge to tbe people that in no circumstances would it increase taxation on foodstuffs during the lifetime of tbe new Parliament. Immediately, however, it did what it could, within tbe limits of .that undertaking, by removing the duty so far as it applied to dominion products. It ill becomes honourable members opposite to reproach this Government for not having done everything possible to get the British Government to increase the preference to Australian dried fruits. This Government has done all that was humanly possible for it to do, and the Baldwin Government gave to us tbe maximum preference possible without breaking its pledges to the electors, but members of the Labour party in this House did not so much as l if t their little finger when a golden opportunity to assist the primary producers presented itself in 1924. Honourable members opposite bave declared that tbe Government has proposed to reduce the bounty by 9d. because it is alarmed at the size of the payments under this legislation. Tbat is not tbe reason, although in truth the bounty payments are very large. This afternoon the bonorable member for Angas contended that tbey were 'considerably less than tbe excise collections. Undoubtedly that is so, if we take into account all tbe years back to 1918, but tbe point bas been reached when the bounty payments largely exceed the present excise collections. For tbe year ended tbe 30th June, [157] 1927, the payments exceeded the total excise collections on fortifying spirit by £7,000, the collections having been £435,000, and the bounty payments £442,000. Eor tbe eight months of the current financial year tbe figures were has a even more startling, the excise collections having amounted to £184,000, and the bounty payments to £452,000. It is only fair to say, however, that during the next four months that £184,000 will be largely increased by the excise collections during tbe vintage season; nevertheless, tbe bounty expenditure"" for this year will again exceed by a considerable amount the excise collections. I do not put that fact forward in support of a reduction of tbe bounty; I merely point to tbe magnitude of these payments. Tbe only reason why tbe Government has proposed a reduction is that since April last an undoubted advantage has been given to us by tbe Britisb Government. Tbe -Government delayed taking action only because it wanted to be satisfied that the wine industry would get that advantage, and that our competitors would not find means of evading tbe preference wbich the Imperial Parliament has given to us. The statement bas been made that the proposed reduction is an act of repudiation on the part of the Government. Last night the honourable member for Angas quoted a statement by tbe Tariff Board, but I propose now to read the board's recommendationThe board considers further that if during the currency of the bounty any increase is made-in the measure of tariff preference granted in Great Britain to tlie Australian sweet wines exported under bounty, the amount of the bounty should be reduced by the amount of the increases in the preference so granted. Tbe Minister for Trade and Customs, when speaking in March of last year on tbe bill to amend the Wine Export Bounty Act, made it clear to tbe House and the industry that tbe Government reserved to itself tbe rigbt to ask Parliament to reduce the bounty during the currency of tbe act, in the event of the British Government doing something to improve tbe position of Australian exporters in relation to continental competitors. In.addition, I have several times this year, when meeting representatives of the wine industry in conference in regard to export organization, reminded",50,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United
145,Mr Charlton,Baldwin,51,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United
146,Mr Paterson,"I shall show thatthem of the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs, the tremendous advantage they now enjoy in regard to British preference and the improbability of the bounty remaining at tbe present figure. Therefore it cannot be said that the wine-makers were ignorant of the Government's intention. Minister remind tbem? Mi-. PATERSON -Thre e or four times, in conference with the members of the Viticultural Council, a body which represents the wine-makers, I went out of my way to remind them of Mr result to us was that instead of obtaining Pratten's warning and of tbe improvement of British preference, and told them not to expect that the bounty would remain much longer at its then figure. In those circumstances tbe suggestion of repudiation is quite unwarranted. understand, however, the beat which that word engendered in tbe mind of the honourable member for Dalley; one has not to seek far back in our political hiswines ori a commercial scale has not been tory to find the reason for that. Its apsuccessful. It was partly on account of tbe plication, however, to this wine bounty was not only a terminological inexactitude, but a gross misuse of tbe English language. Honourable members opposite have challenged me to show in what way tbe effective British preference to Australian London journal, 3 gallons of wine of wines has improved, and if tbey are open to conviction I hope to prove to tbem that tbe present conditions are more advantageous to' the winemakers than were those in March of last year wben tbe wine bounty was reduced from 2s. 9d. to ls. 9d., plus drawback. In March of last year, when the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced the bill which had the effect of reducing the bounty from 2s. 9d. to la. 9d. per gallon it was agreed, even by the wine-makers, that our actual preference was only 6d. per gallon on wines of about 34 degrees, on which we had to pay a duty of 2s., and which bad to enter into competition with somewhat weaker wines of just under 30 degrees manufactured in Portugal, on which a duty of only 2s. 6d. per gallon bad to be paid. These wines being just urider tbe 30 degrees mark, paid the lower It is still highly problematical whether rate for foreign wines, whereas our wines, this blending can be done on a commerbeing over the 30 degrees mark, had to pay the higher rate for Empire wines. But the following month the Chancellor of the Britisb Exchequer introduced a budget which led to alterations of a fundamental character in the wine duties. It is true that the rates were raised from ls. 6d. Empire and 2s. 6d. foreign for light wines, to 2s. Empire and 3s. foreign; and from 2s. Empire and 6s. foreign for heavy wines, to 4a. Empire and 8s. foreign. But, what was of far more importance to us, was that the line of demarcation was altered so that wines of the Tarragona class, wbicb formerly were admitted at 2s. 6d. per gallon, bad to pay the higher rate of 8s. per gallon. The an actual preference of 6d. per gallon, we received the ful l benefit of the 4s. difference between the two rates. It bas been aaid that, in consequence One can of the successful blending of low and high strength wines by the continental winemakers, we have lost tbe benefit of this preference; but the blending of such possibility of this being done that the Government did not, immediately after tbe introduction of tbe Britisb budget, reduce tbe rate of bounty. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) has stated to-night that, according to a report in a a strength of 25 degrees bad been successfully blended with 1 gallon of wine of a strength of 42 degrees, giving a blended wine of between 28 and 29 degrees, wbich is about tbe strength of tbe original Tarragona wine, on which tbe average duty would be 4s. 3d. per gallon. He also read an extract dealing witb this point from a pamphlet published by the Federal Viticultural Council; but he did not read far enough down tbe page. Tbe part of the extract which he omitted to read is as follows:It will be seen from tlie above that the position in regard to the effectiveness of the Imperial preference is still obscure, and will remain in doubt for some time. If the shippers of Tarragona and Lisbon wines can do what has been suggested on a large scale, then the preference on Empire wines will be cut down. cial scale.

147,Mr Scullin,"In what way did thean undoubted success, but this publication says, "" If tbe shippers of Tarrangona and Lisbon wines can do what bas been suggested on a large scale,"" tbe blended product will enter into serious competition witb our wines. The evidence which the Government has received is that the experiments which have been made to blend high and low strength wines bave been unsuccessful, and bave involved the persons who conducted them in heavy losses. to the bottom of the page from which he quoted ? speech in my own way. Wben the practicability of blending bigb and low strength wines was first referred to it was suggested that 3 gallons of low-strength wine could be successfully blended witb 1 gallon of high-strength wine. A little later we were told that attempts were being made to blend 2 gallons of low-strength wine witb 1 gallon of high-strength wine, wbich clearly shows that the first attempts to blend these wines dore) said the figure was nearer 2s. 8d. were unsuccessful. When tbe honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Poster) made his speech a few days ago, be read an extract from a letter which he had received from the president of tbe Viticultural Council, wbicb took into consideration the possibility of successfully blending only 1 gallon of low-strength wine with 1 gallon of high-strength wine. The duty which would be payable on sucb a blended wine would be 5s. 6d. per gallon. The president of the Viticultural Council observed that if this could be done it would bave the result of reducing our preference to only ls. 6d. per gallon. When the bounty was ls. 9d. per gallon we enjoyed an effective preference of only 6d. per gallon. If it were practicable to market a blended wine such as that referred to by tbe president of tbe Viticultural Council, the wine-makers' would still be ls. per is made in tbe bounty tbe wine-makers gallon better off under the revised bounty than they were when tbe bounty of ls. 9d. was introduced. metic is at fault. mit that on the admission of the president of the Viticultural Council, and on the assumption that a blend of 1 gallon of low' strength witb 1 gallon of high strength wine could be made upon a commercial scale the wine-makers would still be ls. per gallon better off under tbe reduced bounty than they were when the Wine Export Bounty Bill was introduced last year. Let me emphasize another point. When tbe Secretary of State for the Dominions ( Mr Amery) was in Australia some time ago, he made it quite clear to us that if our continental competitors were able to evade the payment of tbe higher duty by blending their wines, and so nullifying the advantage that we now enjoy, the Chancellor of the Britisb Exchequer could be trusted to take sucb steps as would regain for us the preference wbicb the British Government intended that we sbould enjoy.' The correctness of certain figures I quoted relative to the price of wine bas been challenged. It was said that I was not justified in saying that the average price of Australian wine f.o.b. during recent months was 3s. 4d. per gallon. The per gallon. I remind tbe House that last night the bonorable member for Angas admitted that our wines were selling at from 9s. 6d. to 10s. per gallon in London. To ascertain the price in Australia we need to deduct 4s. per gallon for the duty, and ls. lOd. per gallon for wood and freight, which gives a total of 5s. lOd. If we subtract that from 10s. we bave 4s. 2d.,' and if we subtract it from 9s. 6d. we bave 3s. 8d. Consequently, I submit that my figures were not at ail inflated. Honourable members cannot bave it both ways. They cannot in one breath argue that the price of Australian wine f.o.b. .is only '2s. 8d. per gallon, and in the next breath demonstrate that it must be anything from 3s. 8d. to 4s. 2d. per gallon. We have been told that if this reduction will be ruined, but certain wine-makers have, perbaps, injudiciously, admitted that if 9d. per gallon is taken off tbe bounty it will take, away a great part of their profits. They do not say that it will take away the whole, but only a part of their profit. It surely cannot be contended that the Commonwealth Government should pay bounties simply to make small profits into large ones.",52,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United

Let me remind bim that if tbe spirit in wine is taxed at 5s. per gallon for doradillo spirit, and 6s. per gallon for other spirit, it is still very Foster) that that was their condition lightly taxed compared witb whisky, upon wbich a tax of 26s. per gallon must be paid. A tax of Is, 9d. per gallon bas to be paid on beer whicli bas only one-quarter of the alcoholic content of our sweet wines, tbe tax upon the spirit content of wbicb is only in tbe neighbourhood of Is. 3d. per gallon. tax levied upon sweet wine is, in consideration of tbe amount of spirit it contains, very small compared witb that which is imposed on other alcoholic liquors. Further, tbe whole of tbe ls. 3d. per gallon is returned to tbe wine-maker in the event of tbe wine being exported. There is no taxation on exported sweet wines; nor are dry wines taxed, whether exported or not. Yet these wines contain more alcohol than does beer, which is taxed to the extent of ls. 9d. per.gallon. Instead of being heavily burdened by taxation, tbe wine industry has received generous treatment compared witb that meted out to tbe producers of whisky and beer. The tax of ls. 3d. per gallon on the wine consumed locally represents about 2£d. per bottle. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Britisb preferential tariff in respect of Parsons) said that tbe tax was imposed as a war measure, and he inferred that, now that the war was over, tbe tax should no longer be levied. I remind him that tbe Commonwealth has to carry, for another generation at least, a war liability of £30,000,000 per annum. Surely, in sucb circumstances, a tax on alcoholic liquors for revenue purposes is justified. Although tbe Prime Minister showed clearly tbe greatly improved prices realized by grape-growers during recent years, time and again we bave beard the remark, "" What about the primary producer-the grape-growers?"" So long as his grapes are purchased, tbe grower hardly comes into this controversy at all. One condition underlying the payment of tbe bounty is that a remunerative price must be paid to the grower of the grapes. Seeing that tbe prices of grapes this year are not less remunerative than Mr Paterson. those of last year, it cannot be said that the Government bas neglected the interests of the growers. honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr until the Commonwealth Government stepped in. paid. petition of continental wines is concerned, The the position to-day, compared with that of a year ago, is that a preference then worth 6d. a gallon is now worth 4s. a gallon Let us now consider the competition . our wines bave to meet from wine manufactured in Britain. These so-called Britisb wines are manufactured in Britain from must obtained from continental countries. Honourable members generally will agree that it is not a purely, British industry, whereas Empire wines are Empire-grown, as well as Empire-made. In dealing witb this matter we do well to consider it from the stand-point of the British Government, wbicb naturally regards tbe British wine-making industry as one in which . British capital is invested. British wines pay a tax of ls. per gallon excise. The our wines is 4s. a gallon-a n apparent difference of 3s. a gallon. Not one speaker wbo bas made that point bas shown that, so long as the ls. 9d. bounty remained, tbe actual advantage was only ls. 3d. per gallon. Tbat difference cannot be regarded as insuperable when we take into consideration the quality and higher spirit content of our wines. Tbe winemakers of this country desire that the excise duty on this so-called British wine shall be increased. Indeed, the Viticultural Council has made representations to Great Britain to that effect, and bas pointed out that Australian wines are Empire grown as well as Empire made. Tbe greatest obstacle in the way of an additional excise on Britisb wine is the existence of the bounty of ls. 9d. per gallon paid to Australian wine-makers. In determining whether an increased excise duty sbould be charged on wine made in Britain, the British Government would",53,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United

156,Mr Paterson,"S o far as the comnaturally take into consideration tiie bounty paid by the Australian Government. In my opinion the most practical gesture we can make to the British Government, if we desire that the excise duty on British wines shall be increased, is toreduce to a reasonable amount the bounty we pay. of reasoning, the abolition of the bounty would result in the British excise duty being increased. member will admit that the argument is perfectly sound. I repeat that the greatest obstacle in the way of getting an additional excise duty imposed in Great Britain is the existence of so large a bounty in Australia, which, to a great extent, neutralizes the difference between conditions in Great Britain and in Australia. I desire now to say a few words regarding tlie future of this industry. A good deal has beeu made of the fact that between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wines nave accumulated in Great Britain. It is significant that the importation of foreign wines into comparing favourably in quality and Britain last year was considerably less than the quantity of such wines consumed. It is clear, therefore, that tbe stocks on dustry can be materially improved by hand in Great Britain are being drawn upon. Tbat naturally raises tbe question of the replacement of those stocks. Wben the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced his budget into the House of Commons last April, there was in bond in Great Britain about one and a balf million gallons of Continental wines which, ordinarily, would have bad to pay a duty of 2s. 6d. a gallon. But wben tbe duty was raised from 2s. 6d. to Ss. a gallon it was realized that a hardship would be imposed on Continental wine-makers. Tbe Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore compromised by reducing the duty on. the wine in bond to 5s. per gallon. Our wine, under a tariff of 4s. a gallon, bad to ' compete with a considerable quantity of Continental wine which was released from bond under a duty of 5s. a gallon. That was ls. a gallon more than our wine and represented ouly 6d. a gallon more than the difference wbich we enjoyed prior to tbe alteration of the tariff. That Continental wine has gone largely into consumption, and the Britisb merchants bave to replace their stocks from elsewhere tbem with British wines. table fact that British wines do not compare at all favourably with our wines. Tbey contain at least 10 per cent, less"" spirit, and are not in the same class at all. Tbe wines that really compare with ours in class and strength will, in future, bear a duty of 8s. a gallon. It is absolutely unthinkable that tbe merchants of Great Britain will buy large quantities of wine under a tariff of 8s. a gallon wben tbey can obtain Australian wines of a similar class under a tariff of 4s. as Australian wines? They cannot be found in London. am satisfied that if our wine industry were organized on an efficient basis as is. tbe dried fruits industry, it would be' possible to advertise our wines to the Britisb public as Australian sweet wines, strength with those of other countries. Tbe Government is satisfied that this inbetter organization. Its overhead expenses are admittedly too bigb, and it bas, unfortunately,been content to follow a certain rut simply because it has been receiving a generous bounty. Tbe Government is satisfied on tbe facts that an enormous benefit under Britisb preference is now being and will continue to be enjoyed by Australian wine-makers. A reduction in tbe bounty is a necessary step before we can reasonably expect an increase in excise on Britisb wines. The Government believes that if tbe wine makers organize tbe industry efficiently, tbey will be able to pay to tbe growers the remunerative prices that are set out in tbe price lists, and, at tbe same time, make their business profitable under the reduced bounty. I wisb now to refer to our exports of wine to Canada, and futuie contracts. Tbe position in , Canada is entirely different from that in Great Britain. In some cases, we are on even terms with other countries. We",54,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United

162,Mr Paterson,"I cannot say. Ienjoy exactly the same preference as does Erance, but we are at a disadvantage in competing with Spanish wines of similar class but rather lower spirit content than our own, and to get a footing in that market, it has been suggested that the Government should retain the old bounty of ls 9d. a gallon so far as exportation to Canada is concerned. The Commonwealth Government recognizes that this is a reasonable request, and proposes to submit an amendment to honourable members at the committee stage. The Government is also impressed with representations made that the 1927 vintage should receive special consideration, and that, if possible, something should be done Francis, J. to grant the old bounty on that vintage. That is a tremendously difficult and complicated proposal, because in Australia there are no distinct vintages. In a very short time the 1927 vintage will be mixed with the 1926 and 1925 vintages and thus Jose its identity. It is almost an impossibility to distinguish one vintage from another. To endeavour to do full justice to"" the wine-makers, the Government has decided not to proceed beyond the second reading stage at present, so that a full investigation may be made regarding the 1927 vintage. There is one other point. Tbe bonorable member for Indi( Mr Cook) to-day stated that the drawback was inadequate, and instead of being ls. 3d. it should be Is. 7d. a gallon. About a week or a fortnight ago, a member of a deputation which waited on me made the same suggestion. I pointed out to bim that the Government had no wisb to tax exported wines, or to collect one single penny in taxation from that source. I said that if he could substantiate bis case that a drawback of Is. 3d. a gallon did not fully cover the excise paid on spirit contained in exported wines, the Government would be willing to increase the drawback. I give that assurance to the honourable member for Indi, but I would point out to him that the average between the taxation on doradilla spirit and that on spirit made from grapes other than doradilla is about 5s. 6d. Tbere is about 23 per cent, of spirit in exported wine, and that percentage of 5s. 6d. amounts to about ls. 3d. However, if the industry can Mr Paterson. make its case good, the Commonwealtl Government will be willing to increase the drawback to cover the excise paid or spirit contained in exported wines.

Question so resolved in the affirmative, Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause1 agreed to. Progress reported. The following bills were received from tbe Senate, and (on motion by Mr Beer ExciseB ill . Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Bill. In committee (Consideration of Senate's requests, resumed from the 27th March, vide page 4174) : Item 112 (Apparel or attire, including furs). Senate's Insert after sub-item ( A ) , the following"" B y omitting the whole of sub-item ( B ) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item:( B ) 1. Fur and other skins n.e.i. (except rabbit skins) dressed or prepared for making up, ad valorem, British, 15 per cent.; intermediate, lo per cent.; general, 20 per cent. 2. Rabbit skins dressed or prepared for making up, ad valorem, Britisb 25 per cent.; intermediate, 35 per cent.; general, 40 per cent."" That the requested amendment be made. sire to support the proposal before the Committee for tbe imposition of a duty on imported skins which have beeu partially treated. Some speakers bave said that the duty on dressed skins is too bigb, or, alternatively, that the duty on the finished furs is too low. While is is proposed to put a duty of 40 per cent, on partially dressed skins, the duty on finished furs is 55 per cent., and I point out that' tbe apparent margin of 15 per cent, is really greater than it looks. To that margin has to be added the cost of labour, tbe profit of the manufacturer, and freight and other charges paid on the imported skins. The position has been mucb tbe same for some time past in regard to ovei'coats, and if I remember rightly my friends on tbe opposite side supported tbe tariff of 35 per cent, and 45 per cent, on imported tweeds. On imported overcoats invoiced at 30s., a flat rate of 12s. 6d. duty is imposed which amounts to a 40 per cent but on a 40s. coat the duty works out at only 30 per cent.; or a coat invoiced at 50s. the duty is 25 per cent. With a duty of 40 per cent, on treated skins, there is, according to tbe arguments put forward by members of the Opposition, little margin between the raw skins and tbe finished fur coats. Nevertheless, I contend that there is an actual margin, and that the furriers are 15 per cent. better makers, who I understand are doing a thriving business at the present time. In Sydney tbere is a firm called Furs Limited, wbich is employing about 80 hands, and I have been assured on good authority that the management consider that this duty is absolutely necessary for request. the extension of the business. This firm not only treats the skins, but is making up fur coats, and other articles of apparel. One of the most striking things I have come across in regard to this matter is a statement published in the British Fur Trade, of October, 1927, from a gentleman named Mr S. Biber, who gave a special interview to tbe paper. He saidAustralians propose to develop their f u r trade in their own way, behind tlieir tariff wall, without undue regard for the tears of British or other outside competitors. . . . "" We are beginning' to build our industries, as distinguished from agriculture, fruit-growing, trapping, and so on,"" he said, "" and we shall go on doing this as occasion offers, using our owu raw materials for our own manufacturers' benefit first instead of sending them all over the earth .to be returned to us as finished articles. . . . For a long time past it has seemed absurd to us out there that we should export raw rabbit-skins, sending them right across the world, to be returned to us dressed and dyed conies for our manufacturers. To a firm like my own-Bibe r Furs Limited, which is not only a manufacturing but a merchant concern, making up goods as well as importing the material from outsideit has appeared especially grotesque. . . ""It certainly appears grotesque to me that this gentleman, although be made sucb a statement for publication in England, is now one of those most actively engaged in trying to prevent this proposed duty from being imposed. Dealing witb the proposals to cut out tbe middle man, be said"" So we determined to buy and dress and dye our own rabbit skins and make them up, cutting out all needless middlemen and transport and otlier charges which put up the price of f u r goods to the Australian customer. We are now about to do this; and the organization of the project is one of the reasons for my trip to Europe."" In the 8th paragraph of this article he says' thisA stiff tariff, argues Mr Biber, is essential to the up-building, of a self-contained or nearly self-contained Australian f u r trade, and this is tlieir ideal. The statement concludes witb this paragraph, wbich I submit for the consideration of my frends on the Oppositionoff than the coat "" The Australian workmen w ill support the idea of a prohibitive tariff; so w ill the 'fur",55,Imports Of Cot5baimts Into The United

164,Mr Jackson (Bass) [9.47],"I detrade as a whole. We have a fine esprit de corps in the trade there-finer , I think, than you have here. Our association is representative, and we work together most amicably. We all believe in the future of Australia and of its fur trade. Not only do we look forward to a heavy tax on dressed and dyed rabbit skins coming into Australia, but we shall press for an excise or export duty on raw rabbit skins going out of Australia, so as to prevent our competitors from getting, for so little as in the past, a raw material which has been bred at the cost of thc Australian farmer and the public at large."" In view of such an extraordinary statement as that, I ask whether there is any reason why we should take these gentlemen seriously in their attempt to defeat the Government's proposals. to increase the duty on fur apparel? is sumcient now. Does the honourable member, as a good protectionist-and I call him that because he has been one of the consistent members of the House ou this point-thin k that it is rigbt for an industry wbicb is only making up furs to bave a tariff of 55 per cent., while tbe furrier, wbo is trying to build up a trade in Australia for tbe treatment of rawskins, sbould bave no protection at all? If be is prepared, with tbe rest of bis party, to vote witb tbe Government on this proposal, I am prepared to give bim my support to ' increase the duty of 55 per cent, on fur apparel if that duty does not prove sumcient. As a protectionist I desire to do tbe fair thing Dy the manufacturing furriers in Australia, and I expect my bonorable friends opposite to give tbe same sympathetic consideration to that section of the industry which has to do with the raw material. I trust that tbe item will be passed without further delay. to support tbe request. try which will be protected under this item is likely to develop into an important one. If I feared that tbe effect of these duties would be as indicated by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) yesterday, I should not support it. He suggested that tbe duties would bring about a reduction in the value of undressed rabbit skins in Australia. I can see no reason for that fear; but there is one aspect of the proposal that causes me some concern. The Minister( Mr Latham) pointed out that, under this item, it would be possible tc introduce undressed skins from China, Belgium or Erance, free of duty. That would be very undesirable. The rabbit in Australia is an acknowledged pest. It has devastated immense areas of valuable pastoral country. Rabbits cost the primary producers of tbe Commonwealth about £5,000,000 per annum. We export about 100,000,000 rabbit skins a year, and basing my estimate on my knowledge of tbe cost of feeding a rabbit as against tbe cost of feeding a sheep, and tbe relative values of rabbit skins and the wool aud carcase of a sheep, I can say witb every confidence that the rabbit costs our primary producers the sum that I have mentioned. It is not at all likely that tbe new industry, which it is hoped will he built up under these duties, will be worth anything like that figure to tbe Commonwealth. In any case, I see no reason why tbe requested amendment sbould not include undressed skins also. If this is done, it will have my wholehearted support. quiries that I bave made, that no undressed rabbit skins are imported. last night tbe Minister said that tbere was nothing to prevent manufacturers from importing undressed skins free of duty. The only fear I bave is that the skins of Belgian and Chinese rabbits may, under certain conditions, come into competition witb Australian rabbit skins. Is there any reason why undressed skins sbould not be included in tbe request? to encourage tbe dressing of tbese skins in Australia. propose to say only a few words in support of the item. The houorable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) endeavored to make it appear that the three honourable members who had spoken from this side, were opposed to the duties. That is not the case. Tbere bas not been one speech from this side in opposition to the item. It bas been suggested that tbe duties will interfere with the protection now enjoyed by the manufacturing",57,Customs Tarif Fbill 1927

It does lie agaiust some honourable members opposite. I am supporting the Government on this item. If there is one thing we can be sure of it is that there will be no lack of the raw material for many years: The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) said just now that there was the possibility of competition from' imported undressed skins. I am satisfied that the Australian rabbit will be able to hold its own. against all competitors. We have an unlimited supply of the raw material. If the rabbit skin is to be prepared for manufacture) the process should be carried out in Australia. A considerableamount of' literature dealing with this item has been distributed among honourable members. have no complaint to make on that score, but I do resent organized opposition to now duties from established manufacturers' who have built up their industries under our protective tariff. I can understand opposition coming from a free trader, but I have no sympathy with the manufacturer who is enjoying protection and objects to proposals to extend the same measure of protection to anothor industry which may in some way affect bis owu business. That is being done in connection with this matter. Only to-day I received a circular in which there was a wholesale condemnation of the skins turned out in Australian factories.. I am informed that the initiatory experiments were not very successful, aud' that much capital is being made out of that. If it can be shown that these businesses must have higher protection to permit them-to exist, I am prepared to support that policy, but manufacturers should not traduce one another. What is the finished article iu one industry becoincs-'the raw material in another, and manufacturers should assist one another to build', up industries. The argument has becn-advanced that this industry oan supply only. 10 per cent, of our requirements of coney furs. I am informed that it can supply, if it secures the market, the whole of the black coney needed, which representing about 90 per cent, of total requirements, is a very substantial proportion. Something has been said about thc additional cost that, will be brought about by the imposition of a duty. I can understand that argument when applied to>oworking'men's cotton tweeds, and so on, although many such statements are falsified by experience. girls' furs. a duty on imported furs would make a very negligible addition to tbeir cost.

The addition of 16s. or f l , by way of a duty, would make little difference in the cost of furs which are being gold for 40 guineas and more, and which actually cost to import.from £8 to £10.

It is common sense to assume that a larger number of rabbit skins will be dressed in Australia, arid-we would have the definite knowledge'-that the skins originated in wealth. I have received a telegram on Australia. We do not know where many of the imported ones are raised. The industry is-not employing many hands at present, but every industry has to have a beginning.

There is not a country that has made progress and taken its place among the other nations of the world that has not acquired its prosperity by building up its primary and secondary industries side by side, and a similar course must be followed in Australia. First of all we must establish our primary industries as the basis upon wbich to build all things. Having done that our secondary industries must be cultivated to enable us to market our products in our own country instead of having to depend on an export market overseas.

This is so, and much of it is very untrue. The honourable members for Forrest( Mr Prowse), Reid( Mr Coleman), Cook( Mr C.

They stated, aB they were told, that 5,000 men would be thrown out of work if this duty were imposed. tion of the facts. honourable members to say that 5,000 men would be thrown out of employment if this duty were imposed.

It statesStatement thousands would he affected positively untrue. Not two thousand workers making up garments throughout Couunonof skins, covering more than twenty varieties. Proportion on coney therefore small, 15 per centi' Difference in duty covers total labour costs for making coney coats. These men would not be discharged, because coney seal is only required for a small proportion pf the coats made. A large number of employees are engaged in tbe manufacture of coats from other varieties of skins that would not be affected by the increased duty. The proposal will only affect rabbit coats and rabbit trimmings, which represent probably less than one-fourth of tbe value of the total trade The popular furs are coney, perschaniki, susliki, marmot, skunk, fox, marten, musquash, minkhare, American opossum, and over twenty other furs. If the duty is increased, those coats will continue to be made. It is said that the -55 per cent, duty charged on the manufactured article should be increased. Let lis take an imported coat sold in Australia at £10, and consider the cost.of manufacturing a similar coat in Australia. It would require 30 skins at Ss. each, which would amount to £4 10s: The extra duty would be 18s., the cost of labour £1 10s., and the lining 12s. 6d., a total of £7 10s. 8d. Adding 25 £1 18s. 7d., making a total of £9 9s. Id., and leaving a balance of profit of -10s. l i d . to the manufacturer. That shows that the manufacturers could carry on with the present duty.

It is surprising that in this case tbe bonorable member should show sucb remarkable solicitude for Australian industries, seeing that on other occasions he has been a bitter opponent of protection. Tbe mere fact that the honourable member supports the request for an increased duty is almost calculated to make an honourable member vote contrary to bis principles.

I mentioned last evening that the Government bad already discovered that duties imposed to assist one section of an industry often injured another section. member support any duty, even if it were recommended by.tbe Tariff Board? ber for Yarra will remember complaining of the action of tbe Melbourne Age in connection with a deputation to the Minister for Trade and Customs objecting to a duty on imported newsprint, although that tariff was asked for to assist in the establishment of the newsprint industry in Australia. I bave received an urgent telegram from Mr Sydney Keith, Managing Director of Holders"" Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, as follows :Holders Proprietary Limited strongly protest against increased duty on coney. Will mean closing our fur factory, employing now 100 hands, as we will be able to import madeup garments cheaper than we can make them here. Matter should undoubtedly be referred to Tariff Board. 1 consider it would affect at least between three and four thousand hands. I do not know if this is true, and the honourable member for Franklin does not know whether the statement that be read is accurate. Obviously the proper authority to deal with the subject is the Tariff Board. ber would not support a duty even if the Tariff Board recommended it. While we bave a Tariff Board it sliould do the work for which it was appointed. I do not wish to move that the item be referred to tbe Tariff Board, but I hope that the Minister will agree to that oppose the item, because the committee remarked that statements by justify the proposed"" duties. In the absence of the"" Minister for Trade and Customs, and without the matter having been investigated by the Tariff Board, I am surprised that tbe Government should venture to propose this impost, and I cordially support the request of the honourable member for Forrest that tbe item be temporarily withdrawn. Tbis is an outrage on the whole principle of protection. The duty was proposed by a private member in another place, and endorsed by the Government representative there, and now this committee is asked to approve of it without any guidance from tbe Minister in charge of the department or from the Tariff Board. A l though I bave tbe greatest respect for the Attorney-General's versatility, I do not think that be is at his best in the advocacy of a duty on rabbit skins.

A tariff holiday, so far as new industries are concerned, would be to the best advantage of existing industries; it would give them time to get on their feet. We are constantly embarrassing them by imposing further duties on tbeir raw material. Tbe item before us is a case in point. We bave strong evidence that tbe proposed duty will embarrass the existing industry, and no convincing evidence to tbe contrary bas been adduced. General) [10.30] -It may comfort tbe honourable member for Henty to know that this proposal bas tbe approval of my absent colleague, tbe Minister for Trade and Customs. considers that the preparation and dressing of rabbit skins is an industry admirmade by tbe manufacturers of fur apably suited to Australia, and that sucb work sbould be done here. It is not disputed that tliose who are at present engaged in this enterprise are in a precarious position, and, unless they are given tariff assistance, what appears to be a most promising industry will assuredly disappear. Objection has been raised to tbe proposal to increase tbe exbut tbe statement of tbe Attorneyisting duties from 10 per cent., 15 per cent, and 20 per ceut. to 25 per cent., 35 bas practically . convicted tbe Governper cent, and 45 per cent.,, on the ground that tbe protection given to the industry of manufacturing fur apparel will thereby be diminished. This industry is at present protected by duties of 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent. The duty on dressed skins imported from foreign countries is being increased from 20 per cent, to 40 per cent. Tbat means an increase of 20 per cent, on tbe raw material used in the fur apparel industry. If the cost of dressed and prepared skins were 50 per cent, of tbe cost of tbe completed garment-I am assured it is very much less-a n increase of 10 per cent, in the foreign duty on garments would meet the case. But bonorable members have received from the Master Furriers' Association of Victoria a demand that tbe existing duties of 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent, sbould be increased to 80 per cent., 90 per cent., and .100 per cent. skins, they ask. for an increase of 45 per cent, to meet an increase, in respect of raw material, of certainly not more than 10 per cent., and possibly only half that amount. This request is extravagant, and the Government has considerable doubts as to the good foundation of tbe statements that tbe industry of manufacturing fur apparel will be prejudiced by tbe increase in duties on dressed rabbit skins. What it is necessary to consider is tbe margin of profit in the fur apparel industry. If , despite the increased duties on rabbit skins there is a sufficient margin of profit to enable tbe manufacture of fur apparel to be carried on successfully, there is uo need for any alteration of tbe duties on such apparel. Tbe Government is not prepared to submit to tbe Tariff Board a proposal for an increase of those The Government duties, but it is ready to ask tbe board to inquire into the profits at present being parel. After a report on that subject has been made, consideration can be given to the desirability of altering the existing rates of duty. [10.34] I bave already indicated to the committee my attitude towards this item, General calls for further comment. He ment out of his own mouth, because be says that it bas grave doubts, amounting to suspicion, regarding tbe statements made .as to the profits earned by the manufacturers of fur apparel. suspicion. I said that tbe Government wanted further inquiries into that pbasp of the industry. clear understanding of the profits that are made before we agree to impose any duty upon a manufactured article. is confusing tbe two industries. quite understand that there are two industries.

If it is, bonorable members are not aware of it. All we have to guide us are the statements that bave been made during this debate. It appears to me that desperate measures have been employed to bave this duty agreed to despite tbe protests of honourable members who wisb tbe Tariff Board to bold an investigation into it. Tbe impression bas been created that sucb an inquiry is not desired. A dangerous precedent is being established, wbicb may result in other matters being withheld from tbe Tariff Board. If the Government has any doubt regarding the position of either the smaller or the bigger industry its course is clear. It is adopting a rather contemptuous attitude wben it ignores tbe protests of bonorable members who have pressed for an inquiry. I feel that I cannot oppose tbe item; but last night I availed myself of the opportunity to protest against what I consider is special and favoured treatment of a new industry, which has yet to become established, and the refusal of tbe Government to tackle the big problems that are connected with tbe working up of our raw materials. Last year we exported rabbit skins to tbe value of £3,000,000, and sheep skins witb wool on to tbe value of more than £4,000,000. Prom time to time. I bave urged that tbe work done upon those skins should be undertaken by our own people. extraordinary that tbe Government sbould show such a particular interest in this matter. in this industry is small compared with that invested in ' the fellmongering industry, which bas been in a languishing condition for many years. Certain bonorable members wbo sit opposite bave repeatedly refrained from supporting items in tbe tariff schedule. terest in this item is occasioned by the fact that the industry is established in tbeir own State. material should be worked up in our own country. They should be consistent and support any move that is designed to bring about tbe working up of other raw materials in Australia. member referring? ber for Eranklin( Mr Seabrook) bas repeatedly opposed items in tbe tariff schedule. Evidently this duty is to be imposed, because a number of Ministerial supporters, and possibly Cabinet Ministers, have had the opportunity of inspecting tbe Tasmanian works, and bave been impressed by them. I am in entire sympathy with the industry, but I consider that I am justified in voicing a protest against the Government's failure to do the rigbt thing in connection witb tbe working up of other raw materials in this country. protest against tbe passage of this item. We bave a Tariff Board that is supposed to make inquiries and fully inform the Government and honourable members as to tbe conditions under which industries sbould be protected. I , for one, shall not accept an assurance that this protection is necessary, until proof of that fact has been furnished by tbe Tariff Board. Some of tbe increased duties to which bonorable members have-agreed after an investigation by tbe Tariff Board are, in my opinion, detrimental to tbe best interests of Australia. I strongly protest against any proposal being placed before us Until tbe matter bas been properly considered by tbe Tariff Board. It was amusing to bear tbe honourable member for Eranklin( Mr Seabrook) advocate this duty because tbe industry happened to be in Tasmania. Last night tbe honI t is orable member for Franklin exhibited a sample of an imported article, and informed bonorable members that tbe prices ranged from 19s. to 40s. He then showed Tbe capital invested a sample of tbe local product, the prices of which, he said, ranged from 25s. to 50s. He did not tell us whether tbe price of tbe sample was tbe lowest or tbe highest in either case. There is nothing convincing in bringing to this chamber samples of local and imported commodiTheir inr ties and supplying no information other than that there is a big range of prices.

He appeared to be rather out of his element, and the information which he supplied to the committee did not coincide with the facts. He said that the price of the skins that are used in a garment represents a very small proportion of the value of the made-up article. If he had had any experience of skins he would know that price is a very considerable item and that the cost of making up is most expensive. Both the manufacturer and the retailer have to make a profit. Every person should-know, also, that there is a further element in the sale of any article which is affected by that is the risk which is involved. Everybody who has been connected with the retail clothing trade knows that while a profit may be made on certain articles of apparel at the beginning of a season, it may be advisable to sell similar articles at a loss at the end of the season. In some cases such stock is carried over from one season, to another, but that also entails a loss. The difference of 10 per cent, which will be made in the cost of such articles if this request is agreed to may, therefore, be a serious item to business people. I have had a recent experience of the futility of protesting against measures introduced by the Government, so I shall not expect much effect from my opposition on this occasion. I shall, however, justify my actions before my constituents during the. coming election campaign, and indicate to them the serious effect that some of the increases that we are making in the tariff is having upon primary production in Australia. [10.46] Some honourable members appear to think that the Tariff Board is an authority superior to the Government. I disagree with that view. If the Government considers that by taking such action as is now proposed, it can effectively assist an industry for which we have an abundance of raw material and a good local market, it should take it. Seeing that I hold that view and consider that this proposal will assist a' local industry, I shall support it. Motion agreed to. Progress reported. (No. 2). and read a first time. surer) [10.50] -(B y leave.)I move That the bill be now read a second time. Immediately after the Commonwealth Housing Bill was passed last year, the Commonwealth Savings Bank entered into negotiations with the various State housing authorities with a view to putting its provisions into operation. the dictate's of fashion, and The housing authorities in three of the States were quite prepared to accept the principles of our act and to recommend that their legislation be altered to make it uniform with ours. It was found, however, that the making of a few minor amendments in our measure would facilitate co-operation, and this bill has been introduced with that object. I thank honourable members 'for allowing me to move the second reading at this late hour. The general purpose of the bill is to make the act slightly more elastic. It is provided in section 9 of tbe measure that an advance shall not be made to au authority until the Commonwealth authority is satisfiedThat thc schemes administered by tlie authority contain provisions under which(i) No loan is made by the authority to any person who already owns n house, except for the purpose of discharging a mortgage upon one dwelling house of which he is the owner. The State authorities pointed out that tbey granted loans not only to discbarge a mortgage but also to'permit a house to be enlarged. That is often necessary when an increase occurs in a family. Provision is, therefore, made in this bill to add to the sub-paragraph I bave quoted the words, ""or for the purpose of enlarging a dwelling house of which he is the owner."" This is a slight but necessary amendment. Similar provision is made to enable a person wbo bas already received a loan under the Commonwealth housing scheme to procure a dwelling house to obtain a further loan to enlarge that bouse sbould necessity arise.",63,Customs Tarif Fbill 1927

205,"Bill Presented By Dr. Eaele Page,",,64,Second Reading
206,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"-TreaI t was also pointed out that quite frequently a person who is buying a house through a State authority changes his place of residence to some other quite different district. Provision is, therefore, made that in the case of such a person fully repaying the amount advanced to him in respect of a house in one locality, he may obtain a new advance to enable bim to secure a home in an altogether differeut place. In addition, it was found that in practically all. the States the system of acquiring houses on tbe rent-purchase plan was in operation. That plan provides that a client may purchase a bouse by making a small deposit and paying off tbe balance by weekly or monthly instalments, including interest and principal. After he has paid off, say, 66 . per cent, or 75 per cent, of the total cost, be may obtain a title to the property, which can then be mortgaged to the bousing authority. It was felt that tbe wording of tbe original act did not fully cover this position. Oonse quently an alteration is being made in clause 3, sub-clause ( E ) 2. It was also.thought desirable that it sbould be made clear that where a State administers more than one bousing scheme, it shall be sufficient if one scheme conforms to tbe conditions laid down in the Commonwealth Housing Act for advances to be made under this act. Tbe bill provides accordingly. The method of repayments by the housing authorities of the State to the Commonwealth Bank, and thence to tbe Treasurer, as set out in tbe principal act bas been found not to suit every State. Accordingly, by clause 4, section 10 of tbe principal act is amended by omitting sub-sections 3 and 4, and substituting other sub-sections in lieu thereof witb a view to providing greater elasticity in tbe dealings between tbe Commonwealth Savings Bank and the State .housing authorities, and between the Treasurer and tbe Commonwealth Savings Bank. The method of repayment is being altered to provide that advances made shall bear such rates of interest, and be subject to sucb terms and conditions of repayment as may be agreed to between the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. As a result of conferences wbicb have been held, it is thought that it will be possible by this means to arrive at an arrangement which will be satisfactory to all parties. Some of tbe States desire to repay to the Commonwealth Savings Bank, as received, tbe money paid to them by their clients. Provision is. made to meet sucb cases Clause4 (4) provides that the Treasurer may from time to time advance to the Oommonwealth Savings Bank out of any moneys in tbe Commonwealth public account sums not exceeding tbe moneys which be is authorized to borrow in pursuance of this act. This will enable advances from Commonwealth revenue to be. made in anticipation of tbe necessary loans being raised.

Tbis matter bas been inquired into by the Tariff Board in connection witb bag frames and attache and suit case pin bolts. It was apparently understood by tbe Tariff Board. that tbe bolts in question were used only in connection witb kit-bags and attache cases. Tbe bolts are made by tbe Consesame company or firm; but tbey are tbe ordinary hardware bolts witb which we are all familiar. Tbe Tariff Board recommends tbe removal of these bolts from item 404, under which it was supposed tbey fell, so that they would come under manufactures of metal. In fact, tbey do at present come under that heading. Tbe importations into Australia of tbese barrel and socket bolts, wbich are very simple implements, are considerable, indeed, and, although the articles may be made perfectly well in Australia and at . a reasonable price, there is not a sufficient market for tbe Australian product to make tbe industry profitable. The increased duties sbould bave tbe effect of giving the local market substantially to the local manufacturers, who have undertaken in Writing, not to increase prices. One of the functions of tbe Tariff Board is to see that such undertakings are carried out. Tbe Tariff Board Act contains a provision for tbe prevention of any overcharge to tbe public by a protected industry. If bonorable members find that prices bave been increased in breach of sucb undertakings, I can assure them that full inquiries will be. made. wisb to say a few words concerning Australian manufacturers wbo are receiving tbe benefit of protection and are not patronizing Australian industries.

We know that many lives, particularly those of infants, are lost through impure milk supplies. The company applied to tbe Minister for Trade and Customs to bave this plant brought, under an item in the tariff which would have made the duty lower, but its request was refused. Tbis is a communication which it subsequently forwarded to the. Comptroller-General of Customs28th February, 1928 We regret to have received yours of' the 9th instant, and ask you to reconsider this matter, because there roust evidently be some misunderstanding with regard to Messrs. R. Werner and Company's ability to supply this plant. The whole system is entirely new to Australia, and we are satisfied that Messrs. R. Werner and Company' could not possibly have designed or quoted us for same at the time we ordered it. Wc understand that Mr Werner, Benior, was in America shortly after our order waa placed, but even now question whether his firm could supply the complete plant. At tliat time no high-power enclosed type of vertical compressors,' direct coupled to synchronous motors could be obtained in Australia. With .regard to the ice-tank section, the best quote we obtained was from Messrs. Richard Wildridge and Company, on' 24th February, 1927. The details of their tank were as under, and we mark dimensions of our imported tank in red62ft. long x 30 f t 6 in. wide x 8 f t . 9 in. deep. 62 f t . 3 in. long x 31 ft. 4 in. wide x 6 f t. 5 in. deep. Capacity-57 6 moulds of 400 lb. each in gangs, of 0-10 3 tons. Capacity-67 2 moulds of 400 lb. each in gangs of 14-13 4 tons. Tbe ice tank which is quoted here Motion negativedThat the question be now put. of very great concern to over 400' of my constituents; obtain the opinion of one of the leading consulting engineers -of Adelaide, and be agreed that this plant could not be made in Australia. The statement continuesThe principle is something quite new to us, so without knowing that it would have been quite impossible to construct a similar plant. Now, with a plant operating, to act as a model, and all the blue prints for same complete, we should be able to construct a similar plant, providing always, we could overcome the various patent rights connected with the plant Here is an extract from tbe annual report of this company, and I again wisb to impress it upon bonorable members that this is a co-operative concern, one in which thc Ministerf o r Markets should be particularly interested, because be is a dairyman himself. The report statesThe absurdity of this situation is plain enough when it is realized that our shareholders are mainly primary producers, 460 of whom whom are direct suppliers. This means that, with an average dairy household of seven men, women and children, AmscolU looking after the welfare of over 3,000 country settlers. Against their well-being we have to offset. £4,370 in cashto prop up a small manufacturing community, who, with very limited output for the class of machinery in question, cannot hope to compete in manufacturing costs to the benefit of the rural producer or city consumer. I wish to protest emphatically against this practice of extorting money from the primary producers by placing high duties on articles wbicb cannot be manufactured bere. ister and Ministerf o r ExternalA f f a i r s ) [11.30],-Tb e honourable member for Swan has spoken, not -for the first time, about the proportion of British manufacture which must be present in goods coming into Australia under the preferential tariff. I wisb to remind h i m that I bave myself on several occasions written to h i m on tbe subject, and explanations bave been made which show that the statement wbich he repeatedly makes that Britisb wool is being treated by tbe tariff as a foreign product, is neither f a i r nor accurate. The caused by the fact that tbe Britisb manufacturers w ill not use Britisb trimmings, even when they are available. They took .the trouble to gentleman has never written to me on the subject --",68,Adjournment Canberra Hospital Appointments Preference To British Goods out Y

This matter baB been thrashed out so often, and the inaccuracy of the charge bas been so frequently demonstrated, that I do not propose to go over the ground again. With regard to the matter raised by the honourable member for Angas( MT . Parsons), I shall take note of the representations he has made, and it will be taken up by the Customs Department to see whether anything can be done. Question resolved in tbe affirmative.
