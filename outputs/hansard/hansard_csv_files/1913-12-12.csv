31,Mr Agarwynne,"The matterMr P. P. ABBOTT -As a matter of personal explanation, I desire to bring under the notice of the House a quotation from the report of a speech delivered by the honourable member for Gwydir on the 26th November last at Glen Innes, and published in the local newspaper on 28th ultimo. I am sorry that the honourable member is not present. According to this report, the honourable member, who was supporting the candidature of a member of the Labour party for the representation of the district in the State Parliament saidI have not seen much of Mr Abbott; he dues not often come to the House, and when he does come he does not stay long. He is all right in the Police Court badgering some unfortunate; but, judging by his first speech in Parliament, he should attend more and learn that the Federal House is not a Police Court. I have always endeavoured to take up a fair attitude in this House, and I hope that I shall always do so; but in justice to myself I should like to draw the attention of tlie honourable member for Gwydir to the records of the House, which show that up to the 26th ultimo, the date on which he delivered this speech, ""he had attended forty-eight sittings of the House during the session, whilst I had attended forty-six. The records show further that up to the 10th instant I had attended fifty sittings of this House, whilst the honourable member for Gwydir had attended forty-nine. I am pleased that the honourable member has now come into the House. I make this statement in justice to myself and to my electors. An course Mr P. P.

So far, no blocks have planation. [152]2 Mr P. P. ABBOTT I shall endeavour to keep on the right track; but I must say that I have been led away from the course I should follow by the honourable member for Gwydir. Like other honourable members, I have found it absolutely essential on many occasions to leave the chamber itself in order to attend to correspondence from my constituents and to other matters affecting my electorate, and very often I have done so while the honourable member for Gwydir has been addressing the Chamber, but I have always been within the precincts of the House.

54,Mr Joseph Cook,"I shall do mywhich, do not permit of f u l l and detailed investigation of the projects to which they relate; and, consequently, I fear that Parliament occasionally knows very little of the actual details of the expenditure of large sums of public money. It is in order to remedy that defect, as well as to insure a more efficient spending of the money, and the wiser disposition of our public works policy, that this Committee Is proposed. toria and New South ""Wales, abundantly justifies this proposal. I do not hesitate -to say that, in the State of New South Wales, a similar Committee has saved the country millions of money. toria. am safe in saying that similar results have been the outcome of the Victorian Committee. the question whether a Committee composed of members of Parliament is the hest court of inquiry into these huge public undertakings-whethe r outside experts, permanently appointed as a board, would not conduct the inquiries more efficiently, and with a greater degree of .knowledge and intelligence. From my experience-and it is a pretty large one I think that a board of experts would not do this work as well as a Committee of this House would. perts here. so; but members have a wide knowledge -of human nature. They have that invaluable quality called common sense, and a sense of responsibility for their actions which enables them to make inquiries into all such matters with an open mind, and, perhaps, with a detached view of things which does not pertain to the mind trained to special courses. Moreover, I ahould like to point out that all the available expert ability that such a Committee would care to call to their aid is at their disposal, and the members may, therefore, inform themselves concerning all the projects submitted, and be in a position to pass judgment in a way that, perhaps, an expert, biased by his training and immersed in details of the undertakings to which he has given his life's work, may not do. I am not so sure that outside unbiased judgment, even relating to technical matters, is often the best that we can obtain. That is an argument that goes as far as it may; but, further, I say that in connection with public works and public undertakings, the responsibility of this Parliament should be preserved inviolate. That is the point, I think, which ought to decide this matter. No outside body should have to do with projects in a responsible way which reExperience, both in Viclate to the initiation of the spending of the public funds of the country. The determination of what, where, to what extent, and in what shape our public functions shall be initiated and utilized must always, it seems to me, rest with those who have charge of the purse of the country, and have the responsibility, finally, for the spending of the money. In other words, I think that this* proposal preserves the power of Parliament over the whole province of public There arises, first of all, expenditure. This appears to me to be the vital thing in deciding whether this shall be a Committee of members inside the House, or a Committee of experts outside the House. There is just another point that should be mentioned here. Ought a Minister-ough t a Government-to delegate this Ministerial function-for after all it is a Ministerial function and Ministerial responsibility-to any body of men either in Parliament or outside ? The reply to that is a very easy one-the Government will not delegate their responsibility, which is preserved at every stage. The Bill will provide that the Minister himself must express his views concerning the proposals in submitting them for the consideration of the Committee. Further, the Minister must take full responsibility for the initiation of the proposals, and for the provision of plans and specifications, and all data collectable within his sphere of responsibility, for submission to the Committee. More than that, after the inquiry has been made, and the information supplied to Parliament, a further responsibility, that is made statutory in the Bill, rests on the Minister,. and makes it mandatory on him to submit the proposals for the final consideration of Parliament within a given period after the inquiry has been conducted. It seems to me that there is nothing here inconsistent with the full responsibility of the Minister or with the financial responsibility which the Government and the House have to undertake.",16,Second Reading

It is quite clear, I think, that this Committee must be a littl e larger than the Public Works Committee of a State. It will have to travel over a great deal more ground, and, as sectional Committees will be required, it would be difficult, with a small number, to set up these Committees in the requisite strength to insure the work being carried on continuously.

As to our relationship with the States, I can see no evidence of any antagonism between the States' Departments and our proposed bureau. Mr Valder, Under-Secretary for Agriculture m New South Wales, has told me that he can see no reason why there should be any friction between an agricultural bureau, under the Federal auspices, and the Agricultural Departments of the States. He considers that the two could work hand in hand, that the experience of the State Departments will probably be of benefit to the Federal bureau, and that ultimately Australia will be able to take its place in the councils of the world in this regard. the Victorian Director of Agriculture.

He was the senior pupil of the late Mr Farrar, and New South Wales could ill afford to lose him, but Western Australia offered him more than he was getting in New South Wales, and, naturally, he went where his As the controlling genius of the laboratory, pointment of a gentleman possessing a veterinary science degree, or of one holding a double degree, that is, a medical degree, and a degree in veterinary science. In most European countries the men at the head of affairs-possess double degrees. Sir John McFadyean, a doubledjegree man, is an eminent authority, particularly on bacteriology and pathology, in Great Britain, and Sir Stewart Stock is Chief Veterinary Officer and head of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries there. In SouthA f r i c a , Dr. America, Dr. Mohler is the Chief Pathologist of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and in India Professor Holmes is the Imperial Bacteriologist. In Australia we have an eminent bacteriologist in D r . Gilruth, the Administrator of the Northern Territory, and another in Dr. Dodds of the Sydney University. A name of wide-world reputation in bacteriology is Professor Bang of Denmark, who is the discoverer of the cause of epizootic abortion in cattle, which is at the present moment a matter of considerable importance to us. It is necessary that there -should be a gentleman possessing a veterinary degree at the head of affairs, because the British Medical Association objects to an individual who has not had special prudence entering the field of bacteriological investigation. A doctor of veterinary science must diagnose wholly from -symptoms, and thus acquires a more in t imate knowledge of the causes of many of the troubles which affect the lower creation than the ordinary medical man obtains of the causes of human disease. I -say that with the greatest respect for the medicai profession, and in justice to the eminent veterinary surgeons who bave so wide a knowledge of the bacteria and micro-organisms affecting animal life. -Coming to m 'other matter, I have before me a map prepared by the Commonwealth Meteorologist, which shows that one-third of the area of Australia has a rainfal l of less than 10 inches. It does not follow that that country cannot be settled, and should be abandoned as if it were a Sahara. It should be a function of the Agricultural Bureau to experiment with a view to ascertaining the methods to be employed to make good use of these dry services were better recognised. areas. The Department should endeavour to find out also what constituents are I would suggest the aplacked by the soil, and how they can be best supplied, and should generally ascertain the possibilities of the country for agricultural and pastoral occupation. Magnificent crops may be obtained with a rainfal l of only 10 inches a year, provided that the rain falls in the growing season between May and October. In deed, I would sooner have a rainfal l of 10 inches between those months than one of 40 inches between October and March. In the Northern Territory, we have a Government farm on which £19,000 has been spent to date. The Thale is the bacteriologist. In rainfall in the locality is 40 to 50 inches per annum, but according to the Government Meteorologist, no rain is to be expected in May, June, July, August, and September. Consequently, agriculture in the ordinary sense of the word is not possible there. What are needed are experiments to ascertain the possibilities of intense culture, or of crops, possibly even of wheat, which may be sown at times of the year differing from the times of sowing in the more favoured and cooler parts of the continent. The dry area to which I referred, if proved by careful experiments to be capable of settlement, would give room for a huge population that would help us to hold for ourselves what is probably the best country under the sun. The chemist has within the last training in medical jurisfew years revolutionized our knowledge of agriculture, and I look forward hopefully to a considerable alteration of our methods. There are in the soil two kinds of micro-organisms, which are hostile to each other. There are bacteria, which are beneficial, and protozoa, which are harmful, and the discovery of methods which will keep the protozoa in check and cause the bacteria to thrive will greatly increase the yields of the soil. Experiments have been made which go to show that, land which has been gradually getting weaker and weaker, or "" sick,"" to use the word of the farmer, can be brought back to almost pristine vigour. It has been found that by subjecting soil to a heat of from 56 to 100 degrees centigrade the protozoa in it is killed, but that the bacteria can withstand centigrade, even though it may be forced back into the spore state. Honourable members interjecting with this question from a broad point of view; and if my remarks are having no educational effect upon honourable members opposite, who are always telling us that they are the friends of the farmer, I am sorry for them. My object is to show some of the difficulties that have to be faced in connection with the greatest industry in Australia. The men on the land are responsible for the only exports of surplus production that we have; and honourable members opposite, who pose as the friends of the agriculturists, should be anxious to help them in every way. If we could have agricultural experts of eminent reputation engaged in connection with the bureau to carry out experiments such as are being conducted in other parts of the world, the whole country would be benefited. theories chemists can be effectively brought to bear in many of the older settled districts, where we have to resort to what is known as the rotation of crops and fallow-, ing, then our older ground will retur n a yield twofold greater than it is returning to-day, and the result must be a wealth of Australia. direction would be costly, no doubt, but the money would be well spent. I feel quite satisfied that the results which have been obtained in this direction in the United States of America would also be obtained in this great Commonwealth.

Some of the finest timbers in the world are being ruthlessly destroyed. This waste is largely due to the ignorance of the individuals concerned, and perhaps, also, to the fact that although these timbers are of commercial value, there are no facilities at hand to encourage agriculturists to prove this great source of wealth, with tlieresult that they are simply burnt off. deal with that matter? it by suggestion; and, by working hand in hand w i th the State Departments, we could ascertain whether those DepartI am trying to deal ments could not bring influence to bear on the State Governments in this direction., Then, again, we have a number of noxious weeds which require to be in vestigated. Prickly pear is one of these* Asf a r as I have been able to ascertain, it is of very little commercial value. I conducted some experiments, at one time, to ascertain whether it could not be used, after being boiled, or as ensilage, for feeding dairy cattle, but the results were not satisfactory. There are also a number of stock-poisoning plants in different parts of Australia that need to be dealt with. We could have the opinions of the authorities promulgated in those useful publications known as bulletins, and now issued in connection w i th the United States of America Bureau of Agriculture. In such bulletins we could give the latest information concerning the efforts of scientific men to solve all these problems. If the new agricultural These bulletins must result in better developed by agricultural work. In conclusion, I want to point out that a bureau similar to that which we propose to establish in the Commonwealth is in existence in Canada, and isdoing good work. I have before me a report by the Live Stock Commissioners of the Dominion; and looking through it I find that ' they act upon the suggesgreat increase in the tion I have made in regard to the emAnythingi n that ployment of veterinarians at the head of the different Departments. In nearly every case where bacteriological investigation has to be made, we find that a gentleman holding veterinary degrees is in charge. The result has been a grand success, and the reports of these Commissioners have been most encouraging. I hold that it w ill not be necessary, in connection with our bureau, to A t present a wicked, wanton commence experiments de novo. If we are wise we should go on with our experiments where others have l e f t off. Let us take advantage of their experience, cheerfully acknowledging the sources which we have drawn upon, and I feel satisfied that as a result of the establishment of this bureau our wealth will be largely in creased; that we shall be able to discover",22,Joseph Cook

It is quite incomplete, and should not have been introduced until the Prime Minister had consulted the Premiers of the States, and had a conference with the directors of the State Agricultural Departments with a view of ascertaining how far the Commonwealth might take over work that is now being done by the individual States.

Hume thinks that there is a difference between a socialistic experiment and a public utility carried on by a Government or a municipality.

The State Governments of Australia have assisted pastoralists to an enormous degree, and if a balance-sheet were published showing the amount of Government money that had been spent in that way the public would be astounded. Almost millions of money have been spent by the Governments of the States in giving the stock-owners wire netting and rabbitproof fences, at very great cost, to fence their runs when, in some cases, there were no rabbits within hundreds of miles. all back in Queensland, by any means.

What are we doing for sailors, wharf labourers, miners, and those poor fellows who work in the trenches in the streets, about whom cultured men, like the honourable member for Parkes, and others, complain, and say "" They are all idlers,"" if they should happen to straighten their backs during their work?

If we appoint an expert to deal with diseases in stock, is he to spend Federal money in issuing pamphlets dealing with this matter when nearly all the States are already issuing pamphlets upon the same subject? Minister defend that kind of folly ? My complaint is not against the idea of having a Federal Bureau of Agriculture, but it is against the clumsy methods of the Government who claimed that if they got into office they would curtail expenditure, and that there would be a return to responsible Government and sound finance. This is their sound finance: The States issue hundreds of pamphlets on hundreds of different subjects concerning farmers and pastoralists, and a Federal Bureau of Agriculture is to be superimposed upon the States and to spend thousands of pounds upon the same work. Surely that is an uubusiness-like proposition. Honourable members would not run their private business in that way. A t any rate, I do not think the honourable member for Riverina would. Sitting suspended from 1.0 to 2.15 p.m. Agricultural Department, according to a pamphlet issued with authority, giving its history, was established in 1890, when the Hon. Sydney Smith was appointed by Executive minute Minister for Mines and Agriculture. A Director was appointed to organize the new Department, and it was administered by the first Minister for three years, as a separate entity. A comprehensive scheme of agricultural education was approved by the Government, the Hawkesbury Agricultural College was started, and four experimental farms were established, and sites for -others were chosen in districts whose climatic conditions differed. A scientific staff was got together. It consisted of a chemist, a plant pathologist, a botanist, an entomologist, a viticulturist, and a f r u it expert; and an officer was appointed to give instruction in dairying, with the aid of a travelling dairy. The Agricultural Gazette was instituted, and was distributed free each month to about 500 persons connected with rural pursuits. -Several experts, such as those I have mentioned, will be required by the Commonwealth Department, if the institution is likely to be of benefit to Australia. In 1893, the year of the great bank smashes, it became necessary for the Government to retrench, and the Department was coupled with the Mines Department. But it was soon found that it did not Can any make the same progress under those conditions as when dealt with by a Minister holding a separate portfolio, and after representations had frequently been made by the classes interested-anti-Socialists , no doubt-the office of Minister for Agriculture was created by a special Act of Parliament, and the Department was, in January, 1908, placed on an independent footing. In the Department now there is a chemist's branch, in which various chemical investigations relating to agriculture are carried on, as well as analyses of soil, fodders, wheat and flour, butter and milk, &c. There is a dairying branch, in which there is a dairy expert, and instructors in dairying, with a staff of inspectors and graders in connection with the Commerce Act. There is a fruit expert, who, with the aid of assistants and inspectors, administers the Fruit Pests Act, and superintends operations at various orchards. There is a sheep and a wool expert, a wheat experimentalist, and a Government entomologist. The duty of the entomologist and his assistants is to investigate the life history of the various insects and pests which affect fruit growing, and to discover methods of keeping noxious insects and organisms in check. There is a viticultural expert, a stock branch, a bureau of micro-biology, a seeds department-the seeds being sometimes sold and sometimes given awayand a Government botanist, together with a number of other experts. I have not time to refer to the various experimental farms, but I draw attention to the following balance-sheet.

Without making a charge against any particular official, I can say that there are officials who seem to have a considerable liking for the imported article in preference to the local article, and some members of the House have had to make very strenuous efforts to thwart their desires.

W ill the Prime Minister take into consideration some method of altering the parliamentary system of reporting, so as to adopt a similar practice to that followed in South Australia, where the parliamentary debates are published by arrangement with the daily press? This would greatly enhance the value of the reports, and lead to a wider knowledge of political affairs in the Commonwealth, with corresponding benefits to the people and to members.

I am not anxious to raise the question of the reduction of this individual salary. I wish to raise a matter of principle. We are entitled to know the intentions of the Government in regard to the payment of temporary hands. The late Government framed a regulation that temporary or casual hands employed by Government Departments must receive the union rate of wages, or wages fixed by an arbitration award, and I am sure that the Prime Minister, unless he has very considerably altered his views, will be prepared to adI think this is one mit that any one employed by a Department casually should receive the wages fixed by an arbitration award, or the union rate of wages.

We claimed that the concessions granted to the permanent hands should also he taken into consideration, just as a Judge in an Arbitration Court, when dealing with wages, always takes into consideration the fact whether a man is likely to get permanent work or merely casual work. For instance, when wharf labourers appear before an Arbitration Court they make a strong point of the fact that they should receive a higher rate per hour because they cannot secure continuous employment. paid the same wage per hour as an ordinary labourer gets, he would have very little at the end of a week; in fact, although wharf labourers are paid per hour considerably more than a number of labourers in other industries are paid per hour, the weekly average earned by wharf labourers is not more than £2 per week. In the same way we pointed out to the Public Service Commissioner that it was a fair and legitimate thing that, in fixing the wages for casual and temporary hands, the concessions granted to permanent hands should be taken into consideration, and we laid it down that if any person employed by the Government enjoyed all the concessions, in the shape of leave granted to the permanent hands, he had no right to ask anything more for similar work than the permanent hand received, but that if he did not get these concessions it was not a fair thing that he should get exactly the same pay. I am anxious to learn what is the policy of tlie present Government in the matter. merely to carry out the Act at present, seeing that we cannot alter it. that stand, they will not be able to employ trade unionists.

In connection with Government work a number of carpenters are employed temporarily. There are also permanent carpenters employed in some of the Departments, who are not necessarily paid the union rate of wage. Having entered the service a number of years ago they will remain in Government employ until they are sixty-five years of age. Each year they will enjoy three weeks* holiday, and they will be allowed six months' holiday after twenty years' service. The Public Service Commissioner takes these things into consideration in fixing their salaries. The carpenters outside the Public Service appeal to the Arbitration Court, and get their salaries fixed, not on the basis of permanent work, and not with consideration to the three If a wharf labourer were weeks' annual holiday or the six months' long-service leave. In these circumstances, it is more than probable that their wages will be 6d., 9d., or Is. per day more than those received by carpenters permanently employed in the Department. That is why I say that if it is the intention of the Government to carry out the idea of the Public Service Commissioner, they will not be able to employ trade union carpenters, unless they pay them union or current rates of wages, or the wages fixed under an arbitratio» award. out the law.

He also made some remark about my observing that he was not very often in the House. And did say on that occasion, was that his attendances at the House were not AB frequent as they might be, and that his attention to his duties in the House was still less frequent. The honourable member compared his attendances here w it h mine, but he omitted to state that I was in quarantine for about three weeks in the early part of the session, And lost my attendance at every sitting during that time, owing to my protest .against the Government's vaccination proposals. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -That is a good for my party and their interests in the excuse to get out of it . excuse.

A t the same time, I must ask the honorI did not hear able member to refrain from using language personally offensive to other honourable members. ber for New England was not at all caref u l about any remarks he made, or any innuendoes he tried to put forward, i u He tried to be funny and sarhis supposedly clever way. He does not know the difference between making a personal explanation and speaking on the adjournment of the House, which again shows that the cleverness on which he prides himself does not exist. He was making statements during the State election that were not correct, and, in order to remove any effect that they might have, I took occasion to refer to him in WhatI wanted to say, a good deal milder language than he was using. If he gets on a platform and alleges that a State Government have been wasting £4,000,000 on Socialistic experiments, when the real facts show that the amount spent was £290,000, we must come to the conclusion that he is uterly irresponsible, and has little or no regard for facts. I felt it necessary, not only to contradict his assertions by putting the facts before the people, but also to show them the irresponsible authority from whom the assertions emanated. I certainly had a right to do so in fighting manner I thought best.

ABBOTT -The Gwydir galah cannot keep quiet. that remark is very offensive, but we will put it down to the honourable member's ignorance. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -Without any desire on my part, this matter has taken rather a personal turn. I quoted from a newspaper, and could have quoted a number of newspapers, word for word, and have also taken the trouble to find out whether the statements could be verified, but the honourable member has not been able to show in one particular where that newspaper report is incorrect. being so, I must assume that the statement. I read here is absolutely correct, and that the honourable member used the words attributed to him. words. Unfortunately, they are true. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -That admission will shorten the remarks I have to make. It strikes me, as a new member, that there is a certain code of honour which should apply in politics as well as out of them; and people, in making statements publicly, are in duty bound to get as near to the truth as they possibly can. The question is whether the honourable member was justified in making the statement he did; whether I , as a new member, have taken no interest in the proceedings of the House, and have really not represented the electors of New England since I was returned. can safely say that since I have been here I have not taken up much of the time of the Hansard reporters. But I have heard such a flood of eloquence from honourable members on the other side of the chamber, including the honourable member for Gwydir, that little opportunity was presented to me to make myself heard. I have endeavoured to attend to my duties here; I have shown that the statements made by the honourable member for Gwydir in my electorate were absolutely without foundation, and were really spoken for political purposes, and to further political ends, and now that the honourable member admits that he was correctly reported in the press, I think I have satisfied my electorate that during the last six months I have endeavoured honourable member for to do my duty by them in this House. surer) [4.12] I wish to place on the table of the Library papers in connection with the Ordnance Stores. The report I have is from the Auditor-General, and it shows that the deficiency is not so serious as it would appear. With re^ference to the question submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne, as to the municipal ratings in the Australian capitals and ratings for similar services in London, Dublin, and Edinburgh, I think it is advisable to place before honourable members a copy of a further communication from the Government Statistician, explanatory of the replies which have already been furnished. Mr Knibbs writesI t was explained in the covering memorandum, That sent with the statement forwarded to the Treasury on the 27th November for reply to questions asked by Dr. Maloney, that comparisons drawn from the figures were subject to the limitation that they did not refer to the same matters, inasmuch as in some of the cities services which do not deny the were carried on by the municipalities themselves were in others intrusted to various boards, such as Water and Sewerage Boards, &c. The ratings as given were those specified in the local government portion of the various State Statistical Registers, and referred to city corporations. The most serious thing in giving the return to Parliament was the omission of the following remarks, viz. :"" The details given refer to city corporations alone. Any comparisons made of them are, of course, subject to the disability that they do not all relate to the same items, i.e., services which in some cases are performed by the municipalities are in others looked after by special boards, e.g., water and sewerage, & c . ' Whoever handed you the matter for reply should have incorporated those qualifying remarks, and to leave them out was, in my judgment, a mistake. One of the principal difficulties in the way of I preparing a strictly comparable return of this nature lies in the fact that differently constituted bodies control the rating for various purposes and different States and countries, and, in addition, the rates are levied on different bases. Thus, for example, in the case of Melbourne, the City Council imposes a rate of is. in the £ 1 for the construction and maintenance of roads, streets, bridges, culverts, & c , and a rate of 3d. in the £ 1 for public lighting, while the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, a federation of metropolitan municipalities, imposes a rate of is. 8d. in the £ 1 in respect of water supply and sewerage, in addition to meter rentals aud excess water charges. In Perth, on the other'hand, the City Council levies a general rate of is. 66. and a loan rate of gd., whilst the rates in respect of water supply, sewerage, and storm water are levied by«a Government Department-the Water Supply, Sewerage, and Drainage Department-and are consequently not municipal rates at a l l .
