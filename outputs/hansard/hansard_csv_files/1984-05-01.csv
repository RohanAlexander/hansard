On 29 February 1984 the Government clearly foreshadowed its commithonourable member for Higgins( Mr Shipton) ment to this piece of legislation, enclosed as it was said: in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No.5) of 1983. The fact is that the Government I am not talking about tax rorts or tax rip-offs; is committed to retrieving for the Australian What has been so difficult to comprehend in this people that which they unfairly lost, because that debate has been the fact that the Opposition has is what the legislation is about.

In fact there is no anarchy at the upper levels of our society, as we clearly have tonight in this place, anarchy which legislation in this House to get the money back for says that we should ignore morality, which is what the workers.
