Sustentation allowance will be paid during such training course. In addition to the Central Qualification Board, which meets daily at the Lands and Surveys Department, Perth, with the exception (at present) of Wednesday and Saturday, Branch Qualification Boards have been constituted at Albany, Bunbury, Kalgoorlie, Geraldton; and in a l l outlying centres where a Local Repatriation Committee is in existence, the said Committee may be constituted a Qualification Board for the purpose of duly examining applicants who desire to come under the provisions of this scheme,, and who would be penalized by being compelled to journey to the city for the purpose of going before the Cent r a l Qualification Board. Land. Land is provided under the heads of(a) Crown Lands -Farming. (6) Crown Lands -Grazing. (c) Crown Lands -Pastora l leases. (d) Repurchased Estates. (e) Repurchased Single Properties. (a) Crown Lands -The provision of these is in the hands of the Surveyor-General and his staff. Suitable land is subdivided and thrown open for selection by returned soldiers and sailors. Two thousand acres of cultivable land may be held by one man, of which 160 acres are granted free, except for office charges. On the remainder, the soldier is charged halfprice only. Loans for improvements and l i v -, ing allowance are granted to approved applicants on the terms set out under Finance. (b) Grazing leases on Crown lands are granted up to 5,000 acres in or adjacent to the agricultural districts. (c) Pastoral leases in the pastoral areas up to 100,000 acres may %e selected free of rent for five years. Any additional area is taken under the ordinary conditions under the Land Act. (d) Repurchased quired by the Lands and Surveys Department under the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act. The Discharged Soldiers' Settlement Board and the Controller are consulted at every stage of the negotiations prior to purchase, in order to insure the purchase only of the best land available. After purchase the estates are' subdivided and made available for returned soldiers and sailors on the terms set out under Finance. (e) Repurchased Single Properties -Thes e are acquired under the Discharged Soldiers' Settlement Act or the Agricultural Bank Act by the Discharged Soldiers' Settlement Board, and should be, as far as possible, going concerns; stock, plant, &c, being included in the purchase price. The ex-soldier is required to locate a property which he considers w ill be suitable to his requirements, and have same placed under offer to the Board. Concessions are set out under Finance. See also remarks re options under Procedure. Assistance. Advances on liberal terms, as set out under Finance, are made for improvements, inclusive of house, clearing, fencing, water supply, machinery, stock, seed, fertilizer, and living allowance, unti l the farm comes into the productive stage. An ex-soldier who held his property prior to enlistment may also be assisted to pay off existing liabilities on the land. ; Concessions on advances are set out under Finance. Inspection. For the convenience of ex-soldier settler applicants, administration w ill be decentralized as far as possible, in order that an ex-soldier who is resident in the country districts may transact the bulk of his preliminary business with the district inspector stationed in the locality in which he desires to settle. For example, an applicant desiring to purchase a single property w ill see the district inspector with the necessary particulars. That officer w ill inspect the property and forward his report and recommendation thereon to head office, thus obviating the delay which would be occasioned by application being made in the first place to head office. District inspectors are located at Northam, Kellerberrin, Bruce Bock, Kununoppin, Geraldton, Narrogin, Katanning, Albany, Bunbury, and Bridgetown. Residence. After an ex-soldier takes up residence on his holding, he w ill be visited once a month by his local inspector, who w ill supervise approximately fifty men. This officer w ill make payments to the settler for work done (see Finance--Living Allowance), advise him on farming operations, and note his requirements for the ensuing month. These inspectors w ill be carefully chosen in respect to their knowledge of the branch of farming for which the particular district is Estates -Thes e are acsuitable, and their investigations w ill be thorough. It is not anticipated that any settler w ill object to this. The ex-soldier w ill bear in mind that he has been placed in possession, in each case, of a valuable and f u l l y equipped property, and that, therefore, departmental supervision is necessary.

No payments are required for five years, and the purchase money is then payable by equal half-yearly instalments, not exceeding 6d. per acre per annum. The term of payment depends on the price, but will not be. less than twenty years from the. date of selection. Improvements -Advances by Agricultural Bank for improvements are repayable in thirty years. The interest during, the first year on amounts up to £625 is at the rate of 3* per cent, rising by * per cent, yearly, until the ordinary bank rate is reached.

It does, not necessarily follow; however, that this amount will be advanced inall cases where settlement is effected per medium of purchasing an improved property.. The maximum amount will only be advanced! in cases where it is abundantly evident, that the value is represented in the security offered. The ex-soldier for whom a single property has been purchased will be required to pay half-yearly, as from the date of his occupancy of such property, 50 per cent, of all rentals payable thereonto the Crown. The interest concession of 34. per cent, for the first year, rising i per cent, yearly till thecurrent rate of the Agricultural Bank isreached, is given on amounts up to £625.

Exception, however, is made in cases where blocks are purchased for grazing or dairying purposes, and where the £625 is insufficient to meet the cost of developing the land, buildings, and the purchase of stock. These cases, however, are comparatively few and far between. Successful applicants fox blocks in repurchased estates or for single farms, are entitled to. leases of the land allotted for a period of ninety-nine years, with the right of purchase after lease has been in force for ten years, provided the conditions of lease have been complied with, at the valuation placed upon the lot at .the time of leasing. Thecapital value is fixed by the Minister oni the recommendation of the Board, and the rental is based at a rate not exceeding 5 pes cent, on such valuation. Where there are any buildings on the land' at. the date of leasing, such buildings will bevaluedseparately, and the lessee will be required to purchase same at such valuation,, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, by equal half-yearly instalments, covering a period of twenty-one years.

That practice has obtained up to the present time; but, in a number of cases, importers after receiving goods have refused to produce documents in support of the valuation on which they paid duty in advance, and the Department has not been able to enforce, the production, of those documents, even where it believed that the duty paid was less than should have been paid. Consequently, it is felt that the present temporary arrangement must be ended, and -we have given what we think is sumcient notice to the commercial community to -enable it to make arrangements with -shippers which will enable documents to be sent in future with , or before, the goods to which they relate.

COA LTRADEDISPUTE . MOB,WELL COAL MINE. ister read the statement of the Victorian Minister, made in the Legislative Assembly, that Commonwealth legislation for the settlement of industrial disputes does not affect a State Government in any way, and does he not think that we should know exactly where we stand in regard to our legislative powers for the settlement of disputes? Has the righ t honourable gentleman any further statement to make concerning his consultations with the Premier of Victoria regarding the existing coal dispute? that I made a suggestion to the Premier of Victoriaf or the settlement of the dispute, which he was unable to accept. This Government has taken no further action, and, speaking off-hand, I do not see what else we can do.

16,Mr Hughes :,"As a general prinhonorable member asks me whether that principle applies in this case,, I tell him that I do not know. It is extremely difficult to know what the law is at present, following upon the recent decision of the High Oourt in regard to State instrumentalities. Prior to that I would have been able to say, "" No, it does not apply."" Now, I cannot say that, because that judgment goes very far. How far it goes no one is able to state. I am not going to say, for one moment, that our law does not prevail. It is not for any member of this Parliament to cut down the powers of the Commonwealth, and while there is a doubt I shall certainly not resolve that doubt against the Commonwealth. Buti f the honourable member asks me for an opinion whether, as a matter of fact, our law does prevail in this matter, I tell him frankly that I do not know. There is one simple procedure, however, which I suggested to the Premier of Victoria. That is that he should go to the Court and ascertain what the law is. I suggested that if he wanted to close down the Morwell Mine he should do so; that he should pay the award rateup to the date of his closing down the mine, and should then go to the Court and ask, "" I s this law ultra vires, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, or not?"" If the Court were to say that it was ultra vires there would be an end of the matter. I am authorized to say, on behalf of Mr statement itself, there is not the slightest Baddeley and his colleague, as representatives of the Colliery Employees Federation, that they would recommend their Council to accept such a decision.

We say that the award does apply. sonal explanation. In the course of a debate in this chamber a few days ago, regarding the question of payment for wheat, the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham) made a statement which has since been brought under my notice. The honourable member, after he had referred to myself upon some matter, personal explanation, I desire to say that stated that it was ""upon record"" that the honourable member for Flinders( Mr the firm with which I am associated exhibited its patriotism during the war by charging for calico which it had purchased at 54d. per yard prices ranging from Is. Sd. to 2s. per yard. If that statement were merely a repetition of something which had been told the honourable member for Gwydir, I , personally, would not have taken the trouble to correct it, or to make any remarks upon it. But the honourable member used the words, "" It is upon record."" When I had his statement pointed out to me I interpreted that phrase as meaning that the facts had been ascertained and were somewhere upon record. I asked the honourable member subsequently, and he then said to me, "" Oh, no; there was -no such record;"" and he added that somebody had told him what he had stated. For an honourable member to say in this House that something is on record when it has only been repeated to him by some one else is absolutely improper. AfterI had made my inquiry of the .honourable member it would have been fairer for him to have got up in his place and to have withdrawn hisr statement. That is the only point upon which I am protesting, namely, that a. statement has been made to the effect that certain circumstances are upon record when there is no such record in existence. Concerning the truth or otherwise of the ground for suggesting that anything of the sort occurred. There have been two inquiries conducted by Commissions in Melbourne upon the subject of the cost and selling price of goods, before which Commissions sworn evidence has been tendered. Every book and every figure of .every company has been at the disposal of those bodies of investigation, and no such particulars as the honourable member for Gwydir quoted have been ascertained or recorded. In addition, I wish to say that since the honourable member's statement was brought to.my attention I have had the fullest in quiry made in every channel of the business with which I am connected, and there is not one shred of evidence, or anything, indeed, to show that there is the slightest truth in his remarks.",27,Collecti On Of Dutie S Presentation Of Invoices

50,Sir Robert Best,"That case isTlie language used in this article is plain, unmistakable, and straightforward. This is what it saysAn organized gang of thieves handed together as a bunch of conspirators is included among the select and exclusive organization of workers who operate on the wharves of Commonwealth ports. The conspiracy, indeed, is world-wide. The thieving of cargo, more commonly known as pillaging, is not only carried on on a grand scale on Australian ships and wharves, but on oversea vessels before departure for 'abroad, on the high seas, and at Commonwealth terminals. . The position has become intolerable, and for our part we say the time has arrived when the authorities should take drastic action to break up the gang, gaol the arch conspirators, and put an end to this wholesale form of robbery, which is now winked at by the law and regarded as something in the nature of an uncontrollable evil. It points out the responsibility of the unions, and calls upon themto purge their organizations of the thieves and rogues included in their lists of 6nancial members. It refers to the f u t i l it y of the mere recording of fines against these people, in stead of imprisoning them. It saysA £10 fine to these men is as a mild scolding to a petulant child. If the man has not the cash to pay, the "" Black Hand"" quickly produces the funds. Theni t gives a list of the claims on one insurance company for twelve months. This list occupies close' on two columns of the publication. The amounts of the claims range from a few pounds to £ 9 0 0 for a single voyage. paid by this insurance company for the period was £ 5 , 1 2 7 ; and as there are fifty or sixty insurance companies doing this class of work, honourable members can gain a substantial idea of the ravages brought about by this pilfering. A report was called for by this insurance company, and the article says that the report statesIn June last four bales of woollens, valued at £900, which were tallied from the ship on to the wharf, disappeared mysteriously. Again, three bales, valued at £500, were landed on th* wharf, and vanished. What were the Customs authorities and the wharfinger doing to let these be taken away without authority. One Flinders-lane warehouse has received claims amounting to £2,700 in the last twelve months. Surely, after these scathing charges had been made in this most manner, and in such unqualified one would have thought that writs would have immediately bring this journal to account for them, but nothing of the kind took place. i Sir Robert Best. the waterside unions, who are charged with having thieves and rogues in the lists of their financial members.' labourers who are working the overseas ships are loyalists, who are not members of a bond fide union. quite immaterial.

54,Sir Robert Best,"That fact is that the duty of the Customs Depart-, ment was merely to collect revenue and detect frauds in connection with Customs matters, this journal comments on that aspect of the matter and saysThis is a fact, hut we say quite emphatically that the Customs Department, or, to be more exact, those whom it employs, display shocking disregard for the safety of cargo which, in the process of landing, is detained for check and inspection. At most Australian wharves there are closed sheds, where valuable cargo, on being landed, is placed for safe keepingWharf labourers in pursuance of their work are admitted to these compartments, but for some inexplicable reason, it is stated, the Customs officers forbid authorized special detectives, and special watchmen, employed by the ship-owners, to enter the enclosures. We are informed that convicted thieves have been granted access to these special compartments, when watchmen have been excluded. Is this part of the conspiracy, or is it merely a conspicuous example of official ineptitude? Inquiry into such a matter as tliis may produce interesting revelations.

We cannot say where they have gone. portunities for pillaging are, if anything, greater on the other side of the world than here. Goods are in transit for a considerable time, very often, between factory and ship. They are frequently locked out from the wharfs. sometimes takes goods to his own home in such circumstances, and he has sole possession of them before they ever get to the wharf at all. Eveni n the packing-room of a factory there are opportunities for pillage. The Customs Department has ample evidence that that kin d of thing frequently occurs. Packages have arrived here containing nothing but stones and bricks, and similar heavy things, which, have been inserted in order to make weight. We have'had evidence of false packing being wrapped up in newspapers of those countries from which the goods have come; and the dates of the newspapers have coincided with the date of despatch of the goods themselves. The whole question is one which has caused the commercial community throughout the world grave concern, and it is an extremely difficult matter to deal with. The newspaper articles under discussion have definitely stated that Customs officials have interfered with people who were charged with the duty of seeing that pillage did not occur. There are three parties, besides Customs officials, who are more or less engaged in trying to detect pillage. One of the three is comprised of the police, who, in Victoria, are under the control of the HarborO f course not; but Trust.

I have made careful inquiries regarding the extent to which our officers co-operate with these forces. The impression I have gained is that the cooperation is, for the' most part, cordial and thoroughly effective. But it has happened, on one or two occasions, that private detective agents have been sent down to the wharfs without credentials to indicate by whom they had been employed, and, on such occasions, our officers have found these gentlemen "" mooching "" about among the cargo in the sheds.

"" Had he done that the Commissioner surely would have had the whole matter properly investigated. Is this Parliament to be made the means of investigating every matter? Only last week the Hou-ie took away from the ordinary Courts ot the land a matter that should have been inquired into by one of them. Are we now going to investigate pilfering on the wharfs? As the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) suggests, the Commissioner of Police might ask the newspaper editor for the information which he has in his possession. But it is the duty of any citizen who has in his possessionevidence of the commission, of a crime to report it to the proper authorities. This newspaper editor would not even have to give the' information' on oath. I am sure that the Conmnissioner of Policei n any State would, and' ought to, acb immediately' upon, information given to him. Had the proper course been pursued, even while we were talking about it , the police should have arrested some of these criminals'. If the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard can sheet heime these charges, it can sheet them home through the medium of the police. It appears to me that the gist of these articles is an attack upon labour unions. the impression that in the labour unions working on the water f r o n t there are bands of criminals, and that they support the Labour party. This statement is made. I am referring to the in the vaguest terms, and then t h £ unions are' invited to issue a Writ. The persons making the charges Would. like them to issue a writ for libel and to have the action tried by themselves. That is one of the methods of the capitalists. honourable member mean by ""trie d by themselves"" ? jury consisting of representatives of their -own class. When the suggestion is made that the Court should be resorted to by means of an action for libel I would like to intimate to the honourable member that in my opinion the tribunal which should try these cases should be broadened and democratized, and that all actions for defamation should be tried by common juries taken from the ordinary electoral rolls. When that happensj it will be a great protection to Democracy and the public generally. I do not intend to detain the House longer. I felt bound to rise to protest against the charge that is made against 1 th.pimembers of the waterside unions generally, and also to point out that the r^a'ehinery ' of investigation .provided by our oidinary police force should be' able to ru n the offenders to earth.

104,Mr Ryan,"T r i e d before a specialtoo, that the evil is world-wide. It is not confined to Australia. labourers. It is rather singular that the clothing, and other articles, have been Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr removed by merely thrusting in the Greene) should have referred to a case that actualK came under my own I had twenty-five years' experience of the adjusting of pilfering claims, and I know that the cases of pilfering are numerous. The records of convictions show this, and it is an evil that should be stamped out. In one case which I adjusted, the firm had accepted from the Customs, and oyer the wharfs, a case of stocks and dies on the weight. There being no marks or signs of the case havliving. The rates charged by insurance ing been opened, the goods were taken delivery of as sound and in good order. At the warehouse, however, the merchant decided to ring up the marine insurance office, and when an inspection was made it was found that in the case there was a piece of bluestone calculated to be almost exactly the weight of the stocks and dies for Whichi t had been substituted. In order to prevent the bluestone knocking against the sides of the case is was wrapped up in a New York newspaper. a wharf labourer, of wanting stocks and dies? just as likely as anybody else to desire such things. There is no desire on my part to palliate offences of the kind, and there be no mistake, these losses in the no honourable member should endeavour to prevent an investigation. ber no confidence in the various Commissioners of Police and their staffs? adopted are not adequate to stop the evil, and, therefore, some further steps are necessary. As an insurance manager I acted in the settlement of many claims; and pilfering has become so glaring that it is almost a daily occurrence for insurance companies to be rung up, and asked to send an inspector to see some cases of goods that look suspicious. Sometimes, of course, it is found that there has been no interference, but in other instances, the insurance officer, the handling the cargo. If there be such surveyor attached to the wharf, and the Customs officer find that a case has been levered in such a way as not to affect even the nails, and that a variety of goods, including silks, stockings, underhand. This pilfering does not always occur in Australia, hut the record of notice in a certain State. convictions here is evidence that it does to a considerable extent. Under the circumstances this Parliament, or some other authority, should take immediate steps to improve the methods of detection. The £500,000 mentioned by the newspaper as representing the value of the goods pilfered in Australia is well under the mark, and it is quite true that this pilfering increases the cost of companies to cover pilfering are fairly high, running up to 10s. per cent, on the Australian coast. Most of the companies, however, are not fond of the risk, even at such a rate. between Australian ports? that comes under the notice of the police does not represent 50'per cent, of that which actually occurs. As I have said, the pilfering has become so frequent that the insurance company take the calls from the wharfs as almost a matter of routine business; and it has to be borne in mind that all the extra cost involved is borne by the general public in the form of the increased price of goods. Let form of additional charges are passed on to the consumer. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) refer to the unions as he did. I am also pleased to realize that the worse and cleverest pilfering is committed outside Australia. . Do not let Australians, however, try to vie with the more expert thieves elsewhere,, but, rather, set themselves to work to stop pilfering altogether,,for it is wrong, and does good to no one. There may be a little conspiracy amongst men on a wharfI do not, of course, say that all the men are involved-and naturally they do not like the idea of any police or other officer superintending the work of an officer about there are references made.",39,Robert Best Som E Merchants There Are The Harbor Trust Officials

126,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [4.29],,43,Postma Ster General S Department
127,Mr Blakeley,"(Darling) [4.31]The Post and Telegraph Service of Australia is unequalled as a sweating Department ; no other Commonwealth Department sweats its employees more, and in no other vocation followed by a large number of men and women are conditions so bad as there. Ministers apparently'intend that this state of affairs shall continue, and that no relief shall be given to the employees. In my early remarks on the basic wage, I predicted that this Government would not give the House an opportunity to deal with the subject, though I hope that that opportunity will be given, and that we stall be able to take a vote on a motion regarding it proposed by an honourable member. If such an opportunity is not given, I hold out absolutely no hope whatever for the public servants of the Commonwealth. It is over twelve months since the Basic Wage Commission started its labours, and the delay seems to show that Ministers do not intend to keep their election promises. How can a young man of twenty years of age live on a wage of £2 2s. per week, or a single man with fourteen or fifteen years' service on £2 15s. per week ? And there are married men getting only £2 18s., £ 3 , and £3 2s. per week. On such wages they cannot properly feed and clothe and educate themselves and their children, and cannot enjoy any of the good things of life. The position of affairs is so serious that unless the GovernService, there must be trouble. I have ment is prepared to immediately give some relief, there must be trouble. The Arbitration Court, a special Tribunal, and a Commission appointed to deal with the matter, are channels through which relief might be granted. But should they all be definitely closed by the end of next month, our public servants will be compelled by economic conditions to follow the lead of the more militant organizations. It has been said that it would be an awful thing for the Public Departments of this country to be closed, and that is so; but it would be no more than the Government deserves. If no money was received or paid in the Commonwealth Departments, that would more quickly bring Ministers to a recognition of the conditions which exist than all the telegrams that have been sent to them and to members. leading article in the Argus. what appears in the Argus. Those connected with that journal have never agreed with any of the sentiments I have uttered, and I do not expect them to i o so I am speaking for the public servants of the country, and I say, as the result of years of experience, -that when all avenues of relief have closed, drastic action should be taken. If the Government is not prepared to make an announcement before the end of December, only one course*is open to them. I venture to say that immediately the public servants decided on direct action, the Government would appoint a tribunal to remedy their grievances, or would have to take the consequences of holding up the business of the country. SinceI was thirteen years of age I have been through many strikes. I know their efficacy, and I know the cost of them to those who take part in them. I received my industrial baptism at Broken Hill at a very early age, when I went with my mother to the store to cash a coupon for 10s. on behalf of my father and for 5s. on behalf of mv brother-15s . in all to keep a family of eight. Flour was the chief conrm.od1.t5 brought back. Because of that experience, and because of experience which I have gained since, I feel that the Commonwealth Public Service is "" un against it . "" If the Government is not prepared to do something to relieve the acute distress and poverty which permeates the stated that I believe in arbitration. I believe that it is better to arrive at a settlement through an Arbitration Court or by means of compulsory round-tabla conferences, but when a Judge declares that £ 3 a week is sufficient for a single man, and £ 3 15s. for a married man who has a' wife and family to support, I say that his Court is absolutely closed against those seeking redress. People cannot live as hitman beings on such wages as those. If Ministers do not appoint a Special Tribunal to settle the grievances of the public servants, or give effect immediately ton, the Basic Wage Commissioner-eithe r of these two courses would meet with the approval of"" the public servants-bu t if , on the contrary, they shut up Parliament and shirk their responsibilities to the service, they will deserve all that they get.

130,To The Recommendations Of Mr Pidding,"the Australian Workers Union, they would not be employed under the sweated conditions under which they work to-day. I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the lack of proper facilities in my electorate. For a number of' years I have been waiting for the erection of post offices in the new suburbs which have sprung up there. A t Botany the Department bought land for a post office site eight or nine years ago, but the post office still remains poked away in the town hall. It is a bad business arrangement to pay rent for accommodation and to keep land lying idle. f u l l of factories, and population is in creasing there. I do not blame-the Postmaster-General, more than his predecessors, for the neglect to provide proper conveniences for the public, but now that the Treasurer has said that there is plenty of money available, and that he w ill not stint the Postal Department, 1 ask the honourable gentleman to take notice of these complaints. In South Kensington more buildings have recently been erected than in any other part of Sydney. Hundreds of homes have been built there for soldiers, and yet proper postal facilities have not been provided. Postmaster-Generali f more. cannot be done for Kensington, South Kensington, Long Bay, and Maroubra Bay? It is surprising that the postal 'facilities of the district have not been improved, remembering the enormous population that has gone there .of recent years. These facilities would prove a paying concern. They would not be a burden on the Department. Why? „ facilities there.' is put down for a post office at Dee Why Dorrigo, an isolated district in my elecdone. buildings has been handed over to the Works Department, and I am pressing for their completion. struction that the Works Department shall be asked for a report every month as to the progress of the various works. wages received by the employees of the Postmaster-General make them the worse paid body in the community; the ordinary labouring man, because he"" has more fight and is organized in unions, gets nearly double as much. I hope that the Postmaster-General may say, before his Estimates are passed, that he w ill give effect to the basic wage that has been proclaimed in New South Wales, by paying none of his officials less than £ 4 5s. per week'. That would allay the discontent which I believe exists in every branch of his Department. All the services of his Department have been increased in costletter rates, telephone calls, and telegraph charges-ye t the employees remain the worse paid in the community. I underThe district is stand that on last year's working the Department showed a profit; but we do not want a profit to be gained either at the expense of the public by the cutting down of facilities for communication, or at the expense of the employees. I hope that the employees w ill be put on a proper footing. We hear a good many complaints about delays in the delivery of letters and telegrams, but we can imagine what might take place should the officials become soured by their grievances, and get careless in the performance of their duties. They are apt to blunder in sorting letters, I ask the and it can be quite understood how such mistakes could disarrange the whole service. The employees should be encouraged to do their work well by being paid something more than a mere livin g wage. I hope that after the Estimates have been passed the Postmaster-General will show that he has taken a live interest in, the whole subject, and that his Department w ill be raised to the highest possible plane. I desire to put on record the appreciation We have no proper of certain country districts of the treatment of the Postmaster-General.

I recently gave instances in this Chamber with respect to public officials in a certain town. The pay received by the local school teacher exceeded by 'about £20 0 per annum the salary of the postmaster, although the latter was controlling five more employees than the former. Similar comparisons may .be made between railway stationmasters and postmasters. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer j that is the payment of junior telegraphists. of considerable value.to them, of .course; but their wages during the early period of their training should be, at any rate, sufficient to allow them to live without too much hardship when they have been sent away from their homes. Many of these employees are placed in positions where they are required to handle various moneys. Temptation is continually placed in their way. ' The Government should pay them at least enough to prevent that temptation from becoming irresistible. About the 19th March last I drew attention in t h is ' House to the fact that my name had been forged to a bogus telegram which had been handed in at the Haymarket Post 'Office, Sydney. I then urged that investigation be unade into the matter, and that whatever steps were offender should be taken in order that my name might be vindicated. A f t e r a considerable time. I received from the Postmaster-General's Department the following letter, dated 12th August, 1920 :Dear Sir,-With further reference to the representations made by you in Parliament some time since, regarding an unauthorized telegram in your name despatched from the Haymarket Post Office to Broken Hill, I beg to inform you that special inquiry in tlie matter has been made by a detective, but that, while suspicion points strongly to one source as that from which the telegram came, sufficient evidence has not been obtained to enable a charge to be proved -Yours faithfully, G-.

The honourable gentleman did not see his way clear to do that. He said that' since J had seen the papers no useful purpose would be served by laying them on the table of the House. I then interviewed the Acting Secretary of the Department, and asked for copies of the Their training is statements made by the postal detectives with regard to their investigations. I asked, further, for a statement that had been made as to the location of the particular typewriter upon which this bogus telegram had been typed. The Postmaster-General informed me that he had sought legal advice, and that the Solicitor General, I think, had advised that it would be against established practice to comply w it h m y request for definite in formation or to lay the papers on the table of the House, where they would be open to criticism and comment.

If any statement that I make in regard to it should be inaccurate, then obviously the Postmaster-General can meet it in the ordinary way by tabling the actual reports. The position is that my name was forged to a bogus telegram, which was used against me, and was forged so successfully that technically the persons responsible for it cannot be prosecuted. They have been too clever to enable a prosecution to be successfully launched. There is such an accumulation of circumstantial evidence, however, that I believe no man or woman in the community on learains; of that circumstantial evidence will have any doubt as to the,identity of the offenders. But beearliest moment, in order to take part in the cause the Department thinks that it canand endorsed' Labour candidates. not sheet home this offence I am denied even the right to have the papers laid on the table of the House. I am expected to let the matter drop without my own constituents or the general public being made aware of the real facts. I have been forced into what is to me a very distasteful position, but there is no course open to me other than that of dealing from memory with the contents of the file. About the 14th January last I received from the secretary of the Miners Union in. Broken Hill a telegram advising me that I had been selected as the miners'' delegate to proceed to Tasmania. answered that I would go by the first available boat. I subsequently received a letter from Mr W. Carey, general secretary of the Australian Labour party in the State of New South Wales, dated 2lst January, 1920, asking me to place myself at the disnosal of the central executive for campaign work during the then forthcoming State electoral campaign. I replied that I had been selected by the Miners Union of Broken Hill to proceed to Tasmania; that I did not know how long I should be there; that I was going to Tasmania at my own expense; that my old comrades badly needed my assistance there, and that the executive no doubt would cordially agree with the action I proposed to take. I next received a letter dated 24th February, 1920, signed by ex-Senator Grant, Mr Con'sidine. on behalf of the campaign committee,which read as follows:Dear Sir,-The campaign committee hascarefully noted the contents of your letter dated tlie 29th January. It is of the opinion; that you should put in at least one week in thp Sturt 'electorate before the 19th prox.. Kindly let me know by return mail if you are prepared to do so. On the following day I received from Mr Carey a letter which read as follows :Macdonell House, 321 Pitt-street, Sydney, 25th February, 1920. MrM . P.

Dear Sir,I desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 25th February, wherein you state that it is the wish of your executivethat I should proceed immediately to SturtI State electorate. In reply thereto, I have toinform you that it is not my intention to take the platform against men whom I believe to be thoroughly bond fide Labour men, and whose work in the Labour movement in this country constitutes a record of which any member of the party might well be proud. I regret that the disinclination of the executive to take any steps in the direction of healing the unfortunate breach existing in the ranks of Labour in. the Sturt electorate forces upon me the very disagreeable task of choosing between participating in the commission of an act of grave injustice on Messrs. Brookfield and O'Eiley, or of placing myself in opposition to the expressed wishes of the executive. I have decided that I w ill not go to Sturt, and in conveying t h a t decision to you I desire to remind you that on every occasion that my services were placed at the disposal of the party for election purposes they were turned down, and I was told, to "" stick to my parliamentary duties."" On this occasion, however, when engaged in a campaign for funds for the BrokenH ill miners in Tasmania, I am asked to drop that and go post-haste to Sturt.

CAREY, General Secretary. I have never yet heard what was the result of the executive's deliberations. On returning from Tasmania, I received from Mr Vic. Kavanagh the following telegram :Can you give Billy O'Brien a night at Moama and Deniliquin? Messrs. O'Brien, Cleary, and Thomas were candidates at the State election then proceeding. I replied that I would do so, and set out immediately. I left Melbourne on 13th March, spoke at Deuiliquin, Moama, and Mathoura, and left again on the following ""Wednesday to resumo my duties in this House. D u r in g my absence the following telegram, addressed-to me by Mr Huckell, secretary of the Barrier District Assembly of the Australian Labour party, had arrived:Assembly require your attendance Broken Hill, Thursday next, for State campaign.

Next day, while I was still absent, this further telegram came from If cannot come Broken Hill, wire me wishing success to official Labour party candidates. --HTJCKEIX . The party Whip ( Mr James Page) did not reply to that message, preferring to await my return. found these telegrams, together with others, awaiting me. Among them was the following,addressed to me by the Barrier DailyT r u t h on 17th March:Miner reports you opposing Brookfield other end electorate. Wire reply immediately if correct and your whereabouts. In reply to that message I sent a press wire, conveying the whole of the correspondence which I have read to honourable members, and showing my attitude with regard to Brookfield and the State campaign. On the 19th March, that is to say, the day before the State election, I received the following wire from the Barrier DailyT r u t h : Huckell has received wire .signed "" Considine, Haymarket, Sydney,"" wishing success Official Labour party. Wire reply immediately if this is genuine. Urgent. To that message I repliedAny telegram, letter, or message from Sydney with my name attached thereto is a forgery. I have not beep in Sydney since January. On the same day I raised the matter in the House. This completes my own file in connection with the question. The papers in possession of the Postmaster General show that the detective who made an investigation in Sydney came to certain very definite conclusions as to who was responsible, for the sending of the bogus telegram. The departmental handwriting experts are of opinion that the same individual could have forged my name. The typewriting experts who were consulted by the departmental officials in Sydney say that the bogus telegram was typed on an Underwood machine which had certain very peculiar characteristics. Those characteristics were such that samples were taken of typewriting done on various machines, including three in the Australian Labour party's headquarters, Sydney. These samples are numbered in the documents 5, 6, and 7. No. 6, which is one of the samples taken of work done on the typewriters in the office of the secretary to the Australian Labour party, Sydney, according to the statement of these gentlemen, corresponds' in every particular wdth the peculiarities I have mentioned.

To use a common, every-day phrase, somebody may have been "" pulling my leg."" ours! that is my information on the authority of one of the leading business men of Mildura.

I honestly believe that the Postmaster-General thinks that this business is being attended to; and, therefore, I wish to draw his attention [267] to the fact that, at the present moment, there are many mail contractors in New South Wales who, though in my opinion entitled, have not received any drought allowance for this year. Only to-day I No received two communications to the effect that certain mail contractors were about to be paid; but I know there are several others whose claims are still unsettled. I do not charge the Po3tmaster-General with neglect, because I believe that when he gave us the assurance that the matter would be attended to, he trusted to his officers, and understood that it would be.

We all know that the life of the settler is not nearly so pleasant as the life of the town resident.

Every honourable member recognises that the Postal Department should not be run as a profit-making concern, and that it is a public utility which should be conducted in the interest of the public. Therefore, I hope that more attention will be paid to the extension of facilities, including telephones in country districts, without the residents there being called upon to pay the heavy subsidies which they are now asked to provide. In almost all country towns the telephone exchange closes at 6 o'clock. Of special fee an exchange can be kept open after that hour, but from all parts of my electorate I have received communications from men who are affected by the early closing of the telephone exchanges pointing out that as in almost all cases persons who are engaged on the land work until 6 o'clock or afterwards, they have no opportunity of making use of the telephone to assist them in the transaction of their business unless, they chose to dislocate their ordinary daily pursuits in exchange is allowed to remain open until 8 o'clock at night, it would afford them great assistance, and at the same time bring additional revenue to the Postal Department.",50,Postma Ster General S Department

167,Some Honourable Members Mr Wienholt,"The semi-officialat his own cost. This is an injustice. I think the Postmaster-General should provide these men with a holiday free of any expense to themselves. I do not intend to speak on the general question of telephone facilities in country districts; the matter has been put excellently more than once by honourable members of all three parties; but any one who, like myself, happens to have a private telephone stretching out in a way that irakes it the furthest point of any telephone communication in a closely settled country district, will know from the free use one's neighbours make of it the great advantage such a service affords. I always tell any visitor who happens to be staying at my cottage not to be frightened if he hears people walking about at night, as it is likely to be some one who has come in from further out to make use of the telephone. There are many cases of confinement and so on, in which the use of a telephone makes a great difference. I do not believe in being parochial in these matters; but I notice that the Postmaster-General has on the notice-paper two notices of motion, the first of which is a proposal to duplicate the trunk line between Melbourne and Sydney. I have no desire to say anything against the in terests of the people in the two leading cities of Australia, but I do think that the Postmaster-General should be careful to make sure that he is not unfairly duplicating existing facilities before considering the requirements of districts which have no facilities. Of course, it would be unfair for me to say this without mentioning also that the Minister's second notice of motion relates to a proposal to link up Brisbane and Sydney by a trunk telephone line, which, I think, is a very necessary work. I agree with the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) that it is better to build a new line to open up additional country along the line of communication. It may be my fault as a member, but I certainly do not see that the district I have the honour to represent is getting very much further in the matter of telephone communication. There is one district which I may quote as one among many, Pimpana Island, which is very closely settled. A proposal to connect it with the line from Brisbane to Southport was approved seven years ago, and at the time the residents paid £80 towards the work, but since then they do not seem to have made any further [267]2 progress towards getting the line. I hope the Postmaster-General w ill look into this matter. I believe he is sympathetic, and I hope that he will keep' continually before him the urgent necessity for giving telephone communication in country districts. I wish to speak in reference to the method of grading officers in the Postal Department. I understand that it will necessitate a slight amendment to the law. Outside the capital cities there is no relative distinction made as between certain groups, no matter what the importance of a post-office may be. Take, for example, the post-office at Newcastle, where the volume of business transacted, and the revenue received, are greater than are the volume of business transacted and the revenue which is received by offices in some of the State capitals. Yet that office is graded as a country post-office. There one may see the postmaster sitting at a table, so busy that he is unable to interview people who wish to consult h i m , receiving cash from the officials at the end of the day just as if the office were one of minor importance in a remote portion of the Commonwealth. The existing system urgently needs alteration. Let me give a typical instance of the conditions which obtain in respect of Commonwealth post offices. In the telegraphic branch of the Newcastle office there are twenty-five officials employed, yet the head of that office is in receipt of a salary of more than £100 less than that which is paid to the railway official in charge of the operators at the same place, who has only eight senior and eight junior officials under his control. The telegraphists in the post-office are required to operate the intricate duplex system, whilst the operators on the railways staff are merely required to work the simple Morse instruments. A similar disparity between the salaries of the members of the railway staff and those of the postal staff obtains from the top to the bottom. Again, in the telephone mechanics' branch, men who have been engaged upon highly skilled work for years are to-day in receipt of a wage which is only equal to that of an ordinary labourer outside. The same thing applies to all other branches of the Commonwealth Service. Thus there is no encouragement for good men to remain in the Service. As a matter of fact, some of the best officers in",52,Postma Ster General S Department
168,Mr Watki Ns (Newcastle) [5.49],".the Postal Department are leaving that Department to accept employment outside. I hold that our Commonwealth Departments should at least set an example to other employers in the matter of adequately paying for efficient service. A f t e r to smithereens. the lapse bf nine, months it is time that the report of the Basic Wage Commission was submitted for our consideration. hope that before many days have passed we shall know its contents, and be in a position to deal with it . In conclusion, I trust that the Postmaster-General will recognise that the importance of a post-office does not depend upon whether it is situated in a State capital, and that all these offices should be graded in accordance with the volume of work with which they are required to deal. If an amendment of the, law is necessary in this connection, the sooner it is made the better. As the representative of a country electorate, I feel impelled to say a few words upon this occasion. Upon previous occasions some honourable members have assisted me to voice my complaints, sometimes with effect, at other times without result. the present time we have in office a Postmaster-General who has shown himself to be sympathetic in the matter of providing postal and telephonic facilities for outside districts. only one or two honourable members who represent remote constituencies such as I do. They include the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page),.the honourable and the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory). either the Postmaster-General or his deputy is to blame in the matter to which I am about to refer, but it is a fact that, some time ago, our postal inspectors were instructed to be as economical as possible in all their recommendations. for example, that I write a letter to the Postmaster-General, in which I make a complaint. to the Deputy Postmaster-General in .Queensland, who in turn will forward it to the inspector of a particular district. That officer will report, perhaps, not exactly as he has been instructed, though he may. have received an intimation that he is to "" go slow."" Certainly he does go slow-ver y slow in some cases. Let me give point to my remark by instancing what occurred in 1918 when a cyclone iu Queensland blew a certain post-office one time there was a Customs House there, but it had been closed some time before the cyclone occurred. . The building, however, remained in the possession of the Customs Department, and was severely damaged in the cyclonic storm. It is true that the Customs Department had leased it , but evidently somebody had the ear of the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs, with the result that the damage which it sustained was immediately repaired, whereas the local post-office was permitted to remain for nearly twelve months in its damaged condition without any effort being made to repair it . In that case, however, the faul t did not rest with the inspector. During the same cyclone another little post-office was blown away, and w i th it about £8 worth of postage stamps. These had not been However, I am pleased that at put into the office safe, as they should have been, and the wind swept them away and damaged them to such an extent that they were unfit for use, with the result that the postmaster was compelled to pay for them. Pin-pricks of this kind are very irritating. Only the other day I He is. . There are received a copy of a letter in which the Postal Department asked for a guarantee of £900 in connection w i th the proposed erection of a telephone line. From my own experience I know that the departmental estimate of works of this description is usually 50 per cent, in excess of I do not suggest that the price for which they could be executed outside. I have proved that conclusively upon more than one occasion. I wish now to say a few words in regard to our public servants who are located in the northern portion of this Suppose, continent.

One matter about which I have to complain is the increase in postal and telegraphic rates. Mr .FLEMLNG .Without increased rates we cannot expect increased services. the postage rate increased from I d . to l i d . for years, and we have recently had a further increase in the postal rates without being any better off than we were before, so far as the postal facilities in some districts are concerned.

The Government propose to establish an extra telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney to cope with the business, and if the Treasurer will delay the erection of that extra line for another twelve months, and spend the money which it will cost in my electorate in providing facilities which do not at present exist, the Government can carry out the extra line between Melbourne and Sydney next year. If the right honourable gentleman will undertake to adopt that course, I The day of the arrival of the shall not say another word. the honourable member for Moreton( Mr. Wienholt) will ask me to do the same thing next year in the interests of his electorate, and the Melbourne-Sydney line will be postponed again. that the erection of an extra line between Melbourne and Sydney is required, but at the same time.

The electorate which I represent is almost as big as New South Wales, so that my one simple little request ought not to be objected to. I again plead with the Government to give a lead to private enterprise in the matter of inaugurating wireless telephony and wireless telegraphy to bring the outback people of western Queensland into touch with civilization. After the authorities had inaugurated the system of boring for artesian water supplies, and had proved those vast storages, private enterin coach and rail fares. prise stepped in and made it possible for Queensland to carry millions of head of stock. With that lead in mind, I plead with the Government to make the initial experiments with these new means of communication. There are stations far outback where the people seldom see a strange face.. There are many people who never see a white man or woman until they come in to the railhead at some terminus or othera matter of ,300 or 400 miles journey. I feel sure that my pleading with the Postmaster-General will not be in vain, for he has already given us mail services which we had never previously had, and he has reinstated others which bad lapsed. charged the same. That is not fair. The People of the cities have no idea what it means to be dependent on a mail delivery once in every three weeks, or for a delivery to be delayed as long as three or four months in wet weather, and to be altogether abandoned during drought times.

I want the sympathetic attention of the Postmaster-General while I discuss the matter of allowance officers. There are few of these latter now in the far-back second year, so that he may have six portions of Western Queensland. The former Public Service Commissioner, ment of postmasters from among General Division officers, who were called assistants-in-charge. They did the work of postmasters, and many of them were much more efficient than postmasters who were actually drawing higher pay. I appeal to the Minister ""to do something more for them.

If he pays for his own return to Brisbanei t costs him a really enormous sum Extension of time granted. -In a democratic country like Australia it is peculiar that there should be two distinct rates of allowance for officers serving side by side in the one office.

A f t e r they have been there a fortnight riding that line ""on their own"" for a couple of hundred miles, they have a habit of getting sick, and another man has to be sent up in their place. Y e t this man stays there from year to year. No member of this House would cut the Postmaster-General's estimates down by one shilling so long as he secures efficient service. If there is one thing 'more than another that honourable members have asked for ever since I have been here, it is that the Postmaster-General shall be as liberal as possible, provided that he gets efficient service. All I have asked the PostmasterGeneralf o r , and it is not much, is a few more hundred miles of telephone lines, and one little ewe lamb of a post-office. As to the wireless telegraph and telephone business, I should like the Postmaster-General to t r y to give us an experimental station righ t out near the South Australian border. It would not only be food for us in Western Queensland and for the Northern Territory end of the South Australian border, but would also bring us into communication with Darwin. The existing telegraph line is costing a great deal of money, and if we could have communication by wireless a great saving would be made. W it h these remarks, the Postmaster-General's estimates have my good wishes. to emphasize a point which I endeavoured to make in an earlier debate on Supply. If I mistake not, from the figures before us, the Postmaster-General estimates a profit from his Department of £1,283,000. If that profit is to go into the general revenue, I regard it as nothing less than a scandal, in the face of the general opinion of members that the Postal Department is a service, and should not be a profit-making machine. If , however, the heavy anticipated revenue, -which is greatly in excess of that of the previous year, is to be devoted to the very necessary extension of the facilities of .the Department, particularly in rural parts, I shall have the greatest satisfaction in castoffer encouragement to the better class of ing my vote for the passing of these Estimates. Postmaster-Generalt o speak on this matter himself, in order to explain to the Committee to what purpose he proposes to devote the surplus. I hope it will not be treated as the £500,000 surplus of last year was treated. [9.21] I had intended to anake some remarks on the question of the remuneration of the employees of the Department, but as there will be an opportunity before the House adjourns of discussing it in the debate on the basic wage, I shall not bring it before the Committee now. I wish, however, to place before the Postmaster-General the position of the younger employees of the Department-thos e from whom it is hoped to draw the responsible officers of the future. It must be admitted by every one who has given any attention to the matter that the Commonwealth cannot hope to develop an efficient service under existing conditions. To-day, in order that a man may keep his son in the Department, he has to subsidize him unti l he is long past the time when in any other employment he would be making some useful contribution towards the expenses of the home. Cases have come under my notice where lads of seventeen or eighteen have been transferred from their home towns to remote centres in the interior on a wage of 30s. a week, out of which they are asked to find board and clothe themselves, and provide some of the amusements that ought to belong to the period of youth. rush these positions? I wish just what they do not do. When a lad. applied for special consideration in one case, the Department gave him t h e ' princely allowance of £ 6 a year for living away from home. That means that the parents of lads have to consider whether they can afford to subsidize them while they are working for the Government, with the knowledge that, even if they attain to the position of postmaster, their remuneration will still be f a r below a reasonable wage. These young people will not come under any basic wage arrangement, and that is why I mention their case now. If we hope to have sufficient capable officers in the future, it is essential that we should young men to come into the Service.

As soon as a lad is competent to do the work of a telegraphist, other Departments, such as the Railway Department, offer him from 50 to 100 per cent, better wages than the Commonwealth offers, and thus, after the Commonwealth has been put to the expense of his years of training, he passes oufTof the Commonwealth Service altogether. That is called economy. I consider it the very worse form of extravagance. hear it so called in the next debate, if not in this. We also read in the newspapers, which are supposed to be the great vehicles for the expression of public opinion, that the Commonwealth Government is grossly extravagant. more readily proved that the Commonwealth is niggardly to the extent of millions in the remuneration of the people who do its work, and that many of the evils of the Public Service to which the papers continually call attention arise from the fact that we do not give to the members of any branch of the Public Service, and particularly the more highlyorganized branches, that remuneration which is given for equal brains outside. While we continue to expect that public servants shall do their work for less pay than is given to people doing similarly responsible work outside, we cannot hope to secure the same efficiency in the Public Service that it is possible to obtain in private concerns. ber advocating increased taxation? cating, whatever is necessary in order that the Commonwealth shall obtain efficient service. That can only be done by payiug One very ill i ndecent wages in every branch. I have had a business training. I hear people talking about the need of business men in politics. Any business man who takes hold of this problem will apply to it the same principles that he applies to his own business. That is, he will pay well the men who do his work, if he wants to retain efficient We have been taking some officers in his service. The man who knows business, and knows what r e a l economy means, is after the best brains I was told he can get to run hi§ show. He does not consider whether it is going to cost him £2,000, £3,000, or £5,000 for the man who has control of tens of thousands of pounds' worth of his business. He wants to know where he can get the man who can make £10,000, £20,000, or £30,000 by the efficient management of his business. , That is the attitude the Commonwealth will have to assume if it is ever to get equal efficiency with private organizations. Not a month passes but some of the best intellects in the Service go out of it to better positions abroad. That goes on right up to the top. I heard talk from some honourable members about the extravagant salary that was paid to Mr. -Who calls it economy ? Alan Box, the secretary of the H i g h ComW e shall missioner in London. They said, "" The Government have taken a civil servant from Australia, who was getting only £300 or £400 a year, and are giving him £1,000 a year. What shocking extravagance!"" Mr Box had not been in LonI t can be don very long before a private concern offered him £2,000 a year, and to-day he is no longer in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. That is the story of many others in every Department. As soon as a man shows his capacity to earn a decent salary the Commonwealth w ill not pay it , and he has to look elsewhere for that preferment which he ought to be able to get in the Service. I hope the Postmaster-General, with other Ministers, will look at this question in the light in which it would be regarded by any business man trained to get the best brains to run his business.

Commonwealth, but that was at a time when the Commonwealth was paying better salaries. A t the present time the salaries paid by the Commonwealth are in many cases less than those paid by private employers, and we in turn are losing valuable men. Government works are being carried out in practically all the electoral districts; and it does seem as though, in this regard, there was greater difficulty in the case of Government work than in the case of private work. On the Mornington Peninsula, in my electorate, the construction of a railway is being held up because the State Railway Department is not paying a wage equal to that for similar work outside the service. On the other hand, I know of contractors who are kept busy all the year round, and who have no cause to complain of any difficulty in obtaining skilled service, simply because they are prepared to recognise ability. employees ? inefficient men in all places, even in this Parliament; and I am afraid that if we had to face an examination up to a certain standard, many of us would not pass. If the honourable member would apply such a test to ordinary employment he i»ught to be prepared to take a dose of the iame physic. I know of no big business organization, whether private or governmental, where all the employees -are of equal calibre or merit; but the outside employer knows that the average work he receives is good, and is willing to pay for it. As we differ in our facial appearance so we do in our ability; and employment must be found for the whole of the human family, despite its inequalities. The sooner the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) abandons the idea of trying to perform a miracle the better. I believe that the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) sympathizes with the policy of encouraging what we call local industry. In my opinion, we import altogether too much of the articles we require in the Postal Department. W it h our raw materials, and the genius of our workmen, we should be able to produce nearly everything that is necessary. patent rights, the Government ought to make some arrangement so that the actual work of manufacture may be carried out The here. I have been, delighted with the splendid work done in some of our own workshops. The work in connection with telephones is intricate and delicate in character; but notwithstandingthis it can be admirably performed by Australian workmen, and I trust the Postin aster-<General w ill give our local mechanics an opportunity of manufacturing in Australia as much of the postal requirements as can possibly be made here. Why should we import from America articles that can be manufactured in the Commonwealth? I trust the Postmaster General, with his sympathies in this direction, w ill proceed on these lines, and give his officers every encouragement to arrange for the manufacture of our requirements as f a r as possible in the Commonwealth. I am glad to support the suggestion of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr James Page) in connection with wireless telephony. I understood the Postmaster-General to say when he was last discussing the subject -There are good and that the Department had certain experiments in hand, and if that is so I trust they will be extended over short, moderate, and long distances, because if this work can be satisfactorily carried out we shall by able to dispense with poles, wires, and insulators, and thus reduce our expenditure to an enormous extent. Messages can be transmitted by this system just as intelligently asunder the present system. I made some inquiries from the honourable member for Bass( Mr. Jackson) concerning the means of communication between K in g Island and Tasmania. .Some fifteen years ago the Yambacoona was the only steamer trading between K in g Island and Launceston, and on one occasion when she damaged her propeller, and had to undergo repairs, those good old pioneers who were then located .on the island were cut off from the rest of the world for four or five weeks. I understand there is now a wireless station on the island, and the residents are now in close touch with the rest of the world.

There is a great responsibility resting upon the Postal Department, and it should be our endeavour to give those who are living in the more remote parts of this great continent the most up-to-date postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities to enable them to carry on their magnificent pioneering work. Coming nearer home, I am either fortunate of unfortunate in representing more than one-half of the outskirts of the city of Melbourne, and I have very great difficulty in obtaining postal and telephonic facilities for those who live in the were at one time attributed to it .

I do not intend to criticise the present Postmaster-General, because I believe that, considering the time he has been in office., he has done remarkably well. According to the figures on the present Estimates the Government are going to spend in the Postal Department this year £1,000,,000 more than was expended last year. additional charges. It has been my duty to introduce citizens to the present Postmaster-General, and I am pleased to say that he has granted benefits and concessions-and rightly so-that were denied by the previous occupant of that office. I trust that the Deputy Postmaster-General, to whom we have to go with our requests, will fully consider the requirements of those in the outer suburban areas as well as those of our outback settlers. I am not one of those legislators who expect our State Railways OT Commonwealth Postal Department to pay, because I do not think they should be regarded as commercial concerns. adequate railway and postal facilities are provided, it will mean that our vast ex-, panse of territory will be more rapidly developed, and that we shall in that way reap an indirect benefit. is not costing the Commonwealth anything. vious Postmaster-General made a boast of saying that he had created a surplus of £500,000, but that is not a creditable performance, seeing that the service was starved in order to accomplish it. I would like to know whether the Postmaster-General has been informed by his officers that the automatic telephonic system does not possess all the virtues that cording to the latest reports, the automatic system in the United States of America-althoug h they . were very The residents in those enthusiastic over it a few years ago-is being dispensed with, and the old system is being reverted to. If the statement published in this evening's paper is correct, that the Basic Wage Commission, which has been taking evidence all over Australia, has fixed a basic wage of £5 5s. per week, I presume there will be a howl of indignation in some quarters. had been fixed at £5 10s. fixed below that rate, because I am"" not one of those who look upon the financial situation with any degree of apprehension.

Nothing, as all those who have reflected upon the position know, can be further from the fact. The Post Office is a great national institution, which proceeds upon the basis of recognising equality of citizenship in the equality of the claims preferred by its citizens, no matter where they may reside, to far more consideration than they could ever hope to receive upon a pounds, shillings, and pence basis. Holding that view of the Post Office, it follows, in my opinion, that its primary object is to give the people every possible facility in postal, telegraphic, and telephonic communication, keeping in touch (Gippsland-Postmaster as far as possible with business methods I do not desire to and management.

Honourable members will see, therefore, it is not true that New South Wales is not getting its f a i r share of expenditure. South Wales is getting more. is a complete answer to the charge made the other night that we were boosting up Victoria at the expense of New South Wales. We are anxious to extend the telephonic communication in the out-back districts, and there is not much likelihood of any surplus in connection with the affairs of the Department. I am quite satisfied to push on with all necessary Treasurer is prepared to givefl me all the money I want, because this is the policy of the Government. The only thing that will prevent the money being All spent will be the impossibility of getting material supplied during the year, b u t we shall do our very best. We do not want to make any surplus out of the Post Office. As I said in my circular letter, I want to see what would otherwise be a surplus expended in extending these facilities in the out-back districts. I have always contended that people do not go out-back from philanthropic or patriotic motives. They go there because they think they can make a good l i v in g; but the Government should never f a i l to recognise the benefits which people who go out-back confer upon the country . In America.

When wireless telephony is devethe loped as a commercial proposition-that is a long way off yet-it w ill be possible to effect a considerable saving in the construction of telephone lines. That is our object. I have indicated the way in which at present the money is intended to be spent. There w ill be no surplus so f a r as ' I am concerned.

We should not pay our public servants by rule'of thumb, we should not pay them a wage under which merit will be entirely disregarded. These are the matters of which I complain and of which my party complains. 250,000 civil servants in the States and the Commonwealth-in other words, we have one civil servant to every ten adults. That is altogether too many. tripping over each other, and we are not getting from them the service that we should for the tremendous sum of money which we pay them. To-day the salaries of our public servants aggregate nearly £40,000,000 annually. When we allow a business Commission to straighten up these Services we shall be able, to alter the methods by which civil servants are now promoted and to insure that they shall be adequately paid for the services which they render. I am sorry that I did not hear the observations of the Postmaster-General upon the question of the salaries paid to bur public servants. I have listened to a great deal of criticism from honourable members upon both sides of the Chamber concerning the fact that the Postal Department is paying many of its officials a salary which is altogether inadequate. There can be no argument about that statement. 1 am sorry that the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) did not direct the Postmaster-General's attention to this fact. Nobody can look through the Estimates with a knowledge of existing conditions in regard to our post and telegraphic services without recognising that I believe in payment the salaries which are being paid to many of these officials are utterly insufficient. That must be obvious to everybody. all parties in this Chamber. That being so, what are we waiting for now ? Isi t for the report of the Basic Wage Commission ? If so, what will happen when we get that report? Surely 1316 PrimeI f that were done, if Minister ought to be sufficiently frank to admit that the salaries being paid to our public servants are entirely inadequate and ought to be increased. It is our business to raise the necessary money to permit of that increase being granted. The Commonwealth should not ask its officers to work for a wage which is less than they are entitled to receive. As an illustration of the nature of the salaries which are being paid at present, I would point to a list of officers who, I am sure, have had We have an army of a long experience of their work. I find, for example, that there are 170 telegraphists who are in receipt of £ 1 9 3 12s. per annum, 150 telegraphists at £244 They are per annum, 65 postmasters who get £222 per annum, and 167 postmasters at £270 per annum. I might go through a long list in almost every branch of the Department in which similarly inadequate salaries are being paid. What guarantee have we that when the report of the Basic Wage Commission is submitted the whole of the grievances of the underpaid public servants in this Department will be remedied? W ill the Postmaster-General assure me that he will deal with the salaries of all these officials ? Does he think that my question is not worthy of an answer ? ister stated the intentions of the Government. This is a Government matter, and not one for an individual Minister. the Postmaster-General.

What is the Postmaster General's policy in regard to them ? Does he say that he desires to discuss the matter with Cabinet? Is the salary of every individual officer to wait until the Basic Wage Commission has reported to the Prime Minister? Is that to be made an excuse for postponing consideration of the demands of our public servants? It certainly looks like it, and it is our duty to employ the most effective means at our disposal in standing up for these underpaid officers. They have nobody else to stand up for them. During the past fortnight I have received many communications concerning this matter, bolh by letter and by telegram, and to many of these I have been unable to reply by reason of the fact that they have been anonymous communications. reply to all of them, that I am entirely with am sure that the facts which have recited are correct. I hope .that the Postmaster-General will give us an assurance that something will be done to remedy the state of affairs which exists in his Department so far as the payment of salaries is concerned. Will he say that he will do all that he can to secure justice for these men ? He merely tells us that he has to wait for the Prime Minister to move in the matter. But, after all, the Prime Minister is only one man, and there are seventy-five members of this Chamber. If one man is going to tell seventy-four men that they must wait until he is ready to move in this matter I decline to subscribe to that proposition. I shall do what I can to see that each individual Minister shoulders the responsibility which properly belongs to him. Will not the Postmaster-General say that he is sympathetic towards the under-paid public servants in his Department, and that when he goes into Cabinet he will advocate a proper increase in their salaries ?

I should be the first to resist unreasonable demands, or unreasonable methods in putting forward demands, and I know that the public of Australia would not stand for a Government that yielded to what was unreasonable, or to demands put forward in an unreasonable manner. But, on the other hand, the public will not allow the Government to inflict injustice on a section of the community because it happens to consist of public servants.

Why do we they hesitate? This Committee could, within twenty-four hours, make the Government do what it desires to have done. We are asked to wait for a recommendation concerning the basic wage, although we know that these Estimates provide salaries which are inadequate, and that the officers of this Department have no one but us to look to for redress. Are we to pass these Estimates because the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) wishes to wait for something the Prime Minister is going to say about the basic wage? I do not think that we should do that. My hope is that the Postmaster-General will give us, and the public, an assurance, before the Estimates are passed, that he will recommend that something be done. Surely the Prime Minister is not master of the honourable gentleman's mind. Is he silent? Will he not give us an assurance? In that case, I hope that some one with more persuasive faculties than I have will assist me in endeavouring to induce him to make an announcement.

But he has given no valid raason for not saying something about the salaries paid by the Department for which he is responsible, and of which he is the mouthpiece in this Chamber. Should he not say something rbout the grounds of the complaints of these public servants?

Every member of this Parliament has received communications from branches, and from individual members, of the Public Service, during the past week or ten days, pointing out the scandalous sweating conditions. under which they labour. I remind honourable members that the deputation of public servants who waited upon members of this Parliament in Sydney this week took very great care to point out that they were endeavouring to secure a peaceful adjustment of their claims. They did not wish to take drastic action. But let me warn the Government that they cannot continue to rebuff a large body of men and women year after year without sooner or later reaching the breaking point. It may well be that we shall wake up one morning and find that, because of the do-nothing attitude of the Government, the Public Service will be in a condition of chaos, attributable, not to their leaders, but to the rank and file, sponsible duties they are called upon to who will be unable to restrain themselves any longer. Many of them are on the verge of bankruptcy to-day. It is the desperate position in which they are that induced them to take the step they did in sending their communications to members of this Parliament. During the past four years, members of the Labour party have been continually endeavouring to induce the Government to do something for the public servants, and their requests have been refused again and again on the score of lack of funds. A Commission was appointed to look into the question of the basic wage. Two months have elapsed since it ceased to take evidence, but no report from the Commission is yet forthcoming. This Parliament will rise in a few days' time, and it may be that the report of the Commission will not reach us during this sesployment many men get to the top of the sion. If Parliament goes into recess before the report is submitted to it, there because of merit and ""efficiency. Men will be no opportunity to discuss it ; the in the Public Service, who have given to grievances of the public servants will conit years of faithful work, should not be tinue, and they must continue to labour under the scandalous conditions under which they are labouring to-day. No Department is'worse in this respect master-General's Department are of the than is that of the Postmaster-General. gravest concern to Australia, which is a Mr Cunningham. I might refer to dozens of cases of men personally known to me, in my own constituency, who have twenty-five and thirty years' service to their credit, and yet are to-day in receipt of wages less than £200 per annum, on which some of them are endeavouring to support families of six and seven children. It is pitiable to see the methods they have to adopt in order to maintain an outward appearance of respectability. Their condition is one of nothing more nor less than genteel poverty. As members of the Public Service, they are not permitted to take casual work outside, and cannot add to the income they receive from the Commonwealth Government. We are often told that, per head of population, Australia is the wealthiest country in the world; and, if that be so, there should be no difficulty in paying our public servants a reasonable living wage, as well as paying those in the higher grades, and who have nearly a life-time of good service to their credit, a wage commensurate with their years of service and the re* perform. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) dealt with the matter of promotion from the stand-point of the private employer. While he criticised the system at present operating in the Public Service, his method of solving the difficulty to which he referred is that some one, he did not say who, should have the job of saying who should be given the higher positions and be paid the higher salaries. If that system were adopted, and seniority were to count for nothing, in many cases the "" crawler,"" and not the efficient man, would be the person promoted. Tn many cases it would not be merit, but other and less worthy considerations, that would operate to secure promotion. We know that in private emtree because they are "" crawlers,'' and not "" scrapped "" because of some small defect in the present method of promotion in the Service. Questions connected . with the Postland of great distances and sparse population. I have never ceased to voice the opinion that it should be the duty of the Postmaster-General's Department to render service to the community. Unfortunately, some time ago a campaign was initiated by the daily press in Melbourne for the running of the Post and Telegraph Department for profit. four or five years prior to this session of Parliament a system was in force of making ths Department cutting down services which the pioneers in , had enjoyed. That was i pernicious system. sented it , and we are all pleased to have the assurance of the present Postmaster General that it is not his idea that the Department should be run for profit. Having regard to his age, there is no member of the Committee who has lived longer than I have in the back country of Australia, and none who has looked forward with greater expectancy to the arrival of the mail once a week, once a fortnight, or, it might be, once a month. No one realizes better than I do what a boon it is to the. people of the back country to have an efficient and adequate mail service and telephone and telegraph facilities, thus bringing them into closer touch with civilization. lation is one of the great drawbacks and hindrances to country settlement. Whetheri t is a matter of mail facilities, of transport of goods and produce, or of keeping in touch with medical assistance, country folk are at a tremendous disadvantage compared with residents of towns and cities. The latter, too often, I am afraid, do not realize and sympathize with the hardships borne by their . fellow-Australians in the sparsely settled back country. changed policy in the conduct of the Postmaster-General's Department is due to the agitation of the public generally. The system of running the Department for profit was proved by the people themselves to be a wrong one. Now, just as that general agitation altered the views of the Government, I hone that the great public agitation which is occurring today will similarly change the policy of Ministers with regard to the present sweated conditions of Commonwealth servants. I trust that, as an outcome of the protests being aroused on every side, justice will be done to public servants"", very many of whom, under pressure of the tremendous cost of living, are now in a truly awful position. They find that, with the sweated wages which the Government are giving them, they can scarcely keep going. Many have had For resort to money-lenders. When our public servants are so poorly paid that they are open to the wiles of these pay by ghouls and blood-suckers, disaster is bound to follow. The Government are the back country of Australia losing hundreds of their best men from the postal and other services. I know Every one in the back-blocks reofficials who have occupied high and responsible positions for many years. During the past twelve months they have been literally forced to get out, and to seek in the open market opportunities of private employment. Every man who leaves the Service after years of training renders the Service less efficient. And what about the juniors as they come in , and from whom the senior officers of the futur e are to be drawn ? They are no longer attracted to enter public Departments. They see senior officials getting out after fifteen and twenty years' experience, and they cannot f a i l to perceive the reason why. Naturally, they ask themselves why they should enter upon so unattractive a career. The factor of isoOnce our public servants were admittedly better off than private employees. Now the opposite holds good. Our public servants lag far behind, both in regard to conditions and wages. Comparing the two great bodies of employees, namely, those inside and those outside of the Service, the former to-day are in an unenviable position. One cannot wonder at their resigning and throwing themselves upon the open labour market to take the risks of securing a livelihood, The reason for. a and, at the same time, for f e it in g . all rights which may have accrued to them. It is a scandalous shame that, in a country like Australia, there should be Government employees receiving as little as £ 3 8s. per week, when employees doing similar work for private employers are earning £ 4 5s. per week. The Government ' are sheltering themselves behind the Basic Wage Commission. The Postmaster-General, as the head of a great Department, is not prepared to say what he is going to do, or that he will do anything at all. He takes the paltry attitude of following the lead of the Prime Minister. Prom our experience of the right honourable gentleman we can only eay that, such being the case, there are very poor prospects ahead for the employees of the Postmaster-General's Department. The Government are using the Basic Wage Commission as an excuse for continuing to sweat their employees, and I hope the latter will, at any rate, demand from their representatives in this Parliament who support the Government their reasons for not assisting us. view of the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) and of the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham), I feel bound to say something concerning the charges which have been made against the Government and honourable members who support the Government. I regret that our Public Service should have been brought into the limelight for party purposes pure and simple. No honourable member on the Opposition side has said and clone half as much for and about the Public service as I . I have been constantly bringing the cause of the public servants under the notice of the Government and the public ever since I entered this House; and I refuse to quietly allow the party opposite to endeavour to take to themselves exclusively this championship of the public servant. alleged efforts is that the Public Service is still being sweated by the Government whom you are keeping in office. by the Government which preceded them. The Commonwealth Public Service is the worse paid in Australia to-day. It was at one time the best paid service, but for a considerable number of years, practically ever since the public servants went to the Arbitration Court, and were taken away from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner-whic h was a retrograde step-thei r salaries have been decreased. I am prepared to admit that members on all sides of the House are ready to see that the public servant is paid a fair remuneration for his services. I had twenty years' experience in the Service, and was for eight years secretary of one of the unions, so I should know something about it, and the conditions under which the public servants work. The Postal employees have to devote a number of years to training in the specialized lines of occupation which they follow. There are no men in Australia more worthy of 1 better remuneration than they are receiving than the members of that Department. Erom the postmasters right down to the lowest rank they are not receiving the remuneration that their services deserve. Some years ago this Parliament deliberately divested itself of the control of the Public Service, and gave it to the Arbitration Court. I have been fighting for the returned soldiers in connection with the Service, and notwithstanding the promise made on the floor of this House by Mr Andrew Fisher when he was Prime Minister, that no permanent appointments would be made to the Service until all the men had returned from the Front, I have a list of no less than 238 appointments which have since been made, and which were not secured by returned soldiers. We have heard that the Prime Minister went to the Public Service Commissioner, and was flouted. The Public Service Commissioner can snap his fingers in the honourable gentleman's face, saying, "" You cannot dictate to me. I am running the Public Service independent of Parliament."" We' have no control over the Public Service, because it was the wish of Parliament and of the people of Australia that the control of the Service should be taken away from political influences, and put in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. dictator. regret we cannot discuss this question altogether apart from party. Why should it take a party aspect? I concede to the members of the Opposition a desire to see that a fair thing is done to tbe public servants, just as that desire is felt by those on this side of the House, and it is regrettable that we should make a party issue of it. The Prime Minister says he is trying to get the Chairman 'of the Basic Wage Commission to expedite their report, and that he believes it will be presented on Friday. He has also made a definite promise to-day that the House",69,Joseph Cook W E Are

I do not think he could make a fairer proposition. of promises, and has broken them. the promises he has made, but I ' have yet to learn that he has broken any of them. I believe it is in the best interests of the'Public Service, and of men outside the Service, that t.hey shall belong to a trade union. Those are the bodies that have been fighting for a decent living wage, and every member of them has got a living wage both inside and outside the Service. But there are men inside the Service to-day who are not eligible to join trade unions, and they are not getting 'the wage they should bo getting. The man who looks after the Commonwealth Offices in Sydney receives the magnificent salary of £ 3 a week. He gets, also, £32 a year as a living allowance. It is disgraceful that the Commonwealth should pay him only £3 12s. a week when he has a wife and several children to keep, and has to maintain a decent appearance. As far as the basic wage is concerned, I suggest that whoever has the control, whether it is Parliamember now has the opportunity of ment, or the Public Service Commissioner, or a Board of Management, should adopt a basic wage for the whole Commonwealth. this way: Supposing the basic wage in this State was £3 6s. a week, whereas in New South Walesi t was £4 5s. They should take the lowest basic wage paid in any State, and pay the difference between that and the basic wage in the particular State where the man is employed by means of an allowance. The difficulty that confronts the Publio Service ie that, if we paid every Commonwealth -public servant in New South Wales £4 5s. a week, which is the basic wage ol that State, and only paid the Commonwealth public servants in Victoria £3 6s. a week, immediately a man was transferred .across the border he would be senior, because he would be getting a bigger salary. We should do the same thing as was done at the inauguration of Federation, when every Commonwealth public servant in Western Australia had 5 per cent, added to his salary while he worked there, because the cost of living was higher there than in any other State of the Commonwealth. Those men in Western Australia are still. getting an addition of 5 per cent, to' their salaries, notwithstanding the fact that Western Australia is one of the cheapest places to live in. If living in New South Wales cost £4 5s. a week, we should pay the difference between that and the Commonwealth basic wage, should our basio wage bo lower, to bring our employees up to £4 Bs. in that State. I regret that the honourable member for West Sydney has moved the amendment. I was hoping that we could get the Estimates through, and have a day to discuss the basic wage question before the House rose. I am satisfied that honourable members on t£e other side of the House have the interests of the Commonwealth public servants equally at heart with men on this side, but I do not think they have them any more at heart than we have. I think we can work together in the interests of the Service of which we are the head, and see that the servants employed by the Parliament of Australia get a fair and even living wage. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [11.7] -The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr) has told us that for moautis he has been .raising the question of the better payment of the public servants. The honourable doing something more than talking. He has the opportunity to vote, and the prospect of having to vote to It could be easily done in force the Government to do what he has been advocating for months fills him with horror and dismay.

CATTS -What is the use of listening to the honourable member when he talks Without any result? I prefer to do the business of my constituents in the Public Departments to sitting in the chamber listening to idle wind. The honourable member, after telling us that he has talked all these months without obtaining any result, then goes on to show us all the obstacles that are in the way of a new and proper basic wage being paid now. He apologizes for it not being paid, and finds excuses for the fact that the Government are not paying it. He gives reasons why it should not be paid now.",72,Joseph Cook W E Are

Surely the honourable member has not looked into the matter very closely. The public servants were given the privilege of going to the Arbitration Court, but they were not compelled to go there. Nothing can prevent this Parliament from paying the public servants of the Commonwealth any amount it likes. If the Arbitration Court awarded £5 as the minimum wage, there would be nothing to stop this Parliament from paying the public servants a minimum wage of £ 6 . There is only one thing which can prevent Parliament from taking action, and that is the want of the will to act. The honourable member also told us that the Public Service Commissioner flouted the Prime Minister. If that is so, it is so much the worse for a Prime Minister who would permit the Public Service Commissioner or any other officer of the Government to flout him. Then the honourable member confused the matter in the minds of those who will read his speech in Hansard by the confusion of his own mind when he told lis that, whether it is Parliament., the Public Service Commissioner, or the Board of Management who has the power, it ought to be done. Apparently, after all these months of talk, the honourable member has not yet convinced himself where the duty and responsibility rests for paying or withholding a proper remuneration. ' The honourable member for Parkes then goes into a disquisition as to the varying rates of a living wage in the various States. Such a. confusion of ideas it is difficult to follow. I have spoken on this question on several occasions, and do not propose to repeat what I have already said, only within the last-few days. We have done the talking, and the material thing now is t<> get a vote to show what ia the faith in honourable members.
