Minister aware that at a special conference of trade union executive committees in London recently the general council of the Trades Union Congress presented a report and recommendations regarding various ways in which trade unions could contribute to increasing industrial production? Is the right honourable gentleman also aware that the general council of the Trades Union Congress considered that the suggested methods of increasing production, which were the transfer of under-employed workers and the discontinuance of restrictive practices, although unpopular, are nevertheless necessary? recent statement by the Postmaster General to the effect that workers had nothing to gain but everything to lose by increasing production beyond what would be necessary to maintain themselves and their families, will the Prime Minister consider discussing with the Australian Council of Trade Unions a suggestion that that organization should make similar recommendations to Australian trade unions with ft viow to eliminating practices which are retarding the rate of prohonorable member's question, I point out duction in this country? first portion of the honourable member's question was intended give information to me than to olbtain information have received a .report from the Australian London of some of the resolutions passed by the British trade union organization that he smentioned. Questions relating to increasing production and restrictive measures have ibeen dealt with previously in this House, particularly by the Minister for Labour and National Service. The Minister and the Government have always favoured a system of incentives of various kinds subject to proper control. Incentives have been adopted by a great number of the trade unions in Australia,. particularly those associated with the textile industry. However, the history of bonuses and other incentives in Australia has been so bad that many J. S. Rosevear) trade unions are very reluctant to approve of their reintroduction. The system was very badly abused by some employers. Provided such measures are properly policed and carefully adjusted and that employers do not use incentive or task systems for the purpose of unduly exploiting the workers, we strongly favour their use, The Minister for Labour and National Service has given a great deal of thought to this matter, and he supports the view which I have expressed. the Postmaster-General's recent statement? report of that statement. I have heard some talk about it in this House, but I am not prepared to accept off-hand any In view of the statement made here or elsewhere about what the Postmaster-General said. I am now speaking on behalf of the Government on this matter. The Government is anxious to assist the trade unions to increase production, and, wherever it can be seen that bonus or other incentive systems can be properly policed, we shall advise the trade unions to give thought to adopting them, as some unions have already done. In reply to the suggestion made in the final part of the that various sections of the Labour movement, including representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the rather to federal executive of the Australian Labour Party and the Parliamentary from me. I Labour party, will discuss these matters at a meeting in Canberra next Monday. High Commissioner in The subjectwill he discussed to see whether better methods may be adopted by which production output can be increased. In my experience as a workman, those who have set tasks at special rates have _ later abused that method of increasing production. That is the point that the Postmaster-General raised.

It may yet he decided that Wyatt Earp is suitable for the task, but I can assure honourable members that the Government will not be prepared to despatch on this difficult and dangerous task any vessel that is not entirely sea-worthy.

When a trainee becomes fully qualified the employer pays the f u l l wage.

The prospects of farmers receiving adequate supplies are good, but their demands, due to the prosperity they are enjoying under this Government, .are very great.

The point raised by the honourable member for Flinders has also been mentioned by honourable members on this »ide of the House. ""When the honourable member for Barker was Postmaster General some years ago, he found that returned soldiers had been employed as linemen for years without ever being considered for permanent employment. Whenever there is certainty of continuity of employment in a particular branch, and employees possess the necessary qualifications, they are placed on a permanent basis. The important point to be remembered is that a great many temporary employees have not passed the necessary examinations. If the passing of the examinations were made a condition of their employment, many of them would have to he dismissed or placed on other work. The honourable member for Flinders wants more persons appointed to the permanent Public Service, whereas the Leader of the Australian Country party is always advocating the sacking of public servants. example of the inconsistency in the point of view of various sections of the Opposition. The Public Service Board and the departments concerned will consider making permanent appointments when a certificate can be provided that there is reasonable prospect of continuity of work, and when employees have the necessary qualifications. sit for a special examination? they could not pass even the necessary medical examination for permanent appointment.

Representations have been made by some honourable members that the whole of the proceeds of the tax should be allocated to the States and to municipal councils and roads boards for the construction, maintenance and repair of roads. The honourable member for Maranoa now suggests that some portion of the tax should be remitted to offset a rise in the price of petrol. There is great inconsistency in these requests. No consideration has been given to the reduction of the petrol tax. This year the Government increased the allocations of the petrol tax to the States and to local governing bodies hy £1,000,000 and made arrangements for an additional amount to be made available for the construction and maintenance of access roads to Commonwealth properties. At present approxiThis is another mately £7,300,000 is being made available to the States and to local governing bodies for road purposes. The present grants, in addition to the moneys made available by the States from their own revenues, will enable the States to expend approximately £36,000,000 on road construction and maintenance during this and the next financial year. The expenditure of such a large sum of money should make possible a substantial improvement of roads throughout the Commonwealth generally.

ASIA AND THE FAE EAST. Minister say who owns the Lapstone Hotel, in which the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is now holding a conference? Why was it selected for this purpose ? Was approximately £8,000 of government money expended upon alterations to make the accommodation suitable fcr the holding of this conference? If the hotel is privately owned, will this money be refunded to the Government? If the Government is interested in the hotel, will the Prime Minister inform the House of the nature of that interest? ted with the Lapstone Hotel, which is situated within my electorate. It is located in very charming surroundings. It is very healthy there. I do not mean that it is healthy for me politically. I am speaking from the physical standpoint. The Lapstone Hotel wa9 selected as an admirable place in which to hold a conference of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and to house the visitors from overseas. Every government insists, when an international conference is to be held in its territory and delegates from other countries arc invited to attend, that the visitors should be treated with the utmost hospitality and made as comfortable as possible. A conference was held in the Lapstone Hotel previously, and it was found to be eminently suited for that purpose. Owing to the large number of delegates attending this conference, it is difficult to find accommodation for them within ;i reasonable radius of the meeting place. That is one of the reasons why the Lapstone Hotel was selected. One or two other hotels were considered, but it was not possible to obtain the use of them for Lapstone Hotel is owned by a company. I do not know the name of the company, although I have met one or two of the directors on various occasions. Certain alterations were made to the hotel premises, to make them suitable for the holding of a conference. No alterations have been made to the bedrooms, dining room and so on. I am not quite sure how much money has been expended upon the alterations. As Treasurer, I approved of the necessary expenditure so that the greatest possible comfort could be offered to our guests from overseas. I shall ascertain, for the information of the honourable member for Richmond, who owns the hotel. I have already told him that it is in my electorate. I snail endeavour to find out how much money has; been expended upon certain alterations, by whom it has been expended, and what adjustments can be made between the company and the Australian Government. The honourable member desires to know the cost to the Australian Government of any alterations that have been made to the hotel, apart from the charges for its use. I shall obtain that information for him.

50,Mr Basnard (Bass,"Minister forthere is little in it that was not disan historical-sense. However, the result closed in the commission's annual report for the year ended the 30th June last. In conformity with the Australian National Airlines Act the accounts of the commission are presented in a form as directed by the Treasurer, and are tabled in the Parliament after having been audited and reported on by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The act clearly indicates that interest on Treasury advances to the commission is to be paid from profits, and is thereclear now, as I did then, that my critifore not an expense item in the commission's annual accounts. The fact that the commission carries its own insurance is disclosed in the report and is in accordance with normal government policy. Amounts credited to the internal insurance fund are based on commercial premium rates applicable to each type of risk, and are reflected fully in the comCommission, which controls Trans-Ausmission's profit and loss account. The method of charging all outgoings to the year in which they occur does not confer any advantage on the airline in the presentation of its accounts, and it does people, and the Government itself must ensure that developmental costs are written off as they occur. In commercial practice, such costs are sometimes capitalized, or spread over a period of years by the establishment of a special account, Aviation has endeavoured to explain away but the Government does not favour the creation of such an account. The matter of mail payments is referred to in the report of the Australian National Airlines Commission and some months ago I stated in the House the amount of the lump sum payments which is being made thereon. The statement by the Minister acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Barnard) had its origin in a speech which I endeavoured to make on the Audit Bill. When Mr Deputy Speaker refused to allow me to proceed I was obliged to resume my seat. Subsequently, three members of the Opposition, who endeavoured to take points' of order in support of my right to discuss the audited of its operations the Postmaster-General's accounts of Trans-Australia Airlines on that bill, were suspended from the service zation a bounty equivalent to £325,000 of the House. Of course, those incidents occurred before your return from abroad, Mr Speaker, and I refer to them only in was that I had to make my statement later on the motion for the adjournment of the House. At that time, only two or three members were in. the chamber, and although my speech is recorded in Mansard, it was not broadcast and the press did not publish any references to it. The comments which I made included a thorough analysis by a chartered accountant of the audited accounts of Trans-Australia Airlines. I desire to make it cism was directed at the method of finance and not at the efficiency of the organization. Indeed, I have the highest regard for its efficiency, particularly that of the air crews who are typical of the splendid young men operating all the air services in Australia. I pointed out in my speech that the Australian National Airlines tralia Airlines, has had advances from the Government totalling £3,670,000. That large sum has been borrowed from the pay interest on it, but the money has been lent to the Australian National Airlines Commission interest free. The Minister acting for the Minister for Civil that arrangement by stating that interest is paid from the profits made by Trans-Australia Airlines. Apparently if Trans-Australia Airlines does not make profits, the commission does not pay interest on the borrowed money. In the first ten months of its operations, Trans-Australia Airlines lost £511,456. In the following financial year it lost £296,800. The point which I raised was that this alleged company, which is really a government department, was concealing its losses. I have urged before, as I do again, that the provision made for insurance, and other matters, should be carefully examined. I also pointed out that before the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines, the rate for air mails was 6s. 3d. a ton mile. After Trans-Australia Airlines had made an enormous loss in the first ten months Department began to pay to the organia year for transporting mails. The Minister representing the Postmaster General( Mr Calwell) frequently extols",19,Civilaviatio N Australian National Airlines Com
51,Mr White (Balaclava),"by leavethe virtues of the Postmaster-General's Department and speaks with pride of the prosperous condition of its finances. Of course, it is not able to supply all the telephones which are required, but it is able, from its excessive profits, to pay a substantial bounty to Trans-Australia Airlines. If that organization were carrying mails at the old commercial rate of 6s. 3d. a ton mile, it would receive from the Postmaster-General's only £112,000 per annum. Despite the statement by the Minister acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation, 1 am still of opinion that some, of the organization's losses have been concealed. Honourable members would do well to read the detailed report of the criticism which L levelled at the finances of Trans-Australia Airlines. The Prime Minister should examine the matter with a view to saving some of the taxpayers' money by having the service conducted on a more business-like and economic basis. MR, SPEAKER. make a personal statement. In the course of the recent debate on the Estimates I Broadcasting Committee that, during the committee's trip to Tasmania last summer, Mr Speaker was with the committee with his official car. I have just been informed by Mr Speaker that his car was not in Tasmania with him on that occasion. I accept that statement and I take the opportunity to correct my previous statement and to say that I am sorry that I inadvertently misled the House. That leave be given to bring in a bill for an which attend upon service in the Parliaact to make provision for contributory retiring allowances for persons who have served as members of the Parliament. Bill presented, and read a first time. Minister and Treasurer) [11.22] -by leave I move That the bill be now rend a second time. It is proposed in this bill to establish a scheme for the payment of pensions or other allowances to senators and members of the House of Representatives upon their ceasing to be members of either House of the Parliament after the 30th November, 1948. The scheme will be on a contributory and compulsory basis. In its general purpose the scheme aims to meet the situation, long recogDepartment nized by members of all parties, that men or women who serve in parliament often sacrifice opportunities to provide against the day when their parliamentary careers come to an end. It has frequently happened that members who have made great contributions to the work of the Parliament have, upon retirement, faced a condition of hardship. Very many others have had to contemplate the results of interrupted careers, earning power lost and private means reduced, through and in the course of their service in the Parliament. The longer and better the service that has been given, the more often has this been the case. There are various reasons why this has been so. Service in the Parliament has become more exacting as the years stated in a criticism of the have gone by. Unlike the more leisurely conditions of perhaps 50 years ago, parliamentary life now makes heavy and increasing demands upon the time and capacities of all who take part in it. Attendance through parliamentary sessions and the work incidental thereto, the severance of business and professional connexions, and the responsibilities of electorates, all combine to render it almost impossible for members to maintain connection with any other activity, and, as time goes on, make it more and more difficult for them to re-establish themselves when their term in Parliament is over. It has frequently been said that the loss and insecurity ment deter men and women capable of making a worthwhile contribution to thp service of the Commonwealth from offering themselves for election. It is hoped that this measure will help in overcoming difficulties of this nature. The problem of making provision for those people who give long service to the State is not a new one. It has, I believe, received the attention of other governments, but",20,Civilaviatio N Australian National Airlines Com

54,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Prime:no action has previously been taken by the 'Commonwealth, which has, in fact, lagged behind Great Britain and some States in this regard. Limited parliamentary pensions schemes were introduced in the United Kingdom Parliament in 1939 and in Western Australia in 1941. New -South Wales and Victoria adopted their schemes in 1946, and South Australia followed suit in 1948. The underlying principle adopted in most pensions schemes is that there shall be two contributing parties, and this principle has been followed in the present measure. To some extent the bill has been framed, as regards its financial proattained the age of 45. In all other visions, on the lines of the Commonwealth Superannuation Act for public servants. It provides for the payment of contributions by potential beneficiaries and for the payment by the Commonwealth of a proportion of the cost of benefits as they arise. The contributions by members will be substantial, and will amount to £3 a week, while the benefits will he limited to £8 a week, an amount which is. much less than the maximum pension provided under many private and public superannuation schemes. It should also be borne in mind that the people who are to receive the pensions are, for the most part, not drawn from the wealthy classes of the community and have no substantial private means. The Government considered, but rejected, the idea of increasing the pensions benefit according to age and duration of parliamentary service. It is of the opinion that the scheme should provide the full benefit for all those who cease to be members while still carrying family responsibilities and who may be unable readily to find re-employment in their own particular trades or professions. The Government has, therefore, accepted the principle of pooling the risks involved and considers that some part of the cost of providing adequate benefits for those whose parliamentary careers are abruptly and prematurely terminated should be met by their more fortunate associates, who will pay contributions for long periods and for whom the value of any benefits they can hope to receive will be little more, or even less, than their own contributions will provide. At this stage, I summarize the main provisions of the bill. They apply solely to people who are at present members of the Parliament and to those who in future will become members. In return for a compulsory contribution of £3 a week, a member will, upon his enforced retirement from Parliament after more than eight years' service, be"" entitled to a pension of £8 a week, commencing immediately on retirement or on his attainment of the age of 45. If his retirement is voluntary, a pension will not be payable unless the member has served for at least twelve years and has cases of voluntary retirement, a member will receive no more than a refund of his contributions. All service in the Commonwealth Parliament, whether before or after the commencement of the act, will count for pension, and this concession will apply both to present members and to those who, having served in Parliament before the commencement of the act, again re-enter Parliament. Ex-members who have served in Parliament prior to the commencement of the act will not be entitled to any benefits unless they are again elected to either House and again retire. In the case of those members who are compelled to retire with less than eight years' service the bill provides for a refund of contributions together with a supplement of one and one-half times the amount of the member's own contributions. This in effect means that 40 per. cent, of the cost of the early retirement benefit will be provided by the member himself. For existinrr members of the Parliament, this provision has been extended to enable them to draw the government supplement in respect of periods of non-contributory service. The Commonwealth supplement and refund of contributions will be, at the option of the member, payable in lieu of pension. In such cases the amount of the supplement is limited to the amount payable in respect of eight years' contributions. The hill defines the circumstances iiv which retirement from the Parliament should be deemed to be voluntary, and, as a safeguard against abuse, it gives to the trustees a discretion to determine whether in other doubtful cases the retirea scheme of parliamentary pensions ment should be held to he voluntary. An important clause in the bill is that providing a pension of £5 a week to the widow of an ex-member who, before his death, was in receipt of a parliamentary pension, A similar pension will also be paid to the widow of a member who, in future, dies in service. In such a case, the bill does not stipulate a minimum period of qualifying service. In the case of a female member, a pension not exceeding £5 a week will, at the discretion of the trustees, be payable to her surviving husband if, because of mental or physical incapacity, he was totally dependent on her. The benefit payable to the estate of a deceased member, who was unmarried at the time of his death, is limited to a refund of contributions. The bill provides that where a person has received a refund of contributions and subsequently becomes a member, the period of his service as a member may be deemed to include the period in respect of which those contributions were paid, provided he contracts to repay to the fund within a period of three years the amount of the contributions and government supplement previously paid to him. Where a person in receipt of a parliamentary pension again becomes a member he will be required to contribute to the fund and his pension will be suspended until he again ceases to be a member. The bill provides for the establishment of a body to be called the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust, constituted by five trustees, namely, the Treasurer, who will be chairman, two senators and two members of the House of Representatives. trustees, other than the Treasurer, will be appointed by the House of which they are members. It is proposed that two government members shall beappointed, one from each House of the Parliament, and, subject to the consent of the Opposition parties, two Opposition members, one from each House of the Parliament. This proposal is, of course, subject to the Opposition parties agreeing to appoint two representatives, and to the Parliament approving of this measure. The Government has given careful contowards meeting the anticipated initial sideration to the financial basis on which deficiency. Some further offset to this Mr Ohifley. should be based. With that end in view, and with the approval of the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, it recently obtained the advice of His Honour Mr Justice Kirby, who expressed himself as in agreement with the approach to the problem made by the two actuaries. Mr W. C. Balmford, F.I.A., the Commonwealth Actuary, and Mr L. C. Oxby, EJ.A., of the Australian Mutual Provident Society. The actuaries have reported that, assuming all members contributed to the fund at the rate of £3 a week throughout the whole of their parliamentary lifetime, it would be necessary for the Government to provide 56 per cent, of the cost of the benefits outlined in the bill. They point out, however, that an initial deficiency would arise in the fund unless the benefits of members with non-contributory past service were suitably reduced. Their estimate of the proportion of the cost of benefits to be borne by the Commonwealth is based on the average experience of parliamentary membership during recent years, and represents the best method of estimating the Commonwealth liability. It is impossible for any one to estimate the rate at which pensions will emerge in individual years with any degree of accuracy. In the first place, the actual calculations are affected by the fact that many of the existing members, although their past service qualifies them for immediate benefit, have not yet paid any contributions. In their case, therefore, the percentage payment by the Commonwealth would he greater than 56 per The cent. On the other hand, following the enlargement of the Parliament and the alteration in the mode of election of the Senate, the retirements in the early years of the scheme may not be so heavy as would normally be expected. This may result in a temporary saving. The bill provides that the Government shall provide 60 per cent, of the cost of the benefits, which is somewhat greater than the amount considered necessary by the actuaries, if the scheme commenced without any liabilities in respect of past service. This margin will be available deficiency will arise if , as a result of the that it would lead to deception and conrecent amendments to the Representation Act and the Electoral Act, the retirement rate in future should prove to be lower than has been the case in the past. In all the circumstances, therefore, the Government has decided to defer any definitive estimate of this initial deficiency until the completion of the first actuarial investigation, to be made after the scheme has been in operation for seven years. The actuarial report by Mr Balmford and Mr Oxby, both of whom are Fellows of the Institute of Actuaries, will be made available to honourable members this afternoon. I commend the measure to the House as a sincere effort on the part of the Government to remove some of the disabilities attaching to parliamentary service. adjourned. BILL 1948. Bill read a third time. Minister for Labour and National Service) [11.87] I move That the hill he now read a, second time. This bill has two principal objects, first, to provide a system for the registration of users of trade marks, and secondly, to permit, in certain cases, the assignment of trade marks, without assignment of the goodwill of the business concerned. The provisions of the bill relating to registered users are entirely new so far as Australia is concerned. Similar provisions became law in England in 1937, having been recommended by a departmental committee which heard lengthy evidence on the law and practice of trade marks. It was generally agreed that the trend of modern commercial development required some relaxation of the then existing restrictions on the use and registration of a trade mark by a person other than the proprietor. Several suggestions were considered by the committee, including one of unrestricted licensing, but that proposal was rejected on the ground fusion to the purchasing public. It was considered to be essential that any use of a trade mark by a person other thaD the registered proprietor should be subject to control in the public interest. At the present time a licence by the proprietor of an Australian trade mark to another person to use the trade mark on goods other than those of the proprietor, is a form of deception which invalidates registration of the mark. This rule is inflexible and applies even if the proprietor of the new mark owns and controls the other party to whom the licence is given. Secondly, a parent company which is the owner of a registered trade mark can not license a subsidiary com pany to use the mark. This position is out of harmony with modern commercial development, and has been so recognized 1 not only in Great Britain but also in other British and foreign countries. An amendment to bring the law of Australia info line with that of Great Britain and other countries, is desirable in the interest of Australian commerce. Many Australian companies have subsidiary companies operating in different States of the Commonwealth and if any one of those separate legal entities uses the registered trade mark of the parent company the registration of the trade mark is invalidated. Further, many overseas manufacturers desire to make arrangements with. Australian companies for the local manufacture of goods formerly manufactured overseas and sold under well-known trade marks. The new previsions proposed in this bill will overcome the difficulties which I have mentioned, and will help in the industrial development of Australia and the establishment of new industries. The bill proposes that the Registrar of Trade Marks shall, before registering a person as the user of a registered trade mark, require to be satisfied as to the relationship between the proprietor and the proposed registered user, and particulars must be furnished shewing the degree of control by the proprietor over Unpermitted use, and the conditions generally which will govern the use by the user. Upon consideration of all the information before him, the Registrar will have the function to decide whether it is in the public interest that the",21,Second Reading
55,Debate (On Motion By Mr Harrison),,24,Trade Marks Bill 1948 Second Reading
56,Mr Hoixoway (Melbourne Ports,"applicant should be registered as the user of the trade mark. The bill makes clear that an application which would be likely to facilitate trafficking in trade marks will be refused). The control by the Registrar will not cease even with registration of a registered user, as the 1 Registrar is empowered to cancel registration on the ground that the registered user has used the trade mark in such a way as, amongst other things, to cause, or to be likely to cause, deception or confusion, or on the grounds that the proprietor or registered user made some misrenresentation or failed to disclose some fact material to the application for registration. All decisions of the Registrar are made subject to appeal to the High Court. The bill also makes it clear that a registered user has no power to assign or transmit the right to the use of the trade mark. At present, a trade mark cannot be assigned except with the goodwill of the business in connection with which it is used. This rule has given rise to one of the most pressing problems of trade marks law under present conditions of commerce and industry. Justification for the rule has been found in the view that if a. mark could be assigned without goodwill there was some danger of deception to the public. Thus, a mark used upon A's goods represents that the goods come from A's factory. If A were to assign the mark to B, Avhile retaining his business and factory, then B would be using a mark which entirely denoted A's manufacture. If however, B was the purchaser, not of the mark alone, but of A's whole business and factory, with its goodwill, there would be no question of deception. Moreover, the courts have taken a narrow view as to what constitutes goodwill, and have insisted that where a vendor of the trade mark retains his factory, he necessarily retains his goodwill. This rule, however salutary it may have been in former conditions of trade, has been the cause of hardship hi modern commercial conditions. Some illustrations will demonstrate the truth of what I ha.ve said(a) A devises a mark for use upon certain goods. He proposes to commence business under his mark, but ifr. Holloway. desires to incorporate a company for that purpose. He registers his mark and forms the company. He then transfers the mark to the company which commences business under it. The assignment from A to the company is not valid, and the mark is destroyed. A had no goodwill in any business which he transferred to the company with the mark. (b) A British company sends its products, bearing its trade mark, to Australia, and the mark becomes well known here. It decides to form a company to manufacture its product in Australia. The company so formed establishes a. factory here and the mark is assigned to it. But, as the goodwill was associated with the British factory, the assignment was without goodwill and void, and the mark is also liable to be removed from the register. (c) An Australian company, with a factory in Sydney, distributes its product throughout the Commonwealth. It forms a subsidiary company in each State to manufacture there, and assigns the mark for each State to the subsidiary company thus formed. Apart from the inherent desirability of modifying the existing rule as to assignment of trade marks the enactment of the other provisions of the bill relating to registered users themselves requires a corresponding amendment to allow a trade mark to be assigned without the assignment of the goodwill of the business concerned. The bill proposes to retain the general prohibition against assignments without goodwill, but to limit the circumstances in which the validity of an assignment can be attacked and the period within which it is liable to attack. An assignment without goodwill will be invalid except in any one of three cases. The first is where the trade mark was not in actual and bona fide use in Australia by the assignor or his predecessor in title at any time prior to the assignment, but this rule does not apply where a trade mark has been registered with the intention that it should be assigned to a newcompany yet to be formed or that some person should be permitted to .use it as a registered user. The second case in which the assignment would be invalid is where the assignee has used the trade mark in association with statements or otherwise in such a way as to lead to the belief that the goods upon which the mark is used by the assignee are manufactured or dealt in by the assignor. The third case in which the assignment would be invalid is where the trade mark continues to be used by the assignor in relation to other goods and the public is likely to be deceived by the use of the trade mark by the assignor and assignee upon their respective goods. There is no doubt in the minds of the Government that the passage of the bill will be welcomed by the commercial community and that adequate safeguards shall be provided against confusion in trade and deception of the public. The bill contains a minor provision to enable more than one Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks to be appointed. The existing law allows the appointment of several Deputy Commissioners of Patents and Deputy Registrars of Designs, but provision is made for only one Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks. The bill also contains several amendments to which it is not necessary for me to refer specifically at this stage and which are consequential upon the adoption of the provisions relating to registered users and permitted assigns. adjourned.

By no stretch of the imagination could it be said that it was ever intended that a person who failed to complete the taking out of papers after making the first declaration should have to repeat the process if he did not complete the application after the -expiry of die additional period of not less than two years and not more than seven years. Dame ENID LYONS -The present practice stands? As the Minister for Immigration ( Mr is no justification to say, "" We want to Calwell) has said, this provision is new. First, it provides that a person shall not be granted a certificate of naturalization unless within .a year or more of his arrival in Australia he makes a declaration of intention to apply for naturalization. Secondly, the clause provides.that the applicant may make application for naturalization not earlier than two years and not later than seven years after the making of the declaration of intention. Sub-clause 3 provides that the Minister may exempt certain persons from the requirements of sub-clause 1, which relate to the declaration of intention to apply for naturalization. They are persons of two classes that are covered by other clauses. I agree with the Minister that this is a new principle. I am not at all enamoured of it. These are my reasons. It is not contained in the Nationality Act 1920, under which we Are working at present; nor was it in the British act of 1914, from which we copied our act of 1920; nor is it in the new British Nationality Act. It is said that the provision was copied from the legislation of the United States of America and of Canada. According to the notations attached to the bill, justification for the clause is that it is desired to deter what are known as opportunists, people who for motives of self-interest or without a proper appreciation of the privileges of Australian citizenship desire to become Australian citizens. It is also said that the making of a declaration of intention to apply for naturalization facilitates the instruction of the prospecThis clause relates tive applicants for Australian citizenship. It outlines The third justification is that proper inquiries may be made of such persons. There are adequate answers to those propositions. The first is a realistic answer. T do not imagine that may people apply for citizenship on any high-souled, idealistic ground. If it is to he a point of criticism against persons that they apply for naturalization out of self interest, that criticism is nonsense. Most persons do it out of self-interest. They do not overflow with patriotic fervour, wave the flag and strike up the national tune when they apply. They apply for all sorts of reasons and perhaps no definite, reason. A whole set of reactions, emotional and otherwise, affects them. It deter opportunists"". There are plenty of deterrents against people obtaining citizenship in the law as it is. I reject as the least valid argument in favour of the clause that it is designed to deter people who may seek Australian citizenship to suit their personal interests and without due appreciation of the privileges of Australian citizenship. The next mat"" ter is that it is said that the declaration of intention to apply for Australian citizenship gives the Government the opportunity to give people instruction. I take it that that means that after the Government has been notified by people of their intention to apply for naturalization, it will be able to call them in for instruction or send them literature or do other things by which they may be educated to become Australian citizens. I do not know what that means. Doesi t mean that they are to have certain doctrines, principles or statement? forced",26,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948
60,Mr Calwell,Yes.,27,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948
61,Mr Beale (Parramatta) [11.52'J,"upon, them willy-nilly? Doesi t mean that they are to go into camp to be instructed, or does it really mean only that they are to have literature sent to them from time to time? to that matter in the clause, which relates to first papers. the honourable member's poin.t that the clause makes no reference to it. it in clause 41. with is the explanation given in the memorandum accompanying the hill. Dealing with clause 14, the memorandum sets out three grounds of justification for the introduction of the principle of first papers. The principle is of no value. There are other channels by which the Government may instruct people in the principles of citizenship. We must not mesmerize ourselves with the words like "" principles of citizenship "". The real way in which the newcomer receives instruction is in earning his daily bread amongst Australian citizens and in participating in our ordinary institutions. If it is thought that additional instruction should be delivered to any particular newcomer, facilities exist for delivering it in other clauses without the need for this clause. It is said, further, that this provision is designed to make it easier for the department to make inquiries. An alien migrant to this country must register as an alien upon his arrival, and then must live here for five years before he can become an Australian citizen. It is probable that inquiries are made about him before his arrival. Surely the necessary inquiries can be made in that long period of time. It seems to me that a provision requiring an alien to give notice that at some time in the future he will apply for Australian citizenship will not aid the department in any material way. I presume that a prudent department would keep its eye upon alien members of the community and make inquiries about them. of value to the alien. be of value to an alien to declare that he its experience, it has developed a [125] will apply for Australian citizenship at some time in the future.

I do not think that this provision will be of any material value. If it does have any value, it will certainly not be sufficiently great to offset the extra barrier to Australian citizenship that will thereby be erected. It has been said that the Americans use this system. That is so. The Americans, however, with a population of approximately 130,000,000, can afford, and may find it necessary to be, "" choosy"" or very selective. The British, on the other hand, have never found it necessary to adopt this procedure.

76,Mr Beale,"It has had more exmuch simpler system of naturalization than is proposed in this measure. It is important that, by means of this measure and kindred legislation, we should establish a liberal tradition in the matter of the entry of alien people into this country. If Great Britain and Australia have not found it necessary to impose such a condition as this in the past. I am dubious of the value of imposing it now in Australia. not agree with the contentions of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr that they were seeking naturalization a? Bcale) regarding this clause. He claimed that it is not a good one because similar provisions were not included in the 1920 legisliiticn rind in subsequent legislation. The honourable gentleman said that, in his opii.iL :, wo should adopt a more liber; . , rllitude to the entry of foreigners 1 to this country. He referred to the practice in Britain, but there have been no mass movements of migrants to that country. This clause is important because it relates to the assimilation of migrants into our population. Masses of people are either coming to Australia or have signified their intention to do so. Many of them are of alien origin, and have recently suffered the horrors of war. We must do more than consider them as a contribution to our man-power resources. If I may digress for a moment, the Minister has had a mo3t successful career as Minister for Immigration, and yesterday he was given full marks for his work by a very reputable press correspondent. He has insisted throughout upon better planning. The procedure of making a declaration of intention to apply for naturalization has been followed by the Americans, who have had experience of masses of aliens coming to their country who do not speak their language and are not conversant with their ideals. If , as the honourable member for Parramatta has said, there is no sentiment about naturalization, we could delete this clause, allow migrants topour into Australia and lose sight of them for five years. It is to the Minister's credit that he proposes to make naturalization a matter of sentiment, although not of sentimentality. Advantages will accrue to alien migrants by reason of their residence in this country. Quite apart from the hard fact of becoming Australian citizens the spiritual affinity that they .will then have with the country that has given them shelter will be a measure of repayment. In the past, aliens who came to this country waited for five years before they could be naturalized and then, by means of the coldest possible procedure, became Australian citizens. No wonder they did not think much of it. They visited a solicitor, inserted a noticein the newspaper declaring to the world Australian citizens and then, after an inevitable delay in the Department of Immigration, although the delay' has been much shortened in the regenerated department, their naturalization papers arrived by post in the same way a9 a duck shooting licence or a dog licence reached them. The procedure was cold and unreal. The importance of this provision is that it. will make migrants who arrived with a flood of other foreigners feel, during their early days in this country, that there is some plan with which they are concerned. We do not want migrants to work as directed for two years and then to flock to the cities to follow the avocations that they followed in the cities of the countries from which they came. They are important to our scheme of enlarging our man-power resources. We have something to give to them in return, that is, the benefits of Australian nationality. This provision is part of a scheme designed to make migrants regard Australian nationality seriously. Australian nationality is not something that should be obtained by correspondence, but something that they should be proud to acquire. Therefore, it is felt that they should make some effort to acquire it. The many people from Northern, Southern and Central Europe, who are coming to this country have ideals, traditions and cultures of their own. They can give us a great deal, and we can give to them, with dignity, the Australian citizenship for which they ask. This matter of first papers is very important in that connection.

This amendment is of a drafting nature, and is designed to remove any possible doubt as to the period of residence required as a qualification for naturalization. Ever since the Nationality Act of 1920 was passed, it has been the rule that an alien should have had a total of five years' residence in British territory before becoming eligible to apply for naturalization, and that requirement has been embodied in the bill. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) anticipated me by referring to what appeared to be a shortcoming in the bill. The amendment will maintain the original principle in conformity with the existing act. Its purpose is merely to make it clear that the period of four years mentioned in paragraph c is in addition to the twelve months' period mentioned in paragraph b. It is provided that an applicant for naturalization shall be required to satisfy the Minister that he has an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. How is it proposed to apply that provision? Is it intended that the applicant shall be required to sit for an examination? Is he to be called upon to submit to some kind of oral or written test?

We intend to continue the practice of requiring an applicant to demonstrate that he has language. In addition, we might well imitate the Americans, and require the applicant for citizenship to know something about Australia, something of the responsibilities of citizenship, and of the duties that allegiance to the King imposes, in addition to knowing something about the benefits and privileges he will enjoy once he becomes a naturalized British subject.

It would be a good thing if people applying for naturalization in Australia were to know something more about Australia, and the duties and responsibilities of citizenship than do most applicants now. Unfortunately, all that we now require of the applicant is that he should know English, be of good character, and swear loyalty to the King, and then the Minister will give him a parchment certificate with a red seal on it. The Minister affixes his signature to the certificate, and then the applicant receives his Australian citizenship as he would receive a petrol licence or a dog licence. It is proposed that in future citizenship shall be conferred at a fitting ceremony, and with due dignity. In this, we propose to follow the American practice. United States of America? bers are interested, I shall get from the American Embassy literature which explains the whole procedure. I know that certain literature is sent out by the Department of Justice in the United States of America to help applicants for naturalization to learn about American institutions and history, and to enable them to pass an oral test on such matters as the way Congress is elected, how the Supreme Courts fit into the scheme of government, and the powers and responsibilities of the Federal Legislature and of the State Legislatures. In other words, they are given elementary instructions in civics, a subject in which we in Australia are belatedly instructing our children.

Leader of the Opposition) [12.27] I like the idea of holding a ceremony at which Australian citizenship shall be conferred upon those persons who are adjudged eligible for naturalizr. tion, but the effect of such a ceremony will depend almost entirely upon the person who conducts it. I remember seeing a documentary film which showed such a ceremony in the United States of America. The film depicted a room full of people, and the person who conducted the ceremony read out the oath, which each person took, merely interpolating his ovra name at the appropriate place, and mumbling through the words of the oath, which may or may not have been administered properly. The effect was to destroy the dignity of the proceeding. If we put people through the ceremony as one would run sheep through a race, the effect of the ceremony would be destroyed. Unless the individual who administers the oath realizes just what he is aiming at and has some appreciation of the psychological 1 reactions he hopes to arouse in the applicant, the present procedure might be infinitely preferable. At present, the oatb is administered in private and there is no reason why in such circumstances the applicant cannot be mnde to appreciate its full significance.

In answer to the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson), I point out that under the present procedure the certificate of naturalization is completed when the Minister signs it. In future, completion must await the ceremony in court. The signature of the Minister is affixed to the certificate on the assumption that the applicant will appear in court and make the necessary declaration in the presence of a judge, or magistrate. A certificate of naturalization cannot be issued until the applicant takes the Oath of Allegiance in court and the judge, or magistrate, signifies that the requirements have been completed. I explained the significance of the amendment when dealing with clause 15. -I s it intended that the certificate bearing the Minister's signature shall be forwarded to the applicant as has hitherto been the practice, or will it be delivered to the applicant by the judge or the applicant by the magistrate.

114,"Mr Mcewen""","As Minister' infor Information and Minister for Immigration) [12.38] I am aware that the honourable member for Indi. ( Mr ""included"", the following words be added:-McEwen), when he was Minister for the Interior, signed certificates of naturalization. However, not many years before he was Minister for the Interior that duty devolved upon the Governor General. The honourable member himself may have introduced the amending legislation which absolved the Governor General from that arduous responsibility. my predecessor. three years I have signed up to 14,000 certificates of naturalization. The grant of naturalization has been so important that it has been felt in the past that a Minister of State, not necessarily the Minister of State for the Interior and later the Minister of State for Immigration, but some member of the Government, should sign the certificates of naturalization if the Minister administerwho went to Great Britain or one of. the ing our immigration laws were unable to sign them. We propose to continue that procedure for the time being in addition to having a judge, or magistrate, affix his signature to the certificates. responsibility upon the Vice-President of the Executive Council? the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) to sign some of the documents, because the responsibility is heavy. However, in the immediate future, and possibly for the next year or two, we are not likely to issue certificates of naturalization in anything like the numbers we have been issuing them up to date. During the period of the war very few people came to Australia, which will mean that for about five years after the end of the war the work should be lighter than in later years. I shal 1 take note of the honourable gentleman's remarks and later I may introduce an amending bill that will enable an official to affix his signature to the certificates of nationality rather than for the responsibility to rest with a Minisobtain employment. ter of State.

Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 17 (Loss of citizenship on acquisition of another nationality). This clause appears to illustrate yet again the disabilities under which Australia may suffer as a result of the provisions of the bill. I know that the Minister will say that the clause is intended to avoid the old difficulty of multiple nationality, but it really refers, not to multiple nationality, but to dual citizenship. As I understand the position, we shall still retain a single British nationality throughout the Empire, but each dominion will have separate citizenship. Under this clause an Australian citizen dominions, obtained permanent employment there and found it desirable or expedient, either because of that country's laws or for other reasons, to acquire British or other dominion citizenship, would automatically forfeit his Australian citizenship. The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) has nodded, and is obviously in agreement with my statement. I say that that position is a weakness and a disability. I know something of the law of double nationality and I do not want to see my countrymen who may go to Great Britain and obtain employment, as many Australians do, lose their Australian citizenship. I do not see why they should have to lose it if they acquire United Kingdom citizenship as a matter of expediency. I consider that the Minister should reexamine this feature of the measure hecause I see no disadvantages to Australia that would follow from double citizenship, a3 long as both the citizenships were of British Empire origin, and I see a good many disadvantages which may affect Australians who go abroad and Sitting suspended from 12.J/.5 to 2.15 p.m.",34,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948

120,Amendment (By Mr Calwell),,35,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948
121,Mr Beale (Parramatta) [12.42],"for Information and Minister for Immigration) [2.15] -The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) has stated that the possession of dual citizenship will not matter provided a person holds the dual citizenship within the British Commonwealth of Nations. That statement is true enough; but the danger is that if that person moves into a foreign country, he may cause complications for the two dominions in which he holds citizenship. We consider that it is not desirable that a person should hold more than one citizenship. Who is to protect him if he gets into trouble in a foreign country? Will it be the country whose citizenship he has last adopted, or the country whose citizenship he first adopted? As the honourable member for Parramatta will concede, the difficulties of dual nationality are great. But we consider that the difficulties associated with holding dual citizenship are equally great. Therefore, we provide for the renunciation as well as for the acceptance of Australian citizenship. Our view may be wrong, but we believe that when an Australian acquires the citizenship of another dominion, he ° should lose his Australian citizenship. Clause agreed to. Clause IS (Renunciation of citizenship). Leader of the Opposition) [2.16] I should like the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) to explain this clause. Sub-clause 2 readsA person who became an Australian citizen by reason of the inclusion of his name in a -certificate of registration or a certificate of the advantage of Australia that such naturalization granted to his responsible parent or his guardian may, at any time after attaining the age of twenty-one years, make a declaration -renouncing his Australian citizenship. with the existing law -for Information and Minister for Immition to sub-clause 5, which statesWhere, during a war in which Australia is -engaged, a declaration is made under this section by a person who is a national or citizen -of a foreign country, the Minister may refuse 4o register the declaration. [126] with existing policy. ties. In war-time, a conscientious objector may decide to renounce his Australian citizenship, and, by so doing, avoid the obligations that he may have incurred by harving been an Australian citizen before the declaration of war. Suppose a United Kingdom and colonies citizen comes here and registers as an Australian citizen. He incurs the full obligations of Australian citizenship. In war-time, because he wishes to avoid the responsibility associated with that citizenship, he may renounce it. the Acting Leader of the Opposition is referring relates to a person who is a citizen of a foreign country. It does not relate to citizenship of another part of the British Commonwealth. The citizens of all the countries constituting the British Commonwealth have the common status of British nationals. remain the citizen of a foreign country if he -becomes an Australian citizen. I am at a loss to understand the reason for the insertion of sub-clause 5. I realize that the Minister has a discretionary power to refuse to register a declaration renouncing citizenship, but I urge him to re-examine this matter. A person should not be permitted to avoid honoring his obligations as an Australian citizen, particularly in war-time. Under other clauses, the Minister has power to cancel a person's Australian citizenship, and that provision is most important, because in certain circumstances, it may be to action be taken. However, I have directed attention to an apparent anomaly, and I should like the Minister to clarify the position. gration) [2.21] -In war-time, there are enemy aliens, neutral aliens and friendly aliens.

130,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Ministe rbe hampered in bestowing those privileges. There is no provision for renunciation of citizenship by any person, either a dual citizen or a dual national, in war time. Many people will acquire Australian citizenship and a foreign nationality at birth. That is one of the unfortunate features of dual nationality. A child born in Australia, and having an alien father, will be regarded by the Australian Government as an Australian citizen, but he may also be claimed as a national of the country of his father's origin. We had considerable experience of such conditions during World War II . Persons who were born in Australia of German parents, went to Germany, were claimed by the German authorities as German nationals, and were compelled to serve in the German armed forces. The provision that we are now considering is in accordance with the existing law. We are applying to citizenship the same principles as those which are applied to a change of nationality. I do not consider that this clause will detrimentally affect a person of good will. If another war takes place, the government of the day will be able to use the same discretionary powers as successive Australian governments used in World War LI. Some young men, the sons of Italian parents, were born in Italy and were brought to Australia as youngsters. Their fathers never became nationalized. During the war, the boys were called up to serve in the Australian armed forces. One of those young men informed me, "" I shall serve Australia to the best of my ability in the war, but, after the cessacountry at war with Australia. I should tion of hostilities, I desire to become an prefer to have a provision whereby such Italian national, because I want to live in Italy"" . how a citizen of Australia can also be a citizen of a foreign country. under dual nationality. cognized by another country? cognized but also claimed by another country if he is within its territory. We do not recognize dual nationality. We contend that such a person is an Australian national, but the other country also regards him as its national. We have never been able to reach an agreement with other countries on the complicated matter of dual nationality. Clause agreed to. Clause 19 (Loss of citizenship by reason of service in armed forces of an enemy country). This clause causes me a little anxiety. It relates to a class of case which, fortunately, is not common, but which does occur. This provision may operate unfairly in respect of persons in that category. The Minister may correct me if 3 am misinformed, but I understand that this is a new provision which does not occur in other legislation. It is an attempt to deprive Australian citizens of Australian citizenship if they serve in the forces of a country with which Australia is at war. The Minister has touched upon, the fringe of the subject already. Let us assume that an Australian citizen goes to Italy, that Australia becomes engaged in a war with Italy, and that by reason of his parentage, the citizen is claimed as an Italian national under the Ilalian law and is called up for service in the forces of the Italian Government. Under this new provision, a man in those , circumstances would be automatically deprived of Australian citizenship. that an Australian citizen shall cease to be an Australian citizen upon commencing to serve in the armed forces of a a person could be deprived of Australian citizenship in the proper circumstances. Deprivation of Australian citizenship should not be automatic. The situation could be dealt with by means of a provision in clause 21 under the heading "" Deprivation of Citizenship "". I suggest that this clause goes too far in that class of case. There may be plenty of instances of Australian citizens being caught up in the forces of another country in time of war. Such cases have occurred in the past, and I suppose that the Minister knows of examples. It would be harsh to deprive a man of his Australian citizenship out of hand by the automatic",36,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948

137,Mr Beale,"Yes. The clause statesoperation of this legislation on account of something which he could not help. If a man should serve in the forces of an enemy in circumstances which make him unworthy to be an Australian citizen, he should be deprived of his local citizenship. But that could he achieved under clause 21. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [2.27] -The Government considers that if a man born in Australia goes to a country where he may be claimed as a national, remains there until the outbreak of war with Australia, and then serves in the armed forces of that country without insisting upon his claim to be regarded as a British subject and, in consequence of such insistence, going into internment rather than serving with the armed forces of the enemy of his country, he should not be entitled, when the war ends, to assert his claim to Australian citizenship. If we gave effect to the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), we should allow such a person to have the best advantage of both sides. He could be both an enemy and a citizen of . Australia at the same time. We consider that Australian citizens who are not subject to dual nationality should, in the event of war, take all the consequences of the possession of British nationality if they happen to be in the territory of the enemy. We have the cases of some young Australians who were born in South Australia of German parentage to guide us. We do not consider that such persons, having served in enemy forces, should have the right to say, immediately after the war, "" We are Australian citizens. We are in a bad situation. It is the obliI assume that the Minister will have gation of the Australian Government to bring us back to Australia "". TJp to date, I have refused to give assistance of any sort to people who served in the German armed forces and have since claimed that, under dual nationality, they were both German nationals and British nationals. I have treated them fairly, I hope, but I have not given them the same advantage as I have given to other Australians who were stranded in Germany hut who went into internment during the war and afterwards asked for the assistance of the Australian Government to return home. Clause agreed to. Clause 20 agreed to. Clause 21 (Deprivation of citizenship). Leader of the Opposition) -This clause states(1.) Where the Minister is satisfied that an Australian citizen who is such by registration or is a naturalized person(a) has shown himself by act or speech to be disloyal or disaffected towards His Majesty; (6) has, during any war in which Australia is or has been engaged, unlawfully traded or communicated with the enemy or been engaged on or associated with any business which was to liis knowledge carried on in such a manner as to assist an enemy in that war; the Minister may, by order, deprive that citizen of his Australian citizenship, and thereupon the person in respect of whom the order is made shall cease to be an Australian citizen. This applies to a person who is an Australian citizen by registration or naturalization. Therefore, I assume that, if a naturalized person did what was recently done in Queensland by a well-known Communist, the Minister for Immigration would have power to deprive him immediately of Australian citizenship. Unless paragraph a can be made to apply retrospectively, the clause will have no application to anything that has happened in the past, but will apply only to what may happen in the future. Paragraph b is perfectly clear. Obviously it will have retrospective effect. I know, that many persons were engaged in activities during World WarI . and World War II . which would be covered by paragraph b. discretionary power to take action retrospectively under the clause if he so desires. In fact, it may be mandatory for him to do so. I hope that the Minister will clarify the situation, because the points which I have raised are of special importance. I believe that a person who can find no good in the country of his adoption should no longer adopt that country and should not be adopted by it. It is fitting and proper that such a person should be divested of his citizenship rights. If he cannot live happily and harmoniously in the",37,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948

139,Mr Harrison (Wentworth,"Actingcountry, obeying its laws, he has no place in the country and has no right to take advantage of citizenship of it. The same thing applies, perhaps not to the same degree, to persons who have traded with an enemy. Obviously, any man who trades with an enemy connives at the destruction of his own country and therefore should be divested of his citizenship rights. I hope that the Minister will clarify the intention of this clause and state what powers he will have to deal retrospectively with persons of the kinds specified in the paragraphs which I have quoted. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [2.34] -This clause deals with an Australian citizen who is Australian by registration or by naturalization. It does not affect an Australian who is an Australian by birth. The contention of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr citizen as is any other person in theHarrison) is correct. If a person has acted detrimentally to Australia in time of war, even during the war that recently ended, he will be subject to any disciplinary power that the Minister may exercise under this law. future or in the past. Any person who is an Australian by registration or by naturalization and who ""has shown himself by act or speech to be disloyal or disaffected towards His Majesty"" will be affected. That refers not only to persons who may show themselves to be disloyal or disaffected in the future, but also to those who have shown themselves in recent times, or even in remote times in the past, to be disloyal or disaffected. Any such person would be liable to deprivation of Australian citizenship. I think that that is perfectly clear. The honourable member's interpretation of the clause is correct. However, deprivation of citizenship does not involve any derogation of a man's status as a British national or a British subject, and there is no power in this bill, or in any other legislation, according to the judgment of the High Court in the Walsh-Johansen case, whereby an Australian Government can deport such persons from Australia if they are British subjects. Under another b ill r aliens who have shown disaffection or behaved in a manner which,, whilst not showing disaffection towards the King, shows that they arepersons who should no longer be allowed to remain members of the Australian community, that is, that they are guilty of conduct prejudicial to thegood order and government of the people, will be dealt with. I think that the meaning of the clause is clear, and I ask the committee to accept it. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [2.37] Paragraph a of sub-clause 1 reads(o) has shown himself by act or speech to be disloyal or disaffected towards His Majesty; There is no reference to period in that sub-clause. I point out that a naturalized or registered person may havelived in this country for upwards of 40 years, and may be as much an Australian community. Does the Government intend that this sub-clause shall operate against such a person? Although the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), when replying to an aspect of this matterthat was raised by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) a moment * ago, used the phrase "" in recent times""' I point out that that phrase does not appear in this clause. times "". Mrs. BLACKBURN -I s it intended that the sub-clause shall operate against a reputable citizen who has lived for a long time in this country? yes. A person who becomes an Australian citizen by registration or naturalization will be liable to lose his Australian citizenship if at any time in the future he shows by disaffection that he is not fit to be an Australian citizen, even though he may have lived in this country for 40 years. Leader of the Opposition) [2.39] -It is not so punitive as it may sound. The Minister has made it perfectly clear that the provision is that such a person shall be deprived of Australian citizenship.

I take the same illustration a step further. Early in the war I was a member of one of those tribunals for several months in the course of which hundreds of aliens appeared before the tribunal making application for release from internment. They had been interned under regulation 29, I think it was, and they were seeking release. As the honourable member for Warringah said, there were great difficulties, and sometimes even great injustices were done to those applicants, because they did not know the case against them. deeply about it, because I well remember that very early in the war, before I was appointed to the tribunal, I appeared as counsel before the tribunal presided over by Mr Justice Davidson Nothing is said about which had to hear applications by British subjects interned, under regulation 29. I appeared for an Australian-born British subject of Italian parentage who had been interned under regulation No, 29 and who had appealed. It was one of the most painful experiences of my professional career to appear in a his loyalty and to have no knowledge at all of what the case was against him. The regulations were so stringent that we had to show cause in a case without any cause being given to us. That man was unsuccessful before the tribunal. He went into internment for years. We continued the fight outside the tribunal in the sphere of politics and ultimately succeeded in obtaining his release. Long afterwards it was disclosed that he had been interned, although an Australian-born British subject, as the result of tittle-tattle arising from the personal vindictiveness of people who were his enemies. cent, of the internments.

Clause 22 (Deprivation of Australian Ri'tizenship of persons deprived of citizenship elsewhere). Leader of the Opposition) [2.48] -Thi3 is an interesting clause when read in conjunction with clause 21. I do not see the value of these clauses or what they intend to convey. This clause, according to its verbiage, gives the right to the Minister to deprive an Australian citizen of citizenship rights if he commits an offence in another country. It readsWhere an Australia citizen who(a) is a naturalized person; and (6) was a citizen of a country to which section seven of this Act applies and has, under a provision of the law of the country of which he was such a citizen, been deprived of citizenship of that country on grounds which, in the opinion of the Minister, are substantially similar to any of the grounds specified in sub-section (1.) of the last preceding section, the Minister may, if he is satisfied that it is not conductive to the public good that that person should continue to be an Australian citizen, by order, deprive that person of his Australian citizenship, and thereupon that person shall cease to be an Australian citizen. For the sake of argument, let me cite a person who has committed an offence in It is very Canada. That would' have an accumulative effect against him if he committed a similar act in Australia. Surely, the all purposes. For this provision to be of any value it will be necessary for reciprocal provisions to be inserted in the legislation of other parts of the British Empire so that a person guilty of an offence in, say, both Australia and Canada will be deprived not only of his Australian citizenship, hut also of his Canadian citizenship, and if he offends in, say, Southern Rhodesia, the same thing will happen there. But where does all this get us? The fact remains that such a person will still be a British subject and may continue to exercise to the full his Australian citizenship rights. He could become a member of this Parliament. the honourable member for saying that? made it perfectly clear that such a person could exercise the franchise and even become a member of this Parliament. All that happens to him is that he is deprived of his citizenship. He may not call himself a Canadian citizen, an Australian citizen or a United Kingdom and colonies citizen; nevertheless, he may continue to exercise all the rights of citizenship.

This clause deals with the deprivation of the citizenship rights of people who, being Australian citizens, reside outside Australia and offend against the laws of another country in such a way as to make them subject to certain disabilities and penalties. same as the provision in the British act. copied the British act in that respect. We do not want Australian citizens who have been found guilty of an offence in another country and who have been punished for their misdeeds, saying, "" It does not matter very much; I am still an Australian citizen "". The observations of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr suppose, be exercised in the same way as Harrison) deal with a situation which is more technical than real. such a person be deprived? privileges does Australian citizenship confer upon a man in addition to what he might already possess as a British subject? that I made earlier. that matter before. The position is clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. The clause as it stands deals with naturalized persons who previously were citizens of another country and accordingly it relates to persons who originally were aliens. readsWhere an Australian citizen who<6) was a citizen of a country to which United Kingdom who are in Australia section seven of this Act applieswhen this bill becomes law, or who may Obviously such a citizen was originally have been residing in Australia for an alien and had obtained Australian citifive years when the bill becomes law, or zenship by registration. In respect of an alien who went to another British country and became a naturalized British subject and later came to Australia, the clause provides that if the other British country revokes the naturalization he shall cease to he a British subject. I repeat what I have said often before, that this bill itself does not confer any special rights on any citizen. It is designed solely to indicate those people who come under the protection of this Commonwealth. If that concept be kept clearly in our minds we shall be able to understand what the clause means. In certain circumstances we give to persons not born in Australia the right of Australian citizenship. That is an executive act which should be capable of being withdrawn by a counter executive act. It is true that where, under sub-clause 2 of clause 7, another country withdraws from a particular person the citizenship of that country, the Minister may exercise certain discretionary powers. For my part I believe that the Minister should have such discretionary powers. They will, I are his discretionary powers under the Immigration Act. The Government should have the right to determine whether the executive shall give protection to persons who are not Australian citizens by birth. Each of these clauses should be considered in the light of the fact that this legislation confers no special rights whatever. It merely defines who are citizens of this country and who shall be given the protection of this country against other nations. Clause agreed to. Clauses 23 and 24 agreed to.

Those Harrison) had said earlier that such persons may not want to become Australian citizens. Briefly, the position may be summarized as follows: Those who have been residing in Australia during the five years immediately preceding the commencement of this legislation will, under this clause, become Australian citizens automatically, without having to make any application for registration. Those who come from the United Kingdom will remain citizens of the United Kingdom also. In other words, they will have dual citizenship. Dual citizenship is inevitable in legislation of this sort. Those who have been in Australia for less than five years will not become Australian citizens automatically. If they wish to .become Australian citizens, they will have to apply for registration. Under another clause the Minister is empowered to register them after they they have been resident in Australia for twelve months, and in practice he may do so. the Minister? dual citizenship is inevitable.

They will still be British subjects and, as such, will be entitled to the franchise, to social service benefits and, if they be qualified, to certain benefits under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and the Re-establishment and Employment Act. However, when such persons proceed overseas, they will have to rely for diplomatic protection upon the representatives of the country in which they were horn, and not upon Australian representatives. Australian citizens proceeding to the United Kingdom will be entitled to the same rights in that country rights are reciprocal. Such rights, for instance, as employment in the Civil Service of Great Britain, eligibility for public office in the United Kingdom and all other material benefits are preserved to them. Clause agreed to. Clause 26 agreed to. Clause 27 (Women who have ceased to be British subjects by reason of marriage). Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [3.6], -This is what might be called the culminating clause of all those dealing with the nationality of married women. I should be churlish if I allowed this opportunity to pass without expressing the gratification of women's organizations in Australia, as well as my own gratification, at the action of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) in regard to this matter, which has exercised the minds of women for a long time, and has been the subject of discussion between various governments, particularly those of the British Commonwealth. It has been discussed at Imperial conferences over a long period, and notably during the regime of the Lyons Government, when it was raised on two occasions. It was found impracticable then, because of certain laws by which the Government of the United Kingdom believed itself to be bound, to carry to a proper conclusion the proposal of the Australian Government that free nationality rights should be given to married women. Under this bill, all the disabilities which previously existed are to be removed, at least so far as the British Commonwealth is concerned. This is the direct outcome of the action of the Minister in initiating in Australia a process which was later taken up .by other British Commonwealth countries. Finally, it was thrashed out at a conference in London. The Minister spoke of a committee consisting of representatives of certain women's organizations. Senator Dorothy Tangney was chairman and I was a member of that committee. So far as I can see, the recommendations of the committee",43,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948

In passing, I direct attention to the fact that the committee, which dealt with problems of enormous magnitude, problems which had exercised the minds of statesmen and interested persons over a great many years, met and settled all the business before it in the space of one and a half hours. That result was a triumphant vindication of the intellectual perspicacity of the members of the committee, and an indication of their determination to get the business done. Their recommendations gained the approval of the Australian Government and of the other governments concerned. Obviously, the recommendations, accepted by the Australian Government, and having been adopted by the London conference, must have met with the general approval of governments throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations. Having said that, I have expressed, in part at least, the sentiments of women interested in the matter, and have paid a well-deserved tribute to the Minister for having initiated the process that, so far as Australia is concerned, finds its culmination in this bill. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [3.8] I thank the honourable member for her compliment. When this legislation was first introduced, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) suggested that I might appoint an ad hoc committee of representatives of women's organizations, including the first two women members of the Commonwealth Parliament, to consider the whole subject of women's disabilities in regard to nationality law. I accepted the suggestion. The committee met, expeditiously despatched its work, and brought in an excellent report which was referred to London. The fact that Australia had taken the initiative in this matter moved the Government of the United Kingdom and the other dominion governments to take action. That phase of nationality law, plus the question of citizenship raised by Canada as a distinctive feature of the nationality laws of all dominions, formed the body of the work of the Imperial Conference in 1946, and of the nationality experts subsequently. I derive great pleasure from being associated with the consideration by the committee of this clause. I am glad that women's organizations throughout Australia and the British Commonwealth will now feel that women suffer no disability by virtue of the act of marriage. I can remember as a boy ten years of age going with my mother to a registrar to whom she paid Is., in return for which she received a paper which conferred upon her the right to vote. Without it she would not have been able to vote. I still keep that document as a treasured family possession. Clause agreed to.

This is a drafting amendment designed to make it clear that judicial officers of the State as well as of the Commonwealth may preside over a ceremony for the administration of the oath of allegiance. This is the clause which, for the first time, establishes the procedure by which certificates of naturalization will be conferred by an officer of a court, a Supreme Court judge, a judge of another court or a police magistrate. The clause abolishes the system under which persons receive certificates of naturalization through the post. It is very important that, when a person who otherwise is an alien becomes a citizen of this country, he shall do so in circumstances which will make him realize what a privilege is being conferred upon him. I have always believed that the system under which an applicant for naturalization merely advertises his intention in the newspapers, and ultimately receives a certificate through the post, is not calculated to impress upon",44,Nationality And Citizenshipbill 1948

Therefore, I strongly support the proposal that naturalization papers shall be conferred in such a way as to impress upon the recipient that he is joining a body of free people with a great, if short, history. I hope that, in so doing, we shall remove many of the differences that have too often distinguished naturalized Australian citizens from Australian-born citizens. I have seen justices of the peace taking the oath in public before a judicial officer, is sometimes a diminution of the simple usually a judge. The oath is often administered to many of them at the same time. They file into the court, the judge reads the oath to them, they file out again, and that is all there is to it. I believe that to be meaningless. They are being called upon to discharge important functions. The oath is something of importance, but I have often felt that its full importance is not properly conveyed to them. It would be very wrong if the oath of allegiance were to be administered to a new citizen in that way. I have seen this ceremony of the granting of citizenship performed in other countries, and the flag of the country to which allegiance was being sworn was raised with due ceremonial. If the atmosphere or the drama of the ceremony is correct, the new citizen is given some sense of the heritage into which he is entering. honourable member for Warringah ( Mr bestowed upon them with due dignity. Spender), in debating this measure, has taken a broad national point of view. That has been particularly evident in relation to this clause. A committee of the Immigration Advisory Council, on which were representatives of all sections of Australian opinion, considered the form that this ceremony should take. Having studied the rather flamboyant ceremonies in America and Canada, it came to the conclusion that we require a more dignified, quiet and typically Australian court ceremony, in which these fortunate people can receive the accolade of Australianism -The committee to which the honourable The decision of the committee was remember for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has ferred to the council, which passed it on referred will have some influence with the to the Minister, who approved of it. Minister in regard to the regulations that The ceremony must have basic dignity are made under this measure, and I and natural drama, and should be conducted with the understatement that is essential to the dignity that we are seeking. Those conditions can be obtained in a court in which the new citizens assemble, where the flag is shown in a simple but dignified way, and where a charge is read by the justice on the bench. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Warringah regarding the swearing in of justices of the peace. Because of the numbers involved, there dignity of the proceedings. I am sure that that will not occur in the case of new citizens under the administration of the present Minister, who has attempted so much in the field of migration. We want to convey our feeling for Australia to the new citizens. Honourable members need have no fear that the ceremony will lack anything in dignity, simplicity or, and this is very important, true significance. We could have blaring bands, flights of doves and so on, but that would he mere showmanship. What is required is the traditional British and Australian understatement. We are advancing from the stage when people could become Australian citizens by correspondence. They received a little parchment document by registered post, and then proceeded to form the proprietary family company that they had in mind when they applied for naturalization. The new citizens will be receiving a gift, and there is no reason why the gift should not be There could be nothing better than the simple dignity of formal court proceedings, with the justice on the bench welcoming the new citizens with a charge upon Australianism. There should be no mass-produced certificates or handouts. For the sake of the sentiment towards Australia of the thousands of people who will eventually become Australian citizens, we must ensure that this ceremonial will lose none of its significance.

185,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.17],"Theexpress my satisfaction with, the statement by the honourable gentleman that the Australian flag will appear in this ceremony. It seems to me that a symbol is very necessary in matters such as this, and, indeed, in all matters of human interest. sentiment, if only we could see it, and this measure recognizes that fact. I believe that hitherto in Australia there has not been sufficient appreciation of the importance of our flag as a symbol. I have had many pleasant discussions with the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) on this matter, which is one on which he feels very strongly, and I am sure that if he were present this afternoon he would give Ms warm support to the clause. It is not my desire to see a flamboyant ceremony, but it must be one that really means something. I agree with what was 'said by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). Sentiment is one of the inescapable psychological factors in the make-up of any individual. stand firmly upon the rock of nationhood rather than in the shifting sands of internationalism. ""When one talks in general terms of going before a justice and taking the oath of allegiance, the impression is created that that is necessarily a dignified ceremony. The clause provides that the oath shall be taken before a judicial officer. It would be a pity if a man who was seeking naturalization were to go to a magistrate's court to take part in what should be the most impressive and important ceremony of his life, only to find the court f u l l of drunkards, vagrants and other undesirables. We are poorly equipped with impressive courts for our judicial proceedings. courts are small and are crowded with litigants and witnesses. Their atmosphere would destroy what I believe we all have in mind. I hope that, whatever ceremony is decided apon, it-will not be a flamboyant one, but that it will convey to the person who seeks to .become an. Australian citizen that a great privilege is being conferred upon him and that he is entering into a great tradition. I do not believe that that can be done before the average court to-day. I am criticizing, not the judicial officers, but the conditions in which they operate. There is much sense in These will, in my opinion, be destructive of the purpose for which this clause is designed. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [3.25] -The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has written to the Premiers of all the States seeking their full oo-operation in the establishment of a proper procedure, and each of the Premiers has replied that he and his government will be happy to co-operate with the Commonwealth Department of Immigration in the conferring of naturalization certificates in -the manner that we desire. We are evolving a scheme undeT which each court will confer the naturalization certificates, apart from its general work of administration. to our request, all the States have agreed that the Australian flag shall be given pride of place in the court during such a ceremony, and that appropriate addresses shall be delivered. We are doing everything we can to fashion the machinery to ensure that the ceremony shall be neither flamboyant nor truculent, but shall live in the memory of, not only the person upon whom the honour of citizenship is conferred, but also his wife and children, who will he encouraged to witness the ceremony, and feel that the whole family is becoming a part of what we, in our hearts, believe to be the greatest nation on earth.

It is true that, under our law, an alien has not the same rights as has a natural-born citizen, or a citizen who has acquired the protection of this country by naturalization, but the development of British justice has produced significant features. One is that, while an alien is living in a country, he owes at least a qualified, if not a complete allegiance to the government which gives h i m protection. Another is that he is obliged to observe the law that is applicable to all the citizens of the land and even if he does not enjoy the same rights as those which arc accorded to ordinary citizens, he is given substantial protection by the Government. If honourable members w ill examine the bill, they w ill notice that the Minister is given an extraordinary power in relation to the deportation of certain aliens. proper safeguards such power is not proper, but I invite honourable members to examine the clause. providesIf it appears to the Minister that the conduct and character of an alien is such that that alien should not be allowed to remain in and children, have to go w it h him because Australia, the Minister may, by notice in of economic circumstances and necessity. writing, summon the alien to appear before a For that reason, it is very hard to justify Commissioner, at the time and place specified in the summons.

There can be no complaint against that sub-clause. The gist of my complaint, concerns sub-clause 3, which readsThe Commissioner shall make a thorough investigation of the conduct and character of the alien without regard to legal forms and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform himself on any relevant matter in such manner as he thinks fit. I have noticed over the years the continual adoption of the insidious practice of giving power over individuals to the executive, by providing that they may have control over their lives, liberty and I do not contend that with property, without regard to legal form.

The Minister should not seek comfort from what has been done in the past. I know that similar things have been done. But here we are dealing with the power of compulsory deportation. It is an extensive power because it ranges over any number of years that an alien may have spent in the country and it covers the most, general grounds of character and conduct. It would be a bad thing if this country, which should maintain the high standards of British justice as our own standards, denied to a person proper information before he was charged, because that is what is proposed, for thereby the person concerned would be denied the ordinary process of judicial The Minister may say, ""I shall get a proper judicial determination hecause I shall not he able to act without a recommendation from the commissioner"", but that begs the point that I am endeavouring to make, which is that it-should not be left to the commissioner to make a recommendation in the absence of the thrust and counter thrust of the ordinary judicial process and the publicity that attracts, as we have so often seen, information from sources that we know nothing about before the process commences. These rights, which are given to a British subject, should not be lightly taken from an alien, from whom we demand observance of our laws and, at least, as I said earlier, qualified allegiance. We should extend to him in Mr Spender. general terms, except to the extent that national considerations override, the same I determined to process of judicial determination as we extend to any subject of the land. Lest my remarks be misinterpreted, I make it clear that I am not making a special plea for aliens. I am making a plea for the maintenance of the principles of I do not challenge the British justice. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [3.50] Clause5 seems to be the only clause that introduces a new principle. I understand that the word "" alien"" is defined as it is in the Nationality and Citizenship Bill, with which we have just dealt. That is to say, "" alien "" means a person who is not a British subject, an Irish citizen or a protected person. The most important sub-clause is that referred to by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), which deals with the investigation of "" conduct and character '* of the alien without regard to legal forms. The sub-clause provides that the commissionershall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform himself on any relevant matter in such manner as he thinks fit. After the investigation the commissioner is to make a recommendation to the Minister and if he reports that the alien is not a fit and proper person to be allowed to remain in Australia, the Minister may,, but is not bound to, make an order for his deportation. The Immigration Act determination. and the Crimes Act set out variousgrounds for deportation and although, inmy opinion, the relevant sections of thoseacts are bad, from the point of view of theliberty of the subject, particularly when; they deal with political and industrial offences. The person to be deported must: be shown to have committed certain specified misdeeds as the basis for the judgment of the Minister in ordering deportation. But in this hill there is no definition of or limitation on what conduct or aspects of character are to be considered. I remind honourable members.of the case of Mrs. Freer. If that case is recalled, we can see what might happen under these provisions. Some Minister orsome commissioner might consider in, the future that similar conduct, supposed or real, rendered an alien not fit to remain in Australia, or the Minister orthe commissioner might consider particular political views rendered a person not fit or proper to remain in Australia. time could have put Mrs. Freer out of the country, but this bill provides a proter to look into the matter, I must vote tection in the person of the commissioner. Mrs. BLA OKBTJEN' -Yes, I agree. WhatI am discussing, though, is a consideration of the conduct and character of a particular type of an alien under this hill. Moreover, the Minister or the commissioner might consider that particular political views rendered a person not fit or proper to be allowed to remain in the country, even when that person's conduct did not bring him within the deportation provisions of the Immigration Act and the Crimes Act. ""Wide powers are taken in this clause and there is a danger of there being unjustifiable political discrimination against aliens of long residence in Australia who have not yet achieved citizenship. The Crimes Act and Immigration Act contain sections that are quite wide enough without the need for these provisions. There is sufficient authority in the existing law to deal with aliens. In clause 5 of the bill there is, as the honourable member for Warringah has said, a lack of proper protection of an alien. The commissioner may inform himself on matters prejudicial to the alien from sources not disclosed to the alien and the alien may be deprived of any opportunity of answering those matters. This is a departure from the normal legal procedure when the liberty of an individual is at stake. I am sure that some alteration could he made whereby such an objectionable feature would be removed from the bill. do not agree with the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) that the Crimes Act and other statutes provide sufficient machinery to deal with the deportation of aliens. I approve in prinLet me give an illustration in the case of ciple with this bill because, in common with other honourable members, I have drawn attention to a case in Sydney that illustrates the necessity for such a bill as this. The general provisions of the bill meet with my approval, but I most warmly criticize clause 5, to which the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has directed our attention. If the clause 5 remains in the bill, unaccompanied by an undertaking by the Minisagainst the bill, because I consider that the clause is fundamental. This matter of deportation involves drastic and, one might say, disastrous power over the persons threatened with deportation. I should imagine that short of death nomore serious fate could overcome a man living in a country than that by Executive act he should be banished from it and prevented from returning to it. Im the ordinary course of law, if one mam defames another, the man defamed has his remedy. If a man commits a criminal 1 act against another man, the State will take action against him. If one man breaks a contract with another man, the injured man may take action against him_ So it goes on. In each of such events the ordinary rules of law and the ordinary rules of procedure are applicable. In no case, except this sort of case, is it thought necessary to waive the ordinaryrules of evidence and procedure. Clause5 is very largely a procedural matter. The long-standing, traditional, accepted rules of procedure and methods of proof are to be, or may be, abrogated, and I am against that heart and soul. It strikes so deeply at the roots of ordinaryliberty that we have accepted as= being the right of every person who lives in this country that I cannot stomach it.. It is sometimes a point of criticism of lawyers and of courts of law that they have what are known as difficult rules of proof. I do not want to waste the time of this House in defending the rules of evidence which pertain in ordinary courts of law. I merely say that, inconvenient as they sometimes are for persons prosecuting and defending, they were not the creation of somebody's unreasonable imagination. They weredeveloped and tried by experience, in many instances over hundreds of yearswhat we call hearsay evidence, the rule under which, normally, evidence may not be accepted against a person in a court, of law except it be about something which the person giving;",49,Calweltj

Does the honourable member fear that a judge will abandon the legal principles about which he is so concerned? L should like to answer it in this way. There is a degree of safety in the fact that a judge of the Supreme Court will be the presiding officer. During the war judges of the 'Supreme Courts of the States were made chairmen of some of the internee appeal tribunals to which F have referred. Those tribunals sat in time of war, and, the rules of evidence and of onus of proof being relaxed, the judges presiding not only thought they were entitled, but also under the regulations they were directed, to inform their minds as best they could. One of them who has recently retired from the Supreme Court bench found himself bound to act in that way, and did so, but with much heart-burning. The fact that he was a judge afforded the alien some degree of protection hut not enough. at present deport a man from this country without holding an inquiry?. deport certain aliens from Australia without holding an inquiry, but this bill proposes to widen his powers in that respect. If this hill becomes law he may deport certain people whom he may not deport under his existing powers. To give him authority to deport anybody from this country without inquiry seems to me to be unwise. I want to improve the position so that aliens or persons against whom this wide power may be exercised may have some rights. directly, this Parliament would have the last say? Eveni f it did not have a legal say, at least it would have a moral say. If the Minister acted illegally or unjustly, the matter would come before this House eventually. under the provisions of this bill recommends that an alien be deported, he must be deported. I agree with that. The honourable member for Warringah and I are trying to guard against a judge coming to a wrong conclusion as the result of the relaxation of the rules of evidence and, on the basis of that conclusion, unjustly recommending the deportation of an alien. not prejudiced against this proposal because he fears that what happened during the hysteria of war may happen again in the calm days of peace? jection. I think it is not unlikely that that may occur. I hesitate to intrude my personal experiences into a debate of this kind, but I cannot help reminding the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) that during more than twenty years' .experience in the legal profession I have seen much injustice done, even under the strict rules of procedure which are intended to ensure justice as between man and man. Justice is only an approximate thing, because human beings are frail and uncertain mortals. It is because of the frailties of human nature that over the centuries there has been developed a system of legal procedures and strict rules of evidence. It is those procedures and rules that I seek to maintain, because that is the only way in which we can shelter a citizen from the ill nature, the falsehoods, and sometimes the sheer mistakes of his fellow citizens. If all of those rules are to be relaxed, and the judge is to inform himself in such manner as he thinks fit, will an alien who appears before one of these judges have the right to be represented? The right of legal representation is a prime principle in law. In the ordinary courts of law an alien would be able to exercise such a right. If an alien has no right to legal representation he might very well be placed at a grave disadvantage by reason of his lack of knowledge of our legal system, our customs and our language. Is that right to be abandoned, too? What about the question of publicity? I agree that if matters of security are involved it may be desirable to hear cases in camera, but,",52,Calweltj

Let the proceedings be -conducted in the light of day. Let the people be present at them. Let the people ralk about them. Let the newspapers report them. We have all had experience of the striking way in which new facts will turn up if a piece of information about a case is published in the newspapers. Every day in the week solicitors get letters giving new, striking, dramatic and decisive information bearing upon cases in which they are interested. We must have protection against discrimination and hearsay evidence. We must have protection against the informer, who, no doubt, is a sad necessitj' in our community, but whom I suffer only because I have to do so. Likewise, he is suffered by the community as little as possible. Therefore, I oppose the -clause in its present form, and I ask the Minister for an assurance that the matter will be further considered before the bill is dealt with in the Senate. Otherwise, I shall be obliged to vote against the measure. From time to time, I have had dealings with the Minister regarding deserters, mental cases, convicted persons and Asiatics about to be deported. I take it that persons in those categories will still be deported without invoking this new provision under which they may be brought before a commissioner. That being so, to whom will the new provision apply? If an alien leads a life of ill-fame or is guilty of black marketing, he can be convicted in an ordinary court of law. If he is an undesirable person because he is a criminal, he will not come within the category which this legislation proposes to create. Therefore, I should like to know what are the offences for which a person cannot be convicted before an ordinary court of law, but which may make him undesirable in the eyes of the Minister, and justify his being brought before a commissioner. I cannot understand what they may be unless-and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr if Gaelic is not a living language, the Spender) came to the point as straight as an arrow when he mentioned Communists -suc h persons are associated with Communist propaganda, which is not actually a crime since communism is not illegal. The new provision might enable a Minister to have such a person haled before a commissioner, who could recommend that he be deported. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [4.17] -in reply -In this legislation, it is proposed to act under the aliens power in section 51 of the Constitution. This power, as distinct from the immigration power, has to date been used only in respect of naturalization. The immigration power has been used to deal both with British subjects and aliens. The case of Mrs. Freer was mentioned by the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn). Mrs. Freer was a British subject who was refused admittance to Australia by a previous government hecause, in the opinion of that government, she was guilty of moral turpitude and was an undesirable person. The High Court held that, under the immigration law, it was a proper exercise of power to refuse her admittance. Aliens, of course, can be refused admittance: Mrs. BLACKBURN -On the same ground ? ground, and on other grounds. If they are of Asiatic origin they can be refused admittance, not ostensibly on the ground of their origin, but because they fail to pass a dictation test, which is a face-saving device. be that the Minister does not like the person's politics, as happened in the case of Kisch. sons or bad reasons, an alien may be refused admittance. There was the famous case of Egon Kisch, a Chechoslovakian citizen, who was given a dictation test in Gaelic. There was a High Court action to determine whether Gaelic is a living language. It was argued that Government was not entitled to exclude a person by giving him a test in a language which, ordinarily, he could have had no",54,Calweltj

212,Mr Beazley,Anothe r ground could,55,Calweltj
213,Mr Calwell,"Yes, for good reaopportunity of learning. Hitherto, governments have acted under the immigration power in refusing to admit persons to Australia, or in deporting persons from Australia. There was the equally famous case of Johansen and Walsh. Walsh was a British subject, but Johansen was an alien, and an effort was made by the Bruce-Page Government to deport them. The High Court held that they could not he deported under the immigration power because they had resided in Australia so leng that they had ceased to be immigrants. They had established domicile, .and had become residents. The hill we are now considering relies upon the alien power in the Constitution. Under that power, Johansen could have been deported because he was an alien, but Walsh could not have been deported. After being a resident in Australia for a certain time, a person may cease to be an alien, by becoming naturalized, but if he does not become naturalized he continues to be an alien no matter how long he remains here. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) referred to aliens who may be removed because they are in ill health, or are feeble-minded, or epileptic, or suffering from dementia, or some serious transmissible disease. may be deported under the Immigration Act which provides that any alien, who has been resident in Australia less than five years, may be removed from Australia on llie fiat of the Minister for Immigration, who may cancel the person's landing permit. Having done that, the Minister may put him under a certificate of exemption, and on any subsequent date may order his removal from Australia. of appeal to the High Court, hut the position has been tested so well that there is no effective' means of redress, and nothing can prevent the person from being deported. There is a provision in the Immigration Act that an alien, even after having been resident in Australia for five years, may be deported by order of the Ministeri f he has committed an offence punishable by twelve months imprisonment. There was the case of .Agostini who had been a resident of Australia for many years. He was charged with murdering his wife, after having been at large for a number of years following herdeath. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On the expiration of that term, I ordered him to be deported. Had he become a naturalized citizen after five years' residence in Australia, he could not have been deported because he would have altered his state of alienage to that of British subject. In the case I have cited, the Minister is empowered to act on his own initiative without consulting any one, and even without reference to the Executive Council. However, we have to consider another class of person, the alien who has resided in Australia for more than five years, and has not committed any offence making him punishable by imprisonment for twelve months or more. Some persons who come within that category may have done something offensive to the general community, and have shown by their conduct and their character that they are persons no longer worthy to he permitted to remain in Australia. sons have not committed any offence for which they could be convicted in a court of law. consider the case of a man who has been in Australia for 32 years. He was not interned during World WarI . , but was interned during World War II . He was found by a commissioner, either Mr Justice Hutchins or Mr Justice Simpson, to be a person who should be permitted to remain in Australia, instead of being sent back to Germany. After his release, he may have done things for which he There is a right could not be prosecuted under State law, such as instigating public unrest, or bribing persons to inflict harm on other persons. His general conduct could indicate him as a person ill-disposed towards the Australian community, whose continued presence in this country could lead to the commission of crimes of violence, even resulting in the death of other persons. In the opinion of the Minister, he might be a person whose case should be investigated by a commissioner, and if the commissioner reported 'adversely on his character and conduct, he should be deported.",55,Calweltj

Let usmitted crimes of violence could he not be convicted in a court of law? a supposititious case, and although the person may have done the things complained of, he may never have been convicted. There is a fairly large body of opinion in Australia which finds expression through the Australian Natives' Association, through organizations of ex-servicemen, and through some branches of the Australian Labour party this House. able member's amendment, the first that I have accepted. There is this body of opinion which is to the effect that an alien, who fails to become a naturalized British subject after residing in Australia for six, seven or eight years, ought were known as omnibus warrants. Men's to be removed from Australia for refusing to become naturalized. There is this large body of opinion that aliens should not be allowed to live here, make money and enjoy the advantages of British citizenship, while suffering none of the disadvantages of such citizenship in time of war. Governments have refused to submit legislation to compel aliens who fail to become naturalized, to leave the country after seven or eight years because it was thought that this would be unfair. There are in Australia aliens who have married Australian women, and reared families of Australians, but who have never become British subjects. They hold fast to the nationality of the land of their birth. We propose that aliens who cannot be dealt with under the Immigration Act, should he dealt with under the alien power in the Constitution if, in the opinion of the Minister, the case is grave enough to be referred for investigation and report to a judge of a Commonwealth court, or a judge of a court of comparable standing. The investigation will be of the same kind as that which took place in the case of aliens released from internment in order to determine which of them should be allowed to remain in Australia and which should be sent back to their own countries. bad instances of complaints by the These people do not want to be organizations to which the Minister Australians and have a contempt for comhas referred, and particularly branches of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in Fremantle and elsewhere. When investigations were made subsequently, the persons about whom the complaints were made were released. I am afraid that persons may be deported as a result of complaints of that kind. After all, these organizations are composed of individuals, and some individuals have axes to grind. They may object to effective business competition by aliens. That is what the complaints amounted to in some instances. were grave abuses during the war, when persons were interned on the certificate of a Minister. I am not casting any reflections now, but I know that people from Queensland were interned on what names were put on a list and they were interned. While they were in internment, their conduct was studied to see whether or not they should have been interned. T had a lot to do with the release of many people, 'because I was the chairman of the Aliens' Classification and Advisory Committees. During the war, we interned 16 per cent, of our alien population. Great Britain, which was only twenty miles from Hitler's legions, interned only 2 per cent, of its alien population, and the United States of America interned approximately .1 per cent, of its total alien population, including the Japanese in California, whom the Americans did not "" intern "" but, as they termed it "" relocated "" in Arizona and elsewhere. There are some people at large in this country who are doing things that are objectionable and dangerous to the peace of the community. They have lived here for many years.

Clause5 (Deportation of certain aliens). his second-reading speech, the Minister talked of certain people being in Australia who had forfeited all rights to remain here. He spoke with some warmth. I know at least one of the people to whom he was referring. The Minister's remarks were, in effect, a pre-judging of those cases, and that is something that we do not want to occur. If the Minister is going to assume now that the people he has in mind have forfeited their rights, it bodes ill for them when they appear before the commissioner. It is true that one of the people he has in mind has been in this country for a long time. He was not interned during World WarI . , but he was interned during World War II . , and was refused release from internment, although he made an application to the appropriate tribunal. Eollowing his release from internment, he has been a considerable nuisance to the community. remain in Australia. might be that this man's conduct is such that, if his case were referred to the commissioner under this clause, he could be deported, but I contend that the case should be tried de novo, that all the usual benefits of the doubt should he given to the person concerned, and that he should be presumed to be innocent until the commissioner considers that he has been proved to be guilty by evidence adduced in accordance with the ordinary rules of evidence. This man should be taken before the commissioner, charges should be made against him by somebody acting on behalf of the Crown, the Crown should establish a prima facie case that his conduct and character are bad, and then he should be allowed to attempt to satisfy the commissioner that his conduct and character are not bad. In his case he would probably have great difficulty in doing so, but that is not the point. The ordinary rules should apply, and the onus of proof should be upon the Crown. Having regard to what I have heard and read about this man, I hold fairly strong views about his conduct, but what right have I , or any member of the Parliament, including the Minister, to pre-judge the case? If we are to have a commissioner, the case should go before him in the ordinary way. The Minister has already given an undertaking that when an alien appears before the commissioner provision will be made for him to have legal representation. Will the honourable gentleman also give an undertaking that an alien will be supplied with, reasonable particulars of the charges that are made against him, and that the ordinary rules of evidence in courts of law will apply to this tribunal? That is the minimum for which we ought to ask in cases of this kind. I agree with the Minister about the case 1 have mentioned, but we are dealing now with principles and not persons. We are considering provisions that will apply to cases of which we know nothing, and it may be that some of our own friends may be affected by them in the future. for Information and Minister for Immigration) [4.44] I dealt with a supposititious case. It has some basis in reality, but I had to illustrate my point when I was asked by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) what kind of cases I had in mind. I give the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) an assurance that the person charged will be furnished with particulars of the charges that are against him. I cannot agree to eliminate sub-clause 3 of this clause, which I regard as an integral part of the whole clause. The sub-clause provides as follows:The Commissioner shall make a thorough investigation of the conduct and character of the alien without regard to legal forms and shall not be bound by any rules of evidence, but may inform him,self on any relevant, matter in such manner as he thinks fit. A man who has persisted in maintaininghis alienage in this country for 10, 20 or 30 years has not the same claim to be protected by the laws of evidence, when he is charged with being a person whose character is dishonourable and whose conduct is disgraceful, as has a British subject or a person who has not had time to qualify as an Australian citizen.",58,Calweltj

If commissioners had not been appointed to review the cases of internees and empowered to disregard the laws of evidence, many internees would have been kept in prison for much longer than they in fact were. The country has some interest in this matter. An alien who has lived here for many years should not be allowed to beat the law on a technicality. The commissioner, about whose sense of justice, acumen and worldliness there should be no suspicion, will be a person who will discharge his obligation with fairness to the accused person and who will consider at the same time what is best both for the alien and fur Australia. If a man wants to continue to be an alien in this country, what disability is imposed upon him if he is told to go back to the land of his birth to which he owes allegiance? He cannot have the advantage, if there be such, of being a national of a foreign country whilst possessing at the same time all the rights and privileges that accrue to those who are British by birth or who acquire British nationality as it may be acquired, by naturalization.

The House has already had several opportunities to debate those two matters. The bill provides that Australia shall deposit an instrument of acceptance, but that our acceptance shall not take effect until the United Kingdom and the United States of America have deposited corresponding instruments. The Havana charter had its origin in the Mutual Aid Agreement and the negotiations associated with the granting of the American loan to Great Britain in 1945. One of the conditions governing the loan was that Great Britain should favourably consider the charter which gives effect to Article VII . of the Mutual Aid Agreement. Accepting that condition, the British Government presented bills relating to the loan and the charter to the United Kingdom Parliament for ratification. Those bills were rushed through the House of Commons and the House of Lords in a matter of days without proper discussion, and I believe that Britain, in a measure, accepted some of the conditions under duress. Since that time, the charter has I withdraw it. been considered by international conferences held in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, and at Geneva and Havana. After the document had been substantially amended, the nations concerned signed it on the 24th March last.

America's part is appreciated as a co-operative effort, but America is dependent upon Great Britain and other countries for markets, just as they are dependent on America for goods and dollars. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) described the United States of America as the leader of the nations. That statement is true. I greatly respect America for the great work that it has done, but I point out that leadership is determined not solely on physical and economic assets but also on national honour, integrity and achievement. In those qualities, Great Britain has qualified for leadership just as much as America has done. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, has stated that the policy of the British Labour party is to implement socialism. One of the objectives of the socialist is to cause the British Empire to be disrupted. In such circumstances, I wonder whether that is the reason why the honourable member for Perth has placed Great Britain in a position secondary to that of the United States of America. When judged by standards of national honour, integrity and achievement, Great Britain is in no sense secondary to America. I am not decrying the United States of America when I express that view. For trade purposes, America depends upon overseas markets and I believe that the policy of the United States of America is hamstringing its economy. I agree with the honourable member for Perth that the United States of America has made an approach to solving the problems -of the world's needs; but it is the only country in a position to do so. I remind the honourable member that after World WarI . Great Britain faced up to those problems, and did a wonderful job unaided, at a time when other nations were in a position to help. Although assistance was not forthcoming, those problems were attacked in a national way. It is unnecessary for me to repeat that after World War II . the United States of America did its part, but there should have been co-operative effort. When :uiy agreement is made on an international basis, co-operation should be the spirit of thai agreement. Great Britain should not have been forced to accept conditions under duress. Looking back over history, the result of the policies of Australia, England and the other Empire countries is apparent. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) said, if I understood him correctly, that Great Britain adopted a wrong policy by "" channelling "" its trade. I disagree with that contention. I shall not deal with this matter in detail, because I have spoken about it on at least two occasions previously. The results may be clearly summarized. As a result of the Empire policy on trade between Britain, Australia and the other Empire Dominions, the Empire was considerably strengthened. Australia had The assured markets, worth much alike in times of plenty and depression. England had assured supplies; the value of past dealing has been apparent in recent years. When world supplies have been in short supply, Great Britain has been assisted greatly by regular shipments from the Dominions. Australia's overseas economic strength has been developed as a result of Empire international trade. We have to issue licences for any import? from the United States of America, because of the dollar exchange and from a trade point of view. Australia's position would not be so secure to-day if we were dependent on the United States of America. If the Government's attitude to-day is as stated by the honourable member for Perth, it is at least consistent, because in 1932 Labour representatives in this Parliament moved amendments to offset the effect of Imperial preference. The honourable member for Perth suggested that we should trade with all of the nations of the world. How can the honourable member reconcile that with Labour's condemnation of Australia's trading with Near Eastern countries prior to World War II . , when we were at peace with them? He said that war often eventuates from trade restrictions. Up to a point, I agree with that statement. But, if that is so, why did the Australian Labour party oppose dealing with Japan in times of peace? If the honourable member for Perth is serious in that contention he must agree that the action that was taken by his party assisted to promote conflict. Imperial preference has always been supported by the Australian Country party. Surely as a family within the British Commonwealth of Nations, we have the same right as was exercised by the United States of America when that nation retained the preference clause in its dealings with Cuba. much eagerness on the part of the Australian Labour party to liquidate the Empire and to seek self-aggrandizement. EarlierI used the word "" disrupted "" as applied to a statement by Sir Stafford Cripps. I withdraw that, and substitute "" liquidated which is the word that he used. The truth of the old proverb that unity is strength was never more pertinent than to-day. The more we keep our Empire intact, the more we will feel the benefit of the truth of the statement that unity indeed is strength. I believe that without the help of the Mother Country in the past we should have been like a clutch of chickens running around without the mother hen, all seeking our own ends, without any co-ordination. What security will be achieved under the International Trade Organization? Under this agreement we cannot possibly secure markets as valuable as those which we have had with our own kith and kin in the past. According to the newspapers, Australia desires to withdraw from the council of the United Nations Pood and Agriculture Organization. I should be very interested to know if there is any truth in that suggestion. see in the press. smoke without some fire. That proverb has a lot of truth in it. Australia is not satisfied with some aspects of that organization. In dealing with Empire preference the honourable member for Perth said that there must be a two-way deal. That is quite true, but I am glad to say that so far as our deal with England is concerned we seem to have maintained the bulk of the trade that we had with that country under Imperial preference. What has been lacking in these negotiations is that Australia has not been sufficiently strong in its attitude, involved, that interpretation will not -behaving regard to the fact that there was a certain amount of duress in the initial arrangement made with Great Britain. Australia could have been more determined in its stand in making that deal to protect its trade and to' protect England from having to scout the world for goods. Great Britain could have had assured supplies from its Dominions and that would have strengthened it when, There is too making the arrangement for the International Trade Organization. If we are forced into a wild scramble for markets, what hope have we as compared withnations of lower standards than our own? I remind the Government that if we lose markets unemployment must result. Is it the desire of the Government, that by placing ourselves in the favoured nations class, we should have to compete with other nations on a lower standard of living, and that if they can sell their goods at a lower price, our standards and wages should be reduced in order to compete ""with them? Why did not the Government maintain Empire preference within this agreement, so that Australia could retain assured markets, with a guarantee of the continuance of our present standard of living? The Government is apparently quite happy about our scramble for markets, in competition with all the nations of the world, irrespective of standards of living. I see no security in the agreement at all. That is why I am speaking on this International Trade Organization for the third time. I repeat that America preserved its rights, and it is interesting to consider the point of view of the United States of America, as a leader in a national sense, on this point. Mr Besse, the president of the American Association of Woolmen, in referring to this agreement, and particularly the charter section of it, said:The philosophy behind this charter is such that the resultant document is a conglomeration of unrealistic proposals. Charter should' be discarded in tolo and an entirely new start made on a drastically different basis w it h limited and simplified objectives. I submit that all of the Empire trade that' we have had in the past could have been protected and maintained within thisagreement. I also remind the Ministerthat when a matter of interpretation is made by him, or whoever happens to be the Minister of the day, but by the International Trade Organization. After this bill has been finally debated and accepted,, instruments have to he lodged by Great",61,Dedman
243,Mr Dedman,Neve r believe what you,63,Dedman
244,Mr Adermann,"There is neverBritain and the United States of America to make it effective. Another aspect of the charter is that, in terms of ""white paper, it occupies 95 pages. Almost every provision in it is made subject to exceptions, modifications, clauses, and special agreements. In view of the objections I have advanced against it, and of its exceptions, modifications, and special clauses, I wonder whether the Minister considers that it is only a scrap of paper, which can be dispensed with when things are not acceptable to us? In view of the opinion advanced by Mr Besse in the United States of America, perhaps that is the viewpoint that the Minister has uppermost in his mind. No reason can be advanced why we should accept membership in the International Trade Organization without considering that point of view. There is another point concerning the International Trade Organization which has been brought to my mind. By interjection, the honourable member for Perth was asked whether the Government favoured free trade or protection. Although he may not have wished to evade the point, I understood his reply was to the effect that he considered it was not very relevant or vital to the issue. Perhaps he meant to avoid discussion. I do not want to be unfair to him. free trade protection is vital to Australia. Are we to assume that all tariffs are bad for trade? If some of our industries are to have no protection we shall not be able to maintain our standard of living, because, as I argued earlier, we shall have to compete in the sale of certain commodities with low-standard countries that, undoubtedly, because of their cheaper labour costs, will be able to place their products on the world's markets at lower prices than we could possibly afford to do. So it is necessary that at least certain industries shall have protection in order that they may be maintained for the good of the country. Are the new industries that Australia is sorely in need of not to have protection other than that provided for in the short period of three years while they are establishing themselves. That brings to the forefront the pertinent point whether it is Labour's intention to reduce the standard of living: in Australia to enable this country to compete with other countries in thescramble for trade. The policy incorporated in the International TradeAgreement is that a concession given toany particular country under the mostfavoured-nation clause shall be given toall countries. That, of course, is, in effect,, a complete ban on imperial preference. Surely we have the right and the need tomaintain our trade. A dodger published' by the Empire Industries Association, and the British Empire League providesus with proof of the value of our trade with Great Britain. The dodger statesI n 1920 we imported 5 million ewts. of Empire sugar. In 1937 we bought 26 million ewts. In 1920 we bought 147 thousand ewts. of Empire raisins. In 1937 we received 530 thousand ewts. In 1920 we purchased only 15 million lbs. of unmanufactured Empire tobacco. In 1937 we imported 57 million lbs. Those statistics relate to imports byGreat Britain from Empire countries. I advance them as an argument for the maintenance of Empire preference and Empire trade. That is all I wish to say in support of the argument that we should have maintained within the agreement our right in full as a family of nations to preserve imperial trade and I submit that the issue of imperial preference in order to strengthen! the British Empire and assure the MotherCountry of the supplies that it has depended on in the past and that it should! be able to depend on in the future, thereby assuring ourselves of the market in the Empire that has been assured to ushitherto. vernment is prepared to adopt theHavana Charter. That can destroy many flourishing Australian industries, rob usof our fiscal autonomy and deny us the right to protect our own industries. Thecharter takes from this Parliament the right to legislate on tariff and tradepolicy. It signs away the right of this country to protect itself against world depression. This Government has surrendered all those rights on one condition. That is that the charter is accepted by the Governments of Britain and the United! States. So the ironical situation is that the industries of this country are now w>",63,Dedman
245,Mr Lang (Reid) [5.19],"This Goa position where they must look to other governments to save them. The fate of many Australian industries, therefore, was actually decided at the congressional elections in the United States. Australian primary and secondary industries are in the position wherein they must look to the new Congress to reject the charter. If it accepts, then the British Government is morally hound to sign. The Havana Charter is the outcome of the seventh article of the Atlantic Charter, and the product of the negotiations American loan to Britain in 1945. Great Britain is committed. tralia has no such commitment. Fortunately, American industries are now beginning to realize the danger of entrusting their future to these remote international organizations. That was why the Congress rejected the International Wheat Agreement. The American people can hold the American Government responsible for its actions. They have no such hold on an international body. Bureaucracy has found a new field of exploitation. It is on the international plane. The bureaucrats are no longer satisfied with wielding power in one country. They see themselves dominating the world. They think in terms of globular power. Their objective is to create a series of world cartels. There is already a money cartel. There is also an air cartel. Now they want a trade cartel. These cartels are not governed on the sound democratic basis of responsible government. The members of the organizations are governments. actual controllers are the bureaucrats appointed by their governments. Once appointed, they become members of a new privileged class. Their salaries are paid by the international organization. They are immune from taxation by their own country. They then become members of a new international despotism. They are remote from their own countries. It is a new form of indirect governOrganization the Tariff Board will proment. The documents tabled with this bill are an amazing collection of essays in the strange new international language. They add up to a weird concoction. They would provide ample material for any J[r. Lang. set of international lawyers to devote themselves to for the rest of their lives. Then, when the lawyers had finished with them, I am very doubtful whether they would be any clearer. An international agreement should be in simple, unequivocal language. The Havana Charter is a masterpiece of verbal confusion. It is a hotch-potch of legal quibbles, crack-pot economic theories, escape clauses, reservations and bureaucratic jargon. No member signing it will have the faintest idea of the extent leading up to the of its commitments. The provisions will all be subject to interpretation by the Ausorganization itself. Under present conditions, Australia has full self governing rights to impose any conditions it likes on trade and commerce within the limitations of the Australian Constitution regarding State rights. The Australian tariff has the dual objectives of being a source of revenue, and a means of building up and maintaining Australian industries. It is also a protection against dumping. Th( j Government from time to time has also adopted other means, apart from the tariff, for the purpose of protecting the Australian economy. It imposes quantitative restrictions. It subsidizes local production by fixing home-consumption prices. In recent years, it has superimposed a still further control in the shape of import and export licences. Once we accept the charter we are committed eventually to the abandonment of all these weapons of defence. There is a very sound principle on which tariff protection should be based. That is that any industry But the requiring protection should have the right to go before an independent tribunal to state its case. That tribunal in Australia is the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board, after hearing all the parties involved, submits its report to the Parliament with its recommendations. It is then for the Parliament to decide the tariff. But once this country becomes a member of the International Trade gressively disappear out of the picture. It did not operate when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in this bill was being negotiated. It will not operate in the future once the International Trade Organization starts to function. It the Havana Charter is to be anything more than a collection of prize economic shibboleths, the International Trade Organization will become the supreme tariff-making body for the entire world. I.t will have the right of veto. Under Article XVI . , we shall be required to eliminate all forms of trade discrimination. We will not be permitted to charge ii. tariff on goods of one country that differs in any way from the rate charged on goods from another country. That system cannot work smoothly unless every country has exactly the same standard of living, and the same currency values. It is a counsel of perfection, when perfection is unattainable. This new organization will provide an incentive for the larger monopolies to transfer their industries to cheap labour countries. Instead of manufacturing in Australia, they will establish their factories in Indonesia, Malaya, China or Japan. At present, we have the right to protect our Australian industries. fully exercised that right in 1931, when it erected the tariff wall to exclude a flood of imports from depressed countries. Under Article XVII . , this country will be committed to a policy of reducing tariffs and eliminating preferences. There could be no room under such a policy for a sudden reversal to meet an emergency. At present, Imperial preference is still an excellent weapon to meet the establishment of an outside trade Hoc. Under this charter that weapon would disappear. Imperial preference is not a one-sided arrangement. It has enabled us to place our primary products on the British market in competition with those of Argentina, Scandinavia, Holland and other more accessible suppliers. Preference has been a sound business arrangement, depending upon the ability of the negotiators to enter into arrangements favorable to this country. The elimination of preference must eventually lead to the loss of markets, or the reduction of the Australian standard of living to enable this country to compete with countries more accessible to the world's markets. A margin of preference that might be' satisfactory to meet current conditions might not be sufficient to meet changing conditions in the future. This bill sets as the ceiling those tariffs operating when the charter became operative. That presupposes that conditions will not change. If they do change, countries affected cannot adapt their tariff to meet those changes without the approval of the international organization. In the international organization the case would not rest on its merits, but on the power politics of the moment. This scaling down of tariffs is an attempt to revive the doctrine of free trade. But the conditions of the nineteenth century are not the conditions of this century. The Australian tariff enabled this country to develop the industries that provided the nucleus of our defence organization. Without those industries, we should have been defenceless. Once we accept the principles of the charter there will be no such thing as preventing the export of pig-iron. If we open up deposits of uranium, or any other key defence mineral, we shall have The Scullin Government to hand it over to all nations without discrimination. Is that a sound policy? Already we have had an example of the complications that are likely to arise. The Groves Parliamentary Committee on Broadcasting recently submitted a report to this Parliament on the use of Australian music on the air. The committee was of the opinion that the percentage of Australian music should be increased. But some one suddenly remembered the obligations contained in this charter. So the committee went to the experts of the Department of Trade and Customs for advice. The department told the committee that any such quota might be regarded as discrimination against the music of other member countries of this organization, and that if the Australian Government instructed the broadcasting stations that they had to use 5 per cent, of Australian music instead of 1\ per cent., the Government might be violating the charter and might be accused of discriminating against the products of other countries selling music to Australia. Is not that an impossible position for any government to have to face? What applies to music may apply to every other product of this country. If there is a shortage of potatoes in this country, and potato-growers are able to sell their product at higher prices -overseas, it will not be possible for a .government to impose a quota system on -exports. We have seen what has happened when such a system was applied to suiting materials. Under price control, imanufacturers were able to export cloth without regard to fixed prices. The result was that all our first-quality cloth went overseas. Much of it has been -returned to this country in made-up form -at exorbitant prices. Once we accept this -charter, no government could protect Australian consumers against such con-ditions. Article XVII. commits this country to reduce its tariffs progressively. reduced, the new schedules become the -top limits. Neither the Tariff Board nor -this Parliament could increase them with-out the consent of the international -organization. At the same time such reductions -eliminate any remaining margins of preference. I have been waiting for the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) to explain -how he reconciles the provisions of Article XX., which deals with quantitative restrictions on imports and exports, -with the Government's dollar policy. We .are told that a country may. impose restrictions to safeguard its balance of payments. How can that be fairly applied -to the restrictions imposed by this Government on petrol imported into this -country? The Government has admitted that most of the petrol used here -comes from sterling sources. then, can it stretch the argument to petrol and still honour its obligations under Article XX.? 13 petrol available in a sterling country, it would appear that this country has no right under the charter to impose any restrictions on its entry into Australia :SO long as this country has favorable sterlin relation to the Commonwealth's powers ing balances. I suggest that the Prime Minister might give that aspect some -detailed consideration as it is only typical -of the thousand-and-one problems that will immediately arise once Australia has -committed itself. We have had another -example of how this agreement works in -connection with Australian films. The British Government decided that it was necessary to impose import quotas on American films, as that was one of the Qargest dollar drains. But, once having Mr Lang. adopted that policy to meet the particular case of American films, the British Board of Trade was up against the non-discrimination clause. Films from the Colonial Empire would have been allowed in. Films from the Dominions were subject to exactly the same conditions as American films, although the conditions were totally different. Admission of the Australian film would have constituted discrimination against the American product. While there may be temporary relief under the escape clause governing the post-war transitional period, it would be only temporary, and it is proposed to Once make a very permanent kind of arrangement. Once we accept this charter there can be very little hope for Australian films, Australian books or any similar product that might benefit from existing preferences, or that might benefit automatically reduce or from any action by Britain to correct its trade balances. There is one other very important aspect of this new form of international government. 'Once the Government signs the charter, it will have all the force of a treaty. It will be an international agreement. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has from time to time made some very interesting observations on the treaty-making power of the Australian Government. It seems to be his opinion that it can be used to override other sections of the Constitution. Thus, if the How, Commonwealth wants specific powers that it does not possess under the Constitution, it can, instead of consulting the AusIf there tralian people in a referendum, enter into an international agreement. That, he contends, would give the Commonwealth power in that field. That is a most important aspect of the charter when considered over trade and commerce-the most contentious of all constitutional problems. The people have consistently refused to alter the trade and commerce powers; but if the Attorney-General is right, then this new organization can impose conditions over trade and commerce within a country that the Parliament of the country itself cannot impose. There is a grave danger that international organizations might be used by an Australian government as an excuse to grab powers that the people of Australia have refused to grant it. ""When some of the provisions regarding commercial policy, free transit of goods, and emhave elapsed. Eveni f its decision are ployment are considered in this light, it becomes evident that if the Attorney General is right in his assumption, the charter can be used to introduce revolutionary changes. It is a matter which might well engage the attention of constitutional experts. This charter is closely allied with the Bretton Woods Agreement, and, in fact, is complementary to it. The reservations that I had made in regard to the Bretton Woods Agreement apply also to this charter. I have analysed closely all the arguments used by the Minister in presentcourse of action. Britain and the United ing the bill, as well as the other documents on the subject tabled from time to time, but when they are all added up there does not appear a single, specific, positive advantage to be obtained by this country in return for sacrificing its right of economic self-determination for this new fad. The Minister's principal claim appears to be that it will encourage other nations to adopt a policy of full employment. How, he does not say. If all the professors, all the economic experts and all the lawyers and bureaucrats, who have produced this amazing hotch-potch, go on conferring for the next ten years, I am afraid we shall be no closer to that objective. Every time they assemble, whether it be in pleasant Geneva or in delightful Havana, they think up a few more complicated escape clauses, reservations and pious hopes. The world still has to devise a formula that will make war the least productive of all means of providing employment. This is not a charter of human rights. It is a legal nightmare. The Minister holds out the hope that the Parliament is asked to legislate to some member of his staff may be eliminate British preference, the Governappointed, to the executive of the new ment proposes to grant special allowances organization, but even that would be only of petrol to the purchasers of British a temporary achievement.

Thus, even if the Minister's British cars shall be taxed at a lower rate optimism is justified, this country will, than cars imported from foreign counat the expiration of three years, probably tries. Again, I do not complain of that, have no representation on the governing and merely mention it in order to [127] body. Once the organization is established-if it is established-n o withdrawal will be permitted until three years totally opposed to Australian interests, this country will be bound to remain inside the organization for three ' years. What will happen to Australian industries in three years? It only took eighteen months for a world depression to develop. Anything could happen in three years. If Australia ratifies the agreement, a large number of important countries can remain outside it. It would be much better to postpone the bill until the countries that matter have decided their States of America are not the only countries whose economies have important hearings on Australia's future. Of course, if the 81st Congress of the United States of America decides to revert to a policy of domestic tariff control, the bringing in of this bill will have been a waste of time. The first objection I wish to make to this measure is in regard to the date upon which it is to come into operation. In clause 2 it is stated that the act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal assent. That seems to me to be the height of hypocrisy. Although the ostensible purpose of the bill is to bring into effect an agreement to remove restrictions on international trade, the Government i9 continuing to enforce import restrictions of many kinds. There are in force quantitative restrictions which are much more ferocious in effect than any tariff could be. It also smacks somewhat of hypocrisy and double dealing that, while",64,Dedman
246,Sir Eakle Page (Cowper) [5.55],"emphasize the contrast between such a policy and a measure, the purpose of which is to abolish discrimination in favour of British trade. The attitude of the Government of the United States of America to the charter is very differcr.t from that of our own Government. In the United States of America, it is not proposed to enact legislation providing that the charter shall come into force on a certain date. On the contrary, it is intended that all the trade items that may be affected by the charter shall be the subject of special consideration by committees appointed for the purpose. I maintain that, in the same way, we should insist that, before the provisions of the charter are made to apply to commodities in which we trade, those commodities should be properly examined by the Tariff Board. Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m. talk of expanding world trade while food is rationed in Great Britain and Australia, and while most countries are depreciating tbeir currencies with the object of restricting their imports of the goods of other countries and stimulating their own export trade. The Havana Charter recognizes this, absurdity by stating that escape clauses are necessary. In the form of a White Paper, the charter covers 95 pages, whilst the sixteen clauses of the Ottawa Agreement cover only two pages. Almost every provision of the Havana Charter, which has been distributed to us in the form of an immense mass of typewritten matter, is subject to exceptions, modifications, escape clauses and special arrangements. It is, therefore, almost impossible to understand what is really intended. The kernel of the charter is to be found in the fourth paragraph of the opening statement on purposes, which reads as follows:To promote on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis the reduction of tariffs, and other barriers to trade and the elimination of discrimiiiatory treatment in international commerce. The paragraph implies that all tariffs and forms of discriminatory treatment are bad for trade. Although the document provides for the ultimate abolition of Empire preference, at the first meeting of the International Trade Organization special arrangements were made for effective preference to be given by the United States of America to Cuba and the Philippines. In almost every European country, as well as in Australia, many kinds of government controls are in existence. There is rationing of food imports, raw materials, and almost every commodity that affects a nation's economy. An examination of the trade arrangements that have been made between Great Britain and Australia reveals that most of them have been made on the basis of the government of one country buying from or selling to the government of another country. The old concept of individual trading seems to have gone by the board. Any one who has studied what took place after World WarI . knows that there is not the slightest chance of a return to normal trading conditions during the next five or six years. It was in 1925, seven years after the end of World WarI . , that Great Britain returned to the gold standard, and it was realized, subsequently, that that was an unfortunate and precipitoiis step. The peak of the inflation which followed World WarI . was reached approximately six years after the end of the war. To-day, France, Italy, China ""and other countries are suffering from tremendous inflation. While the present state of affairs continues, and while there is rationing of food in Britain and other countries, Australia does not need an agreement of this kind to assist it to sell its export surpluses. Britain is anxious to import as much as possible from us. It can buy our products more cheaply than it can buy those of other countries, and, therefore, will take as large a quantity of our goods as we can send to it. The stark fact is that Britain's imports of food, in -terms of annual weight per capita, are much smaller than in pre-war years. In 1938, the annual weight per capita of imports of grain, flour, meat, dairy produce, fruit and vegetables, sugar, &c, was 820 lb., while the figure for 1947 was only 527 lb. In 1938, Australia occupied the proud position of the largest exporter of food to Britain, on a monetary basis, but to-day we are fifth on the list. The position in regard to quantities of food",68,Dedman
247,Sir Earle Page,"It is absurd tois very similar. In 1938, Britain imported food to the value of £46,000,000 from Australia, £36,000,000 from New Zealand, £36,000,000 from Canada, £33,000,000 £34,000,000 from the United States of America. In 1947 the figures were £45,000,000 for Australia, £64,000,000. for New Zealand, £130,000,000 for Canada, £90,000,000 for the Argentina, and £98,000,000 for the United States of America. We were then fifth on the list. Those figures emphasize my point that Britain would readily take all the food that we can send to it at the present time. There is no limit to what we could sell to it if we could supply the goods and find the ships in which to carry them. Great 'Britain have decreased because we have been sending vast quantities to other parts of the world. My point is that there is no difficulty in selling our goods, because the world is short of food. We do not need an agreement of this kind to enable us to sell our surpluses. The world is in a state of chaos. It was in a state of chaos for some time after World WarI . , but probably the present position is worse than that which obtained then. This document, having regard to the circumstances that surround its birth, is a confession of defeatism and of lack of faith in the possibility of the rapid recovery of the British Empire. To my mind, its acceptance by the governments of the countries of the British Commonwealth indicates their lack of belief in the resurgence British Empire. I venture to say that the Anglo-American loan comes into that category. been strongly of the opinion that if the British Empire had stood firm and retained the sterling bloc, as it could have done after the victories over Japan and Germany, America, in its own interests as well as in the interests of the world generally, would have had to give money to Britain instead of lending it, and Britain would have passed more quickly through its crisis. Despite the defeatism that is apparent in many quarters, the British Empire still holds a quarter of the world's surface. Its natural resources, although they are largely ""undeveloped, are so great that it would be able to obtain very advantageous terms from America in a proper deal, such as the Ottawa from Argentina and Agreement was between Great Britain and the Dominions, if it were able to negotiate on a basis of equality We could make our own conditions. A study of the history of the British Empire shows that during the last 200 years there have been, in effect, three British Empires, one succeeding the other, and each one being larger than its predecessor. The first Empire began with the great conquests of the sailors of Queen Elizabeth, and may be. said to have ended with the loss of the American colonies in 1780. The second Empire lasted from 1780 until 1874, when Canada was granted dominion status. The third Empire, consisting of Great Britain, the Dominions and the colonies, then came into being. Each one of those Empires, in its trade and development, was greater than the preceding one. If , when World War II . ended, we had not dallied with this trade proposal but had stood four-square for the retention of Empire preference and for the fiscal autonomy of which the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) spoke this afternoon, I do not think we should have been faced with our present difficulties in retaining India, South Africa, Eire and Burma as integral parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or of the Commonwealth of Nations, if we are to abandon the word ""British "". We should have been able to offer those countries sufficiently valuable inducements to remain within the Commonwealth, and of the undoubtedly they would have done so. If that had been done, it would I have always have greatly simplified the, arrangements that it would have been necessary to make between ourselves and the United States of America, as well as with the nations of Western Europe, with which we have a very close affiliation and in which we can always find good markets. Because of the greater simplicity of those arrangements and agreements, less difficulty would have arisen in their interpretation and administration than is likely to be the case with these international arrangements. I ask honourable members to compare",69,Dedman
248,Mr Pollard,Our exports of food to,70,Dedman
249,Sir Earle Page,"I realize that.the sixteen articles and two pages of the Ottawa Agreement with the 95 pages of the Havana Charter, which, I am sure, scarcely any member of this House has had the time or the courage to read. Practically every provision of the charter is so dubious that there are exceptions, modifications, escape clauses and special arrangements attached to it. The United States of America took the definite step of saying that if the international trade agreement did not work out satisfactorily, it would alter it within a short space of time. During the Second Session of the American Congress in 194S, an act was passed to extend the authority of the President under section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and for other purposes. The act was the Trade Agreements Extension Act 1948, section-3 of which reads in part as follows:(<i) Before entering into negotiations concerning any proposed foreign trade agreement under section 330 of the Tariif Act of 1030, as amended, the President shall furnish the United States Tariff Commission (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ""Commission"") with a list of all articles imported into the United States to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions, imposition of additional import restrictions, or continuance of existing customs or excise treatment. Upon receipt of such list the Commission shall make an investigation and report to the President the findings of the Commission with respect to each such article as to (1) the lim.it to which such modification, imposition, or continuance may be extended in order to carry out the purpose of such section 330 without causing or threatening serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or similar articles; and (2) if increases in duties or additional import restrictions are required to avoid.serious in j u r y to the domestic industry producing like or similar articles the minimum increases in duties or additional import restrictions required. The Havana charter, as published in a White Paper, occupies 95 pages, and points out that the purpose of the agreement is to reduce duties. But the United States of America, which is in a key position in the matter, has adopted the attitude that, if its domestic industries are adversely affected, it must be in a position to increase duties against competitive goods admitted to America from other countries'. We all know that the United States of America is the great creditor nation of the world. Section3 Sir Earle Page. of the act to w h i c h I have r e f e r r e d , also contains the f o l l o w in g p r o v is i o n s : Such report shall be made by the commis si on to the President not later than 120 days after the receipt of sucli list by the commission. No such foreign trade agreement shall be entered into until the commission has made its report to the President or until the expiration of the 120-day period. (6) In the course of any investigation pursuant to this section the commission shall hold hearings and give reasonable public notice thereof, and shall afford reasonable opportunity for parties interested to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard at such hearings. (c) Section4 of the act entitled "" An act to amend the tariff act of 1030"" . . . is hereby amended by . . . inserting . . . the following: ""and before concluding such agreement the President shall request the Tariff Commission to make tlie investigation and report provided for by section 3 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 104.8, and shall seek information and advice with respect to such agreement from the Department of State, Agriculture, and Commerce, from the National Military Establishment, and from such other sources as he may deem appropriate."" In the agreement negotiated between the United Kingdom and Australia in 1932, and the subsequent arrangement in 1938, responsibility for dealing with such changes was vested in the Tariff Board, which was not obliged to examine by five government departments, as is required in the United States of America. How negotiations can be satisfactorily conducted between 55 nations under the charter, I do not know. The best way in whicn to restore the economic condition of the world is for the British Empire as a whole to reach a trade agreement with the United States of America. Subsequently, other countries may be included in the arrangement but for the time being, the United Kingdom, the British Dominions and the United .State* of America should negotiate bilateral agreements. For many years, they have been the two principal lending countries which have kept the wheels of international commerce in motion. I still retain the views which I held when T spoke on this subject about two years ago, that we should not be obliged to give the most-favoured-nation treatment to every country with which the United States of America has trade relations. It will be impossible to keep track of the manner in which social and industrial conditions in all other countries are reflected in their production costs. That matter is most important, because production costs in other countries may ultimately, through competition, affect our industries and cause unemployment here. The international agreements provide that British preference shall not be increased, and must ultimately disappear. In this changing and chaotic world, I regard the negotiation of such a dogmatic agreement as the height of folly. No one can forecast with certainty the new industries that may be established here, and the degree of protection that they will require. We may not be able to afford to wait, before giving protection to a new industry, while we approach the International Trade Organization and obtain the approval of at least two-thirds of its members to .an increase of tariff in order to enable us to protect an industry. Certain industries may be most important to our development, but not so important to the development of other countries. During my lifetime, I have known many new kind3 of industries such as the motor car industry and the radio industry to spring up almost overnight. Five years after they had been established they probably employed as many people as many of the biggest industries. That experience may be repeated. Therefore, we should be in a position to protect our industries when they require protection. It is our first duty, as an integral part of the British Commonwealth of nations, to develop the Empire so that we may defend ourselves in periods of difficulty. I recall the time when the world appeared to be on the threshold of a long era of peace. Great Britain had enjoyed almost 100 years of peace because of the manner in which it had been able to strengthen its position. The United States of America had experienced 60 or 70 years of peace. If the United Kingdom and the United States of America were able to act in concert, I believe that they could preserve the peace of the world. They need to develop their resources to the maximum capacity in order to assist nations which are not well developed or are in dire need peace occur during a period of free trade? to discuss that particular matter, because I have been pointing out that restrictions and currency depreciation will continue during the next five years. 1 urge that ratification of the proposed trade agreement be deferred until we are able to view the position more clearly. I u other words, we should not jump into water before we know its depth. When I was in Africa, I discovered that the British territories had an order of preference which had been imposed upon them from an external source. The preference was granted to countries in the following order:-The United-Kingdom, the United States of America, ex-enemy countries of Europe, and, finally, South Africa and the other Dominions. When I discovered that such an order of preference could be granted at the present time, I ceased to wonder that so many difficulties could arise in trying to persuade India, South Africa and Burma toremain in the British Empire. We should endeavour to make membership of the Empire so valuable to those countries from the standpoint of trade that they will be glad to remain in the British Commonwealth of Nations. From, that basis we can, by continuous trade contacts, become better acquainted with one another, and strengthen the sentimental bond between us. If Australia ratifies this charter and is afterwards overtaken by an economic crisis, we shall not be able to act so quickly as conditions may demand, but will have to wait until we have observed the procedure prescribed in the charter. The circumstances may demand that we act overnight to correct a position. Of course, we may act overnight in certain circumstances by using exchange control, but the degree to which we may depreciate our currency is limited by these international commitments. However, we shall not be able to make a prompt adjustment of the tariff in order to meet the crisis. I realize that the Government will insist upon the Parliament ratifying the action of its representative in signing the Havana Charter, but it is not yet too late for us to reconsider our position and work for the rehabilitation of the Empire. that era of By giving 60 days' notice, we may move to alter the agreement, and three years hence, we may withdraw as a signatory to the charter. Almost every provision in the",70,Dedman
250,Mr Beazley,Did not,72,Dedman
251,Sir Eaele Page,"I do not desiredocument is made subject to exceptions, modifications, escape clauses and special arrangements. We can make use of the exceptions if they are to our advantage in developing the Empire to the maximum capacity. The world is in such a chaotic state that we are unable to determine precisely the permanent action that we should take in this matter. One idea which should certainly be corrected is that only those countries, colonies and dominions which are contiguous to one another by land should have the benefit of any improvement in their trading conditions and preferences. For many years, the sea has united the various parts of the British Empire. In the Middle East campaign during World WarI I . , Great Britain lost control of the western Mediterranean for a period, but because it controlled the seas it was able to deliver supplies to its army in Egypt via the Cape of Good Hope more effectively than the Axis, which had shorter lines of transport by land, was able to do for its troops. When this agreement is to he revised, we must recognize that the sea is not a dividing factor but one of the great connecting forces of the world. Until a few years ago, the air was considered to be a dividing factor, but today it also is recognized as one of the great connecting forces. We must realize that the sea can join us with and need not separate us from the other parts of the Empire. I have already spoken on this subject on two occasions, and, therefore, I do not propose to occupy the time of the House by analysing in detail the various provisions of the International Trade Organization charter and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, I desire to express briefly the same fears which I have mentioned on previous occasions about the operation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After studying the final draft, I find that there is nothing in it to cause me to alter other parts of the world, which conthe opinions which I have previously expressed. I find the same confusion of words, the same ambiguities, the same qualifications and the same references from one article to a second article and thence to a third article, all of which produces an amazing document which defies accurate and confident interpretation. I still visualize the same dangers to which attention has been drawn on previous occasions in respect of certain branches of production in Australia, particularly primary production. I refer to the policy of imperial preference, and to our policy of developing certain commodity agreements for the protection and the disposition of some of our products for export. Whilst some honourable members admit the existence of those dangers, they consider that Australia is forced to accept the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Havana charter for an International Trade Organization. One reason which they advance for holding that opinion is thai the purpose of the International Trade Organization is to remove threats to world peace which have developed in the past as the result of trading activities. That objective, some honourable members say, will be achieved through international co-operation. In view of the present world situation that opinion can be regarded only as a pious hope. We hope that if the various nations approve of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade and the Havana charter, their confidence will be justified, but there is nothing in the agreement to warrant such a belief. The arrangements which nations may make under the charter may just as easily develop into a threat to peace, as previous trading arrangements between nations have done. I suggest that a possible alternative result of the International Trade Agreement could be, as far as the British Empire is concerned, a steady moving apart at least of the component parts of the Empire. I very much wonder whether thought has been given to that possibility by those responsible for the developments of the agreement? Under the operation of this agreement it will be necessary for the various component parts of the Empire to enter into trade relationships with ceivably could have the result of separating them still further from the other component parts. That is a serious possibility. There are others who contend that Australia is forced to the acceptance of this agreement because of the position in which Great Britain finds itself.",72,Dedman
252,"Mr Davidson"" (Capricornia) [8.27].","There may be some merit in that argument, but if it is considered that Australia of the International Trade Organization. is more or less bound to come into the agreement because of its effect on Great Britain, and the fact that Great Britain was more or less forced into acceptance of it, surely we would have been in a much better position had that realization of Australia's responsibility been faced up to at a time when the Empire could have supported Great Britain by assisting it within the bounds of the Empire, instead of forcingit into the hands of the United States of America. I contend strongly that there was at the end of the war a responsibility on all of the component parts of the Empire to realize that Great Britain, in the early part of the war, fought alone in our defence. As a result Britain's economy was cruelly and savagely torn to pieces. One of the first tasks facing this nation at the termination of the war was to rally to Britain's reconstruction. That was not done, and we a.re now faced with the necessity to accept this world agreement because we f -iiled to realize our obligations then. Others contend that unless we do that now, we will be more or less in the position of a pariah among the trading nations. One must admit in that, too, there may be some force because of the inclusion of provisions in the agreement to the effect that any nation that is not a member-nation can only trade under some difficulty, and that in the event of a member-nation entering into any form of trade agreement with a non-member-nation, the principles laid down in the agreement mu9t be followed. Therefore, even though one may be outside the agreement, one will still be forced to conform to it, in order to trade. I believe that there are few who will admit that we are in this position through failure to realize our obligations at the end of the war, and our failure to take advantage of the opportunities that then lay open to us to rally behind the Empire, which would have enabled Great Britain to recover without recourse to such questionable experiments as this agreement. I realize and admit that the position we are facing is that the Government will pass this measure, and that Australia will thereby be committed to membership It is well, therefore, that we should be quite clear on certain of its implications and aspects. I say that we cannot be blind to the fact that this agreement will mean the ultimate lass of the policy of imperial preference. That policy has meant an enormous amount to the producers gencrallyj and the primary producers of Australia particularly. It is not necessary to state additional figures on that point, as the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann) this afternoon quoted figures showing the value that the application of the policy of Imperial preference has been to Australia and the Empire through the years. It is particularly regrettable that this agreement must eventually mean the loss of that policy. There are, I admit, certain apparent safeguards to this policy written into the charter. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, made reference to that, and contended that there is no danger to that principle in the agreement. I am afraid that I cannot accept that as the position although I admit that the policy of Empire preference is retained, in that provision is made that agreements entered into will remain. But we have to face the fact that the principle of Imperial preference is definitely condemned in the charter, and that all members are bound to consider any proposal or variation of the present position which may be advanced by other members. I believe that there are certain articles demanding that ""when one nation puts forward certain proposals affecting, as they could, some of our arrangements for Imperial preference, we are bound, under the agreement, to consider the proposals, and, if necessary, sustain our present attitude before the council of the organization. No one can say at this stage how such a provision would work. Can we say, confidently, that if some member nation outside the British Empire challenged some of our arrangements under Imperial preference, and called upon us to sustain our attitude and our agreement before the council of the organization, as a result of a teaming-up of some of the other member nations, we would be able to do so satisfactorily? To contend, confidently, that we could do so, would be exhibiting far too great a degree of confidence. I consider that the main safeguard to this important policy is something which is not written into the agreement at all. The main safeguard is the practice of the policy of Imperial preference in the United States. As I have said before, the United States of America, which is one of the dominant nations, makes considerable use of the policy of preference. Although that country does not call it Imperial preference, it is the same thing in essence. Even at the expense of repeating what I have said before, I point out that one particularly good example of America's use of the policy of preference was its approach imports. past the American policy with regard to imports of sugar from Porto Rica and other American colonies has been that that commodity is admitted duty-free. The United States of America also imports considerable quantities of sugar from the Philippines, recently, was an. American dependency. That country has now obtained its independence. The United States of America has an agreement with the Philippines whereby that country will supply to it about S5 0,000 tons of sugar annually. For several years to come the sugar will be admitted to the United States of America duty-free. Duty will then be imposed at a gradually increasing rate. According to figures that were published a few months ago, the full rate of duty on sugar entering the United States of America is about £10 a ton. Cuba is not a dependency of the United States of America and sugar from that country enters the United States of America at about half-duty rates. That proves that America applies the preference principle whenever it wishes to do so. It applies that policy also to other commodities. That provides us with an excellent answer to any challenge against the application of the policy of Imperial preference at any time. A country that intends to continue that policy cannot, in justice, require that we should alter our policy in that regard. Therefore, that is a most practical and material safeguard in this matter. It is something which impresses itself on my practical Mr Davidson. mind far more than, anything contained in the charter. I consider that we are likely to pay H very high price for our membership of this organization. Undoubtedly, it sets out on very fine principles, but it is likely to fall because its charter is ambiguous and because it expects too much of nations. I believe that high price to be the result of our own failure to realize our responsibilities at the end of the war by getting down to the task of 'adjusting these matters within the Empire. They could have been faced then, instead of waiting until Great Britain was forced to go elsewhere for the assistance that it requires. It is to its sugar not yet too late, because this agreement For some considerable time is still being discussed in various countries. We are not committed to the agreement until it has been endorsed by the Governments of the United States of America and Great Britain. We remember what happened in connection with the International Wheat Agreement. which, until Although that agreement was adopted in this House, it became inoperative because the United States of America did not adopt it. It is still not too late for the nations of the British Empire to get together to see whether it is possible to overcome the difficulties of that country within the boundaries of the Empire, thus overcoming the necessity for the Mother Country and the rest of the Empire to rely on the questionable security of this agreement. I feel that my attitude to the matter can best be expressed in the words that were used by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) this afternoon. They were particularly apt not only to the matter to which he was addressing himself, but also to this matter. He saidI stand firmly upon the rock of nationhood and not in the shifting sands of internationalism. T believe that we are in grave danger of severe loss in the matter.. I have no confidence that the objective behind this agreement will be attained. I have listened very attentively to the speeches on this bill delivered by honourable members on both sides of the House. I shall try to gauge",73,Dedman
253,Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [8.43].,"what good this bill will do in binding the British Empire together, or what harm it may do by dividing it. In an endeavour to size up the matter, honourable members on both sides of the House have said very clearly that this is the result of the American loan to Britain, and that Britain had no alternative but to enter into this agreement. Whilst that may be true, Australia is is in a different posiclosely linked. Will the Minister for tion. What amazes me is the fact that during this debate, and at other times, the Minister has never said that he is reluctant to enter the agreement. This Government is entering into this agreement with enthusiasm. this agreement is dividing the British Empire. I fail to understand why the Australian Government should adopt that attitude, with the approval of even the back-benchers on the Government side of the House. If the Government had come to us and said that it had been forced to enter into this agreement and that it was still fighting to the last ditch to continue reciprocal Empire trade, I could have understood its attitude, but [ cannot understand why it is so enthusiastic . about what the International Trade Organization will do for that body will do nothing at all for the greatest Empire that the world has ever known. Are we trying to estrange other members of the British Empire? Are we trying to break the Empire up? That seems to be the intention. The ninety-odd pages of typescript which were issued to us in connection with the hill start off by saying that the main object is to promote on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis the reduction of tariffs and other barriers to international trade and commerce. dom has been the leader of trade and commerce for centuries. Britishers have sailed wherever ships can sail and founded many a mighty state, as the poet has written. Temporarily Britain is ""up against it "" financially. Yet, the Australian Government seems to want to sacrifice all that the Empire stands for in its rush to enter multilateral agreements supposedly for the common good. This agreement is closely linked with the Bretton Woods Agreement, which I opposed. is not interested in what the honourable member did about the Bretton Woods Agreement. It is debating the International Trade Organization Bill. Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) tell us what multilateral agreements have benefited this country to any great degree? Although Great Britain is a signatory to the agreement, it is also making bilateral agreements with other countries, especially in Europe. Australia could best help to strengthen Empire ties by keeping out of the agreement. Doubtless, the Minister will say that we are being practically forced into it, but our representatives would do well to fight to the last ditch to preserve the ties that bind the Empire. We should be given an assurance that at the first opportunity this multilateral agreement will be swept aside and that the British Empire will be enabled once more to emerge as the greatest Empire in the world and still united under the Union Jack. Under this bill there are to he no increases of existing preferences. No new preferences may be instituted and existing preferences may continue but negotiations must be entered into for their reduction and eventual elimination. The Minister has not, perhaps, said so in so many words, but he has indicated that the Government intends to barter Empire preference for the lowering of tariffs in certain other countries. To many Australian industries it is vital that Empire preference shall continue. One in which I am most interested is the dried fruits industry. The growers are apprehensive of the future because, having seen what has The United Kinghappened with the signing of the agreement, they believe that this bill is the beginning of the elimination of Empire preference and that its total elimination i« not far round the corner. It is clear from the terms of the agreement and the bill that Great Britain and the Dominions are reckoned as separate countries that may not give each other any better trade terms than they give to foreisn countries.

It is useless to try to bring some nations up to the level of others, and far worse than useless to try to bring other nations down to a common level.

Consider the position of South Africa which is overwhelmingly dependent on gold, which in its turn is overwhelmingly dependent on the continuation by the American Treasury of its policy of purchasing gold. If the United States of America ceased to purchase gold, or if it ceased to exchange a certain quantity of gold for dollars, or if it ceased to accept imports of gold to finance exports from the United States of America, the value of gold would fall spectacularly. South Africa would then quickly find out to whose economy it is geared at the present time. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earlc Page) said that certain British protectorates near South Africa were extending higher preferences to foreign countries than to the Dominions. right honourable gentleman referred to the British protectorates of Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland, the only explanation for that is that the standard of living of those protectorates is so low that their peoples cannot buy the goods' at the prices at which they are produced in the British Dominions. The natives of South Africa are under privileged. If they had reasonable purchasing power South Africa would have no food for export whatsoever. It would all be absorbed by the local population. The natives of South Africa do not enjoy a reasonable standard of living, and, consequently, a policy of export subsidies has been adopted in that dominion. India, however, has no purchasing problems in its relatons with the United Kingdom. India £1,200,000,000.

Nehru has said that India will look to the United States of America for its requirements of capital equipment. Are we to be told seriously that with the United Kingdom, by mem is of the American loan, looking to the United States of America, for equipment, with Canada overwhelmingly interlocked with the United States of America in the economic sense, with South Africa dependent on the United States of America for the continuance of its gold-purchasinrr policy, with India in its present position, so far as purchases from Britain are concerned, it is likely that those countries will ask for a restoration of the Ottawa Agreement as it stood in 1932? Such talk is heard in three quarters only. It is heard from some Conservatives in the United Kingdom, notably Lord Bcaverbrook, who has been opposed to all of these agreements entered into by Gr-at Britain. He opposed the If the Bretton Woods Agreement and the American loan. He thought that in order to briug about the restoration of England, tLere should be. an heroic policy of tightening the belt and Empire free trade. Such talk is also heard in Australia, and in New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand the structure of British investments is still intact. The economies of both dominions are still, and are likely to be in the future, overwhelmingly geared to that of the United Kingdom. I can see nothing in these agreements which will have the effect of diverting the flow of our primary products from the United Kingdom. We are always hearing stories from the Opposition about how best we can assist in the restoration of the United Kingdom. Setting aside the £35,000,000 Great Britain owes worth of gifts that this country has made to Great Britain-and they do not. economy of Great Britain-w e have still been directing to the United Kingdom the major part of our export trade. He We have what is termed rather stupidly by economists a "" favourable balance of trade"" with the United Kingdom. We have been developing credits in London, which is a sign that our exports are still being directed there. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) has suggested that our gifts to the United Kingdom are valueless. I have not heard any British statements to that effect, and £ doubt if I shall do so. It is cbvious that a credit of that magnitude must be ultimately translated to the purchase of goods from this country, and it assists the United Kingdom in a policy for which it has asked. Great Britain has asked those countries which are prepared to allow it credits to be content not tc receive raised by honourable members in this dethe volume of exports which they would expect to receive from it. [t has tried to direct its exports to those countries which will not give It credit, or to those countries to which it is greatly indebted but which are not prepared to have large sterling balances t'rczen under a gentleman's agreement, such as we have, in London. What our gift of £35,000,000 means is that there is an amount of £35,000,000 in London which we will never claim and for which rlie United Kingdom will never have to pay in goods. To suggest that it is of no importance that Great Britain should not have to send to this country £35,000,000 worth of goods, or to export them to another country which will not give it credit for them, seems tc me to be lop-sided reasoning. farmers will be interested in the new protectionist line adopted by the members of the Australian Country party.

The bill also provides for the ratification of certain protocols in connection with both the agreement and the charter. In replying to the matters bate, I shall not make a lengthy speech. En my second-reading speech and also in one or two speeches which I made when this Parliament accepted provisionally the Geneva agreement at the beginning cf this year I gave reasons to justify Australia entering into the agreement and adhering to' the Havana Charter. I wish to divide the subject matter of the bill into two parts. First, I ' pointed out that ' this Parliament has provisionally ratified the Geneva agreement. At the time that was done, there was a very lengthy debate in the House on the subject. Secondly, I point out that many of the articles cf the Havana Charter duplicate the articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Australian Trade Since this Parliament has accepted the Geneva agreement provisionally, I can see no valid reason why it should not accept the agreement definitively, provided the United States of America and the United Kingdom take similar action. Many of the arguments raised by honourable members opposite are relative tc the discussion that took place some months ago on the Geneva agreement. Much of what was said by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), and, indeed, by most other honourable members opposite, in relation to the Ottawa Agreement and the preferences enjoyed under that agreement was dealt with during the debate which resulted in the provisional acceptance by this Parliament of the Geneva agreement. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) said a few days ago that it was no new thing for the Labour party to be opposed to Empire preference.

If I remember rightly, we had a very important preference .of wheat, but the government of the day gave it away without getting anything in return. The honourable member has moved an amendment which is not even original ment 'was similar to one which had been moved in the New Zealand Parliament. ber said nothing of the kind. I found it out myself. The amendment ""is the same, almost word for word, as the one that was moved in the New Zealand Parliament. In any case, the amendment, in the form in which it has been moved, is a stupid one. There is no other term to describe it. The wording of the amendment is as follows:That all words after "" T h a t "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the bill he withdrawn and redrafted to provide that nothing in the proposed act shall in any way restrict the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia from giving preferential tariff concessions to goods manufactured in the United Kingdom or in other countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth "". Under the Ottawa Agreement, the United Kingdom enjoys certain preferences in the Australian market, and Australia enjoys certain preferences in the United Kingdom market. However, the honourable member's amendment does not deal with the preferences that we enjoy in the United Kingdom market, but only with the preferences that the United Kingdom enjoys in the Australian market. The Government of the United Kingdom has intimated it i intention to deposit an instrument of acceptance of the Havana charter. Therefore, the United Kingdom will be bound by the charter, which provides that it may not seek any preference in the Australian market. Thus the amendment means nothing at all, and is, in fact, a stupid one. The honourable member for Balaclava said that the Havana charter and the Geneva agreement were unacceptable to Australia, and to Empire countries generally. Let us deal with the Geneva agreement first, and see whether it is acceptable in Australia. Mr P. B. Newcomen, president of the Graziers Federal Council, has spoken in support of the agreement. 2s. a quarter in regard to Mr A. E. Heath, president of the .Sydney Chamber of Commerce, also approved of the agreement. The financial editor of the Melbourne Herald, a journal which cannot be said to be friendly to the Labour party, has written in terms favourI said that the amendable to the agreement. The Melbourne Age, in a leading article, has statedGeneral agreement must be accepted in a spirit of reasonable compromise-wit h reserva tions, Australia w ill nevertheless accept the agreement as the first really effective evidence of international co-operation since the end of the war. There is nothing very critical in that. Mr Peter Malloch, a member of the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, and Mr P. R. Wilkins. secretary of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, have also expressed approval of the agreement. There is no doubt that public opinion in Australia is in favour of both the Geneva agreement and the Havana charter. The honourable member for Balaclava also said that the Geneva agreement and the Havana charter were unacceptable to Empire countries. I have shown that they are acceptable to Australia, generally, and now what abojit the other Empire countries ? The United Kingdom Government has intimated its intention to introduce legislation similar to that which we are now considering. The New Zealand Government has already introduced such a measure. The Governments of South Africa and Canada have stated that they will brin? down legislation for the same purpose.

267,Mr Dedman,"The honourable memstated that it will do exactly what the Australian. Government is now doing; yet the honourable member for Balaclava has the temerity to suggest that the agreement and the charter are unacceptable to Empire countries. Much has been said on the subject of Imperial preference. The purpose of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Balaclava. is to give the Australian Government the right to freely grant preference in the Australian customs tariff for the benefit of other Empire countries. The amendment is, in effect, a negation of the bill itself. It implies that, under the agreement and the charter, there is no provision for granting new preferences should British countries wish to do so. That is not so. It is evident that honourable members opposite have not even taken the trouble to study the charter properly. In Article 16, there is preserved the margin of preference that remained at the conclusion of the tariff negotiations last year. In Article 40, provision is made for the restoration of any preference that has been refused if there should be a flood of imports threatening the economy of the country concerned. In Article 15, there is provision for the creation of new preferences in certain that it would deprive Australia of the defined circumstances. It is true that the approval of the organization must he given to the establishment of new preferences, hut it is open to any country to seek such approval if it desires new preferential arrangements with another country. Thus, a great, deal of what has been said by honourable members opposite about preferences is without foundation. The honourable member for Balaclava also charged the Government with reducing certain customs duties without reference to the Australian Tariff Board. May I point out that, once again, it was a government in which the honourable member was a Minister that first reduced customs duties without reference to the Tariff Board. It is true that, in negotiations between the representatives of a large number of countries-ther e were only eighteen at Geneva, but at Havana there were 58-it is impracticable to have a discussion on tariffs going on at home at the same time that tariff bargaining is proceeding at the conference. Reductions of customs duties must be used as bargaining points to induce other governments to reduce their tariffs. On such an occasion it would he impracticable to consult the Australian Tariff Board, officially at any rate, on matters which formed the subject of negotiation with other governments. That is why the Government of which the honourable gentleman was a Minister did not approach the Tariff Board when it reduced certain duties in 193S under trade treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. Mr ""WHITE -That was in the intermediate tariff. what tariff it was in ; the principle remains the same. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) had something to say about the bill. The description of him given by my leader is apt. He dubbed the honourable member the de facto leader of the Opposition. The term, de facto suits him very well, because almost every argument he used tonight was illegitimate. He said that the charter would rob the Australian Government of its -fiscal autonomy. It will do nothing of the kind. He said right to protect itself against economic depression. It will do no such thing. He said that it would deprive Australia of the power to protect its industries. It will not. He said Australia was not committed under the Mutual Aid Agreement with the United States of America to enter into arrangements regarding trade. That statement is wrong. Australia is committed just as much as is the United Kingdom. ""We received goods from the United States of America under the lend-lease agreement, and entered into a mutual aid pact which contained a clause binding us to take part in trade negotiations. even had we not been bound by such a clause am merely emphasizing that every point raised by the honourable member for Reid was without any justification. The honourable member said that if we accepted agreement definitively we",81,Dedman

That matter also is covered by an exception in the charter, and the export of uranium can be prevented. He said that if potatoes were in short supply here and higher prices could be obtained for them overseas than in Australia, we could not prevent their export and that our own people would go short. That is completely untrue. He said that we could not prevent the export of worsted materials if they were in short supply in this country. That also is without foundation. Every point that was raised by the honourable member for Reid was without foundation. He is well named the de facto Leader of the Opposition, because he can bring forward nothing but illegitimate matters. I propose now to make a few observations on the charter itself. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) made a valuable contribution to the debate when he showed that one of the great causes of wars in this century has been the disturbance of international trade relations such as that which took place between the two world wars. I believe that in trade disputes there may lie the cause of another world war. Therefore, any attempt that is made by the peoples of the world to agree upon methods by which international trade should be conducted and to provide a meeting point at which they can discuss their difficulties and disagreements is something that should meet with the approval of every one who has the peace of the world at heart. This is made perfectly clear by a. study of the history of the world between the two world wars. If honourable members opposite will refer to the memoirs of Mr Winston Churchill which were published recently, they will find that Mr Churchill subscribes to the argument that was so ably adduced by the honourable member for Perth and which I am also putting forward. When a depression threatened the world in the 1930's each country applied restrictive trade practices. They only made the position worse. One of the chief reasons why Hitler came into power was that, by means of a series of bilateral treaties, f>f the kind that the right honourable memJfr. Dcdmtrn. ber for Cowper has talked so much about, he was able to tie to the German economy the economies of almost all of the European countries. In that way, he increased the strength of Germany and was ultimately able to wage an aggressive war. Anything that can be done to ensure that restrictive trade practices are not again resorted to will assist in ensuring that another war will not break out in the near future. ing. whether it is wishful thinking, but it is a matter to which millions of people who are praying for world peace are directing their minds. Surely a government should not be criticized for devoting its attention, as this Administration has done, to an international agreement that will help to prevent the difficulties of trade being aggravated in the way in which they were aggravated between the two world wars, for it may thereby avoid another world conflict. with this question. to do with this question. I said earlier that there was one feature of international relations and domestic policy between the two world wars to which I wanted to refer in greater detail. It is the question of employment. -Order!

Consequently, there is nothing to which the Minister need reply in regard to employment. dealt with the restriction of trade and the ing the charter and the agreement are effect that it will have on Imperial preference. Imperial preference was brought into being by the Ottawa Agreement, which was the answer to the HawleySmoot tariff legislation that was passed by the Congress of the United States of America. America had not raised its tariffs to a high level under that legislation, the Ottawa Agreement would not have been concluded, and we should not have had Imperial preference in its present form. The Congress of the United States of America would not have passed the Hawley-Smoot legislation if it had not been faced with grave unemployment in America. cerned with the Hawley-Smoot tariff or with any other such, arrangements. AllI am concerned with are the rules and Standing Orders of this House. Neither the Minister nor any other honourable member is entitled to defy the ruling of the Chair. not pursue that line of argument. Restrictive practices throughout the world are bound up'with traditional employment policies. Unless -vve are able to depart from these policies insofar as they have failed to deal with the employment problem in the various countries of the world, countries will continue to apply the restrictive trade practices that arc prohibited by this charter. I believe that the people of Australia and the peoples of the British Commonwealth of Nations generally are in agreement with the principles cf this charter. It will be a good thing for the Parliament to ratify the Havana charter and to bring the Geneva agreement into effect definitively, it having already been brought into effect provisionally. There is a curious alinement of forces in opposition to the Geneva agreement and the Havana charter. The only governments in the world that are violently opposed to both the Havana charter and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are the Government of the Soviet Union and the governments of the countries that are under Soviet domination. quite different from the reasons advanced by honourable members on this side of the House. The honourable member for Balaclava finds himself in strange company. ?TheI f the United States of only governments in the world to-day that are opposed to the Havana charter and to the Geneva Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland and other Soviet satellites. In addition, the Communist, party in Australia has expressed its opposition to both the Havana charter and the Geneva Agreement. It is a curious combination. The honourable member for Reid, honourable members opposite, the Communist party in Australia, the Soviet Government and the governments of Poland and other Russian satellites are all opposed to the Havana charter and to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those who are adopting that attitude have no interest in the reconstruction of the world. Russia desires that the economies of the European countries shall be thrown into such a state of chaos that the Communist doctrine will be easily inculcated into their peoples and more areas of Europe will be brought within the Soviet sphere of influence./ Honourable members opposite are not really interested in the prosperity of Australia..

The honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Balaclava stated that the manufacturing industries of Australia were in danger because of the tariff reductions that were made at Geneva and because, under the Havana charter, we have undertaken to enter into further negotiations. Those remarks have no relation to the position in Australia to-day. I tabled recently a paper showing that new industries and new branches of industry to the value of £144,000,000 had been established in Australia between 1945 and the date when the paper was tabled. Is it likely that firms from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as local firms, would expand their businesses to that degree if they were afraid that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or some other commitment into which the Australian Government was entering under the Havana charter would endanger the prospects of their businesses in Australia? There is not the slightest fear in thn minds of Australian business people that the success of their enterprises will be in any way endangered by the provisions of the Geneva agreement or of the Havana charter. I believe that the Australian Government is to be commended for having taken a leading part in these negotiations. Brennan, F. Chapter II . of the charter, which deals with employment, is one for which the representatives of the Australian Government were responsible. If it had not been for the activities of the Australian delegation, that chapter would not have been included in the charter. Its inclusion represents one of the great achievements of the Australian Government and the Australian delegations to the conferences. not be a perfect document. It is the result of a series of compromises made by the 58 nations represented at Havana. It was not possible for the Australian delegation to get its own way on every article of the charter, hut, in the circumHarrison, E.

Because it is the best instrument that we can get, and because so many other countries have signified their intention to accept the charter, I believe that Australia will be detrimentally affected if it does not accept both the charter and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade definitively, as we have already done provisionally.

Fadden-. B r it a in at present. On the 14th September, 1948, the ""most-favourednation "" treatment for western Germany was agreed to by thirteen nations, and it is no secret that similar treatment for Japan is even now being sought by a major power. The Minister will probably quote Article 16 to show that British preferences are not in fact eliminated. I point out, however, that Article1 pledges each nation to promote action for the reduction of tariffs and the elimination of discriminatory treatment in international commerce. The whole purpose of this bill is the ultimate extinction of Empire preference. I have just received an official booklet that was published by the United Nations secretariat in July, 1948. On page six, in the explanation of the Havana charter, and referring to ChapterI . it says that devices such as import quotas which discriminate to the advantage of cue country as against another must be gradually abolished. On page 7, referring to Chapter IV . , it saysThe first section lays down the general principles of "" most-favoured nation"" treatment amongst member countries, while allowing certain existing preferential systems to remain, subject to negotiations for eliminating them in time. These obviously are official intimation? that the Havana charter is specifically designed to destroy the import quota system, on which the International Sugar Agreement is based, and also to destroy the system of Empire preference. What dees the official statement by the United Nations Secretariat mean? The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction w ill doubtless give us another of those verbal assurances for which he is notorious. WhatA require, however, and what the primary producers cf Australia demand, is something in black and white which w ill protect them against removal of preferences Havana charter contains in by the signatory nations, amongst whom Australia w ill have only one vote, and commodity agreements, a very small voice indeed. This bill, which attempts to n u l l if y the Ottawa administration of quantiAgreement slowly but surely,. without reduction of tariffs, legally signing its death warrant, doe.= ""mostnot give those assurances. If the Minister In other is satisfied that preference on the item? mentioned in my amendment is adequately in as favourable a safeguarded, he will have no hesitation in accepting the amendment. to If he refuses to accept the amendment, we are justified in assuming that Empire preference is doomed under this bill. Consequently the adoption of my amendment would give honourable members, including those .representing constituencies in which sugar, dairy products, flour, meat, base metals, &c, are produced, the opportunity of declaring for cr against the system of Empire preferences, until a system better than that contemplated, in the present bill is devised.

It was not even mentioned. No country brought up the subject of sugar in the Geneva conference. L-t remains as it was before those negotiations were completed. I trust that I have made the position clear to the right honourable gentleman. The other aspect of the matter that I wish to make perfectly clear is that under the Havana charter the sugar industry is adequately protected. The charter makes provision for international commodity agreements. Within the terms of that agreement, the sugar industry of Australia can be protected just as effectively as it has been protected up to now. try was protected under the agreement with New Zealand? able gentleman that the Government that his party supported gave away a preference of 2s. a quarter that we enjoyed in the United Kingdom market. that often enough he will believe that it is true. are protected in the same way. Any arrangement that we have had up to the present time in relation to butter and cheese, and any organization for the protection of those commodities that we have in Australia would be covered by the commodity agreements. That also applies to a great many other items that have been mentioned. The Government will not accept the amendment moved by the right honourable gentleman. support the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), to what I consider to be the most important clause in the bill. I warn the Government that I do not believe the Australian Labour party knows where the Minister is taking it. This charter is a bureaucratic dream, and by its acceptance we are threatening the policy of protection in Australia and destroying the tried and trusted preferential trade system operating in the British Empire, which is not a matter of sentiment, but of common sense, although sentiment, runs through it. It is a wise bargain and an agreement of the head as well as of the heart. The amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party is specific, whereas the amendment that 1 moved was of a general nature. To show what items should be protected, I shall inform the committee what happened during the first five years of the operation of the Ottawa Agreement. In that period exports to the United Kingdom rose from 36 per cent, to 49 per cent, of our total exports. Exports to the United Kingdom increased as follows:-Barley by 270 per cent., cheese by 107 per cent., eggs by 167 per cent., apples by 30$ per cent., pears by 106^ per cent., butter by 39^ per cent., leather by 126 per cent, and canned fruit by 80J per cent. There was a general increase to 90 per cent, in the export to Great Britain of everything that we exported except wool and wheat, of which there were other large buyers, although Great Britain bought most of our export surplus of wool and wheat also. All those preferences are ultimately to go by the board. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has signed away our economic sovereignty. He has accepted this shadow for the very substantial substance that we have had under Imperial preference. Winding up the second-reading debate, the Minister, who not surprisingly, will not accept the amendment, asked what we had done in 1937. We have nevor opposed the principles of this trade treaty. We realize that trade treaties cannot remain static and modifications have to be made from time to time.

I should like to know how we can hcpe to compete with those countries if we do not foster and protect our industries. The Minister asked what threatened our industries. He mentioned the names of half a dozen people who approved of the agreement. One can always get someone to agree with something. Doubtless the people whose names he quoted are theorists and free-traders who do not understand that an economic balance must be maintained and that industries must be fostered. One must not go to extremes in tariff matters. Tariffs must not be too high or too low. The purpose of our tariffs has been dual-the protection of industries and the raising of revenue. Within the last few days one deputation has been to Canberra to complain that a great Australian industry employing about 10,000 workers is already threatened. Order!

By the time action was taken, the industry would be dead or dying. A post-mortem, not a tariff inquiry, would be conducted. That is what we are walking into. The Minister boasts that we have not suffered yet and that the American duty on wool has been reduced. Some one has pulled the wool over his eyes. I challenge him to point to f l ' s worth of extra business that we have done as the result of the months that he and his entourage have spent with their international confreres in bringing this organization into being.

Because of Imperial preference Great Britain imported 26,000,000 cwt. of Empire sugar in 1937 compared with only 5,000,000 cwt. in 1920 r u d 536,000 -cwt. of Empire raisins in 1937 compared with only 147,000 cwt. in 1920. Imperial preference is misunderstood by foreign nations. They are jealous of its success. They believe that it is selfish and exclusive, whereas it is nothing of the kind. It sets an example of co-operation to the rest of the world. The Age newspaper, which is not given to extravagant statements but does believe in the development of the Empire, in a leading article on the 15th June, statedTwo clauses in the present draft agreement relating to the British part of the European recovery plan threaten the economic interests of Australia and all other Dominions. A curious absence of mutuality is to be detected in the demand that, whenever America wishes, Britain shall discuss lowering of Empire preference and the possible devaluation of the pound. Article 17 of the Charter, which is headed ""Reduction of Tariffs and the Elimination of Preferences"", negotiations for the reduction of tariffs and the elimination of preferences. The Empire Producer, for September-October, 1948, written to the Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) by the Dried Fruits Preference Committee in Australia:We express our regret that it was found necessary to agree to a reduction of the existing rates of preference and in some cases the total elimination of preferences, in the negotiations conducted at Geneva in 1948. We regard adequate Empire Preferences as absolutely essential to the stability of the Dried Fruits Industry in this country. Other Empire Preferences. Australia settled hundreds of returned soldiers in the Industry following World War I., and it is now planning further soldier settlement following World War IT. Production has now reached a total of 100,000 tons per aunuin. Mr White. The committee refers to the possibility of the Californian dried f r u it s industry capturing the English market from Aus-. tralia. It may be enlightening to honourable members if I tell them that the dried f r u it s industry, which is mainly concentrated in the electorate of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) , in which the Australian Government and the Victorian Government has invested millions of pounds and whose annual production is worth £6,000,000, is so well organized that it has never suffered a depression. That industry is now to be placed in jeopardy by people who place international beliefs before national obligations. I direct the attention of honourable members to Articles 16 and 17. Under the heading "" General Most favoured nation Treatment"", Article 16 statesThis article contains a statement of unconditional most-favoured nation treatment and prescribes all forms of discrimination. To .this general rule there is a number of exceptions. . . . Yes, there are exceptions. The United States of America gives preference to its island possessions in the Pacifici n respect of copra. It gives preference to the commodities of Cuba and the Philippines. Yet Empire preferences are to be whittled away. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera that the United States of America and Russia are compact land masses and that each can trade freely within its own borders. It is not underprovides for stood that an Empire spread throughout the world is also entitled to something approximating a customs union. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr. published the following letter Beazley), who is usually well informed, showed appalling ignorance about the Ottawa Agreement. He was even ignorant of the date on which it came into operation. Then he said that it had been supported by Lord Beaverbrook. Nothing of the k in d ! Lord Beaverbrook believed in free trade between Empire countries for Fremantle did not say that Lord Beaverbrook had supported the Ottawa Agreement.

Article 17, under the heading ""Reduction of Tariffs and the Elimination of Preferences "", statesEach member undertakes to enter into negotiations directed to the reduction of tariffs (and other ^hnrgps on imports and exports) and the elimination of preferences on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis. . . . That is an obligation that we should not be obliged to enter into.

His loyalties are wrong. We have three loyalties, the first to Australia and its development; the second to that league of nations, the British Empire; and the third is an internationality based on a desire to make the nations more united and the world a better place to live in. It must not be forgotten, however, that charity begins at home and that internationalism that menaces u? and our kin is to be deprecated. honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) lives so far back in the past that he is unable to accept the changing views of the world. He will not admit the mistakes of the policy that he has espoused. He said that he could not subscribe to the free trade policy that I and, presumably, the Government advocated. I point out to honourable members and the country generally that neither free trade nor protection has been the subject of this debate. The debate has been confined to the Hlavana charter and to the Geneva agreement. At both the Geneva and the Havana conferences there emerged the desire of all the peoples of the world to get together and to assess tariffpolicies of nations individually and collectively on the effect that they have on other nations or groups of nations. The Ottawa Agreement, as the honourable member said, appears to confer on the participating nations some major benefits, but, as I have pointed out previously, when the Ottawa Agreement was signed, the world was in the throes of the worse depression it has ever experienced. It had tc rise from that depression or sink into despair, revolution and ruin. A ll the nations recognize that bilateral trade agreements bring in their train other bilateral and that in the final aualysi they result in a contraction of the world's markets. The agreement which was formulated at Ottawa and which was given effect by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, the late Sir Henry Gullett, and the then Prime Minister, now Lord Bruce, had exactly that effect. At a time when the trade of the world had contracted sharply the nations of the British Empire sought to preserve as far as possible the markets in British countries for members of the British Empire. The Ottawa Agreement was formulated and signed; but it inevitably brought in its train retaliatory measures by other countries.

That is what happened following the signing of the Ottawa Agreement. Shortly afterwards a world economic conference was held. The nations looked to that conference to find a solution of the disturbing problem of world trade. That conference failed to find a way out of the morass because the United States of America, the greatest industrial nation in the world, refused to participate in it. The conference was incapable of producing any worthwhile solution of the shocking difficulties that confronted humanity at that time merely because one major country stood out and refused to participate in it. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) referred to the alarm expressed by representatives of the chambers of commerce and manufactures about the effect of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs on Australian industries. I propose to read a short extract from a letter written by Mr Oscar Seppelt, president of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, regarding the Ottawa Agreement and its effect upon Australia's manufacturing industries. The letter which was written members of the International Trade on the loth November, 1932 was addressed Organization. to the then Prime Minister, the late Mr Lyons. The extract readsSpeaking now for the manufacturers of membership of the organization, it is Australia generally, we can frankly say that had any indication been given that Messrs. also true that all the major trading Bruce and Gullett were going to Ottawa with countries in an international sense have practically an unlimited fiscal charter, this already accepted or are proposing to organization at the outset would have pressed accept membership of it.

Mr Seppelt went on to indicate that in impossible at the moment to lay his view the concessions made at Ottawa down hard and fast rules to be followed were not only damaging to, but in any circumstances. destructive of, Australian industry. I factor in the success of the International Mr Burke. quote his remarks to show that when any change in trade relations are contemplated Australian manufacturers fear It is apparent that that their interests may be threatened. That is true of some Australian manufacturers to-day in relation to this new agreement. We must look at the wider implications of this world organization and at prevailing world economy in order to see the agreement in its proper perspective. At present, because there is ample purchasing power among the peoples of the world, we have no difficultyN in selling all the goods we can produce; but that state of affairs may not always continue. Should there be a recession, with a consequent fall in employment in overseas countries and a resulting diminution of purchasing power an immediate contraction of world trade will follow. Foolish as it may be in essence, the trend in all countries will be towards stemming importations. Every country will seek to prohibit the importation of goods and automatically cut off its exports to its former customers. Such a policy, stupid in the extreme as it may be, will be inevitably followed. It is a tragedy that the science of economics is so widely misunderstood.

If that is not of the essence of common sense, and a desperate need in the world to-day, I do not know what is. For how much longer can the people of Australia be deceived into believing that we can with impunity impose tariff duties on the goods of other countries? we attempt to do so those countries will accord most-favoured nation treatment to another country, to our disadvantage. I merely say-and I do not speak as a spokesman for the Government on this matter-that unless the nations get together in this way and look broadly at such proposed tariff agreements they will merely deceive themselves. The simple facts of everyday life prove to us that if we seek to lessen our trade with other countries because those countries will not buy goods in sufficient volume from us, our action must lead inevitably to a contraction of the already diminished field of world trade. what the honourable member refers when he says "" suicide "". Certainly a further contraction of world trade would be suicidal."" Before any trade agreements are made with other countries their impact upon the ref t of the world should be carefully analysed in the light not only of existing circumstances but also of possible future trends.

Nothing in this Act shall in any way restrict the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia from making reciprocal preferential trade and tariff arrangements with the United Kingdom and other countries, territories, or dependencies within the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations with respect to products of primary industries, including the following:(a) sugar, ( l ) butter and cheese, (c) bacon and ham, (d) fresh and canned f r u it and dried fruits, (e) eggs, We cannot do so.

I support the amendment because it provides a definite safeguard which will ensure that the primary industries of Australia which are specifically mentioned are not to he adversely affected by the operation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and because it will give to the Government power to make certain tariff arrangements with the United Kingdom for the benefit of such primary industries. That is a definite and positive safeguard of a character which is not contained in the agreement. The Minister has said that he cannot accept the amendment, first, because there is already protection of Australian primary industries, and secondly, because the amendment is contrary to the provisions of the Charter. That is a most amazing and disturbing statement.

In his reply the Minister also dealt with that commodity, and said that the preference enjoyed by the Australian sugar industry was not in any way jeopardized by the discussions at Havana, because no mention was made of the preference now being received by the Australian sugar industry on the British That is correct, but it does not mean that there is no possibility of an alteration in the future. The fact that, so far, the sugar industry has not been attacked' does not necessarily mean that it will remain free from attack. Thus, the statement of the Minister will not afford much consolation to those in the sugar industry who believe that the charter does, in fact, afford an opportunity for an attack upon the industry. In my second-reading speech, I pointed out that the reason why the sugar industry was not discussed at Havana was that the policy of the United States of America on sugar was on all fours with that of Britain. The Minister cited the International Sugar Agreement as a further protection for the Australian sugar industry. Let us see what measure of protection that agreement affords. It was entered into in 1937, and under it the Australian industry was allotted a quota of 400,000 tons in the world's markets upon which Australia's sugar is sold at world parity prices. That provided security in regard to quantity, but only under Empire preference was any security afforded in regard to price. The agreement remained in operation until the outbreak of war when, because of the complete disruption of the industry, it became inoperative. The sugar exporting countries, realizing the importance of the agreement, have continued it from year to year by protocol. Article3 of the most recent protocol states1. The governments signatory of the present Protocol recognize that revision of the Agreement is necessary and should be undertaken as soon as tie time appears opportune. Discustsiou of any such revision should take the existing Agreement as the starting point. 2. In the event of an agreement based on such revision coming into force before 31st August, 1949, the present Protocol shall thereupon terminate. Thus, in the event of another interneeded to be convinced cf its importance, uational sugar agreement being reached, the speech of the honourable member for Mr Davidson. the present one w ill immediately terminate. Finally, the protocol provides3. Tor the purposes of such revision due account shall be taken of any general principles of commodity policy embodied in any agreements which may be concluded under the auspices of the United Nations. In other words, the position now is thai the provisions of any new international market. sugar agreement which will he entered into' when conditions become normal, will depend largely upon the provisions of the International Trade Agreement. All the articles of the International Trade Agreement which will operate against Australia's primary industries will have a bearing upon the terms of a new international sugar agreement. Thus, the present International Sugar Agreement is a weak reed upon which to lean. In the discussions on a new international sugar agreement we may expect a large sugar exporting country such as Cuba to come out strongly in a claim for a greater share of the world's markets. Fortunately for the world, Cuba was able to increase its export of sugar during the war. But Australia had to reduce its exports because the urea in which sugar is produced in this country was affected by war conditions. Therefore, when the time comes to negotiate a new agreement, Cuba will be in a favorable position to argue for an increased quota, but the position of Australia will not be so fortunate. Australia will find it very difficult to get. an increased quota or, perhaps, even to hold its present quota. There has been a move in Great Britain to obtain a considerably greater quantity of sugar from Australia. We in the industry here wish to export more sugar to Great Britain, but there are material difficulties in the way, such as the providing of extra milling power and of the developing of more sugar-producing lands. Before anything can be done to overcome those difficulties it is necessary that the industry should be assured of greater overseas markets, and a stable price over a period of ten years. Only such assurances would justify the necessary capital expenditure. port the amendment. If the committee",94,Pairs
330,Mr Mcewen (Indi) [10.55],"I supCapricornia ( Mr Davidson), who is an expert on the sugar industry, should have convinced those honourable members who come here to be convinced. That, of course, applies only to honourable members on this side of the committee. At least, we can record the desire of the Opposition parties to protect the primary industries, the products of which are enumerated in the amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to have written into the statute an assurance that nothing in the Geneva Agreement shall in any way restrict an Australian Government from making reciprocal preference tariff and trade agreements with the United Kingdom. That is the historic policy of Australia which pulled us out of the depression when foreign countries would not take our products. The British Government which entered into the . Ottawa Agreement reversed a policy of 100 years' standing when, -in the interests of the Dominions, it imposed import duties on foodstuffs. I cannot understand the blindness of any Australian Government which sets itself against a policy of Empire reciprocal trade, the advantages of which are so obvious. Every one knows that we sell most of our sugar, butter, cheese, bacon, ham, and meat on the United Kingdom market, and on the markets of other dominions. If the price of primary products should fall, we know that, under the system of Empire preference, there will be a market within the British Commonwealth for virtually all that we can produce of the items enumerated in the amendment. We know from bitter experience that foreign countries will not continue to buy from us for one day longer than it suits them to do so. If they can buy more cheaply from our competitors, they will abandon us. In spite of this knowledge, we are now asked to ratify this device which emanated from the minds of theoretical planners, not from the minds of practical people who were in positions of responsibility during the depression. The plan comes from the minds of two of Australia's most notorious planners, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) and the principal Australian official delegate to the Geneva and Havana conferences, Dr. Coombs. It is all very well for those impracticable planners to sit down with a pencil and a piece of paper to produce a scheme, but things are not likely to work out as they expect. I cannot recall that anything with which Dr. Coombs has been associated has been such an outstanding success as to induce me to accept his advice regarding an international trade agreement. The truth is that nearly all of Australia's primary industries were sold down the river for dollars, and Empire preference has been sacrificed. The Minister stated by interjection that if the amendment were accepted the effect might be to take us outside the ambit of the International Trade Agreement. And then, what terrible things might happen! The threat is held out that the Americans might increase their tariff upon Australian wool. If there is one Australian primary industry that could withstand that threat to-day, it is the wool industry. I speak as awool-grower myself. Never before in the history of Australia has the wool industry been so prosperous and never before has there been less necessity for it to receive the benefit of a protective tariff, yet it is the one industry that is cited by the Government as being likely to benefit from these arrangements. Apparently, we are to risk the loss of Imperial preference upon our exports of dairy products, meat, poultry products and dried and canned fruits so that we may sell more wool to America and obtain more dollars with which to buy American cement-making plant and bottle-labellingmachinery. That is why vital Australian primary industries are being sold down the drain. I do not belittle the importance of the wool industry to Australia.. It is our greatest primary industry, but it is not one which will lead to an expansion of our rural population. For that,, we must look to the pig, meat, sugar,, butter, canned and dried fruits and dairying industries. We shall not implement the Government's immigration plans, develop irrigation schemes, and achieve decentralization, closer settlement and other admirable national objectives by stimulating the wool industry. We shall do those things by stimulating the industries that were enumerated by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). It is time that sanity was hrought to bear upon these problems. We should be allowed to escape from the schemes of the theoretical planners. I have had enough of the planners. In addition to being planned out of our opportunities for trade by Dr. Coombs, we are now apparently to have a financial system that is planned by him. The policy of reciprocal Empire tariffs extricated us from the difficulties in which we found ourselves in the 1930's. There is no doubt that the policy that was first devised in Ottawa and which was extended by a series of bilateral trade agreements was a successful one. The policy that is now proposed, however, is, at the very best, an experiment. It is suggested that from it wider world trade will emerge. We know where we can sell our canned peaches, sugar, pig meats, and poultry and dairy products. The United Kingdom can take all of those commodities from us. We do not need a scheme of wider world trade to enable us to market those products. What would he disastrous to us would be a policy which would debar the United Kingdom from extending preferential treatment to our goods and compel us to sell them in that country in competition with other countries which, McEwen) has, as usual, worked himself for various reasons, have some advantage over us. We sell at least half of our total production of canned fruits in the United Kingdom, and it is sold in competition with 10 per cent, of the annual production of canned fruits of the United States of America. The Americans could dump that 10 per cent, and depress the price Avhenever they liked. If we did not have the benefit of reciprocal Empire tariff arrangements they could ruin our canned fruit industry in one season. Our dried fruits are sold in the United Kingdom in competition with dried fruits from Greece, Syria and Turkey. The people of those countries have low standards of living. that the Australian dried fruits industry could compete on equal terms with the dried fruit Industries of the Mediterranean countries? vernment helieve that without protection of Empire preference, we can sell our meat in the United Kingdom in competition with meat from the Argentina? Does the Government believe that, without this protection, the Australian sugar industry could dispose of its products? No honourable member opposite who represents tin area which is sustained by any of the industries to which I have referred has attempted to justify these international agreements. If this policy had been formulated at conferences of the Labour party and. at caucus meetings, and if . it were sponsored by the honourable member for the Riverina( Mr Langtry), the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams) and other honourable members opposite who represent primary-producing areas, I should believe that there wa3 something behind it. It is, however, a policy that has emerged from the minds of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, Dr. Coombs, and other planners. We cannot a:fford to experiment along these lines.

The preference in regard to dried fruits was reduced by only 20 per cent, and, in some instances, by less than that. The honourable gentleman endeavoured to lead the committee to believe that those commodities will not be the subject of a preferential tariff. That demonstrates his complete dishonesty, and is an indication of the humbug which he submits to the committee. He attacked a prominent member of the Australian delegation to the Geneva Conference, That gentleman and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction were regarded as two of the ablest men at the conference. The honourable gentleman attacked them because they were what he described as planners. One of the planks of the platform of the Australian Country party is the planning of the sale of Drimary products. Honourable gentlemen opposite call it orderly marketing. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is an attempt to ensure the orderly marketing of primary and other products on the world's markets. The principle on which it is based is one that is written into the constitution of the Australian Country party. It represents an attempt to bring order into the present chaotic position. If one country imposes a tariff, other countries are compelled to take similar action because they are faced with adverse trade 'balances-,' and the process continues until the channels of trade are blocked and a depression occurs. The honourable gentleman"" asked what advantage the agreement would be to the wool industry. It is true that it will not be of great advantage while the price of wool is high, but it will be of considerable benefit to the Australian wool producers when the price of wool begins to fall, and I do not think that anyone is optimistic enough to believe that wool prices will remain indefinitely at their present level. The operation of the agreement will ensure more extensive markets for wool and other primary products. There will be greater competition amongst buyers andj in consequence more satisfactory prices for producers. The honourable gentleman has said that the General Agreement on Tariffs an Trade wool industry does not assist in the closer settlement of the rural areas of Australia but that the dried fruit industry does do so. He has a few dried fruit-growers in his electorate, and therefore we get back to petty politics. The wool industry brings more money into Australia than does any other Australian industry. Will any honourable gentleman deny that the purchasing power of that money does not assist us in our population problem? If has often been said that Australia lives on the sheep's back. The sheep's back has brought vast amounts of purchasing power to the people of Australia.' If we took away the Australian wool industry, where should we be ? would cut up the sheep stations and take the industry away from its present owners.

We were told that as the result of satisfactory trade arrangements made with the Government of the United States of America, other primary industries would derive advantages. I shall examine the so-called advantages which our great wool industry has derived from trade with America since the arrangement was made with that country nearly two years ago. A few days ago, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) asked the Ministerf o r .Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) the following questions:Was there a decline in (a) the number of bales and (b) the values f.o.b. (Australian currency) in the export of Australian greasy wool in the United States of America between the years 1040-47 and 1947-48; if so, what were the amounts and values of such decline in each case ? The Minister's reply revealed that exports of wool had declined by 623,013 bales, and that the decline in value was £A.8,344,547. Where, then, is the advantage which is said to have accrued to the Australian wool industry by concessions obtained at Geneva and Havana? In the years 1946-47 and 1947-48, our trade in wool with Soviet Russiai n creased by 42,096 bales and the increase of value was £A.2,S52,130. Isi t any wonder that the honourable member for In d i has stated that Australian primary industries have been sold down the drain ? Let us have a look at the general overall economic position as it affects the United States of America as the result of the Geneva agreement, and, consequently, the Havana charter and the agreement which the Parliament is now asked to r a t if y. The Treasurer informed me in reply to a question that in 1946-47 our deficit with the United States of America amounted to £A.35,100,000 and that that deficit had increased for the year 1947-48 to £A.73,900,000.

As I indicated in my second-reading speech, it would appear that the T a r i ff Board is being sidestepped when the degree of protection required in a particular instance is being determined for the purposes of the trade agreements now before the Parliament. This Government relies upon departmental officers who are under the general control of the Minister. No public hearing is held and no evidences taken in public fro m in terested parties by a body such as the Tariff Board which, obviously, in such matters is more skillfu l and more likely to be impartial than are departmental officers.

It is obvious, therefore, that the United States of America believes that its industrial structure, both primary and secondary, must be safeguarded against the unforeseen impact of international negotiations entered into hastily by departmenal officers. It is dangerous for the Government to rely solely upon the reports of departmental officers in the handling of negotiations on trade matters. The United States of America has set an admirable example in providing safeguards against such a danger. Departmental officers, however conscientious they may be, are apt to furnish more or less one-sided reports because they have not the benefit of hearing the representations of opposing interests such as would be the case were an open hearing conducted by the Tariff Board on such matters. The official who reports to the Minister on these matters remains anonymous. H is identity cannot be ascertained by interested parties or by the general public. A departmental officer has no opportunity to test such evidence as may be put before him, nor have parties who may be vitally interested, any real opportunity to combat or even comment on the case put to the Minister. The only real opportunity presented in such cases to interested parties to state their case or to have a decision reviewed is for them to request an interview with the Minister concerned. Although such interviews are usually generously granted, obviously they cannot be of such duration as to enable the information to be placed adequately before the Minister, so that a proper decision can be made. A properly constituted tariff board can do very much more I point out in that regard. I say that in the circumstances, and particularly in view of the the biggest contributor under attitude that the United States of America has found it necessary to adopt to safeguard both its primary and secondary industries and the amendment should be accepted. In the interests of a better presentation and better consideration of the general interests of the economy of the country, an investigation such as I have suggested should, be made before agreements of an international or trading nature are entered into. strongly support the amendment. If the Government will not accept it, obviously it will have abdicated to international control. Section 15 (1.) (d) of the Tariff Board Act 1921 provides that the Minister shall refer to the board for inquiry and reportThe necessity for new, increased, or reduced was stressed, and the section dealing with the duties, and the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties; Concessions that have been made in Geneva have been fcrced through this House by weight of numbers by the Government. I u my opinion masses of paper and reports have been issued without proper consideration and study. If this procedure is allowed to continue, the Tariff Board will be put into the discard. The Government's policy will amount to economic disarmament if we accept the mcst-favoured nation clause. Any consideration that the United States of America may give to Japan when that country joins the organization will have to be given by us, thus menacing our own industries. The Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) said a moment ago that this is a new system as previously^ because when our tariffs are raised, other countries will retaliate by raising their tariffs. How simpleminded the Minister must be. These outside considerations are always taken into account in Australia by the Tariff Board and the Government. Only the lowest duties that will do what is required are applied. The Tariff Board is to go, and some haphazard rate decided upon by people on the other side of the world will be our rates in future. There will soon be penetration by Japanese goods. instance the details of which, although I cannot mention them here, are known to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice). management of an industry, which had made representations to the effect that because of the introduction of the 40-hour week its production costs had increased, and therefore it needed additional protection, was advised to make an application to the Tariff Board. That right will now be denied them. The Minister who went to Geneva was proud of the fact that he had something to say about full employment. Certain British comment on the Geneva report is interesting. Mr Amery has written:-'The main scheme with its ambitious design for controlling world trade is one gigantic and preposterous piece of make-believe. . . . Of Australia's participation at Geneva he saidThe importance of stability of employment subject was somewhat expanded. But it still amounted to no more than to say that it was every country's duty to keep the people f u l ly employed. . . . We are now surrendering to a somewhat, nebulous organization that will begin operations in Geneva shortly the right we at present have of making our own tariffs by a proper inquiry open to the public. The United States of America would not consent to such a provision and Congress passed the Trade Agreements Extensions Act of 1948, which lays down that before entering into negotiations concerning any proposed foreign trade agreement, the President shall furnish the United States Tariff Commission with a list of all articles to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions In the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), it is suggested that we do what is done in America, which is to provide that before the Minister or any officialseven though they may act with the best intent-ca n make changes, the Tariff Board shall ibe asked to report. In the United States of America the Tariff Commission will hold public hearings, take evidence from all interested parties, and report its findings to the President. I know of an With constantly changing wages and conditions, there must be tariff changes from time to time. Who could be better qualified to handle that matter than the Tariff The Board? I point out that this year our adverse trade balance with the United States of America will be the biggest on record and will amount to approximately £70,000,000. This matter is above party issues. The amendment should be considered on its merits. If a division is taken I hope that at least some Government",101,Pairs

Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.47] I cannot accept the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). It gives form to the same matter which was raised by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) in his speech during the second-reading debate. When I dealt with it then I said that it would be quite impossible to have possible reductions in our tariff or preferences discussed before negotiations began with other countries. I point out that in 1931) the Government of which the honourable member was a member followed the procedure now proposed in its negotiations for trade agreements with Belgium, France and Czechoslovakia. the intermediate tariff. matters were not discussed by, and did not come before the Tariff Board, we did invite the manufacturers, and the primary producers throughout' Australia, to send to the Government any observations or criticisms that they had to offer on the demands that were heing made on us. I use the word "" demands "" because that was the language that was used in notes that were exchanged . on these matters before the negotiations actually began. The manufacturers and primary producers were also invited to send in any objections for reductions in tariffs or preferences that were being made by other countries. In addition, the chairman of the Tariff Board accompanied the delegation to Geneva, and the members of the delegation had the benefit of his advice. I repeat that it is not possible, when entering into negotiations by a process of bargaining between different countries, to have the issues involved discussed in public before the negotiations begin. Although the United States of America has included in its legislation a provision similar to the amendment, President Truman has announced since his re-election that he is going to introduce a new reciprocal trade measure. This provision was put into the American act against the wishes of President Truman, and there is every indication that it will be removed very shortly.

The owner has been in touch with people in Australia who wish to use the ship for trade, particularly between Tasmania and Empire preferential trade. I the mainland. But the entry of the ship is subject to certain disabilities. First, customs duty amounting to about £20,000 would have to be paid on it, in addition to which it would be subject to sales tax and the cost of a licence to trade on the Australian coast. The ship could be used here with great advantage because we are short of ships, particularly for the coastal trade. I have heard honourable members who represent constituencies in Tasmania and Queensland complain on many occasions about the great difficulties experienced in obtaining the shipment of goods between Tasmania and the mainland and along the Queensland coast. It has been proposed that the ship shall be used primarily for the timber trade between Tasmania and the mainland. I thought that in the circumstances permission would readily he given by thp Government for the entry of the ship under customs by-law, thus exempting its owner from the payment ment of customs duty on it .

Streams of requests for shipping accommodation for such goods continually flow to honourable members representing Tasmanian electorates. To say that the ship is not needed for the Tasmanian service does not make sense. This question should be re-opened. The Englishman who owns the vessel has offered to bring the vessel to Australia even if he is not granted any times. The Minister for Shipping and concessions by the Customs authorities. He would be put to great expense in doing so. Tasmania is sadly in need of that class of ship. The residents of Dlverstone, in the north-western area of the State, have repeatedly asked the Australian Shipping Board to direct a vessel to that port. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) knows as much as I do about that subject. We have both discussed it with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel. A ship with only small displacement would be ideal for TJlverstone. A vessel trades between Melbourne and that port' at present, but a service conducted by this English vessel would be of inestimable value to the town. The port of Stanley also could use a ship of light tonnage. Therefore, the Minister's statement that such a ship could not be used in the Tasmanian service is against all the facts as they are known to Tasmanian members of this Parliament. The vessel could be used to carry shipments of timber and cement to South Australia and Victoria, and cargoes from the mainland to Tasmania. Furthermore, new Tasmanian industries are producing goods in quantities which are imposing increasing demands upon shipping agencies. I support the case put before the Government by the honourable member for Flinders and ask that the request of the owner of this ship be re-examined in the light of the facts which the honourable member has stated. Dame ENID [12.12 a.m.] I cannot allow this quate seems to me to be entirely matter to pass without comment, parin opposition to the facts, and I ticularly in view of the fact that the warmly support the representations ports of TJlverstone and Stanley, menmade by the honourable member for tioned by the honourable member for WilFlinders. I appeal to the Governmot ( Mr Duthie), are within my elecment to review the situation, and I do torate and therefore, I assume, are my so with some confidence because I believe particular care. What the honourable that it is likely to accept the facts member for Wilmot has said is perfectly presented to it by honourable members true. For two reasons these two ports present a special opportunity for the use of a vessel of the kind that was mentioned by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan). The first reason is that, particularly at TJlverstone, only small ships can be accommodated. The second reason is that there is an ample supply of labour available at both ports at all Fuel (Senator Ashley) stated in the letter quoted by the honourable member for Flinders that one of the real difficulties of the Tasmanian trade was that of clearing sufficient timber. That was a rather ambiguous phrase. It might have meant the clearance of timber from the forests, or it might have meant the clearance of timber from the wharfs. I assume that it means the clearance from the wharfs, because there is plenty of sawn timber in Tasmania at present awaiting shipment. There is no labour difficulty at TJlverstone or Stanley. Ships arrive infrequently, and gangs are always waiting. The rejection of this proposition, with Tasmania in its present situation, seems to me to be a serious affront to the people of Tasmania. To say that that State is not short of shipping is utterly wrong, as the honourable member for Wilmot has said. RecentlyI received a letter from the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, who referred to the difficulty of transporting adequate stocks of sugar to Tasmania. The company gives priority to Tasmanian consignments in an endeavour to build up reserves there because the island is entirely dependent upon shipping. He mentioned particularly the poor shipping service to Hobart. served, too. Dame ENID LYONS -Yes. It could use a small ship.

The comments on this subject by my colleagues from Tasmania are close to my heart because I , too, am not unmindful of the shipping difficulties with which that State is affected. The letter written by the Minister for Shipping and Fuel did not seem to answer the just claims made on behalf of Tasmania. I assure the honourable members that the matter will be re-examined. I shall ascertain what additional reasons there are for the Minister's decision, apart from those stated in the letter, and will seek a further explanation of what at the moment appear to be discrepancies.

It w ill be noted that only two doctors have actually been entered to date, the remainder mentioned are still at liberty to withdraw. The Official Secretary at the same tin\e advised that five other applicants were in course of interview and that there were 70 other applicants. Experience has also shown that many applicants never pursue their inquiries further, hence the number who join is always much lower than the number of those applying. It is understood that eligibility to join the Royal Australian Navy is dependent upon release by the Central Medical War Committee. In order that there should be as few obstacles as possible in the way of doctors in the United Kingdom entering the Royal Australian Navy, the Government has recently approved of free first-class passages to Australia for the wives and families of successful applicants. Newly entered doctors undergo courses of instruction in the United Kingdom of six to ten weeks in duration. On the average it will be approximately three months, depending on availability of passages, from the time of entry telephone exchange services are outstanding of a doctor to arrival in Australia. As these doctors become available those now serving and desirous of discharge will be released iu their turn. the honourable member for Flinders( Mr inducing people to have telephone services inRyan) asked whether the Commonwealth Bank was conducting a house to house canvass in the course of seeking contributions to Commonwealth loans, how many canvassers wore employed, and from where the names of potential investors were obtained.

It was instituted in the war years when it M*as necessary to conduct canvassing campaigns to raise funds for war purposes and the system has been continued in the post-war years because of large conversion operations which have had to be arranged in Australia during the last few years.

(c) Will he find out how many persons were employed by the Postmaster-General's Department, each State, each year, canvassing the general public in an effort to get them to install telephones ? The Postmaster-General has supplied the following information:(a) Approximately 118,000 applications foi throughout the Commonwealth at present. The arrears have accumulated, due to conditions arising from the war. the acute shortage of essential materials for the provision of the necessary exchange buildings, line plant and telephone equipment, and an unprecedented demand for telephone facilities.
