0,"Bous E Of Eeptesentattbes. Friday, A.m., And Read Prayers. Have To Announce With Sincere Regret The Death Of Mr Copeland, The Late Agent","General for New South Wales. Although it may appear invidious to single out for notice the death of a gentleman who was an officer of a State, and not of the Commonwealth, it will not seem so when I add that during the last three years he, together with the other Agents-General, in many important matters acted gratuitously on behalf of the Commonwealth. Perhaps he, more than any other of the Agents-General, had thrust upon him a very great deal of Commonwealth work, and he performed it with the whole-souled devotion to duty which always characterized him. I had a long acquaintance with Mr Copeland as a member of the New South Wales Parliament. He was in the public life of that Colony for very many years prior to Federation, and I am sure that I shall have the sympathy of every member of the House who knew him when deserved the appreciation and good-will of the Prime Ministeri f he has yet made in the people, or more genuinely earned it, than quiries in regard to the matter which was he did. chap. behalf of the Government to show our sinnight, it has now been thought advisable to cere regret at his death, and our sympathy let such action stand over.

There was no truer friend, no better man, no man whom I knew, or with whom I came into contact, who had greater natural abilities, or gave those abilities more freely to the service of his State, and afterwards of the Commonwealth. During the many years of public life in which he held high positions in New South Wales, he was respected and admired for his outspokenness, his honesty, his great integrity, and as a man who studied with all his will the interests of the people of Australia. He was not only a representative of the State of New South Wales, but from the earliest time. I knew him, a truly representative Australian. I think that we have lost a very great man in losing one of such high qualities as Mr Copeland possessed. I wish to know from brought under his notice respecting promotions in the Defence Force.

Does that mean that the Order in Council confirming it has passed ? action of the Government was at least precipitate, because its effect is that the classification is now law. DoI understand that the forthcoming Estimates will be based upon it? that the classification would not be in print until Tuesday last. ters were placed in an embarrassing position because of the late period of the session at which the classification is published ; but, now that it has become law, I wish to know whether the Prime Minister considers it necessary to afford the House an opportunity to discuss it, other than that? which will be afforded, either generally or in detail, when the Estimates are submitted. No more important executive act' has been done by the Commonwealth Government than the passing of the Order in Council ratifying this classification. It is important, not only because it affects the personal interests of at least 12,000 persons, but because the whole of the taxpayers are deeply concerned in its financial operation. point it is regarded, the classification is sure to be much criticised in detail. It is based upon a set of principles which the Government by Order in Council have adopted, but which this House has not yet had an opportunity of knowing. We do not know in the least upon what principles the classification is based. I have the greatest confidence in the Public Service Commissioner"". Mr G. B. EDWARDS -I s the honourable and learned member going to debate the whole question? are so little seized of the importance of the question I am putting bate the subject if the .honourable and learned member does so. the subject does not alter the fact that the Standing Orders prohibit any debate when asking a question. I , therefore, request the honourable and learned member for' 1 Ballarat not to offer an opinion upon the matter. trespassing in regard to the rule which governs the asking of questions. of the House. matter should be discussed when we have, had time to read and consider the Public Service Commissioner's report. If there had been an opportunity to do that, I mightnot hesitate about moving the adjournment. I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the very exceptional circumstances to which I have referred, he does not feel it necessary to afford honourable members an opportunity, when they shall have examined the report of the Commissionernot with microscopic scrupulousness, but so as to grasp its broad principles -to discuss it in this Chamber? I do not ask the question because of hostility to the scheme, since I do not know what it is, and have great confidence in its author, whom I believe to be one-of the ablest public men in the Commonwealth. Does not the Prime Minister consider, although the classification is now law, and could not be repealed or revoked except in formal fashion, that the House is entitled, as soon as the. state, of its business will permit, to a special opportunity to discuss this most important scheme ? giving time for the discussion of the scheme, but I do not think that the law by which the Government is bound, which was presumably enacted by Parliament with its eyes open, contemplates the submission of the matter to Parliament, unless the Ministry of the day think that there is some question of policy involved, quite apart from the salary which each individual officer is to receive, a matter which, in my view, is of no' concern to Ministers.

The whole matter depends upon the interpretation placed on that section of the Constitution which states that accruing rights shall continue in respect of all omcers in the Departments transferred from the States to the Commonwealth. which, as a layman, I put forward with the utmost diffidence, is that, so soon as the law of this Parliament is passed-and I think we can say that the classification scheme gives effect to the Public Service Act, passed by us-it overrides all previous decisions arrived at by the States, or tentatively approved by the Commonwealth. That opinion may not prove to be sound. Minister mean to say that the Commonwealth law can reduce salaries which are in effect provided for in the Constitution ? finite opinion upon that point; but my view is that once our own law is passed, it takes the place of the previous State laws which have governed the public servants belonging to the transferred Departments.

Another irrelevant issue was introduced by the honourable member for Darling, who, in the course of a long speech, pointed out that black-lists were issued by the Pastoralists' Union. We were subsequently assured by another honourable member that the same practice was adopted by the Australian Workers' Union. If I thought that the passing of this provision would abolish that system I should support it, but I find that the black-listing of both employers and employees is carried on almost entirely under unionist Workers' Union, of the internal working of which the honourable member for Darling knows so much, is perhaps the best organized body in Australia. shearers' organization in Queensland? organization affiliated with the Australian Workers' Union? exchange of tickets. recognised by the other. I shall content myself by saying that shearers are the best organized workers in the community, and yet we find that the black-list system is most prominently associated with them. It cannot, therefore, be said that if we forced all labourers to join organizations, and gave the Court the right to grant a preference to unionists, the practice would be abolished. It has been stated that shearers are placed on black-lists not merely when they object to the rates of wages offered, but when they refuse to pay the high price charged by pastoralists for rations. If we compelled every man to join an organization, a wider field for the employment of the system would be opened up, and the prominent ofncials of the unions would be placed onblack-lists as before. Feeling, therefore, that the adoption of this provision would not lead to the abolition of the practice, I consider it my duty to oppose it. My chief reason for opposing the clause is that I think that it constitutes an attack upon the rights of free men. ' I object to any man being forced to I believe that every join a union or political association. This clause would, if carried, very seriously affect But the rights of those who have no desire to join certain political organizations. interpretation of the clause. why the Government so strongly support this provision.

Those who remembei the way in which unionist officials who sUp, ported persons other than labour candidates at the last elections were treated by their organizations will recognise that if this clause be carried, and men are forced to join unions, an attempt will be made to control their votes and political sympathies. I believe in industrial unionism, but not in forcing men into political trades unions. At the last general election the honourable conditions. The Australian and learned member for Bendigo was supported by the secretary of the local branch of the Miners' Association, who, in the undoubted exercise of his rights as a free citizen, urged his election on the ground fhat he had done more for the mining industry about the than had any other candidate.

This is one instance of how unions in Victoria attempt to control the votes of their members. fresh nominations for the position every year ? and learned member think that an organization has a right to elect whoever it pleases as its secretary? passed this provision men would be forced to join apparently what are organizations, and on claiming the free exercise of their political rights might be dismissed from any office they held in them. The honourable member for Yarra will remember that at the last elections a Mr became a member of one of these Davis, secretary of the Brick, Tile, and Pottery Employes' Union, supported the candidature of the honourable member for Bourke, who fortunately continues to represent that constituency. member was opposed by a labour candidate, and the Trades Hall.Council sent a communication to the union requesting it to reconsider the selection of Mr Davis as its representative on that body on the ground that he had not supported the pledged labour candidate. I do not know whether Mr Davis was dismissed from his office, but in any case a distinct attempt was made by organized unionism to interfere with the man's political rights. I might also mention another case which occurred in my own electorate. The assistant secretary of a trades union in Geelong was told that if he did not support the pledged labour candidate for Corio at the last elections he would not be re-elected to his office. Other men informed me that if they did not publicly announce their intention to support the candidature of my opponent, who was the secretary of a trades union, it was extremely possible that they would not obtain their customary employment as labourers on the wharves. There was a similar case at Port Melbourne, and in the recent State elections. These practices may be all very well from the point of view of honourable members of the Labour Party, but to adopt this provision would be to force many labourers who do not believe in a bound Labour Party into the ranks of organizations, and to compel them to support labour candidates at the peril of loss, of employment or loss of office. able and learned member favour a Bill tadeprive these men of all political rights ? interjection made by the honourable member for Kennedy indicates that the clause would, if carried, have a tendency to operate in the direction I have mentioned. The honourable member thinks that every man should be able to exercise the franchise, but as one who is in the inner circles of trades unionism, and who is one of the minority which bosses the pledged majority, he wishes to control the votes of the workers. He is willing that every man should have a vote, but desires that the votes of the workers shall be controlled by means of the unionist organizations, which the Government are attempting under this measure to establish. As 'soon as a man organizations he would be looked upon as one who should be ostracised if he failed to vote for a unionist candidate. The Government, by means The honourable of this class of legislation, hope to force men to vote for members of their party. We might as well pass an Act declaring that the Labour Party shall remain in power for twenty years, or until such time as the people, as free citizens, insist upon their right to vote as they please. The rules of these organizations may not provide for the utilization of any portion of their funds for political purposes, but the honourable member for Yarra, who is familiar with the , inner working of trades unionism in Victoria, will be able to confirm my statement that a large number of the unions affiliated with the TradesH a l l have contributed ta the Labour Party's Senate election fund, as well as to the Tom -Mann fund. In legal proceedings with which I was recently associated, I had occasion to examine the balance-sheet of one of the large trades unions of Victoria, and found it had subscribed to Labour candidates' election fund, the Tom Mann fund, and also to the maintenance of the labour newspaper ancl the Labour Party's Senate election campaign. I then took steps to ascertain whether the expenditure of money in this direction was not a violation of the rules, and found that the object of the society was to assist aged and distressed members and members out of work.

On two or three occasions the Prime Minister, in trying to get advocates for certain of his proposals, has charged his opponents with attempting to destroy the Bill. I charge the honourable gentleman and his supporters that if they insist on the retention of this provision, interfering with the freedom of men and of employers, they will be doing their best, perhaps unwittingly, to break down this legislation. They will create a state of things which will become simply intolerable. By overloading the Act with an iniquitous, oppressive provision such as this, they.will do their best to see that conciliation and arbitration shall exist in Australia for only a very short time, because the provision will create a constant, if not rankling, wound in the hearts of those who would otherwise be ready to support the legislation. I think that the Prime Minister will admit that I have supported him very thoroughly on this B ill ; because I believe in the Bill as fair to both employer and worker. I shall support the Government in carrying any provision which will put the measure in a just form. But I strongly object to the insertion of a provision which will interfere with the political or industrial freedom of any man, and which will become so oppressive to a large number of the community that they will be only too glad to rid themselves, at the earliest opportunity, of such a restriction. Sir JOHN ' QUICK (Bendigo) -The honourable and learned member for Corio has objected to this preference clause on the ground that it is an interference with freedom. sound objection it could be aimed at the whole Bill, because it is unquestionably an interference with freedom. justification for the Bill is that, although it interferes with freedom, it does so with the object of securing the greatest good to the greatest number. I speak as a supporter of the principle of arbitration. I am sure that there is a large number of honourable members who believe in the principle. But it cannot be enacted without interfering with freedom. An objection to the clause founded on its interference with freedom is' hardly sufficient, because that goes to the very root of the B ill . Every law passed in the interests of liberty itself must be given effect to by an interference with the freedom of those who I feel that if it is desire to take action to the prejudice of liberty. I supported the second reading of the Bill when it was brought down by the Barton and Deakin Ministries, and I cannot now waver in my allegianceto it . I cannot take any action in reference to the Bill which would place me in a false position, or render me liable to the aspersion that I desire to kill it by a side-wind. It is quite possible that in order to give effect to its main.principles and its machinery we must. have invasions of individual libertyUndoubtedly this clause does amount to an invasion of individual liberty. Its inevitable tendency will be to drive men into statutory organizations. I cannot say that I regard that with indifference or equanimity. But, on the other hand, what is the use of placing a sham on the statute-book? If we want a scheme which will work in a satisfactory manner we must make the necessary provision, even though it may interfere with individual rights and interests. Speaking candidly and frankly, I do not like this clause; I have the utmost repugnance to it ; but at the same time it seems to be what may be called a sort of necessary evil. In order to achieve the main object that we have in view-the accomplishment of some scheme of arbitration and conciliation which will put down industrial warfare, and which will tend to secure industrial peace-w e must make sacrifices, and the question is what is the least sacrifice to which we can submit. WhilstI feel constrained to support this principle, because I think that the B ill would be a sham unless we recognised industrial organization, I shall be prepared to support any proposal which will surround this conI t seems to me that if that were a cession with safeguards, in order to prevent as far as possible, its being converted into an instrument of tyranny. I am preThe only pared to consider every reasonable proposal in that direction, and whilst conceding to the Court the power to grant a preference in certain cases, I would impose on it the duty of surrounding that grant with safeguards. I would not leave it to the mere discretion of the Court to grant the concession without imposing certain safeguards and securities to prevent its misuse. There can be no doubt that it is a great and important privilege, and its grant should be accompanied with conditions. I am prepared to surround the grant of the concession with such conditions that it shall be made applicable only to special circumstances. We must have guarantees for its operation with a certain amount of security in the interests of those who do not belong to industrial organizations. I regard with approval the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, shall be granted only in cases where it is found to be in accordance with the views .and interests of the majority of those affected. I think that the Court should be equipped with power to inquire into the question whether the request for a preference is asked by a minority or a majority of those interested. can be no objection to that? Why should an insignificant union, which happened to be organized, be allowed to go into the Court, and demand a preference for its members over the heads it may be of a large majority of workmen who do not wish to be bound by the decision, or to be coerced into joining the organization? If rule, surely Court a judicial into the question I have just mentioned. Before a concession of this kind is granted the Court ought to be required to give public notice to those persons who object to the granting come I do not say that the Court is to act without evidence. Those who wish to object should -have an opportunity to show that the great mass, or the majority, of the workers have no desire for the concession or privilege, or that it would have a prejudicial effect. .Surely there can be no objection to that view. I do not know that I am prepared to go so far as to say that the concession should apply only where the common rule applies, because that might carry us even further than is desirable. But I certainly contend that before any such concession is granted, an investigation the mass of the workmen, or non-unionist-organized ized-desire by the preferential clause. Then, I think the clause ought to require the Court to grant this concession only in special cases; that is, there ought to be something special in the circumstances of the case to justify or require the Court to exercise its power. In very many instances judicial authority is granted, to be exercised only in special cases. There is nothing in the Bill to say that preference is to be conceded in special cases; it may be granted in the most trumSir John Quick. pery case-in a case where a union consisting of the minimum number of members, In the first place, apply of their own accord and endeavour to bind, perhaps, hundreds and thousands of other workmen, not parties to the dispute.

It merely gives the Court power to suspend the organization if the rules do not appear, on their face, sufficient or satisfactory.

It is possible that rules such occurrences in the bud, may provide for the admission of every honest and capable man, and yet some who apply may be blackballed without any reason being assigned.

I am not satisfied with the mere inherent authority of the Court; I want the power laid down as plainly as A, B, C, to the workers as well as to the Court. it workers who are treated with injustice may not know that they have a remedyI want workers to know that if they are unfairly treated, they may go to the President, or write a letter to him, so that a meeting of the Court may be convened to deal with the case in a summary manner. As I say, my suggested amendment may not be completely effective, but it will remove some grounds of the apprehension which I have expressed. It may prevent some of the injustice and inconvenience of which I am afraid, and which I only reluctantly agree to tolerate because I feel constrained to support some form of organization recognition.

But what I do desire is that when we make such great concessions to organizations, the concessions shall be accompanied by such guarantees and securities as to remove every reasonable ground of apprehension on the part of those men who are practically to be forced into unions. It may be that connected with organizations there are certain conditions which cannot be prevented by law. I do not know that We could prevent unions having a political tinge or tendency, or that we could insert a clause which would prevent unions becoming political organizations. I do not see how unions could be prevented from becoming political organizations. We must recognise the irresistible pressure and tendency of the times in the direction of trades union organizations. force, and the only course is to regulate that conceal from the Committee-certainl y not force.in proper and safe channels.

I idea of an attempt being made by either party to attain any ulterior purpose. If some political organization, on what is called the more conservative side, endeavoured to secure undue rights, I should object just as strongly as I object to the labour organizations endeavouring to do so. I have only one clear object in view, and that is to pass such a Bill, that when there is a dispute between labour and capital, or when, as was suggested by the honourable and learned member who has just sat clown, there is a dispute within the organizations themselves, its settlement shall not be tarnished in any sense by the thought that other advantages are sought to be gained by means of the machinery established. the great purposes for which it has been introduced-the settlement of industrial disputes. the suggestion which fell from one of the speakers last night, that those who object to give the proposed preference to unionists are opposed to the Bill, and inferentially to trades unionism. I have already indicated, on other occasions, that I am in .favour of the principle of conciliation and aibitration. circumstances which require that the awards of the Court should be enforced, and that there must be some compulsory element in connection with the measure. With an intimate knowledge of the working of a great many trades union organizations, I say that trades unions have been of immeasurable benefit to the persons for whom they are particularly organized. In the past I have been brought into close contact with labour combinations, and, as far as the bulk of the members of the unions are concerned, man for man, one can always discover in them a fair and reasonable desire for the making of amicable and just arrangements. suffer, not from the great bulk of the men themselves, but from a percentage of those who may be regarded as their leaders, who have apparently felt compelled by pressure from outside, time after time, to assert and justify their existence by maintaining a constant state of agitation, inquiry, and interference with labour conditions, for which there was not justification. Last night my honourable friend, the member for Darlingwho, I am sure honourable members must unanimously recognise, has become one of the most mild-tempered legislators amongst us, and whose transference to the benches felt that we could divorce the occupied by the moderate party with which I am associated, may be confidently expected in the near future-fel l into an error in regard to somefigures,which I must recognise he had the kindness and courtesy subsequently to adjust.

With respect to the Broken Hill field, Mr Delprat, in sworn testimony before the New South Wales Arbitration Court, stated that there were over 5,000 men on the field, of whom only 1,700 belonged to the Amalgamated Miners' Association, and that there were 300 other men who belonged to other unions, leaving over 2,000 men who were not associated with any union whatever. Further, there are 2,641 men employed upon the Broken Hill Proprietary mine-the previous figures quoted referred to the whole of the Broken Hill field-and of that number, 705 men belong to the Amalgamated Miners' We have had to Association, and 200 belong to other unions. That is to say, 905 men out of 2,641 employed at fhat one mine are unionists, leaving 1,736 men who do not belong to any union whatever. These great mines cannot",25,Conciliation And Arbitration

103,Mr Knox,"I accept any correctionafford to employ other than efficient and capable men. Taking the men employed at Broken Hill, as a whole, I venture to say that honourable members could not find connected with any mining enterprise a better-equipped class than those now engaged there. I think that would apply also to the Mount Lyell field. If , .in the recent reference to the Court from the Broken Hill miners, when the whole of the mining companies were cited to appear, the Judge had given his award that none but union men should be employed, it must be manifest to honourable members that a very serious injustice would have been done to a large majority of the men employed on that field. I am prepared to admit that my illustration perhaps supports the suggestion that we may trust the Court. The Court saw that for a period of two years there was no necessity to alter the rate of wages there, and it practically gave a preference to unionistsbut what was the qualification? The Court said that so long as there were men disengaged on the field that preference should not apply. The honourable member for Barrier will admit that that is correct. sion recognised that if he-had conceded the preference to unionists, he would have been doing a great injustice to a large number of employees on the BrokenH ill field. I have shown that much injustice might be created if the Court were to arbitrarily exercise this power. Bill. power might be exercised, and the Court in the instance to which I have referred might have so exercised it under pressure by unionists, and on representation which might have been made to it. surely does not mean that the Court would be subject to pressure? this instance is concerned, he has shown a great grasp of industrial conditions. He has recognised what honourable members generally recognise: that the trades and labour unions have come to stay, and that it is perfectly idle to suppose that any legislation is going to interfere with the progressive course and influence of those great organizations. I have already said that it is clear that preference to unionists was one of the great purposes and objects of this measure. I may be permitted to read, and it is the only quotation with which I shall trouble the Committee, portions of an address on Socialistic changes in Sydney, given by Mr G. C. Wade, who has since been elected to the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales. I wish to say that special consideration and weight should be attached to the remarks of this gentleman. He is a barrister. by the employers. rister who is retained by the employers. But he has given a great deal of thought and consideration to the whole industrial question, and has been brought into direct contact with the operations of the Arbitration Court. the other side. WhatI propose to read has been stated publicly, and is open to criticism. It is, no doubt, open to the criticism suggested by the Prime Minister that Mr Wade has been all along an advocate for the other side in this question, inasmuch as he has always acted on behalf of persons who have been challenged by the unions. his bread is buttered. be said that he is actuated by that consideration. Any one who knows Mr Wade will be satisfied that he is a capable and intelligent lawyer, and a man who does his best to get at the bed-rock of the question. those who pay him. ber know Mr Wade personally ? high esteem for him. ber agrees with his views? Mr Wade, in his address, saidThe chief trouble in connection with the Arbitration Act was to be traced to the clause giving preference to unionists. From its very inception many union employees, who have no real quarrel with their masters, rushed to the Court, and preferred a claim in regard to wages, being quite content if they obtained the inclusion of the preference princijjle in the award. The result was that in a very short time the business of the Court became absolutely congested, and now there are fifty odd cases awaiting hearing, which were, presumably, industrial disputes, but which a few years ago would never have been thought of.

120,Mr Knox,"I agree with his views.the Arbitration Court was being used by the employees as a recruiting agent for the unions, for the recognition of the preference clause enabled them to increase their membership, and, as most of the unions were directly associated with politiby the honourable member for North Sydcal organizations, we had.a machine in operation which tended to give the Labour Party a solid front in the political world. He had been told of a certain union, whose members had admitted that they would be content if they obtained the preference, even if they lost their claim for the increase of wages. At the last election, through a want of cohesion in the union, a man was returned to Parliament who was opposed to the caucus. But it was now hoped that if the Court granted the union the preference clause they would have a solid body of workers, and the member referred to would be defeated at the forthcoming elections. The honourable member for Barrier will know who is the member referred to. be a member of the caucus. knows the man who was defeated, and to whom reference is here made. him also. members the views of a. gentleman who is in a position to speak with great authority on this question, because day by day during the whole period of references to the Court, he has been watching the development other honourable members on this side, I have consistently held that, underlying the high humane purpose and object of the Bill, in the direction of conciliation and arbitration, there is this greater desire to secure a weapon for the purpose of increasing the power, influence, and membership of the great trades and labour organizations. feel that if honourable members opposite wishfor the application of the principle of this Bill in its integrity-and I conscientiously believe that a large number of them do all. the case in trades and labour organizations, there is amongst the party opposite a small minority who, in connection with legislation, take extreme views and attitudes that the majority would not desire to take. believe I have been justified in bringing under the notice of the Committee the views of a gentleman who is so well-informed upon one side of this question. effect of the amendment proposed, if carried, will be to create a blank by the omissiori of these two sub-clauses. agree that it is necessary to have some organization to which an award can be applied, and through which an application can be made. For that reason, I believe, the best solution of the difficulty confronting the Committee is that which has been submitted ney. Let me again revert to the condition of things at BrokenH ill . I have referred to the benefits which were sought to be obtained under the award of the Court, in the case of the miners against the BrokenH ill mining companies. It was perfectly right, no doubt, that the unionists should in that case say to those who were not members of the unions, "" We are"" taking action in which you are hot assisting us. You are not contributing anything towards the cost of the reference."" I think the suggestion that every one who is a party to a reference to the Court, and who will be affected by the settlement of the dispute involved, should contribute proportionately to the expense is a very good one. It should apply to inI know dividual employers and to associations of I have quoted for honourable employers and employees. The Employers Union is, I think, a political body, but if it felt called upon to adopt an attitude of defence'against what its members regarded as the encroachment of the labour unions, and was cited before the Court, all the parties of industrial disputes. With interested in the dispute, and not merely' that union, should contribute to the expense. I think that that would be a fair and reasonable application of the common rule.

In the first place, I might mention that without a provision for preference to unionists the whole fabric of this measure will' be practically destroyed. The law cannot be applied with any beneficial I ask their consideration to the result, and there can be no effective administration under it. The recognition of organizations is the ruling principle of the measure, and it can have no effect whatever if the incentive to organization is to be destroyed. What inducement would there be to men to organize with a view to taking advantage of the provisions of the measure if no provision were made for giving preference to unionists? Who should have a preference if not those who have spent years and years in attempting to bring about reforms such as that now under consideration? Are those who have stood apart and have shared in the benefits for which others have fought to be placed upon an equal footing with unionists who have directed all their energies to bringing about better conditions of labour? I do not f u l l y understand the What arguments advanced by some honourable I members sitting opposite The honourable member for North Sydney would go to extremes such as were never contemplated by unionists. We do not suggest, as does the honourable member, that men should be forced into joining unions. The honourable' member for New England went still further, because he said that he would not only make every man join an industrial organization, but would authorize his employer to deduct from his wages the amount of his contribution to the union. Honourable members who are prepared to support this measure should certainly go the length of giving us their assistance in securing preference for unionists. TheA honourable and learned member for Corinella seems to have a penchant for drafting amendments which are likely to provide work for the lawyers. He proposes that the Court shall not direct preference to be given to members of organizations except as part of a common rule, and with the consent of such organizations and persons as, in the opinion of the Court, represent the majority of those engaged in an industry. I do not see that any advantage is to be gained by making such a proviso. The Court could not direct that preference should be given to unionists beyond the area covered by the common rule. They would never attempt to do any thing soidiotic as to extend it further. a matter of fact I do not propose to move that portion of the amendment.",29,Conciliation And Arbitration

The honourable member for Robertson objected to the general tendency of the B ill , and presented to us as illustrations a number of cases which demonstrated his utter ignorance of the application of the preference provision in the New South Wales Arbitration Act. If a dispute occurred in connection with the railway services of New South Wales and Victoria, and a common rule were applied not only to those States but to others, do honourable members suppose that the men would be satisfied unless preference were given to unionists? In such an event no inducement would be afforded to the railway men to keep up the contributions to their unions, and to maintain the organizations which had been instrumental in bringing about improved conditions. If honourable members think that the railway servants who are members of unions will be content to be placed upon the same footing as others who are outside their organizations, they Will find that they are mistaken. member mean to say that the Government should not employ a man unless he joined the union? thing of the kind. ing that it is the general wish that we should conclude this debate in time to permit of representatives from the other States catching their trains, I shall omit a great deal of the matter with which I had intended to deal in discussing this clause. I am pleased to note tlhat we have now reached a very calm atmosphere, notwithstanding that hitherto the debate has been as heated as has any which has taken place in this Parliame t. stand why that has been so. that we are all in earnest over this question, and also that there are two sides to it, as indeed there are to most questions. my mind the discussion does not represent a mere scramble to determine which of two parties shall obtain an advantage. contrary, I recognise that there is a big economic question involved, and whilst our friends opposite claim that unionism has done a great deal for non-unionists, I contend that non-unionists could make out a very good case indeed from their point of view. I find it very diffithat we are dealing practically with a minority of the workers. It is always repugnant to the instincts of our race to'exercise compulsion of any kind, but the compulsion of a minority seems to me to be the crowning act of compulsion. In discussing this Bill the other night the Prime Minister -and I think the Minister of External Affairs-used , the word "" weapon."" They urged that this clause provided the onlyweapon which could be put into the hands of unionists to give them control of the situation. Why should a weapon be placed in the hands of any section of the community to enable it to dominate any other section? I can understand that it might be necessary to put a weapon into the hands of a man who was engaged in looking after criminals,' but I see no reason why one should be placed in the hands of a section of the community to enable it to lord it over another section. we experience in connection with unscrupulous capitalists. ""unscrupulous."" I am at a disadvantage as compared with the honourable member, in that long ago I realized what is stated in the Biglow Papers, that "" The further I go Ihe harder it gits to be sure that I know."" Probably the honourable member will reach I do not say anythat stage some day. The Prime Minister also used another word, which, I think, was as much out of place as was the word "" weapon."" He used the term "" altruistic "" in referring to the great good which has been conferred by unionists upon non-unionists. I am perfectly prepared to believe that a great deal of altruism exists in the minds of many honourable members opposite. I credit them with the sincere belief that by the enactment of the legislation proposed they will accomplish much good. _ But they should also remember that I can quite underthere is a considerable amount of selfishI realize ness at the bottom of it.

That is the other side of this question. We are not called upon to deal exclusively with altruism. Altruism leads us into very high altitudes, but, on the other on which I desire to dwell briefly. hand, selfishness is more likely to prevail in matters of this kind. The view which is entertained by many non-unionists is that any interference with the free action, of labour prevents expansion of industries. .Money begets money, labour begets labour, and a free exchange of labour frequently leads to a condition of things that is infinitely better than are any artificial aids which we can employ. I freely confess that if , by their superior skill, unionists can insure peace and harmony to the employer, they are entitled to all the benefits which they can derive from their good work and all familiar with the story of the man who went from America, on behalf of the Westinghouse Company, to hustle the English labourers. On his arrival the unionists in England waited upon him, and placed their views before him. ""What do you want?"" that they wished to work certain hours, and to be paid iod. an hour. Thereupon he said, "" V e ry well ; I will give you n d . an hour if you will do the work as I wish it to be done."" What was the result? Within nine months he had completed what the English architects estimated would occupy three years, and he had accomplished that result with the greatest satisfacper man. tion to himself and to the unionist labourers. to fix a minimum wage, and to alThat fact proves that, if unionists depend entirely on their superior skill, they will sefcure a material advantage. Last night the honourable member for Darling, and the. honourable member for Moira, referred to the shearers' strike of 1890. I have a vivid recollection of that struggle, because I was specially interested in it. The year previously I had become so disgusted with When some of my own class who undertook to get their shearing done upon certain lines and failed to carry it out that I engaged unionist labourers on their own What would the mothers terms. When the strike occurred, for some' reason or other my employees remained at work, but a great many others were called out, and the cause of unionism It was one of the emin Victoria was thrown back at least ten years. Since then, I think that the methods employed by unionists have improved, and if the Government are content not to press I do not exactly know their proposal in favour of a preference to that class of employees too f a r if they are willing to adopt some such method as has been suggested by the honourable member for North SydneyI shall be amply satisfied with the Bill. There is another matter It has reference to the limitation of apprentices, and to the payment of a minimum wage To my mind it is very clear that, if the weak man is to receive more than his value, the strong man must accept less, otherwise the industry in which they are employed will be ruined. member like to have his sheep shorn fast? allusion. that the weak man must go down, and yet when he engages shearers he desires to better methods.

To my mind, that was an exceedingly sensible suggestion. No industry can carry on which has to pay more than the economic value of the work performed. We know that with the advance of medical science, and with cheaper food supplies,'a great many weaker persons are being reared to manhood. As we obtain improved methods of treating the young and rearing them to manhood, this trouble will become more acute. The standard wage must not be set by the weaker men. vided for in the Bill. the methods which unionists have adopted in the past. Another point which occurs to me in referenoe to this matter is that the Government are now proposing to seriously depart from the principle which they have expressed a desire to follow in other directions.. Thev talk of nationalizing industry, ancl yet they propose to create a monopoly of labour. I contend that, by so doing, they are altogether departing from the lines which they have laid down in regard to other matters. Several amendments are to be submtted, which I hope the Government will accept. AlthoughI began by admitting that I was in favour of voluntary conciliation that. degree anxious to go back upon the principle of compulsory arbitration at this stage. My only desire is to get the best Bill possible under the circumstances. therefore, that the Government should go as far as they can towards accepting the amendments proposed. As the honourable member for Kooyong has said, the position m California has become so acute that one realizes that it would be well, if possible, to do something in this direction. It would seem that in California many employers and employees really conspire together to exploit the consumer. In dealing with difficulties of this kind, however, a State enjoys an advantage over a Federation. fessor Fiske, in discussing similar agitations which took place in California years ago, points out that if the trouble is confined to one State it cures itself. As soon as the money begins to flow from the State the people must go too, and other States take warning. We are legislating, however, for the whole Commonwealth, and must therefore regard these questions from a broader stand-point. As I understand that it is the wish of the Committee to go to a division as soon as possible, I shall content myself with this brief statement of my views. to occupy the time of the Committee at any great length; but am anxious to refer to the system of issuing black-lists which is adopted by the pastoralists. I have a copy of a black-list, and propose to give honourable members some idea of how the system is worked. When a shearer applies for a stand he is asked for his reference, and on receiving it from him the manager at once takes it into his office, and by referring to the number which it bears is able without difliculty to ascertain what remarks appear on the black-list in regard to the holder. A man may have a first-class reference, setting forth that he is a good shearer, and that his behaviour is excellent; but if on perusal of the black-list the manager finds that he was considered by his former employer to be an undesirable he is atonce refused employment. I have no desire to mention names, but I shall read some of the remarks which appear in this black-list. Let me take, first of ail, remarks appearing against a man whose name, we will say, is Tom Smith.

It is said that we need a larger population in Queensland, and yet many pastoralists are driving some of the best workers out of the country. Many men have been compelled to leave Queensland to seek employment elsewhere. Numbers have been hounded out of the shearing industry. They hunted me out of if, but, thank God, it was the very best day's work they ever did-for me. As'soon as these men ( find it necessary to leave Queensland they tiavel to New South Wales or Victoria, where they settle down, and become first class farmers. Some of the best settlers in Victoria are unionists from Queensland. It has been urged that the organizations to which this provision of the would apply, are cal organized into political associations, but I can assure honourable members that not one penny of the funds of the Australian Workers' Unioni n Queensland is devoted to political objects. We have a separate organization known Political Organization, which deals with political questions, .and any man. may become a member of it by paying an annual fee of 2s. 6d. As soon as a man takes his union ticket he is asked. "" W ill you take a ticket in the Workers' Political Organization ?"" If he becomes a member of the organisation he is allowed a voice in the selection of the candidates nominated he declines to more about the matter. thousands of non-unionists in Queensland who belong to the Workers' Political Organization. I do not say that they all vote for labour candidates, although I dare sav that, nine-tenths of them supported my candidature ; but they have certain fixed political principles, and their opinions on the fiscal question are especially pronounced. This is the secret of the success of the Australian Workers' Union in Queensland. lieve that some proposal was made to use the funds of the union in New South Wales, and that it led to the difficulty in regard to the registration of certain rules; but in Queensland nothing of the kind has occurred. Queensland which a union organizer is not the Machine Shearers' Union is ths allowed to enter. In nine cases out of ten the land on which the station buildings are erected is freehold, and the owners will not permit an organizer to visit the shed for the purpose of organizing the men. Last year the manager of the Kynuna station summoned an organizer for visiting' hi.s shed. The man first asked for permission to go there, but was refused. A number of the shearers subsequently invited him to' the shed, and he accepted the invitation, with the result that he was sued for trespass and was fined some Â£ 2 or Â£ 3 . Surely when members of a union are employed on these sheds, the organization should be allowed, through its representative, to approach them for the purpose of carrying on the work of the society. We have no desire to force any man into our union. A man is simply asked Bill whether he will take a ticket, and if used for politihe declines to do so no harm is done. purposes. Unionists are easily There is no objection on the part of the members of the Australian Workers' Union in Queensland to work alongside non-unionists. Ever since the strike of 1891, the pastoralists have said to us-""Let bygones be bygones, and let us work on the as the Workers' same old lines as we did before the strike."" But what has happened? A black-list has come into vogue, and any man who dares to say a word to the "" boss"" is blacklisted, and hounded out of the country. I car. tell honourable members that, had it not been for the Australian Workers' Union, the price of shearing to-day would have been about 12s. per 100, instead of Â£1. Yet it is desired to give non-union by the organization; but if shearers the right to fatten on that which we join he hears no have won during the last twelve or fourteen There are years, and which they have accepted with all the good grace imaginable, while we are not to be allowed to organize them. That is the true position so far as non-unionists and unionists are concerned. I could give instances of what happened last year, when I was at Barcaldine. When I was at home there during last recess, a man came down in search of shearers for Pondooroo, in the Witton district. ThereI bewere available many men, who were good, capable shearers, but they had upon them the brand of the Australian Workers' Union. This man said, "" No ; I cannot take you men, because you do not belong to our association,"" which was the Machine Shearers' Union.

208,Mr Page,"It is only the right honoroccupied a little time, there has been an attempt on this side of the Chamber lo ""stone-wall"" the measure? clause as the most important in ihe Bill, and I would prefer this' discussion to be carried on even for a few days longer rather than any honourable member who wished to state his views should be deprived of the right to do so. I followed the' remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa very closely, and I am in thorough accord with him in protesting against Parliament recognising or sympathizing in any way with a black-list, or with the compulsion of shearers to join any particular union in order to get a living. The whole drift ofhis argument was that there is a certain union which' seeks to compel the shearers of Queensland to join its ranks, and that those who stand out cannot live. But he is supporting a provision which is designed to compel men to join other organizations, otherwise they cannot live. He desires to create exactly the very thing against which he has so ably and vigorously protested. There was not an honourable member, I am sure, in the Chamber who did not realize the force and urgency of his remarks, when he pointed out that some of the best men in Queensland had had to join a particular union, or, as an alternative, to submit to being hounded out of the State. That is exactly what he is trying to do under this Bill. I am not an enemy to trades unions. bers from the other side sneer across the chamber at honourable members on this side; but let us contrast their record as employers, or as Members of Parliament, or as public men, and see whether they have' been the oppressors or the opponents of either unionists or workmen generally. I take it'that, if that inquiry is made, it will be found that on this side there you strike out or mutilate this clause, the are men whose public records, in the interests of workers generally, are quite as good as those of the honourable members who wish to take out. a patent for a monopoly of sympathy with the workers. I am not opposed, I repeat, to trades unions. When I was an employer of labour my office was a union one, and, with one single exception, we got along exceedingly well. If I were running a newspaper to-morrow, 1 am very strongly of opinion that, unless I were restrained by some wretched legislation, I should prefer a trades union to a non-union office; but I do protest against any legislation or any Arbitration Court saying to a man who has conscientious objections to joining a union that he, with his wife and' children, must starve, because no employer can be permitted to give him employment. ganizations. what it is built on. oakers "" come on deck, they ask, "" How is she heading ?"" and as I have sat here, while the different clauses of the Bill have been discussed, I have asked myself, ""How is she heading?"" When the Bill was introduced a most eloquent speech was made by the Prime Minister, and an equally eloquent, though perhaps more emphatic one, by the Minister of External Affairs. The whole object of the Bill, they urged, was to abolish strikes, to give us peace instead of war, to secure conciliation throughout the trades of Australia. That is the peg on which they hung their case then. But as soon as we come to this clause they say to us, "" Unless you give the Court the power to say that the non-unionist is not to get employment, the Bill will be of no good. You may as well throw it in the waste-paper basket.'' thing of the kind, as the honourable member knows. cussion on this clause that has been said by Some honourable memseveral speakers representing the Government.

MrM c WILLIAMS reason why these men left the union.

Mr O'MALLEY -The A.M.A. of Victoria did not .think the strike was justified. MrM c WILLIAMS Tasmanian miners paid their contributions and levies, the strikes in Victoria were justified. The fact remains that the best menancl as to this I appeal to the honourable member for Darwin-hav e stepped out of the union, not because, as the honourable member for Kennedy, who knows nothing of the subject, and makes the remarks he has about men quite as good as himself A.M.A. than does the honourable member. MrM c WILLIAMS The honourable member for Kennedy does not know much L e t me tell honori f he calls Mr Long a ""blackleg"" and "" a scab""--if he applies such epithets to one who, because of the attitude he chose to assume was dismissed, and took his dismissal like a man.

MrM c WILLIAMS The honourable member for Yarra, who knows something of the circumstances of the case, says that Mr Long was dismissed because he is a labour man; but the honourable member for Kennedy affirms that Mr Long is a "" blackleg,"" because he refused to stay in a union which he thought was doing an injustice to himself and his colleagues.

It is said that this legislation is for the people's good; but has there ever been a tyrant, who, in sending people to the stake, has not thought and declared that he had a good end in view ? Not one. Now it is proposed that one-sixth or one-seventh of the workers shall form an aristocracy of labour, and that others shall starve-that one-seventh of the workers shall be the chosen few, and the other six-sevenths, as the honourable member for Maranoa has said, be "" black-listed,"" not by the managers, whom he condemned, but by the parliamentary representatives through the Judge of the Arbitration Court. Honourable members who support these proposals have the cool assurance to say that they are the representatives of labour, while those who oppose them, are described as the enemies of labour and of trades unionists. And why is that said ? Because we refuse to allow trades unionists to close their books. occurred in New South Wales was brought uncler the notice of the Committee by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo; and I ask honourable members who have any knowledge of the wharf labourers of Australia, whether that is the only case ?

253,Mr Mcdonald,-Ho w did the honor,40,Register Of Shearers Who Shore For The Members During The Vear 1895
254,Mr Mcdonald,"-The honourable memno other representative oÂ£ that State has spoken. We are all, I hope, in complete sympathy with the honourable member for Maranoa in his most laudable protest against the black-list that has been circulated. I think we are also in the fullest sympathy with him when he protests so vigorously and honestly-as he always does -agains t the action of Young and Co., who have a union of their own, and will not allow a man to 'shear unless he joins it under compulsion. If 1 were a shearer I would fight Young and Co. to the last ditch rather than be compelled to join their union.. I ask honourable members who share that view to join with me in saying that what we condemn in Young and Co. we condemn all round, and that we will not place in the hands of any Judge the power to say that a workman shall not obtain employment unless he joins a union. To my mind no more despicable proposition has ever been put before a Legislature in Australia than that we shall give a Judge power to say to a man, "" You shall not obtain employment, and your wife and children may starve, unless you join a union."" Thank God we are too far civilized to introduce the thumb-screw and the rack again ! We are not doing that, it is true, but some people might prefer even that alternative than be compelled to consent to the proposition which is now made. There are men who would rather face punishment themselves than see it inflicted upon their wives, and their helpless chilfcldividual liberty, under the threat of absoren at home. That is the ordeal to which honourable members opposite, who claim a monopoly as representatives of labour, want to subject the workers of Australia. The Minister of External Affairs said that the Bill would not compel a worker to vote for a labour candidate, but admitted it would compel him to pay a portion of the expenses of a labour candidate. The unions require their members to subscribe to a fighting fund-to be used, perhaps, to fight elections on behalf of men whose principles they absolutely abhor. Association. member is stating what is not true. times called for order, and honourable members take absolutely no .notice. The very next time. I have to make this complaint I shall ask the leader of the House to deal with the offender. trict in Victoria, where the feeling of the unionists may be protectionist. Certain labour candidates may be absolutely free traders and single-taxers in principle. In New South Wales the reverse may be the case. Are we to say to workmen, "" Before you can obtain work you must swallow your political principles to the extent of helping to secure the election of men whom you clo not want to represent you?"" This Bill goes even further than that. It would deprive men of their political liberty. In my opinion, this is not so much a measure to create a monopoly for the trades union operatives, as it is to create a monopoly for the union representatives in Parliament. I believe that it is the first duty of Parliament to treat all men alike. That is my idea of democracy. I draw no distinction between employers and emploves Both should be treated on exactly similar terms. I draw no distinction between a unionist and a non-unionist. The honourable member for Darling has drawn a broad distinction. He says that every man who is not in a union may, nevertheless, be a unionist. But the Bill makes no such distinction. It simply provides that preference shall be given to unionists. The workman who is not a member of a union, who is not contributing to the upkeep of the union, who is not contributing to the political fighting fund of the union, is under this Bill a non-unionist -We are asked, deliberately, tb take away from men their inlute starvation. The amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella goes farther than I should be inclined to go, but I would ask the Committee to give it serious consideration. Honestly, I am against any preferen'ce being given. I would treat all men equally. Buti f the Committee is not prepared to go so far, I would ask them to accept the amendment, and to say that a man who objects to join a union shall, at least, have a chance to preserve his individual liberty, and to earn daily bread for his wife and children. cussion has -lasted a considerable time, but Ido not think that any one need complain of its length, because the matter under consideration is a very serious one. It will be my duty to contravert, as shortly as I possibly, can, some of the statements which have been made.

260,Mr Chanter (Riverina),"-The disimproving the Bill, many honourable members have used it for party political purposes, with the object of misrepresenting to people outside what the real objects of the measure areI f I understand it rightly, the objects of .the Bill are to prevent strikes. I venture to say that there is no fair-minded man, no matter what his politics may be, who would not, if he is an honest and humane man, go to the very greatest lengths to secure such legislation as would prevent strikes. more ruinous, to worker and employer alike, than strikes. The very basic principle of this Bill, as was very clearly pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Indi last night, in his most admirable remarks, is organization. We want to bring the employers and employ6s into organizations. That is the foundation upon which the Bill is constructed. If the measure be passed, and if subsequently any attempt to create an industrial dispute is made by one party or the other, very heavy penalties may be imposed. Who can honestly and conscientiously say that these proregistration of the Machine Shearers' Union, visions will be of a compulsory or mandatory character? There is no mandate to the Court to give preference to an organizaunder this Bill, will have the power to cantion of employers or employees. The Bill states' clearly enough that the Court may, under certain circumstances, direct that ceragainst the members of the Government and tain things shall be done. power whether this paragraph remained in the Bill or not. true; but I also believe that Courts have many powers given to them foruse at their discretion, for the .benefit of the people, which are not always used. Let me give an illustrative case. It is within my experience that an attempt of the kind which I shall describe has been made. Suppose a dispute arises between an organization of employees,and an organization of employers, and there is power for the Court to prevent them from doing certain things. What would the employers do? They would absolutely employ non-union labour for no other purpose than to provoke the unionists; and if the Court were not given power to discriminate, having in view the whole of the circumstances, its hands would be tied. It must not be forgotten that, to a very great extent, this is experimental legislation. Whilst the clause provides that the Court may direct that a certain preference shall be given, it is also empowered to vary any award or order. If the' Court finds 4z2 that a mistake has been made, there is power provided in the Bill for remedying the mistake as quickly as possible. 1 fail to see anything in the clause compelling the Court to give preference to any one. The provision is purely directory, and the exercise of the power is within the jurisdiction of the Court. Some reference has been made to the constitution of the Court. We are aware that the President will be a Justice of the High Court of Australia, Nothing is and, whoever he may be, we can be assured that he will mete out justice, and will not be influenced by the consideration that an organization is either an employers' or an employees' organization. his personality. stands his position sinks his personality, and becomes the instrument of justice to carry out the will of the people as expressed by the Parliament of the country. In a New South Wales case, which has been cited, the Court was asked to cancel the and if any attempt should be made to constitute improper organizations, the Court, cel their registration, if there should be reason for taking such ""action. It is urged their supporters that they belong to bodies of unionists who subscribe funds, a portion of which is utilized for political purposes. That may be so; I am not .aware whether it is or not. Buti f that should be considered a crime, I unhesitatingly say that there is a combination of employers opposed to the Australian Workers' Union who have committed a far more serious crime, as they have largely used their funds for political purposes. I have had personal experience of that. I have only recently found that the funds of the Pastoralists' Union of New South Wales may be allocated, not merely for political purposes, but for personal purposes; and that they may be used, not only to injure the worker where that can be done, but also to keep people off the land. The honourable member for Franklin has said that we should get people on to the land, and yet he is prepared to support a party, some members of which take action to prevent people getting on to the land. I could deal with these matters at some length, and, perhaps, on another occasion I shall refer to them to show that coercion is rampant at the present",41,Register Of Shearers Who Shore For The Members During The Vear 1895

In the circumstances, what is there left for me to do but to support the Bill to which I have previously given my support, a Bill which was brought in by the late Government, and -which many other honourable members who are now on this side also supported. I am sorry to say that some of them are now prepared to seize upon this directory provision to destroy the measure.

It is for that reason that I am now determined to let it be known exactly what my views nn this question are. I do not believe that this provision will have the effect that some honourable members contend that it will have, and I remind honourable members that the Prime Minister has given a promise to support the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. That amendment will have the effect of toning clown what in some quarters may appear to be a mandatory provision, and I shall give it my support. of the Committee believes in his heart that Mr Chanter. a measure of this kind is necessary to prevent strikes, and if we are going to recognise industrial organizations it is This clause contains an instruction not unreasonable to give some preference to the members of those organizations 'as against those who keep outside them.

The provision to which exception is taken can not be conI have heard from sidered as likely to be oppressive, unless it is assumed that the Court constituted under the Bill will be corrupt, ancl will not disThose pense justice, or carry out the will of the people. I ask honourable members to assist in making the measure one. which will secure the protection of the worker as well as of the employer, and prevent industrial strife and ruin. I desire day that I was prepared to accept the suggestion put forward by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat-afte r consultation with the honourable. and learned member for Indi and myself-as to the advisability of having an additional subclause to clause 67. Since then other suggestions have been made. In the first place, I may say that the Government is prepared to accept the amendment which has been suggested by the honourable and learned member for Corinella in this formProvided always that before any preference to members of organizations is directed as aforesaid, the President shall, by notification published in the Gazette, and in such other publications, if any, as the Court directs, specifying the industry and the industrial matter in relation to which it is proposed to direct such preference, make known, that all persons and organizations I have given interested and desirous of being heard may, on or before a day named, appear or be represented A before the Court, and the Court shall in manner prescribed hear such persons and organizations so appearing or represented. That would apply the same provision to the matter of granting preference as we have in clause 46 applied to the granting of the common rule. The Government are willing to accept that, and they are also willing to accept an amendment which has been given notice of by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, which would follow the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and which is stated in these termsIn any case in which the Court directs that preference shall be given it may subsequently suspend or qualify the direction for such time or subject to such conditions as it thinks fit if it Every member be proved that the rules of the organization are burdensome or oppressive or do not provide",42,Register Of Shearers Who Shore For The Members During The Vear 1895
265,Mr Watson,"I mentioned the otherreasonable conditions for admission to or conexperimental. Similar legislation has not tinuance in membership or that the organization been tried in any of the older countries of has acted unfairly or unjustly to any of its members in the matter of preference. Beyond these amendments explaining the general purpose, and qualifying to some extent the power of the Court in relation to preference, the Government are not prepared to go. We will agree to these amendments if they are moved by the honourable and learned members to whom I have referred, and if they do not care to move them, I shall be prepared, on behalf of the Government, to do so myself. honourable gentleman will also assent to an amendment allowing the President, without action by the Registrar to take notice of the rules of any union. pared to accept such an amendment to clause 67 when we reach it. made no secret from the beginning of my intense repugnance to some of the features of these proposals for compulsory arbitration. reading, there is a greater violation done in this Bill to the individual liberties and rights of the citizens of a civilized country than I know of in any other legislation in the British Empire. New South Wales Act. think I was in the New South Wales Parliament when that measure was passed, but I was there when it was first introduced, ancl I expressed my views very strongly. As I have already said, the main object of this Bill is such a humane one, and if realized would have such a tremendous effect for good, that I am prepared to surrender a number of strong objections to some of its provisions in order that there may be a fair experiment. But I sym-. pathize very cordiallywith those who object to carrying the provisions of a measure of this sort further in the' direction of compulsion than is absolutely necessary. What is the object of the Bill? Compulsory arbitration; the compulsory settlement of differences which may arise between employers and employees. We are prepared to pass a measure in order to endeavour to attain that great object, but we are not all prepared, at this stage at any rate, to pass some of the objectionable provisions which the Bill contains. All legislation on this subject is admittedly the world; it has been confined to countries lying within the Australasian seas, and is of only a few years' duration. No careful man would say, at the present time, that it is more than a most interesting experiment which has an excellent object in view. not been tried elsewhere. experimental stage. The fact that a measure has been passed is not conclusive as toits merits. I admit that the remarks which I am making apply to everything new, because every new departure is, from that very circumstance, an experiment. We are all friendly to the object which the Government have in view. No human being who has any appreciation of the sufferings and distress which have been occasioned to. innocent persons by strikes could be otherwise. But the question is whether the provision under discussion does not go too far. I think As I said on the second that it does, and that it is a most objectionable provision. The amendments which the Government are prepared to accept show its hideous impracticability. Itseems to be forgotten that we are legislating for a continent containing 3.000,000 square miles, over which population is scattered at enormous intervals. I hail the I know that. I do not amendments which have been referred to by the Prime Minister as a vast improvement upon the clause, and I am glad that the honourable gentleman has accepted them, because, in doing so, he has gone a long way beyond what many of those who sit behind him would favour. I welcome his conciliatory attitude in this matter, because I look upon those amendments as an immense improvement, since they will remove a serious objection to the clause as it stands. But they show the absurdity of the situation. The Arbitration Court will sit in Melbourne or in Sydney, or in some other particular place, and will deal with disputes concerning industries in which persons are engaged in all parts of a continent having a coast line of 8,000 miles. It is proposed that a man shall be at liberty to come from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Melbourne, say, to show cause why the award of the Court, in a particular dispute, should not apply to him.

Are there not hundreds and thousands of workers out in the wild bush who have no chance of belonging to a union? It is all very well for those who live in large cities, and can gather together in large numbers, and who have officers to arrogate to themselves this offensive exclusiveness with reference to labour. ought to remember the fact that when they speak in the name of labour they represent only a mere fraction of the numbers of men just as honest as they are who cannot belong to a union, even though they may wish to do so. When a man is down, through having lost his employment, and is searching for work, do his fellow workmen in the unions take him by the hand ancl say.

Such a What is being done now under the man may have been working in such a township for twenty years. He may Working men never have belonged to a union, berepresent working men talk of cause there may have been no union running after him. Perhaps the two or three workers in the town would not have been worth running after, because there was no political strength behind them. In this little bush township there might be two or three men out of employment when a vacancy occurred.

The proposal is f u l l of the most hideous impracticability when an attempt is made to apply it to a vastt continent like Australia.

I absolutely admire the idea of trades unionism. If I were in the position of a man employed at a trade, I should feel, as I think every good man in a trade ought to feel, a desire to associate with my fellow-workers in some body connected with the trade. During the whole time that I have been in public life, no man can say that I have ever used a disparaging word in regard to trades unions. I look upon them as representing the cream of the working men in every industry jn connection with which they have been formed. times gets sour, when it goes into politics. men-more , perhaps, than it is that of some others-to study the interests of all classes of the community. members for the trades unions in the districts that we represent. much of that sort of thing now. My honourable friends opposite must admit that the whole of their political power and existence depend upon the trades unions of the States in whicli they live. away from them the support of the trades unions, and they will disappear for ever from the political horizon.

The best basis upon which a representative in this House can stand, is that he represents every interest and every man in his constituency equally, and not unequally. there in my district? thousand. The Prime Minister should recollect that he was once a big city representative.

Does he think that I am ravenous for office? I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs is probably more ravenous to keep me out of office.

That the following words be added :"" Provided always that before any preference to members of organizations is directed as aforesaid, the President shall, by notification published in the Gazette, and in such other publications, if any, as the Court directs, specifying the industry and the industrial matter in relation to which it is proposed to direct such preference, make known that all persons and organizations interested and desirous of being heard may, on or before a day named, appear or be represented before the Court, and the Court shall, in manner prescribed, hear all such persons and organizations so appearing or represented.""

But I wish to point out that it would practically have the effect of hampering the operation of the whole of the clause. The Court will doits work thoroughly.

The amendment, however, is an attempt to secure some degree of fairness, and to enable persons to obtain intelligence of the position they are in, before an award is made. Amendment agreed to. That the following words be added :"" And provided further that no such preference shall be directed to be given, unless the application for such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants."" This matter has really been under discussion for some days, so that further debate is unnecessary. The amendment simply means that if a union on either side asks for a preference the Court, must be of opinion that either the union itself, or those who agree to its application to give unions preference, represent a majority on that side. It does not mean that the approval of the majority on each side shall be shown, but a majority on only the one side. I am quite content to submit my proposal to a division without debate. If any debate arises, however, I shall claim my right to reply. sider that, on agreeing to the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, they will have gone quite as far as those who favour this clause could be expected to go, and I , therefore, earnestly ask honourable' members to reject this amendment.",47,Register Of Shearers Who Shore For The Members During The Vear 1895
