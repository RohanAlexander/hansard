However, perhaps it restrict my remarks to the steel industry. might be reasonable if I were to read it into The Fraser Government had no long term Hansard because it goes to the very heart of the plans for the steel industry. It was just as happy reason for the introduction of this bounty bill. The for it to disappear-as it rapidly was until the table is related to local producers and gives the advent of the Hawke Government. This Governpercentage rates of the imports market share of ment is firmly committed to maintaining a viable, competitive market supplies. It shows that for internationally competitive steel industry, not just high alloy bar products in 1979-80 the local probecause of its importance to the Australian econducers market share was 77.6 per cent.

The corollary was that imrecognised. The fact that the steel industry is ports market share had risen from 22.4 per cent in localised in certain areas-in Newcastle, Port 1979-80 to 52.2 per cent in September 1982.

As I said, this Government will not see that share had risen from 23.1 per cent in 1979-80 to happen, for one other very important reason, as 55.4 per cent in the September quarter of 1982. So the honourable member for Burke so eloquently those of us who are interested in the shrinking pointed out. The importance of the steel industry market shares of local manufacturers in the steel to our national security and defence arrangements industry, in comparison with the imports share, is paramount. For those very important reasons, will now be able to read those facts in Hansard, we will be taking steps very shortly-steps that because I have read it in, despite the best efforts of the previous Government did not take in its seven the honourable member for Franklin to make sure years of mismanagement of the nation's economy. that that advice was not available to honourable The Minister for Industry and Commerce members and to interested readers of Hansard.
