Minister whether it is true, as reported in one of the newspapers, that 200,000 tons of coal lying; in New South Wales, and belonging to the Pederal authorities, have been handed over to the State Government for civic purposes? Was this coal brought out from England at a cost of, at least, Â£4 12s. a ton? Government still has certain stocks of coal at grass, the actual quantity being, not 200,000 tons, but 130,000 tons. This is the residue of* a very large stock of coal that was obtained in 1917. A great proportion of it has been made available to the States on previous occasions, the coal having considerably depreciated i u value. The action now taken has been to constitiute a board, consisting of the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department, Commander Fernley, and, think, Commander Ramsay, to advise tlie Government as to the price at which the . coal should be made available to the States. I have written to the State Premiers indicating the proportion of coal to which his State would be entitled on. a population basis, and asking if he desired that any of it should be reserved for his State. Whether the coal will be utilized for public utilities or for keeping manufacturing going is a matter entirely in the hands of the State Governments, and it is entirely at their option to accept any part of the supply available to them. This coal has no value to-day for naval purposes. gentleman w ill pardon me, but quite a number of shiploads of coal were brought here recently from overseas for the Navy Department at an enormous cost, which I think was a scandalous waste of money. in the stock to which I have referred. That coal has been lying at grass for many years. Minister read an article published in the Empire Review for A p r i l by Sir John COAL. Ross, and entitled, "" One of Our Most Vital Problems"" ?

Before Federation, it was enough for them to decide that a thing should be done, and, if physically possible of accomplishment, it was done. Australia is par excellence a democracy, and when the States were invited to federate, their people were told, and believed, that union would extend their power and reduce the burden of taxation. The experience of a quarter of a century has sadly disillusioned them. The expense of government has been increased, and the power of the people has beenhampered at every tur n by the terms of a Constitution which, as I have already said, they have never properly understood. The Commonwealth Parliament, unlike the British Parliament, or even a State Parliament, enjoys only the powers set out in the Constitution. can legislate, it must not only consider the expediency and practicability of what it proposes to do, but also closely scan the terms of the written instrument which has created it . For unless the power to legislate on a particular matter is expressly conferred by that document, this Parliament can do nothing, even though the nation may topple to its f a l l through lack of federal action. Having ascertained that the subject-matter with which it desires to deal is included in the enumerated powers, this Parliament is [103] of industrial only half-way on its journey, for it has yet to find out whether the apparently clear words of the Constitution actually confer the power to legislate in the direction desired. I have referred to the disillusionment of the people. We who sit in this Parliament are in like case. I have sat in governments that set out with much enthusiasm to give effect'to this new instrument of government, and time and again the H i gh Court has declared with emphasis and finality-for the powers of this Parliament are only what the H i g h Court declares them to be-that in respect of matters of v it a l importance, upon which the Constitution appears to speak clearly, this national Parliament is impotent. The Prime Minister, when in troducing this bill, referred to the Commonwealth Parliament as the national Parliament. Soi t is, and surely the functions of a national Parliawhich has served our ment should be national in their scope, and nothing vital to the welfare of the nation should be beyond its legislative competency. But when we study our enumerated powers in the light of the H i g h Court decisions, we find that in respect of matters that each year are becoming more and more important to the well-being of the civilized world, this Parliament is only national in name. The great problem that confronts the world to-day, the Aaron's rod that swallows up all other rods, is the labour question. In some one or other of its myriad aspects it not only impinges upon the periphery, but penetrates to the very centre of every phase of social activity. Finance is one of the most important matters with which this or any Parliament can deal; yet finance is governed by industrial conditions. Do we not repeatedly deplore that continual industrial unrest diminishes the ""productivity of the people, and threatens to shake the State Before this Parliament to its very foundations? In England recently there occurred an industrial upheaval which amounted, in effect, almost to civil war. Never before in her long and splendid history was Englandi n such great peril as she was a fortnight ago. A t one period during the Great War-the fact came to my knowledge as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet-England was within six weeks of defeat by starvation.

I say deliberately-and every man knows the than at that critical statement to be true-that unless we can quesgrapple successfully w it h the industrial imporquestion, this country cannot come into its heritage. We must do what is possible to bring about a modus vivendi between labour and capital. To that the necessary corollary is that Ave must have we must accept the power over both; so much is obvious. A t present, as I have said, we have no power over either; and no one else has, for it is a national matter with which the To find a solution is not easy, States are unable to deal.

But it is admitted by a ! 1 sections of the community that amendments of the Constitution are desirable. Unhappily, there surrounds this great national question the clinging tendrils of party, and every proposed amendment is looked at through party spectacles. That, again, unfortunately, is in the nature of man. bring forward amendments of the Constitution, and they have always been regarded with suspicion. But m y efforts have not been entirely in vain. voting on <the various referendums shows that the people are becoming alive to the necessity for amendments. This brings me to the proposals now before the House. It was stated last night by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that these proposals had come upon us somewhat abruptly, not having been heralded as he conceived to be proper in the circumstances. I shall not discuss that aspect of. the matter. I shall not look this g if t horse in the mouth, for that reason, at any rate. It is enough that it is proposed to amend the Constitution. The situation imposes upon us the solemn duty of looking at these proposals most carefully, in order that the Parliament may be l if t ed out of its present humiliating position. things are now, it can deal with neither labour nor capital. to control any union or any company in this country. It cannot protect a union, nor can it prosecute one. It cannot even make a uniform company law. Nothing could be a greater reflection upon the dignity and the usefulness of this Parliament than the fact that, in its twentyf if t h year, it must confess that it cannot make a u n if o rm company law, let alone deal with the activities of companies, or corporations, as they are technically called, which contribute towards industrial unrest. The present Parliament is in a special sense qualified to deal w i th this matter on its purely industrial side, at any rate, for it was elected in a veritable tumult of industrial unrest, and received probably the most emphatic mandate ever given to the Commonwealth legislature. It has been commissioned to find means of protecting the vital interests of the people of Australia. It is clearly authorized, nay, commanded, to settle, if it can, or to settle as f a r as it can, the industrial unrest that so unhappily disturbs Australia. In the early part of this session, the Prime Minister introduced an amendment of the Crimes Act. In speaking on the second reading of that bill, I ventured to sayThe Government, returned by an overI t has fallen to me many times to whelming majority, has a mandate, if any government ever had, to go to the root of this matter. But we can only play with it unless we amend the Constitution, and give this national Government the power to deal The with these things, which every other Government has. We talk about dealing with industrial questions, and I do not care what measures the Government introduces, its power is so limited that its choice of methods is not very wide. When industrial unrest arises out of a dispute between organized labour and organized capital, whether corporation, combine, or trust, we have no power to deal with either party. A parliament so constituted is national only in name. I hope that tlie Government will at the earliest moment, after having examined this question, permit this House to consider the amendment of the Constitution. Those words set out my attitude towards these amendments. I am unfeignedly glad that the Prime Minister proposes to give the people an opportunity to consider this matter. It would have been well, perhaps, had that been done earlier; but certainly it ought to be done. In considering the Government's proposals we As have to ask ourselves, "" What is the disease fro m which the body politic is It cannot legislate suffering? What is the wrong for which these proposals are declared to be the remedy?"" I have already answered thc question. Industrial unrest is a worldwide phenomenon. It exists in every country. A visitor from England affected the other day to be outraged to the bottom of his soul by the spectacle of industrial unrest in Australia. But as he came from a country where strikes seem to be the favourite recreation of the people, his denunciation of our iniquities f e l l upon deaf ears. It is undeniable, however, that although we do not suffer severely by comparison with some other parts of the world, there is much need for reform. As we are all passionate lovers of our country and desire wholeheartedly that it shall go forward to its great destiny, we must do everything in our power to l i m it industrial unrest to the minimum. More than that we cannot do, human nature being what it is. The disease being industrial unrest, the remedy, to be effective, must be one that goes to its very root. It is not sufficient merely to paint the face of the leper so that it shall assume a healthy normal hue. It is the removal of the leprosy that is required, and if it be necesthis Parliament, but of their nature. I sary for the leper to bathe in Jordan, that must be done. It is of no use for us to tinker with this question. Industrial unrest arises out of the nature of man and the clashing interests of capital and labour. This is particularly so in these modern days when great, and ever greater, masses of capital are needed in order that labour may be employed productively. If by any unhappy chance half of the capital that is now employed should be destroyed, labour would need to exert itself a great deal more than it is doing to bring forth perhaps only 25 per cent, of what it can produce to-day in a given period. Other things being equal, the greater the capital employed the less the exertion that labour is called upon to undergo to produce a given amount of wealth. Clearly, in the very nature of things, clashes are to be expected between capital and labour. Labour in Australia, and in most other countries, is almost wholly organized, and well organized. Rut it is not better organized than capital. Labour is marshalled into what are known as trade unions. Ninety per cent, of capital, on the other hand, is owned by companies or corporations. The amount of production carried on in this country by individuals and not by companies is negligible. Clearly, therefore, we cannot deal with industrial unrest unless we deal with companies as well as with unions. So much I think is obvious. I have in this Parliament on four occasions advocated the amendment of the Constitution. Although the amendments I' proposed at different times differed slightly from one another, in essentials they were the same, covering the same ground in the same way. In each case they were framed to give this Parliament complete power over trade and commerce corporations, trusts and combines and industrial matters. The Leader of the Opposition last night spoke as if the amendments proposed iu 1919 were a radical departure from those proposed in 1915. They were not. It is perfectly true that in 1919, in the circumstances in which we found ourselves at the time, it became expedient to fix a period during which the powers asked for might be exercised. That period was three years. I speak, however, not of the period for Mr Hughe*. which the powers were to be granted to have before me the three pamphlets which were issued to the people, giving the reasons why they should vote for or against the questions submitted at the various referendums. The questions put in 1919 were, in essence, the same as those put in 1915. wise. All I said was that in 1919 there were limitations proposed in regard to the time during which the powers might be exercised. was a limitation of time proposed, but I am speaking of the nature of the powers to be granted. It will be observed that in 1911, 1913, 1915, and 1919 the people were asked to agree to the omission from paragraph (i) of section 51, of all the words after the word ""commerce,"" so that the power of the Commonwealth should extend to the whole of the subject matter, of commerce without any limitation whatever. They were asked that the paragraph dealing with corporations should be deleted, and a new paragraph inserted, and for all practical purposes the new paragraph proposed was the same on all four occasions when the matter was considered by this Parliament, and on the three occasions when it was submitted to the people, and the same thing may be said of the amendment dealing with, trusts and combines. The proposed amendments of our industrial powers followed on each occasion similar lines. These proposals were submitted to the people on three separate occasions. They were withdrawn in 1915, during the war, upon an agreement arrived at with the State Premiers that they would gTant powers sufficient for our purposes, which, in effect, would cover the ground of the proposed amendments to the Constitution. I come now to the criticisms directed to the bill by the Leader of the Opposition. Apart from the point to which I have already referred, the honourable gentleman complained that the Prime Minister had not made a preliminary announcement concerning this matter, which he thought was rather unusual. That seemed to disturb him a good deal. He complained, too,",19,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words

50,Mr Hughes,"I admit that. Therethat Ibe matter should have been discussed with the Premiers of the States. I cept that I discussed these matters w i th the State Premiers on at least f o u r occasions, and my was distinctly unfortunate. no distinction in this regard, between Premiers representing States and Premiers representing Nationalist States. with the one brush. They put forward a hundred reasons why they should not be dethroned; why their splendid majesty should not be tarnished; why they should not be pushed a little from the centre of the stage in order that we might get some foothold upon it . When, under the stress of war, they were driven to make some concession, or appearance of concession and reasonableness, to the people stirred up f a r beyond the point at which they care two straws about State rights-in m y opinion, the people have never cared much about State rightsthe State Premiers came to an agreement with the Commonwealth Government, to which only one of the six made even an attempt to give effect. But for the happy circumstance that the H i g h Court found that the defence power of the Commonwealth was like the widow's cruse, of such a nature that when we wanted a power we had only to dip our hands in this vat of power, and lo, it was there-bu t for this the Parliament would have passed through its severest ordeal hampered and fettered by the dog-in-themanger conduct of the State authorities.

But1 say boldly now that, in my opinion, if the people of this country were given a free and unfettered opportunity to express their opinion, they would prefer a Constitution vesting sovereign powers in the Commonwealth, and allowing it to transfer powers to the State authorities, after the fashion provided for in the shall say nothing about that, exCanadian and SouthA f r i c a n constitutions. I venture to say that if the State authorities ever put the matter to the experience test, they w ill find that the citizens of the I draw States have not forgotten that they are also citizens of the Commonwealth.. The Labour setting, of men in their capacity of citizens of a State against themselves as They were all tarred citizens of the Commonwealth has lost all its magic. The rceople now demand that they shall have the legislation they require. They do not care two straws whether the instrumentality exercising the power to legislate calls itself a municipality, a state, or a commonwealth. But there are some powers which can be exercised only by this Parliament, and commerce is one of them. The power who by that time were over commerce is clearly as wide as the continent, and this Parliament alone can exercise it . The same observation applies eoually to the power to control corporations and industrial matters. The proposals of the Prime Minister, as seen through the spectacles of the Leader of the Opposition, are open to certain objections. To the first proposed amendment, omitting the words in the paragraph dealing with conciliation and arbitration that confine our jurisdiction to interstate disputes, the Leader of the Opposition, I understand, takes no exception, but, on the contrary, approves of the proposal. On the other hand, he is very strongly opposed to the second paragraph, proposing the establishment of authorities with such powers as the Parliament confers on them with respect to the regulation I understand that and determination of terms and condiconsulting them on tions of industrial employment, and of the Perhapsi f they had rights and duties of employers and employees, with respect to industrial matters and things. He contends that this power should be granted to the Parliament. OnI have always, in and out the whole, I am inclined to agree with him. Since what this Parliament, suffers from is the want of power, and since our reason for going to the people is to ask them to grant us power, and we are responsible for the request, it appears curious that we should confess unfitness to be trusted with its exercise. The objections put forward by the Prime Minister to the exercise of tlii3 power by the Parliament were not without force. He said that Parliament could not deal directly mentioned overburden and administration us considering any other subject. But we must consider that the grant of power is one thing, and the extent to which it is exercised is quite another. the Prime Minister, and other of the House, that the powers which by this bill it is sought to persuade people to grant are powers which the British Parliament So, too, have the State Parliaments. grant of additional power to this Parliament wheel of fortune-upon terpretations the High Court-yet other countries enjoy powers which are almost limitless.

There is nothing in the Constitution taxing them until they have nothing left. Surely no power transcends that. the taxation of capital, or a capital levy; but what does it matter capital if the Parliament taxation all that capital produces?

Experience has taught the people a lesson; they want to give this Parliament power tp deal with industrial except unrest. To do that we must have power over every part of the field of industrial that is physically unrest. Over trade and commerce, over that it cannot do. It can corporations, over trade unions. Every the King from his throne, parliament in the world-Americ a alone excepted-ha s these powers. As we of motor cars or pass some already possess great powers which we And have not abused, and as upon every Parlimitless power it has always liament that abuses its powers retribution comes swift and severe, I venture to say that we shall have a much better chance unsullied, of carrying the proposals than ever we There has had before if we say to them, "" This is There is a the power that the Parliament must have if it is to protect your interests."" As to the power itself, one party would propose although to use it in one way and another party our masters in a different way; but in the end the people will decide to what extent and in what way it shall be used. As to the in any set of abuse of power, the judge upon the bench This Parliament has may abuse his power, the soldier to whom to taxation. a rifle is given may use it to shoot his whose fears have officer; and members of parliament may excited by stories of the abuse their authority-bu t none survive long to tell the tale. Those men are likely to represent the people longest who best interpret the people's will as mirconfiscate rored in their concept of what is best in the country's interests. I to prevent us from entirely agree with the Prime Minister literally that we should tell the people that we have no intention of exercising this Men may, if they like, talk about power directly. We made no attempt to exercise the power of conciliation and who has the arbitration directly. It never occurred can take by to us to do so. We appointed indepenIfI dent persons to act for us in that case, and so we shall do in this. But while this Parliament will not exercise the power directly it must have authority to take whatever action is necessary to e nsure industrial peace. Industrial unrest takes a thousand shapes. We must be able to deal with it in all circumstances. mirrored in the past, and we cannot, by looking back, arrange our conduct aud policy so as to meet every difficulty that may arise. If we try to do so we shall find ourselves bitterly disappointed. No one can say how this power must be used; but we know that, if given, it will be used for the benefit of the people. Whatever is necessary for their protection shall be done. I am a believer in strong government. and respect a strong government: the worse and least excusable fault of an administration is weakness. But what avails strength without adequate means to give effect to its resolutions? A government and a parliament must have necessary powers. If we desired a victory, should we arm our obsolete weapons and to their courage; rather send them forth with the latest and most effective instruments of war-' fare? We should have this power to use if and when circumstances demand; but we should never dream of using as fix directly the basic, wage, or to grapple with the problem of child endowment and other questions which should be referred to properly constituted tribunals. realize what it is we are handing over to these authorities. We may clothe them with very great powers. can dissolve. the conditions of appointment. must give these authorities such conditions as would make positions upon them attractive to good men, and thus it may easily come about that we may set up a tribunal such as a High Court, which is independent of every other institution in the country, and supreme over them within the limits of its jurisdiction. We are going to hand over to these authorities power over matters vital to the welfare of this country. will the hours to be worked, the wages to be paid, whether child endowment shall be a principle of the industrial system, how it shall be engrafted in the wage system, and a hundred and one other questions. When this authority has been set up the Parliament can do The future is not wholly nothing. Eighty per cent, of the people of this country are wage earners, and it is these authorities that will deal with the only things that really matter to that 80 per cent. They will be, in effect, industrial legislatures or dictators. The right honourable gentleman and other honourable members on this side, myself included, would be the last in the world to set up a soviet. But I ask my right honourable friend, what is this but a The people expect potential soviet? It may be a. fascist soviet; but, at any rate, it will be a council determining the hours and conditions of labour of the whole community. That is exactly what the soviet council does. There is nothing to prevent the creation of an individual soviet or council attached to every industry, with a grand council over the whole. I fighters with ask honourable members to look at that trust wholly position. I am against setting up should we not authorities having supreme power over matters absolutely vital to the people. This Parliament must be supreme. I come, now, to the third point made by the Leader of the Opposition-that it it to do such things is not proposed to ask for power to legislate in relation to corporations. It is not proposed to do this. I think this a cardinal error. Corporations are the entities with which organized Honourable members must labour has to deal. Honourable members do not complain of the proposal to ask for power to control trade unions. They ought to be legislated for to their own good.

Over those interests we have no authority whatever. plain words in the Constitution-and no words could indicate more plainly that this Parliament was intended to exercise its power to deal with corporations-the H i e h Court ruled otherwise. The Deakin Government piloted through Parliament, or, at all events, drafted, a Companies B ill , but the H i g h Court ruled that, although this Parliament has power to usher companies into the world, and, possibly, to attend their obsequies, it has no control whatever over their actions. It may be that the court, as now constituted, takes a different view. If so, it becomes more necessary to set down beyond the vagaries and shifting opinions of any court what the powers of the people are. In regard to the trade and commerce power, a previous H i g h Court held-the present court takes a different view-that there is an underlying principle permeating the Constitution. trine of reserved laid down, every section is to be interpreted in such a way as to favour the sovereignty of the States and to Parliament. The Commonwealth Legislature should have power over corporations, direct and without limitations, and the grant of it should be expressed in language that is unambiguous. In drafting, every additional word is a danger; in seeking to cover a wider field we may find that we have vacated that which we held. The only safe course is to seek f u l l power over trade and commerce, corporations, and industrial matters. with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that the power which the Government seeks in relation to "" trusts and combinations in restraint of t r a d o "" is not sufficient. Proposed paragraph x l i i would be more effective if it followed the wording of the 1915 b ill, namelyTrusts, combinations, monopolies, and arrangements in relation tola) the production, supply of goods, or the supply of services; or (6) the ownership of the means of production, manufacture, or supply of goods, or supply of services.

The vital Federal principle of the Constitution remains unimpaired after a quarter of a century, and the proposal to transfer this, that, or the other power, does not affect in any way the federalism of the two entities-the people and the States-o n which our Constitution is founded. I agree entirely with the Prime Minister that there is nothing sacrosanct about our Constitution. We say pious things of, and pay our sincere homage to, the great ancestral institutions of Britain, under which we have won and keep our freedom, and we believe that her form of government is the best. gathering tution, or an historic practice; but the birth of the Australian Constitution is remembered by us all. Some of us took part in endeavouring to induce the people to accept it . It is not like the laws of the Medes and Persians-unalterable . It is the thing with which we started work. It is like a schoolboy's suit, which this young nation, as it has reached to manhood's stature and proportions, has outgrown. We should survey the situation frankly, and, every time we find our clothes too small, should tell the people that a larger suit is necessary. Without any desire to lay unholy hands on a sanctified institution, let us tell the people how we feel about the industrial and commercial powers which we are seeking from them. HereI join issue with the Government on the question of procedure. I frankly confess that I am astonished at the action of the Government in submitting this bill . recently re-read the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General at the opening of this Parliament. is no announcement in it of an intention to submit during this session what is obviously the most imnortant measure of the session. either, in the Government's policy speech. Government's policy, for there were many statements of policy, by the Government and many answers by the Opposition. The answers were disbelieved by the electors, and the policy statements were accepted. I think I can show that there was an intention on the part of the Government to submit proposals for amendments of the Constitution at some stage during this Parliament. We have just come from a general election, in which the people voted, by a large majority, for the Government's policy. The right honourable the Prime Minister, in introducing the bill, said that it was only an advance step in a general re-building by this Parliament of the Constitution. There is to be a constitutional session at Canberra, or elsewhere, during the life of this, the tenth, Parliament. That being so, are we to have in three years four appeals to the electors-for that is what this proposal means ? Are we to thrust the people, in the middle of winter, into a I can imagine a sanctity hurried and unannounced referendum round an historic insticampaign, and ask them to determine the most vital proposals they have ever been called. upon to consider ? If the bill is only a first step, the recent general election will be followed in a few months by a referendum, and, later, by another referendum and a general election. AH those appeals to the people will be made in the course of three years, and the fact that the last two may coincide in point of time makes little or no difference. Members of the Government may solace themselves by believing that they w ill obtain a large vote because of the compulsory provisions of the electoral law; but the proposals may still be unfair to the people. I doubt whether it is fair to make voting on proposals for altering the Constitution compulsory. I am not, however, finally pronouncing on that. On this question the important thing is not the quantity, but the quality, of the vote. The great fights that were conI have ducted in 1911 and 1913 roused the people and re-educated them on the subject of the Constitution. The great adThere vantage of the vote was not that the party advocating reforms won or lost, but that the people were dragged from their homes by a natural desire to see the fight conducted in the public halls of this country. The educative effect of the campaign was of even more It may be read into the importance than the adoption of the Constitution, and that effect cannot be obtained on the present occasion if , in the middle of winter, we suddenly spring a proposition of this importance on the people. We may compel them to vote, but we cannot compel them to read the arguments for or against the proposition. Even allowing the right honourable gentleman's contention that this matter is vital, I fear that he will find the people cold to",27,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words

An appeal at a wrong time, particularly if it be a referendum, may f a i l. Those are a few plain words in opposition to the procedure adopted by the Government, and adopted, doubtless, deliberately. I ask the Prime Minister, why all this hurry, in view of the fact that we are to have, during this Parliament, a session for the revision of the Constitution ? said that this question was urgent; but he gave no proof of that. His speech contained merely a declaration that the Government considered it urgent. Why is it urgent? W h y is it more urgent today than it was immediately before the genera] election ?' the Prime Minister wants to go to England. motive, and in a matter of this kind I suggest that honourable members should be above making such petty insinuations. Why is the question deemed urgent now, when it was not urgent a few months ago ? Only one thing has happened since the election, and that is the decision of the H i g h Court on question of the 44 or 48 hour-week. Isi t necessary to spring on the people a bill of this kind without notice, and to take a referendum at huge expense, because of that decision ? That difficulty will adjust itself in the ordinary course of industrial evolution long before the people can register an opinion on this question. I take leave respectfully to tell the Government that to have a hurried referendum on a special issue because of that conflict of authority, if it be a conflict, is bad tactics, to which I am sure the people will not respond. As the honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) reminded the House, even if this proposition is accepted by the people, the Parliament w ill not give it effect for nine or ten months. rise in Augusti t is unlikely that we shall settle down to serious business u n t i l early in the new year. Where, then, is the ground of urgency? If we place upon the Government the onus of proof of I am a great urgency, further evidence is required than the Prime Minister has yet produced. While I declare these things, and declare them rather more emphatically than other speakers, because I feel strongly about them, I am by no means satisfied with the condition of industrial arbitration in this country. No observer or student of economics can be unaware of the bad conditions into which we have gravitated-condition s which do not differ fundamentally from those that have existed since the failure The right honourable gentleman of the 1919 referendum. Those unsatisfactory conditions prove the importance of this action, but not the urgency of it . AgainI say to the Government, the necessity for hasty or immediate action has not been established. L e t us review the state of industrial affairs in Australia. It is due to Federal limitation, as has been stated often in this House, and was It may be urgent because re-emphasized this afternoon by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes). There are other contributing I am not implying any causes, but the Federal limitation is a basic cause and irremovable except by action of this kind. Out of it arises the conflict of jurisdiction, the overlapping, the duplication in authority and in appeal, and the ruinous competition between Federal and State authorities, which has been to the lasting disadvantage of the the workers and those who have capital in vested in business. But, apart from this basic cause, there are many causes of trouble which spring out of the process of arbitration which the Commonwealth has established-that is to say, the Arbitration Court. Our system is the apotheosis of the jurist, who officiates amid the pomp and embellishment of a court, and surThis is panic counsel, and rounded by expensive lawyers. In the atmosphere of opposition and conflict of such a court, there can be no real conciliation, and little entirely acceptable arbitration. I speak now with some knowledge of what the court has done to benefit the worker particularly, and to stabilize industry; it has done it not because a jurist presided, but despite that fact. Much better results would have followed had other means been emI f we ployed. One direct result of the system we have established and followed is",28,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words
60,Mr West,,29,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words
61,Mr Watt,"that conciliation, which was supposed to be the first step to arbitration, has been forgotten. In our Arbitration Court conciliation is dead and buried. The first President of the Court was known, and, in his legal capacity, respected by all of us. He paid no attention to the conciliation provisions of the Constitution, or to the debates of the Convention, which put conciliation before arbitration. He apparently doubted the wisdom of the court concerning itself in any way with conciliatory preliminaries. That was because he preferred to sit on high on his bench, as all judges do, and hear third-rate evidence of the plaintiff's case through solicitors and barristers, theory of collective bargaining. all of them, except the men who gave the original instructions, being essentially ignorant of the industrial conditions concerned, both generally and specially. That is the attitude of the judge and the court in our prevailing industrial system. gentleman suspended me last year for saving less than that about the judges! was not suspended-hi s memory is at fault. He would have been suspended had it not been for my good nature. He made a violent attack upon a Supreme Court judge in Victoria in the discharge of his strictly judicial work. speaking of what I know of the practice of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and the same procedure has been followed by his successor and the two deputy presidents. cede the judicial procedure in many instances. sory; and that is not conciliation. I know that there are boards of reference also, but there is always the atmosphere of a court, and the conclusions that are reached must be submitted to the court in order to make the agreement a binding one. Under such a system of compulsion it is not likely that binding and stable agreements will be reached. Not only has conciliation been dropped out of sight in the operation of our industrial laws, but serious delays have arisen in consequence of the legal methods adopted. There are no short cuts.

The ex-Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) did so in a dispute connected with the coal industry, and subsequently established a special triI am bunal to deal with that industry.

Another source of trouble under the present system has been the absence of power to enforce awards. Many men have abandoned compulsory arbitration because they say it is impossible to compel large bodies of unionists to accept the decisions of the court.

73,Mr Watt,"It is in order that wemember's motion, that we should crea+e some administrative machinery to police awards and determinations of the court. I think that the honourable member, as a lawyer, would admit that it could be done without any alteration of the Constitution. But it has not been done, nor is it intended to do it, so far as I can see. Out of the creation of this cumbersome machinery, which does not seek conciliation, and has no power to enforce its awards, have arisen a number of blunders which unionists and employers alike deplore. One principle on which the court has operated is the most amaz. ing that I have ever heard stated. Mr frankly that I have a great respect for Justice Higgins declared, in his capacity as president of the court, that he would not consider whether an industry could stuid the payment of a minimum wage, but intended to fix the wage that it would have to pay. He is the first and only man who, during my public life, has declared that profits do not and should not condition wages, and I know of no economist who would do so. The application of so crude and bald a policy to the' economic life of a young country like onrs, in its present stage of partial development, could have no other effect than to damage industry. For an academic economist on the bench to work on the assumption that an irreducible living wage must be paid in all industries is ridiculous. It is a slow form of industrial suicide to put into operation. But because the statement came from the lips of a judge people seem to be afraid to challenge it. Statements of that.kind have never been made by the members of wages boards. of any industry closing down in consequence of Mr Justice Higgins' adherence to that principle. cannot be well acquainted with our industrial history.

Unless we are very careful, I think we are in imminent danger of repeating thu follies and blunders of the past. I do not say that that must necessarily happen, but it is a danger. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) alluded to the fact that if these proposals are adopted, the three men who will be called upon to exercise this power will have larger power than even this Parliament, and larger power, I venture to say, than has ever been entrusted to any men in normal times in British history. It will be not merely administrative, but also legislative power. Whether this bill is passed in its present form or not, the three men who will be appointed under the Judiciary Bill will possess the whole of our arbitration authority, and in their position of authority they will have more effect on the position, incomes, prospects, employment, and wealth of the working classes than the whole of the Parliaments of Australia. That will be so, irrespective of the alteration of the Constitution; but if the policy of the Government in correlation with this bill is given effect, these three men will hold in the hollow of their hand the fortunes, prospects, and careers of at least 80 per cent, of the Australian people. affect the fortunes of the other 20 per cent. of the proposals to grant extended powers.",30,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words

It w ill be greater than any of us eujoy, greater than this Governmentenjoys, and greater than the whole of the Australian Parliaments enjoy. Eveni f they were angels from HeavenI should hesitate to repose in the three new jurists of the Arbitration Court the enormous powers which must be given under this extension of powers and the Judiciary B ill which the Government has introduced. this place up altogether. deavour to show that there is another course. The new judges w ill probably endeavour to aggrandize their position as other men have done before them. They w ill seek to magnify the importance of their court. They w ill keep as much power in their hands as possible, and no matter how conscientiously they may discharge their duties, they must compete one against the other, and that not necessarily for popularity only. It must be remembered that they will have no public opinion to guide them. honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said that the safety in giving larger power to Parliament was that even if it were abused by the members of Parliament, those who abused it could soon be replaced by others. Buti f we give a l if e tenure to these judges, and equip them with such tremendous powers, and they abuse those powers, their removal can be effected only by a resolution passed by both Houses. I ask the Government to pause before it goes so far as to place these men in charge of a machine which they will be tempted to operate u n t i l it makes them veritable industrial autocrats. I am a believer in the wages board principle for the consideration of industrial problems, and the prevention and settlement of disputes. I was born and bred in this State, which -first experimented with wages boards, and T h a t is so. If the exmy public life has been spent in it . I know that mistakes have been made in connection with wages boards. A t one time the legislature appointed the memI. bers of the boards, but later the automatic system of appointment was developed, because employers, employees, and the general community alike became satisfied with the work of the boards. Let me briefly compare the wages board principle .with the Arbitration Court principle that we have developed. The comparison may be made more extensively later, but it may be stated in a few words now. The wages boards constitute a system of collective bargaining. The employers and employees, sitting together, study the problems which they have been called upon to determine. They know how much their respective sides can give, and not infrequently it has happened that they have reached a determination withI think not. I shall enout calling upon the chairman to exercise his authority, other than to preserve order and direct the procedure. In one case in particular, which has become famous because of the criticism it has been subjected to, the chairman was called upon to frame a most difficult log of wages and conditions. He was a man of great experience in other lines, though not in this one; but in a few weeks he had signed a perfect log w i th the f u l l agreement of both sides, and on not one occasion during the The righ t discussion did he need to give a casting vote. That has happened on many occasions. In so far as the wages board principle has been adopted in our economic and industrial life, it has been for the lasting benefit of all concerned. There is no collective bargaining through the medium of barristers in a supreme or arbitration court, with final arbitral powers. We should do our best to develop in the an indignant Parliament on Pederal sphere the system of wages boards, which hitherto we have neglected. Perhaps the greatest advantage of the wages board system is that the men on each side who sit at the table to make the award know the conditions of the industry with which they are concerned. On the one side practically all their capital is invested in it , and on the other side practically their whole l if e has been spent in it . The prospects of both parties are bound up",31,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words

86,Mr Watt,"w i th thc successful solution of the problem they are called on to consider. No employer or employee can get away with a falsehood in any matter under consideration, for all the parties concerned would know it to be a falsehood. The chairman and members of a wages board do not arrive at a decision upon evidence skilfully submitted, but upon craft knowledge and their intimate acquaintance with the facts of the industry with which they are concerned. There is a check upon one side by the other, and the balance is well-nigh perfect so long as both sides select reasonable men to represent them. It is the most expert industrial tribunal that can be called together. The only difficulty is that of securing an ideal chairman. We are not always able to get such a man in this or in any other part of Australia. MrI i . GREEN -Ho w is the public represented on a wages board? the authority and morale of the chairman, and by the fact that the people generally know what effect upon the industry a decision by the board is likely to have. I do not say that we could not improve the wages-board system by the appointment of a representative of the consumers, but self-interest and experience are checks which produce a balance on a wages board which cannot be secured in the decision of a court. the wages boards. their operation is infinitely swifter than that of any other system for the settlement of questions that has been devised. A t present, we have three judges operating under our limited jurisdiction, and, if we are to have only three when we secure the more ample jurisdiction proposed, the delays of to-day in the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Court w ill be as nothing to the delays of to-morrow. We must invent some system which w ill give expedition if it is to be without other serious disadvantages. I have known wages boards to be called into existence in a week, not because there was trouble, but because there was the unanimous desire shown by employers and employees to have such wages boards operating, and in several cases determinations upon which the industries concerned operated for years were arrived at within a month. ceedings have been protracted and an appeal made to a court on legal grounds. very many such cases in this part of Australia.

It would be remarkable if it achieved expedition and complete success. I do not think that such difficulties have arisen in Victoriai n connection with the boot trade or the white-workers' trade. I do not know the temperament or the capacity of any of the men who constitute the coal board, but I am certain of the greater wisdom of the principle of the wages board in 99 cases out of 100 when compared with the Arbitratio n Court. I was going to say that only deal with disputes intra-state. tation under the Constitution as it stands. We are hoping that complete industrial authority will be given to the Commonwealth, but I do not think we could entrust to three jurists exclusive power for the regulation of wages and conditions of industry the exercise of which they are not equipped to perform. gentleman is not suggesting that, under the proposed amendment of the Constitution, we could not do what he suggests in the establishment of wages boards ? could be done.

If the community could be satis. fled that the exercise of the powers sought would be provided for by thecreation of a scheme for which the Government would make itself responsible, and that the wages board principles would be the basis of that scheme for giving effect to the new powers in the Federal arena, we should get an enormously increased vote in favour of these proposals. I fear the operation of these powers by judges. Mention was made hy the Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney, and the Leader of the Opposition, of the provisions of the bill dealing with authorities. It seems to me that some confusion exists, for which probably the rapid utterance of. the Prime Minister, as he reached the conclusion of his speech, may be responsible. There are three things to be considered in connection with the proposed new paragraph XL. First of all, what is the Government's intention; secondly, as to the wisdom of it if we read the bill aright; and thirdly, whether it is possible to do what the Government suggests. The Prime Minister said that there is no desire for the exercise by Parliament of all the powers which we seek from the people, b uÂ£ rather to give them to authorities created under special legislation passed by this Parliament. The desire apparently is to short-circuit Parliament, to cut it out, leaving these things to some created authority, so that the Parliament may be free to do other work instead' of being called upon to deal with economic and industrial matters. Some men believe that that can ba done, and believe in its wisdom. I do not believe in its wisdom, if what I have suggested is what the clause means. I believe that this Parliament should ask the people for these powers, at the same time saying deliberately hat + it would devise machinery for their proper exercise. I do not believe that the power should be pawned to a court in advance. venomously, or in opposition to the Government, as the Prime Minister is aware; hut I believe that if we secure increased jurisdiction this Parliament should be responsible for the acceptance and discharge of the larger powers granted. In actual practice it would not Mr Watt. itself exercise the powers once in a hundred times. It would create machinery for the proper discharge of those powers; but at any time it should be in a position to call back any power which it gives, or destroy any authority which it creates. Anything which would tie the hands of the Parliament in the discreet exercise of any powers entrusted to it under the Constitution would be unwise. bill to prevent the Government from doing what the right honourable member suggests. the right honourable gentleman is speaking now as the head of the Government, intent on carrying this bill, or as a lawyer. what would be the actual power given under this measure. gentleman speaks in his dual capacity, doubtless.. the legal advisers of the Crown. orable gentleman's legal adviser has considered the matter or the bill would not be framed in the way it is.

Australia led the world in the great national experiment of compulsory arbitration.

The right honourable member for Balaclava has clearly stated that in determining wages and conditions under the system of compulsory arbitration in vogue for the last twenty years, the court has completely ignored the economic conditions upon which alone the industries of this country can achieve success. again and again that it is concerned only with the cost of living, and by its cumulative awards has increased the cost of living u n t il the unfortunate worker who has placed his trust in the court has become bewildered. has no clear money to-day. The cost of living has greatly risen owing to this floundering instrument of industrialism. The present system of arbitration is fundamentally wrong. I listened with interest to the splendid address of the right honourable member for North Sydney, who painted in wonderful colours the picture of a great nation struggling for power. He would have l e f t us with the impression that Australia has no power to protect itself industrially, but I contend that complete and absolute power exists within Australia to deal with all industrial matters as the people think f it , but they in their wisdom have limited the power of the Commonwealth to disputes extending beyond the boundaries of any one State. This Parliament derives its right to interfere in industrial matters only by the provision of the Constitution relating to conciliation and compulsory tion. ditions that satisfy either the employer or the employee. It has ruined the economic standard upon which industry can successfully thrive, and we are now asked to of compulsory arbitration the whole of the industries of Australia. for I from both sides of the House, and I have watched the progress of events outside, particularly references from industrial centres. It seems to me that in industrial matters we have completely boxed the compass. Honourable members are at their wits' end to know what is to be done.

It is sought to-day to obtain for the But what is Pederal Parliament complete and absolute power over all industrial conditions. It has rightly been said that there are many entanglements across the approach of the court, and that many of its awards are exceedingly complicated. There are three courses open to the Government: first to let the present system continue; The court has laid down secondly, to remove it by the process of making this Parliament, and any instruments created under it , supreme in the land; and thirdly, to call a halt, to review the situation and to ask the Federal authorities to recede from the sphere of He industrialism altogether except in relation to two industries. I know of only two industries that are practically bevond control by the States. One is the shipping industry. The seamen on our coast should not be paid different wages, and be employed under different conditions on different stages of the journey. The other is the coal-mining industry. Onlyi n respect to shipping and coal m in ing may the arbitration system be said to be interstate in its incidence. There exists between the mine-owner and the miner, who feels that he is hewing dividends for his employer, a gulf as wide as hell itself.

State Arbitration Courts; they know conditions better. I am not influenced in my statement by the fact that there are State Arbitration Courts. I personally prefer, not the wages board system, but a devolutionary system that permits those in the industry to go right into the factories and shops to fix wages and conditions. What is the use of a system under which no first-hand knowledge is possessed by those who have to settle disputes. The workers are disturbed in an industry. They go to their unions who, in turn, go to their industrial pleader. He goes to the judge, who in his turn makes a pronouncement based chiefly upon a compromise. So crafty and clever have become the industrial manipulators that outrageous claims have been made in the hope that the award of the court would be something near what the applicants really expected and desired. pay no regard to the economic conditions by which industries must be regulated if they are to endure and prosper. So uneconomic is the system that has grown up, largely because of compulsory arbitration, that the products of the secondary industries cannot be sold in the markets of the world. What representative of the primary producers will take the risk of voting for a measure which, if endorsed by the people, will place all rural industries at the mercy of a central arbitration court, presided over by three lawyers who have been elevated to the bench but have no first-hand knowledge of country conditions? Even now, only a few of our primary products can be profitably placed in the overseas markets. can be exported only by the payment of a bounty in Australia and the granting of preference in the markets of Great Britain. which is exported a bounty is paid. I do not object to the payment of a bounty to some new experimental industry or to an existing' industry that requires assistance to tide it over a crisis; but it is false economy to dip into the public treasury and practically pay pensions to industries that are as old as the nation the honourable itself, in order that they may place their products upon the markets of the world. By such expedients this country is being reduced to a wretched condition. Of secondary products, practically none except manufactured primaries can be marketed overseas. How can this nation become great, how can we expect population to come to Australia when such woefully unsound conditions obtain? I say, in all sincerity, to employers and employees, "" You have had twenty years' experience of the fundamentally unsound system of allowing other people to prescribe the conditions of your industry. Get closer together, and fix your own conditions."" There must be a change of system and a change of heart before Australian industry can be placed upon a sound economic basis. Those who differ from me I refer to the soldier settlers, who, of all men in the country, deserve an opportunity to prosper. Those engaged in the dairying industry are settled upon some of the richest land in Australia. A competent board bought Such methods for them land in the most favoured districts at current market values; certainly no exorbitant prices were paid. The soldier settlers in Victoria were lucky in having the services of Mr Mclvor and other members of a board, which has worked with patience, knowledge, and sympathy for the soldier. It has purchased land, built homes, and made working improvements. Yet, notwithstanding the advance of Â£2,500 of capital by the State, and favorable weather conditions, the average soldier dairy farmer and his wife, by working seven days a week, taking no holidays, and living a life of drudgery, can only earn between them half the present basic wage. That is the sorry plight of thousands of young soldiers and their brides who have settled on Dried fruits ready-made dairy farms in Victoria. The time has come to cry a halt.

I may be told that the proposed industrial authorities will operate in a devolutionary way. I remind the Attorney-General that whatever power the Commonwealtli has to-day in respect to industrial matters arises out of the reference in the Constitution to conciliation and arbitration. The proposal now before the House is either a g r a f t upon that principle, or is at attempt to set up side by side w it h it a new system that The Govenroent is proposing to establish an industrial authority which w ill have power to legislate and regulate.

The system suits the single While the Government is placing before but it is of no benefit to the the country proposals for an alteration of the Constitution for the purpose of giving the Commonwealth greater powers in regard to industry, two great unions are resisting Federal awards, and one has declared a preference for the State award. The Isfew South Wales Parliament by statute established a working week of 44 hours. That was in conflict w it h the Federal Arbitration Court's award of 48 hours. The workers rejected the arbitration award, and both employers and employees have shown such an absolute lack of confidence in the system of compulsory arbitration that they have accepted the working week of 44 hours established by the State authority in defiance of the Pederal authority. garding the extension of the Commonwealth power. both sides have made an abject surrender to the State authority. In my opinion, By this this bill represents an attempt to persevere w it h a system that has failed. The industrialists are divided in regard to it . When the workers consider that they have a grievance, they sliould have a ready reference to a tribunal that is thoroughly conversant w it h the conditions of their industry. The employers should take the workers more into their confidence, as has been done with such signal success in the United States of America; and I do not know why this Government, of all governments, should want to persevere with compulsory arbitration, which the whole outside world has rejected. It is idle to complain of the constitutional limitation of this Parliament's powers in respect ignores compulsory arbitration. of industrial matters. The industrialists have all the power I am prepared to give to them; indeed, they have too much.

The right honourable member had either to forswear himself or to support the amendment. I was particularly gratified to find that early in the debate the right lionorable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) was prepared to give forceful expression to his views. It is a pity that amendments of the Constitution are so difficult to bring about. Without saying anything derogatory to the framers of the Constitution, who were capable men, 1 consider that they followed too slavishly the constitution of the United States of America. When the Fisher Government in 1911 proposed amendments of the Constitution, the then member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine), who is now Chief Justice of Victoria, said that it was essential that the Commonwealth Parliament should have greater powers; but that, as the Labour party was in possession of the Treasury bench, he would not support the proposals. Some honourable members have referred in glowing terms to the constitution of the United States of America; but, had it not been for that"" noted jurist, Judge Marshall, giving a wide and liberal interpretation of that constitution, the people of the United States of America would not have been able to live under it . That man seemed to be inspired in his interpretation, and his decisions enabled that great country to progress. Australia to-day, like the United States of Americai n the past, has suffered from too narrow an interpretation of the Constitution. Under recent decisions of the H i g h Court, we are in a better position than formerly, and, if the whole matter We have stated our were put to the test, it might happen that the H i g h Court would now concede more powers to us than we realize that we possess. I am not a unificationist, although I would unhesitatingly abolish the State Parliaments and substitute something different in their place. The most recent example of a federation is furnished by the South African Union. The white population there is much No t one speaker on the Gosmaller than that of Australia.

In order to get out of our difficulties we need the support of a majority of the people and a majority of the States. It might happen that, although we had a majority of 400,000 or 500,000 votes, the proposal would be lost because a majority of the States did not favour it.

When the American Constitution was framed, no steamer had ever crossed the ocean, and the electric telegraph and many other modern inventions were unknown. The circumstances under which the constitution of the United States of America was framed were peculiar. been a war which resulted in the severance of the American colonies from Great Britain, and when Washington, Hamilton, and others, assembled to draw up a constitution, their desire was to make it so binding that the American people could not evade it . If all parties in this House and in the country were united on the question of altering the constitution, there would still be great difficulty in altering it . The sister dominion of Canada framed a constitution at a time when she had the experience of the United States of America to guide her, but she did not copy their constitution.

The number of members of parliament in Australia is not so large as it was, for the Labour Government of Queensland has abolished the Upper House there as a useless excrescence; but even now we have something like 600 members of parliament. For my part, though I do not know that all my colleagues would agree with me, and I am sure that the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), and some other honourable members who support the Government, would disagree.

I consider that we should be wise if we followed the South African, and, to some extent, the Canadian example, and clothed the National Parliament w it h f u l l powers, and the State Parliaments w i th limited powers, and reduced the number of members of parliament. I think it would be worthwhile if , irrespective of the present State boundaries, we were to divide Australia into, say, twenty provinces, each During the regime with a population of something like the Deakin Government, Mr 300,000 people. would be a few provinces in Svdney alone. 1,000,000 people, would have a community of interest, and it would be advisable, probably, to make Sydney into a single province. The same thing could be done with Melbourne. Wherever there was shown to be community of interest, I should set up a separate province. That would do away with the necessity for creating new States. The Riverina, for instance, could have a provincial parliament. The sooner we face the question of constitutional amendment in a big way, the better for Australia; for it is high time that we had a Constitution more in consonance with the views of the people.

If there is any way by which we could submit them to the people, w it h the approval of all the of the Constitution; parties represented in the Parliament, it would be wise for us to find it , even if it took us some time to do so.

It provides for alterations similar to those which the Labour Government endeavoured to have made in. 1915.

With the exception of one or two words, the proposals as now submitted by the Leader of the Opposition are identical with those agreed to by the Labour party iu 1915. These words are used for a purpose. I personally prefer in an act of Parliament that as few words as possible should be used, that they should be plain words, and easily understood; but if the proposals submitted by the Leader of the Opposition contain a few more words than are contained in the proposals of the Government, their purpose is to make the position more secure. If the Attorney-General examines the words of the amendment he will, I think, recognize that, on a test of their constitutionality, they would have a better chance of passing the scrutiny of the High Court than would the words used in setting out the proposals of the Government. course, defer to the honourable gentleman as a legal man understanding his business, but I know why the amendment has been framed in the way in which it has been submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. I assume that honourable members on the other side accepted the proposals of the Government because they were satisfied with the explanation of them sriven by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, but it is of no use to ask for an amendment of the Constitution on lines through which some legal gentleman could drive a coach and four. Whatever is put to the people should be able to stand the test of examination by the High Court. For these reasons I favour the phraseology of the amendment. I thought that we might before now have heard what the Government intends to do.

I believe that the Prime Minister will eventually accept some of They the suggestions which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. The proposals of the Leader of the Opposition would, if agreed to by the people, give this Parliament the ample powers which we think it should have. He proposes that we should ask for powers with regard toLabour and employment, and unemployment, including(a) the terms and conditions of labour and employment in any trade, industry, occupation, or calling; (b) the rights and obligations of employers and employees; (c) strikes and lockouts; {d) the maintenance of industrial peace; and (e) the settlement of industrial disputes. What words could be added to make the power more complete? If the people granted this power, this Parliament could pass legislation which must be beneficial to the whole community. TheI , of Attorney-General may contend that the proposals submitted by the Government would give us all we are asking for; but I know that in 1915 all the words used in the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition were considered absolutely necessary to make the position secure. The burden of the Prime Minister's complaint in introducing the bill was that at present the Commonwealth has not full powers to deal with industrial matters. It cannot intervene in disputes that do not extend beyond the limits of a State. We may have operating within the limits of one State a giant organization in which millions are invested, and by which thousands of men are employed, and should a dispute occur in connection with it this Parliament is powerless to intervene. As the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) said, when on previous occasions we asked for increased powers we did not receive the assistance even from State Labour Governments that might have been expected. I believe in consulting the State authorities as far as practicable, but the powers of this Parliament in industrial matters should not be confined I am afraid that is the to industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State.

I do not know how far the Government's proposals will affect them; but all we know is, that it is asking for additional powers in industrial matters, and reference is vaguely made to trusts and combinations.

In 1915 a book was published containing the argument for and against the (referendum then proposed to be taken. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister at the time, and put the case for the referendum. The following statement was contained in that book"": Now, we all know how the cost of living has increased, so that it is with the utmost difficulty that the bulk of the community are able, even with thc greatest economy, to make both ends meet, and, making every allowance for the effects of the drought, there can be no doubt whatever that this is due very largely to manipulation of the market by unscrupulous persons at the expense of the community. These persons frequently pose as patriots. subscribe Â£50 to patriotic funds, and fleece the public of Â£5,000 by high prices. It is an easy matter to be generous when one is robbing other people. It is that aspect of the question that affects the worker, the real wealth producer of the community. To protect him from the operations of combinations and trusts, we have asked that the present proposals shall include that submitted to the people in 1915.

Having regard to the care taken to perfect the Constitution, there should be no undue haste to make amendments for which the people have given no mandate. I do not remember any Minister indicating, during the last election campaign, tliat the Government would propose an amendment of the Constitution in order to make the Commonwealth Parliament supreme in industrial matters. Had the Government announced a proposal to bring all industries, whether in the northfar as they come under the arbitration west or south-west of Western Australia, in Queensland, or Tasmania, under the jurisdiction of a Federal Arbitration Court, I would have declared my opposition to it, and I believe such a declaraThat raises a very big question. tion by the Government would have had a big influence* upon the votes of the people.

Had this actually does. member does not believe that the framers this side would support it . of the Constitution intended to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to deal admission. with industrial matters other than those of an interstate character. Clearly their viction. I believe in consistency. I am opinion was that the Commonwealth not like the right honourable member for authority would deal only with shipping, Balaclava ( Mr Watt), who made a fine shearing, and other industries that are speech which ended in nothing. He defederal in their scope. i who framed the Constitution pass, during the first seven years of federation, legis 1 lation which they believed to be constitutional, but which the High Court declared to be ultra vires-as in the famous Harvester judgment? am sure that the framers of the Constitution never contemplated that the railway servants of the various States and most minor industries would pass under the jurisdiction of a Federal Arbitration Court. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. honourable the Leader of the Opposition should withdraw his amendment and substitute another to refer the question to a special parliamentary session. I , for one, promise my support to such an amendment. support from the Government side of the House. more support than the amendment now before us. While asking for control of many things, the amendment eliminates control of trade unions. It differs greatly from the Government's proposal that this Parliament should have control of both the employer and the employee so and conciliation provisions of the Constitution. The amendment further seeks power in regard to "" the ownership of the means of production, manufacture, or supply of goods, or supply of services.""

Last night he said that I was "" in the breechin."" I assume he meant that I was a brake on those who desired to go too far. Isi t not desirable that some one should apply the brake in those circumstances ? I do not hesitate to declare my views on this important question; it is my duty to think for myself and decide what is best in the interests of Australia. I have been twitted contemptuously by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , because I represent a constituency of large area. I have as many constituents as the Tight honourable member, and they are men who have fought a stern battle against adverse conditions in the outback. honour to represent them, for they are the best class of people of this country. I claim that I have won the confidence of the electors in the back country. The right honourable member for Balaclava said that he would vote for the Government, although he denounecd the Government's proposals as next to useless. Honourable members know, from questions I have asked of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) on the subject of restraint of trade by manufacturers protected by the Customs tariff, that I have no sympathy with monopolists, and would give the Government all the power necessary to control them, for they are a greater danger than tile wildest Bolshevik or I . W . W . I do not blame members of the Labour party for their desire to alter the provisions of the Constitution. They saw their opportunity when it was being framed, and obtained parliamentary representation on a population basis. I say quite candidly that I do not believe in representation on that basis. In a country where the people are congregating in large cities there is great danger, if representation is on a population basis, of the cities obtaining control of the Parliament. When members of the Labour party saw industrialism developing and Australian cities increasing in size, they became desirous of obtaining control of trade, commerce, and industry. We were asked to join a federation, not to agree to unification. able members opposite have always been in favour of unification; but we now find that honourable members on this side, perhaps not intentionally, are assisting the passage of legislation which makes our federation little better than a unification. If this Parliament is granted power in industrial matters it must ask for power to control trade and commerce. That is as certain as that night follows day. Unless honourable members on this side believe in unification, they are making a grave mistake in assisting to pass this legislation. The proposal is to spend Â£80,000 on a referendum for which there is no mandate from the people. I am not aware of any special appeal having been made for it , and there is no reason for it except the 44-hours dispute in New South Wales. No general desire for it has been expressed, though the manuI t is an facturers of New South Wales, on account of the Lang Administration there, may have brought pressnre to bear on the Government. I believe in ""home rule,"" and, if the legislation of that State is not what the people there desire, it is their duty to elect a different Parliament at the next election. I wish to give to tliis Parliament control of national matters; but any one can say that control of industries throughout Australia is a national matter? The proposals are preposterous, monstrous. I can understand honourable members opposite favouring them, and that honourable members on this side should lend their support to them astounds me. If the proposal is carried, it w ill involve the country in a large expenditure, and honourable members in some expenditure, too. I have no doubt, if there is an unholy alliance between the two parties, what the result of the appeal to the people w ill be. An y one can see that the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition was moved to save the face of honourable members opposite. They w ill gladly accept the Government's proposals, for there is only one little thing in them to which they object. Por the last fifteen years the Labour party has been asking for this power. They w ill certainly support the proposal that this Parliament should have control of trade unions, and that it should have power to appoint authorities to make investigations into industrial matters. Although this GoHonorvernment may pass legislation appointing certain authorities, that legislation w ill not control the next Government or the next Parliament. party is returned at the next election, it will be able to alter all the legislation we pass. Constitution. to appoint authorities, and the legislation of this Parliament appointing authorities can be repealed by it . The mistake the National Governments have made is that they have not repealed the legislation of previous Labour Governments.

There has been an Arbitratio n Courti n New South Walesf o r a long while, and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has been functioning for a number of years, yet in spite of that, strikes occur almost daily in nearly every industry. I have, in my room, a list of the cessations of work that have occurred in the coal-mining industry over a considerable period.

I do not think that there is a country in the world where the antagonism between capital and labour is as great as it is in Australia. member is so obsessed with his idea of the value of arbitration that he cannot realize the truth of my statement. I agree with the right honourable member for Balaclava also that the wages board system is far more likely to lead to satisfactory results than the Arbitration Court system is. We are much more likely to get our industrial troubles satisfactorily settled if they are of employers and employees, who know the industries with which they are connected from A to Z, and an independent chairman, than if they are dealt with by the Arbitration Court. I should be even more strongly in favour of the wages board principle if the right to appeal to a court were granted. The Arbitration Court system involves the summoning of witnesses from all over the country, and all associated with the interpretation of law. the railway employees' case, which was recently heard before the Deputy President of the Court, Sir John Quick. deavoured to follow all the ramifications of thc railway business, and to make an award covering all branches of the work. That has also been attempted in connection with the timber industry and other big industries that I could mention. It is too ridiculous for words to drag witnesses from Western Australia or Queensland to give evidence in industrial cases in Melbourne, and yet that is done in connection with almost every big Arbitration Court case. shown quite definitely that the Arbitration Court, as it is at present constituted, can never lead to a. condition of industrial peace. hope in the course of my address to be able to do something to heal the soreness, and smooth the discordance that the introduction of this bill has apparently caused among honourable members on the Government side of the House. I hope also to be able to say something to soothe even the ruffled feelings of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), who has just concluded an impassioned attack upon the Government of which he is generally so distinguished a supporter. This is not the first time that the Labour party, as the direct agent of yourself, Mr. It is absolute rot. Speaker, has had to assist in the conduct of the business of this House by restoring good feeling, peace, and order among honourable members opposite; for, recently, they have become strangely fond of making vitriolic attacks one upon the other.

On the like principle, the right honourable member Sydney is entitled to his due. I do not wish to make the analogy too close, but I mention it in passing.

""We should give a little credit where credit is due. At least, the Prime Minister, admitting that he is a new chum and a neophyte in this matter, and admitting that he had not time to turn up past speeches on this question to learn what we had already said on the subject, might have instructed his private secretary or some one else to give him a list of those who had blazed the track for these constitutional amendments. It may be that with nations, as with individuals, the uses of adversity are sweet, and even profitable; and so it may be that there is much in the divine ordination of affairs which requires men who have given their mind and heart to great public projects, and whose proposals are destined ultimately to be accepted, to drag after them for long and weary years the comatose carcass of the reactionary, as we have dragged it in this case. Let us hope that we are fulfilling some high destiny in so doing. At all events, I congratulate myself at this stage upon the fact that, willy-nilly, in spite of the chortling of a few honourable members on that side, we have brought the Government up to the mark to see at least that the Australian Constitution requires amendment upon the lines now being followed, or on some such lines. In after years, if the present Government, as nominal leader, succeeds in effecting an amendment of the Australian Constitution, and our successors, or some of us, when upon the platform, claim for the Labour party the credit for bringing in these reforms, we shall be told, "" But the Bruce Government brought that about;"" just as, in connection with the old-age and invalid pensions and factory legislation, when we point to our years of pioneering work and education, we meet with the answer that some government other than a Labour government brought about those much needed reforms. We justly claim that the Labour party has done splendid work in times of adversity and against heavy odds, and that it was the real, if not the nominal reformer. The proposal is to amend the Constitution because one part of it has been found to press too tightly on the Government. Because the boot of the youth is not found suitable for the foot of the man, the Government begins to cut a hole at the spot where it begins to pinch, instead of realizing that the boot is too small, and that amendments of a more general and more generous scale are required than those now proposed. What are these amendments? I entered the chamber in time to hear the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) speaking of an unholy alliance between the Ministerial side of the House and this side. I have spoken a few words kindly meant, but perhaps not altogether gentle in tone, about the Ministerial side and its leaders; but, after all, how does the honourable member expect that the Australian Constitution will ever be amended if ho approaches the question of our basic charter in the spirit of the words "" unholy alliance."" Is this a party question? I ask the honourable member for Swan, does he want ample powers under the Constitution.while his party is in power, and restricted powers while his political opponents are in power, or does he believe that the Constitution should be independent of party, that it should be the basis, and not the superstructure, of political action, and that it should be laid without any regard to the political complexion of the persons who may be required to legislate upon it, remembering that the choice of those who legislate remains with the whole of the people of a free democracy? The first proposal under the bill is to amend section 51 of the Constitution by omitting from paragraph 35 the words, "" extending beyond the limits of any one State."" At present the Constitution gives to this Parliament power to legislate in regard to "" conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State."" And those qualifying words, "" extending beyond the limits of auy one State"" have, over a long series of years, nearly broken the hearts and emptied the pockets of the industrialists who have sought reUnder this bill we are appointing agents dress of their grievances under the in with such powers and such tenure as we tricate system of law that was erected hy choose to prescribe. the Federal and State authorities with moment's notice destroy the agency we arbitrar y and vexatious limitations.

We may use other forms of conciliation, and it is wise to bear in mind that this provision is dealing with the arena in which legislation may take place, and not with the legislation itself.

I can readily understand an oligarchy of rich persons-profiteer s and buccaneers, as I said before-bein g opposed to the amplification of Parliament's powers, because enlargement of the powers of the Parliament involves diminution of the powers and privileges of the rich classes. I can understand the opposition of certain newspapers to these proposals because the liberation of Australia's Parliament will mean the vesting of control in the people, and the withdrawal of it away from newspapers and other oligarchies which have controlled public opinion in the past. I can understand all kinds of reactionaries being opfortable "" in this matter. When these posed to these amplified powers for the same reason, but I cannot understand any hefty Australian like the honourable member for Wannon, unless he speaks for the privileged classes, joining them in opposition, when he knows that these proposals are merely for the enfranchisement of a Parliament of which he is a member, and in which he was not long ago a chosen Minister of the Crown, exercising administrative power. Does the honourable member fearfully anticipate a time when he may be so drunk with power that, as a member of this Parliament, he will do something outrageously detrimental to the people who elected him? If he does not fear himself, there is no reason why he should oppose the amplification of Parliament's powers in the manner proposed. It is unnecessary for me to defend the principle of arbitration, because we have already converted the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman paid a glowing tribute to the Arbitration Court, and, strange to say, was not heckled by any of his supporters. In other days, when members of the Labour party championed the claims of the Arbitration Court, honourable members opposite, in chorus, pointed out its manifold defects and deficiencies. But when the right honourable the Leader of the Government offered his meed of praise to the principle of industrial arbitration, his supporters were silent, if not satisfied. I have lived to hear the leader of this reactionary Government quote with approval a resolution passed through this House at the instance of the then member for Northern Melbourne ( Mr Higgins). have heard that gentleman atvernment bench, and I did not hope to live to hear the Leader of this Government quoting his words in support of a policy for increasing the powers of the Arbitration Court. I hope I have made it sufficiently clear that, so far as I am concerned, these greater industrial powers are welcome. This is a long-delayed step in the right direction, and, so far as industry is concerned, the proposed powers are in my opinion ample. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) spoke of the "" uncomfortable speech "" delivered by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is not "" uncombills were thrust upon the House, almost at a moment's notice, he, with characteristic moderation and generosity, got busy among the persons he represents, and took counsel with them, as an honest man, tq find out their views. He then came to this chamber and made his speech, and it was a sound one. It is obvious from the method of submitting these proposals, and their insufficiency and incompleteness, that many activeminded industrialists will not support them. It was to be 'expected, in the circumstances, that there would be diffidence, and that is why the honourable the Leader of the Opposition proposed that the question should be deferred for consideration by all sections of opinion interested, and, if convenient, that it should be made a subject for discussion at what has been called a constitutional session of this Parliament. The postponement was suggested so that an honest endeavour might be made to get all sections of opinion into line at a time when there seemed a good prospect of obtaining agreement.

I am concerned w it h examining the two sets of proposals with the object of showing how different they are in outlook. It appears to be quite beyond question that the methods by which the Opposition propose to regulate and control industry, as expressed by its leader and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), and those proposed by the Government, are entirely dissimilar. The Opposition suggests that industrial peace, and even the millennium itself, may be ushered in and maintained by Parliament agreeing to a continual ' series of bills for the regulation of hours of work, wages, and other conditions. The Government is of the opinion that these matters, which affect the life, health, and welfare of the workers, should be investigated and determined in the most impartial atmosphere it is possible to find. It is of the opinion that an absolutely independent authority should deal with them. It is impossible for. Parliament ever to assume an i m partial and non-partisan attitude, for it is always composed of the representatives of different parties, the outlook of which is continually altering. The Government believes that it would be unwise to make Parliament the cockpit of battles over these important matters. The criticism offered by the Leader of the Opposition to the Government's proposals may be stated under three heads. He argued, in the first place, that the proposals should not have been brought, forward in their present for m ; in the the second place, that they were not urgent; and, in the t h i r d place, that they should have been left for the consideration of a constitutional session. My reply to' the first argument is that the matter is urgent. Everybody knows that on the 16th December last the New South Wales Parliament passed an act which deliberately cut across the federal arbitration system. Section 12 of that act reads I am quite prepared as follows:Where in any award oi order made under any Act of tlie Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, or in any industrial agreement made pursuant to any such act, for any industry to which the principal act applies other than coal mining and shipping, with respect to vessels trading 'beyond the limits of a port, provision is made that the standard or ordinary weekly hours of work or duty of an am prepared to employee shall ""not exceed a number stated in the award, order, or agreement greater than 44, or where in any such award, order, or A t the moment agreement, expressions of a like significance occur, then in such a case the standard or ordinary hours of work or duty of sueh employee shall not exceed those prescribed by or under section 6 of this act.

210,Dr. Earlepage,"T h at is . so.in 1915, during the war, the State Governments were urged to equip the Commonwealth Government with sufficient power to deal with industry. Some of the Premiers were willing to do as the Commonwealth desired, but others were not, and nothing was done. The'matter was also on the agenda-paper of the 1918 Premiers' Conference, and the following motion was carried:1. This conference affirms thc desirability of defining the industrial matters which should with advantage be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court, and those that should be regarded as within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State industrial courts. 2. The defining of the respective matters mentioned above be referred to a conference of Ministers of Industry and Labour (Commonwealth and State) to be held at a date hereafter determined. A second ""conference was held later in that year, but all efforts to obtain an agreement failed. Before the referendum was taken in 19.19, definite assurances had been given in behalf of the State Parliaments that they would take certain action to equip the Commonwealth Parliament with additional powers, but only one Parliament did anything definite In these circumstances, I submit that it would have been quite useless to consult the State Governments on this occasion. The proper and straightforward course for the Government was to introduce its proposals to this Parliament and seek authority to submit them to the people for approval. That course was taken, and the Commonwealth was not discourteous to the Statesi n taking it . The Leader of the Opposition also argued that it would have been better had the Government held its hand u n t i l the whole question of constitutional amendment could be considered at a constitutional session. He said that when a decision had been reached the whole matter could be submitted to the arbitrament of the people. To decide the wisdom or otherwise of that course, we have only to ask ourselves what happened on previous occasions when constitutional questions were submitted to the people for consideration. On the first occasion the whole matter was submitted in the form of one question, and the. people were asked to vote a straight out "" Yes"" or ""No."" reason that they did not understand the position, and would not give unlimited power. On a subsequent occasion the proposed amendments were submitted in the form of a series of questions, but the very multiplicity of questions confused and befogged the people, and on that occasion many who were prepared to vote ""Yes"" to some of the questions did not understand all of them, and so voted "" No"" to the lot in order not to make any mistake. On this particular occasion, we are dealing with two issues. One concerns the essential services of the Commonwealth, and is a plain and straightforward issue, which every one can understand. The other deals with 'the whole question of industry, and, although certain clauses w ill be referred in one question to the people, they hang together, are part and parcel of the one issue, and for m a compact whole. If a man were building steps to his house he would not set one brick to-day and two or three more next week, but would put in the whole construction at the same time, if he expected it to be of any use. We have had the other system tried. Proposals have been submitted in globo and turned down. Proposals have been brought forward in series and submitted with other proposals for the amendment of the Constitution, and have been turned down. Every one apparently is agreed that the time has come when this particular amendment, or something closely resembling it , should be made in the Constitution, and the Government brings it forward as a single clear issue. If it will clarify the position and bring about 25 per cent, more industrial peace than we have at the present time, or will eliminate even one-fourth of the waste due to overlapping State and Commonwealth awards, it will be worth to the people many times the cost of the referendum, and will be one of the best investments the Commonwealth has ever made. So the criticisms of these proposals are effectively answered. I notice the h o n orable member for Capricornia ( Mr. Forde) is looking at me very hard, and I do not hesitate to refer to the proposed new states' referendum, concerning which I have often been twitted. I believe that the creation of new states is essential for the proper development ment of this country, and I believe that They voted "" No , "" for the the best and most appropriate means to secure the passage of the new states referendum is to submit it with other proposed amendments of the Constitution, whicli, if carried, will commend the new states proposal to the people. tion ! view the new states proposal depends for its acceptance by the people on some better distribution of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. I am quite content to have this matter discussed in its proper place. should be our constitutional powers in relation to industry is a question which can be dealt w i th by itself, and I believe we can settle it now, because, apparently for the first time, we have reached some measure of agreement upon it . I now come to a comparison of the Government's proposals with those of the Leader of the Opposition. There is one touchstone which, it Tseems to me, should be applied to these proposals. In my opinion those which w i ll tend most to ensure improvement in the wages and conditions of the workers are those which every one should support. I believe it is the aim of every member of this House to bring that about. During the last seven or eight years there has gradually grown up in this country a general agreement as to the necessity for constitutional changes in regard to industrial powers. That is due to a variety of factors. One is, I think, that the war markedly changed the whole national outlook of Australia. It taught us to think in an Australian way, as we did not do before the war. It tended to put an end to much of the parochial feeling which previously existed. In addition, modern invention in transport and means of communication has tended to annihilate distance and bring us closer together. A t the same time, modern methods of in dustiy, and the establishment of many bie industries supplying raw material, partly finished material or finished goods to all the States, has tended to one in its commercial out-look than it has ever been before. the national l if e has been greatly increased owing to the rapid growth of secondary industries. We are recognizing more and more that, as the tariff is a Commonwealth instrument-and we hope some day a scientific one-operate d by this Parliament, its aim to establish industries and ensure their prosperity should not be defeated by isolated State action such a3 is threatening at the present time in New South Wales. Here, after long consideration, and sometimes acrimonious debate, we decided, for instance, that a certain measure of protection was necessary for the steel industry to enable it to thoroughly establish itself under good conditions. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, the Government of New South What Wales, without proper inquiry, altered the whole conditions of that industry. It reduced the hours of labour in the industry from 48 to 44 per week, and at once made it necessary for the steel industry to approach the Commonwealth Parliament for a revision of its tariff protection. Every one can see what a stupid position we shall get into if , because one State alters the hours and conditions of labour, we must alter the tariff accordingly, not because of any general alteration in industries or conditions throughout the Commonwealth, but because those in power in one State appear to have gone mad. non-party spirit which the honourable gentleman is displaying. is a difficulty which has to be borne in mind. It w ill , I believe, influence the people of Australia in regard to constitutional changes. gentleman guarantee that the Commonwealth authorities w ill fix u n if o rm rates throughout Australia? that in two or three moments. The difference between the Government's proposals and the Labour amendment is really that the Labour amendment would give practically unlimited power to the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with the whole of industry in any way it thinks fit. That is to say, under it Parliament itself would undertake the consideramake the nation much more tion of questions of hours, wages, and conditions, and thresh them out here to Further, the exclusion of everything else. The effect of the tariff on the Government's proposal w it h respect to industry, though wide-sweeping, would place the power to deal with details in the hands of authorities created by the Parliament.

If we bring about a condition of affairs in which this Parliament w ill be a cockpit for industrial legislation system of Australia. Finalityi n deciand trouble, we shall not be able to achieve the national destiny of the Commonwealth. In America, the policy of the trade unions has always been ' to keep as f a r from politics as they can. Despite the tremendous immigration to that country of people who could not speak English, and who might reasonably be looked upon as a source of cheap labour, the American trade unions, sticking exclusively to their job, have succeeded, by the organization of various trades and assisting to increase the output of industries, in increasing the purchasing power of the wages of the workers of America beyond those of any other country in the world. In 1924, I notice, the effective wages in various countries were given by the Financial Times at 100 for London, 144 for Sydney, and 221 for Philadelphia. In June, 1925, according to a bulletin of the Pederal Reserve Bank, the figures for effective wages were-London 45, Sydney 77, and Philadelphia 100. affairs in the United States of America was brought about, not by political action and agitation, but by organizations carrying on the work of the country without making the Parliament at Washington a place in which nothing but industrial legislation could be discussed. What are the essentials of a system for the regulation of industry? According to the way in which the proposals of the Government or those of the Leader of the Opposition f u l f i l these essentials, the House and the people should be able to judge Avhich of them to accept. The most important and vital of all is that the decision arrived at by any tribunal dealing with wages shall be final,"" decisive, and certain. Three or four years ago the Leader of the Opposition claimed, in a speech, that the value of arbitration was that it brought about finality of decision, so that Australia cannot ultimately be men could go on w it h their work certain that wages would be paid according to arbitration awards. We are in sufficient trouble already because of the duplication of awards of the Pederal aud State courts. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that it is of no use to paint the face of a leper and pretend that he is all r i g h t ; but neither is it of any use to inject h i m w i th the virus of. some other disease and then think that he is all right. That is what the Leader of the Opposition would do to the industrial sions regarding wages and conditions of labour is much more likely to be assured by the verdicts of tribunals created by this Parliament, but outside it altogether, than by verdictsof the Parliament itself, which, by reason of the nature of its election, must be a partisan body. It looks to the electors for their support, and must be influenced, unconsciously possibly, but still truly , in its votes. The next essential, it seems to me, of a system for the regulation of industry, is that the decisions arrived at must be universally recognized as impartial. AlthoughI have every respect for decisions arrived at in this Parliament, I do not think any one will claim that they are absolutely impartial. These decisions are frequently arrived at through preconceived ideas or prejudice, or perhaps, because of the omission of those opposing them to put the whole of the case. A t any rate they are"" not im That condition of partial decisions, and, therefore, on industrial questions would make no appeal to the mass of the workers as such. Under the Government's proposals the workers would be able to rely entirely upon an impartial decision, because questions requiring important decisions would be outside the control of Parliament. It may be suggested that this is a thing to be feared, but the Victorian Parliament has never attempted to interfere with its own system of arbitration or wage fixing. Unfortunately the New South Wales Parliament within '--he last few months has tried to decide the question of hours without any evidence or inquiry, simply because it says that it has a mandate from the people of that State. In appointing the Commonwealtli Arbitration should endeavour to maintain the prestige and traditions of British and our own law courts. No matter what the political predilections of a judge may have been, lie always recognizes that he must maintain a high standard of impartiality, base his verdicts on the evidence before to maintain that standard in connection with any new method of dealing with industrial matters. vernment is that the court in fixing the wages and conditions of labour in industries, would take cognisance of local conditions-a jurisdiction important factor that has to be decided in connection with the regulation of industry, is the determining tions and hours of labour so as to ensure the good health of the workers. give the worker decent working tions, so that he may preserve his natural spring, he will become a more and more productive of a happy and contented But how are we to determine the hours and conditions of labour? determine them in the same way as tariff increases and reductions are determined after a discussion in this House?

This would be a calamity from the point of view of industry and the workers generally. say that that scheme could be undertaken by an arbitration court consisting of three judges? tliat for a moment. additional powers were given to the Commonwealth, we should be able to carry out scientific investigation, and use the results in whatever tribunals wo create. The workers should look not to legislation for a millennium or improved conditions, but to the handling of their own problems in conference with employers. ' We shall then be able to have a practical arbitration system, such as exists in many parts of the world, without the necessity for reference to the Arbitration Court at all. The cardinal reason for these proposals is to create a new outlook among the workers and the people of Australia in regard to industry generally. We desire to encourage, by every possible means, the development of the proper self-government of industry. Modern industry has developed practically in the last 100 years. It grew quicker than its method of control, and a tremendous amount of industrial unrest and disturbance has resulted. A proper system of self-government of industry to ensure equitable distribution of profits of industry, will come about only as a result of the application of the workers to their own problem. That is our object. The Constitution is a vital instrument of government, and embodies the fundamental principles on which the nation is governed. In amending it, we need to ensure that the progress of the country shall be along proper lines. Unfortunately, politicians are neither omniscient nor omnipotent, and we must encourage men to depend for their salvation upon their own resources, initiative, and enterprise, and to grapple with their own problems, rather than be always leaning on governments and governmental agencies. If the Only by such a policy can this country achieve the greatness of which we all believe it capable. -Most honourable members who have participated in this debate have said that they approached the bill free from party bias, but the speech of the Treasurer was tinged throughout with party politics, and he did not lose one opportunity of criticizing the action of State Governments. To-night he appeared in a new role, that of an advocate of direct action. His concluding remarks are typical of those of I say that if gentlemen whom the Treasurer aud his supporters designate direct actionists. Those men declare frankly that they wish to work out their own salvation in the industrial field, and do not want the assistance of parliaments and politicians. For preaching that doctrine, which the Treasurer has to-night repeated, the Government would deDort them. If the only advice which the Treasurer can give to industrialists is to rely upon their own resources, and not look to Parliament, the honourable gentleman should join the communists and revolutionists on the soap-box in advocating the abolition of parliaments. Evolutionary development is possible only by parliamentary action. any but constitutional action. gentleman said that the workers must look to themselves and not to Parliament. Those are the very sentiments of the communists, who no doubt will welcome the Treasurer into the ranks of the revolutionary army. At one stage thc by co-operative methods, honourable gentleman, when discussing the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, spoke in a conciliatory tone, and practically offered to confer with the Leader of the Opposition, but when the latter was about to acquiesce in the proposal, the Treasurer commenced to raise obstacles, and concluded ' by declaring that negotiation would be possible, only upon the basis of a complete acceptance of the Government proposals, and the. withdrawal of the amendment. The Treasurer also said that because the New South Wales Parliament had by statute established a 44-hour week in conflict with the Federal award of 48 hours, an",62,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words

223,Mr Lazzarini,"The honorablealteration of the Constitution to make the CommonAvealth power paramount was needed. gentleman that the Storey Government introduced the 44-hour week, which was in operation while that Government was in office. Not until the Lang Government re-established that principle did the employers think of appealing to the High Court. When they did appeal, and won a victory over the workers, this Commonwealth Government discovered the need for an amendment of the Constitution. It is strange that for some years that necessity was not apparent. It seems to me that that argument was put forward by the Treasurer only for the purpose of combating our contention that, in asking for extended industrial powers for the Commonwealth, we are not advocating that all details for the regulation and control of industries shall be threshed out on the floor of this Parliament. We are told that there is a fundamental difference between the proposals of the Government and the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I can see no difference in principle between the two. an extension of a principle embodied in the bill. We say that the Government's proposal does not go far enough, that it will put the country to the expense of a referendum in order to obtain for this Parliament powers that will be found insufficient, and that later we shall have to duplicate expense by appealing for a grant of extended powers. The Treasurer said that whereas the Government proposes that hours of labour and conditions of industry shall be regulated by an independent tribunal, the Opposition desires that all these matters shall be decided in Parliament itself. That is not so. All we ask is that these powers shall be given direct to this Parliament without the condition that the exercise of them shall be delegated to any other authority. No person is so foolish as to believe that all the ramifications of industry can be invesless in the absence of the power to give tigated on the floor of this House, but Parliament could prescribe a minimum wage and a maximum working week, and delegate to a tribunal the responsibility for fixing wages above and hours below the statutory limits. Parliament's decision would be based upon statistics and other information obtained after full inquiry, and no tribunal should be able to set it aside. Afr.

The people of New South Wales have to accept the 44-hour week established by the State legislature, and similarly we should have to accept for the time being any decision of this Parliament. In the ups and downs of politics different parties come into power. I am a good enough loser to take a beating without complaining, and to submit to the law. It is of no use for any honourable member opposite to argue that honourable members on this side wish all industrial questions to be decided by a vote of this House. Both sides in industry would oppose that. But I see no reason why this Parliament should not have power to fix hours. With other honourable members on this side, I contend that The amendment jjroposes merely this Parliament will have that power. Something has been said about the undesirability of making the Parliament the cockpit for industrial disputes; but, although the State parliaments have sovereign powers, and can legislate according to the policy of the party in power, none of them has become a cockpit for industrial disputes. The honourable the Treasurer has evidently discovered a formula for industrial research ; he claims to have discovered that, just as he claimed some time ago to have discovered the principle of a sinking fund. All the things he advocated are being done in the States, and in most other countries. All the information which, according to him, will have to be obtained, can be obtained by this Parliament to-day. I agree with him that the information, if obtained, would be useeffect to it. Most of these things will be investigated by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, unless it fails to fulfil the purpose for which it is to be created. When the honourable the Leader of the Opposition stated that this Parliament would have ample powers under these proposals, he created something like consternation among honourable members opposite, and the right honourable member-",63,Sydney To Broken Hill Their Stead The Words

225,Mr Lazzarini,"I would not supfor Balaclava ( Mr Watt) interjected, "" If that is so we ought to have a further investigation into the matter."" All honourable members on this side have put forward the same contention, and recently it was shown who was right when the famous deportation case was before the court. Every member on this side said that the Deportation Act was unconstitutional, and the High Court decided that the laymen on this side were better able to interpret the Constitution than the lawyers on the other side. of the Opposition are all constitutional lawyers! only of exercising common sense. The supporters of the Government allowed passion to blind them in their desire io win the election. be fooled like that once, but they will become wiser some day. The Minister evidently admits that it was done to win the election. If the Prime Minister goes to the High Court again he will receive as severe a jolt as he received in regard to nationalist senator, had been in communithe Deportation Act. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) said that honourable members of the Opposition wished to eliminate from the Government's proposals control of trade unions. I cannot see why any honourable member should contend that. says definitely and clearly, "" The rights and obligations of employers and employees,"" and the Government's proposal savs, "" The rights and duties of employers and employees."" If everything contained in the one proposal is not also in the other my reading of them is at fault. Similar proposals haye been put forward by Labour governments in the past, and it has never been contended that they did not contain that power. The honourable member also spoke of the socialization of industry; but the amendment does not seek to give the Parliament power to bring that about. All the State Parliaments have that power, and the Commonwealth Parliament could give effect to it to-morrow in many indirect, if not direct, ways. The honourable member for Swan said the Government had been forced by the manufacturers concerned in the 44-hour dispute to submit these proposals. That is as Dold an admission as he made when he said that if these proposals had been brought forward by the Labour party, every Ministerialist would have opposed them. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) missed the motive of the Government when he was dealing with the proposal to delegate powers to authorities. The Prime Minister thinks that his proposals will hamper future Parliaments, and that is the reason for submitting them in this form. It is not that he is afraid of this Parliament becoming a cockpit for industrial disputes, and not because he thinks that other means than the establishment of courts of investigation, and the appointment of boards of conciliation will be used; but because he is drunk with power to-day and fearful of tomorrow that he wants to shackle future Parliaments. The remarks of the honourable member for Swan, to a large extent, support that view. The right honourable member for North Sydney referred to the creating of Soviets. He made me wonder whether some one, perhaps a cation with the shades of Lenin, and had received a direction from him to introduce the Eussian system here. Honourable members opposite had better beware. The cries of "" Disruption,"" "" Revolution,"" and "" Law and Order"" have not so much force The amendment since the election. When a Labour government comes into office, these powers may be handed over to authorities outside Parliament. The present Government is forging the weapon, and will be blamed for the consequences. The honorabh* member for Wannon( Mr Eodgers) said that only two industries in this country, shipping and coal-mining, were of a Federal character. He said nothing about the waterside workers and the shearers. Whether an industry is carried on in one or more States, the conditions iu it. have an effect on the whole of Australia, for Australia is an economic entity. The conditions for industry should be the same throughout the Commonwealth.
