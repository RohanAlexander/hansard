30,Mr Maxwell,"P a r a g r a p h b refers19. If a Minister desires to interfere in a dispute he can proceed by calling a compulsory conference before an organization has had time to take any steps in regard to the matter. If that conference fails to agree in regard to the whole dispute, the Minister has power to refer tlie matter immediately to a Special Tribunal which may make an award. The Minister may thus oust the Arbitration Court. The only exception to that procedure is when a plaint is pending in the Arbitration Court, and proceedings have actually commenced. If it is not the intention of the Prime Minister to deprive any organization of the right to approach the Arbitration Court, the provision for a -compulsory conference should be struck out of the Bill. The organizations would then have the right to go to the Arbitration Court or to have their dispute dealt with by a Special Tribunal. ter and Attorney-General) [11.28] I thought this provision for a compulsory conference would be regarded as one of the most valuable parts of the Bill. It is admitted that the Arbitration Court has done much good work by exercising its power to compel the parties to meet. I said last night, in reply to the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), that the most valuable part of this measure is the fact that it brings the parties together at a conference table. graph b of this clause is to enable a tribunal to deal with a dispute, which has been referred to a compulsory conference without a settlement having been reached, thus giving the tribunal the same jurisdiction as the Court has in relation to such disputes. If that provision is taken away this Bill will at once assume a menacing rather than a conciliatory form. It will say, in effect,"""" There shall be no attempt at conciliation; we shall at once bring you before the bar of justi.ce and make you do a certain thing."" honourable member has suggested that this provision takes away the right of the union to go to the Arbitration Court, but I hope he will not think that such is the intention. This measure will not touch any union that wishes to approach the Court; it will only be used where unions will not go to that Tribunal. have nothing to do with those who will go to it. We must have some remedy where unions will not go to the Court, and the first remedy to which we propose to have recourse is that of conciliation through a compulsory conference. Power is given to bring the parties together and leave them to endeavour to reconcile their differences. I hope that the honourable member will not take objection to the powers given to a Special Tribunal under paragraph b. quite realize with the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) the very far-reaching effects of paragraph b, because, although paragraph a limits the jurisdiction of a Special Tribunal to cases brought before it by the parties, paragraph b when read together with clause 19, which gives the power to a Special Tribunal to convene a compulsory conference, will open the whole field of an industrial dispute to consideration by such a Tribunal. However, I rise to call particular'attention to the proviso at the end of clause 15, which reads as follows :Provided that no dispute as to which a plaint is pending in the Court and the hearing has commenced shall be referred to a Special Tribunal. This practically limits the prohibition, as one may call it, against interference by a Special Tribunal to a comparatively small number of industrial disputes Paraout of the total number which are under consideration by the Arbitration Court. Not all disputes come before that Court by means of plaints. In practice we find that a great majority of them do not 'originate in that way, but come to the Court following upon compulsory conferences. ' Furthermore, the Conciliation and Arbitration. Act stipulates quite, a number of ways in which disputes may come before the Court other than hy the method of plaint, the various ways being set out in section 19 of the The Act, which reads as follows:The Court shall have cognisance, for purposes of prevention and settlement, of the following industrial disputes: (a) All industrial disputes which are certified to the Court by the Eegistrar as proper to be dealt with by it in the public interest. (&) All industrial disputes which are subI t will mitted to the Court by an organization, or by an association registered for the time being as an organization', by plaint.",21,Industria L Peace Bill
31,,Mr HUGHES (Bendigo-Prime Minis,22,Industria L Peace Bill
32,Mr Brennan (Batman) [11.31],"I(c) All industrial disputes with which any State industrial authority, or the Governor in Council of a State in which there is no* State industrial authority, requests the Court to deal; and (d) All industrial' disputes as to which the President has held a conference under section 16A of this Act, and as to which no agreement has been reached, and which the President has thereupon referred to the Court. The only matter referred to in the proviso to clause 15 in the Bill are those which come under paragraph b of this section of the Act, and in actual practice the most general method by which disputes may be brought before the Arbitration Court are those referred to in paragraph d of the section. Any number of disputes may be pending before the Court, and the Bill will give a Special Tribunal the power to ""butt in "" upon the consideration of them if only the limitation contained in the proviso to clause 15 is retained. ister ( Mr Hughes) desires that the powers of Special Tribunals shall be exercised collaterally and on parallel lines with the work of the Arbitration Court, and from the fact that this proviso has -been inserted in clause 15, I should suppose that he does not intend that a case actually in course of being dealt with by that Court shall be interfered with by any Special Tribunal against the will of the Court it may be, and even, apparently, against the wish of the parties. member says is very true. This is the use to which the clause may be put, but the intent of the Bill is to deal with those cases the Court cannot or does not deal with. why the proviso should exclude the Special Tribunal from dealing with only a limited number of cases which are before the Court. go to the Court, pointing out that it is the place where they must get their remedy, but some unions will not do so. On the other hand, a de facto dispute arises with which we have to deal, and subject to clause 17, we tell the parties that we cannot hear them if their case has been taken to the Court because they have ""elected to go to the Court. what the right honourable gentleman has said, but it does not cure the difficulty I have raised; on the other hand, it rather bears out what I have been saying. Where a case has been brought before the Court by means of a plaint, it may not be considered by a Special Tribunal while it is pending before the Court. It may not be a case in which the Court has failed; the 1 Court may be proceeding quite satisfactorily with the hearing of the case, and the parties may be quite satisfied to remain under its jurisdiction. In such circumstances, so long as the case has originated by means of a plaint, the Special Tribunal cannot interfere with it, but if a compulsory conference has been held under the powers given by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the President of the Court has referred the matter into Court, as he may do, without the necessity of proceeding by way of a plaint, Apparently the Prime Minand the parties are quite satisfied to go before the Court, being so referred to it, the proviso to clause 15 will not prevent a Special Tribunal from interfering in such a case. I have already quoted section 19 of the Act to show that there are a great many other cases in which disputes maybe brought before the Arbitration Court, and the Special Tribunal may interfere with them. So long as the Court is functioning apparently in a satisfactory way, surely the Prime Minister does not desire that Special Tribunals shall be invited to interfere with it. right honourable gentleman to consider the effect of the proviso to which I have drawn attention. He will see that it does not protect the Court to that extent. filed in the Arbitration Court, and a plaint is pending in five, would the honourable member suggest that if a dispute arose in an industry, the case of which was the thirty-fifth on the list, and the parties said they could not and would not wait any longer, a Special Tribunal should not act in such a case? such a case; there is nothing to prevent it ; but under the proviso a Special Tribunal may interfere with a case which is in actual course of hearing in the Arbitration Court unless it has been initiated by means",22,Industria L Peace Bill

There may be something in the view that delay may take place in regard to a large number of cases formally originated by means of plaints; but I invite the attention of the right honourable gentleman to the fact that the very cases in which he empowers a Special Tribunal to interfere are those which have already been referred to the Court for prompt action as tbe result of compulsory conferences. originate in several different ways, and we only prevent the Special Tribunal from. interfering with those which have originated by means of a plaint. The honourable member's contention is that in all cases where a hearing has been commenced, irrespective of the way in which they have originated and irrespective of whether the Court has gone on with them, the Special Tribunal should not interfere. by the honourable member be met by amending the proviso to read as follows :Provided that no dispute as to which a hearing has been commenced in tlie Court shall be referred to a Special Tribunal. tainly be an improvement; but I do not wish to be taken as approving of the policy of interfering with matters which have been once initiated in the Arbitration Court by way of plaint or otherwise. amended as I have indicated. It will certainly improve matters from the point of view of the honourable member. is a curious phrase in the last line of the proviso, which says that no dispute as to which a plaint is pending in the Court and a hearing has commenced "" shall be referred"" to a Special Tribunal. Many matters may come before a Special Tribunal which are not referred to it. It may really grip disputes where it likes under clause 19, which gives the power to convene a compulsory conference. ""It is misleading to say that no dispute shall be referred to it. Under clause 19 a Special Tribunal or the chairman or the Minister, or any person thereto authorized in writing by the Minister, may summon any person to attend at a conference. The number of disputes actually referred to a Special Tribunal may be comparatively small. It may be merely a matter of verbiage, but it seems to me that the -phrasing of clause 19 leaves it open to the Special Tribunal itself to seize upon a dispute that is already before the Court. If it is made clear that that cannot be done I shall be satisfied. Will the Prime Minister consider my suggestion ? before a Special Tribunal only by being referred to it. only in the sense that it may refer the dispute to itself. Under clause 19 the Chairman of a Special Tribunal, or the Minister, or any person authorized by the Minister may summon any person to attend. pulsory conference, whereas I am speaking of a Special Tribunal. Paragraph b of clause 15 provides that a dispute can be referred to a Special Tribunal only after failure on the part of a compulsory conference held under clause 19. vides that where a conference has been held under clause 19, and an agreement has not been reached as to the whole of the dispute, the Chairman of the Special Tribunal, if the conference was summoned by that Tribunal, or the Chairman thereof, may refer the dispute to the Special Tribunal. The main point, however, that I ask the Prime Minister to look into is as to interference on the «part of a Special Tribunal with cases that are There actually proceeding amicably before the Court. ister and Attorney-General) [11.51] I have every desire to meet the wishes of honourable members in order to make this a workable measure, ancl having listened carefully to the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) I feel that there is much in what he has said.

It may be argued that my amendment would come into conflict with the Constitution, but I do not see that that is so. Decisions have 'been given by the High Court in regard to the powers of the Commonwealth. For instance, in the McKay case, which is the only case having any direct bearing, it decided that the Arbitration Court had not the power to fix prices. I am not asking that prices should be fixed, but that in connection with the coal industry, for instance, the Tribunal should have the right to inquire into every phase, so that, in the interests of the employees and the general public, it may Ibe ascertained whether there is any justification for increasing the price of the commodity in order to give increased wages. have all the powers of the Arbitration Court -ting a fair deal-that somebody is "" havtrouble is that the powers of the Arbitration Court do not quite provide for what I desire. The Arbitration Court has power to do certain things, but up to the present it has not been able to go beyond -the dispute before the Court. Payment by results is a method generally accepted by the honourable members opposite; and the selling price of the commodity, it is fair to the men that there should be some means of ascertaining whether the selling price is commensurate with what they are paid. To-day there is a declared price for coal, but no one knows whether or not it is the price obtained. The men, however, are paid only on the declared price; and to give satisfaction in the coal industry, in which I am deeply interested, the men claim that 'they ought j;o be able to inquire into every phase of it. practically what was accepted by the Government in regard to ""industrial TIT £LfctGl*S-"" the Prime Minister will accept the amendment, for it will go a long way to assist in preventing any disruption in the coal trade. ister and Attorney-General) [12.3] When speaking on the second reading, and at subsequent Committee stages, I pointed out the limits of our power in regard to prices and profits. I said that once we established, the fact that the evidence sought to be obtained is relevant to the dispute, I personally do not see that there -are any limits, because the Tribunal is created to prevent and settle disputes. The jurisdiction having been clearly established, the only question is whether the evidence desired is relevant to the dispute. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) has taken a concrete case, and, after all, we are dealing with concrete, and not hypothetical, cases. 'The honourable member says that there are men on piece-work, paid so much a ton for hewing coal, and that when the declared price is 17s. 9d. the hewing rate is so much. The men also say that nothing is more calculated to cause industrial unrest, and breed discontent, than a feeling that they are not geting"" them. It is said that a man will be more content, and less likely to create industrial unrest, if he is getting 3s., .with the knowledge that he is being fairly dealt with, than if he is getting 3s. 6d., feeling that he is being "" h a d "" at the latter rate. That is quite true; and the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) contends that all the evidence if on those results depends bearing on that phase should be brought out. I appreciate the necessity for such evidence where it is for the purposes of the dispute, and not for other purposes. I pointed out to the honourable member the other day that, recently, there have been made public statements by certain officials of the Coal Miners Federation for which the men are not necessarily responsible. These oflicials have said that the miners wish to own the mines; but that is not relevant to the present dispute. It is an aspiration of a section, an aspiration which may be good or amendment is bad, but the miners as a whole are not necessarily to be held responsible for it. Every man in the Coal Miners Federation has a perfect right to hold' opinions on the point; one man may say that he believes in the mines for the miners; another that he believes in the mines for the people of New South Wales; a third,",25,Industria L Peace Bill

Therefore, it must be clearly understood that the only evidence that will be permitted will be evidence relating to the dispute, and for the purpose of dealing with the dispute, which, of course, is a matter relating to the wages and conditions of labour. That being so, we have to ask ourselves how far the amendment is acceptable from the Government's point of view of the desire that is at the back of it, and how far it is constitutional. side the limits of anything you have just said. There are two points I should like to mention to the honourable member. A great deal of industrial unrest arises through a suspicion in the minds of the coal miners that there is much leakage between the shovel and the grate. It is not material whether that suspicion is true or not-the fact is the men believe it. The miners say one thing and the mine-owners another; and if the whole facts were brought out, the Tribunal would consider them, and give a decision fair to the community, in the matter of price-becaus e it would have relation to price-and fair to the men. But it will not help the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) if we insert an amendment that the High Court will say is ultra vires; and, therefore, in order to disclosure make it perfectly clear what questions may be asked, I suggest that we strike out the words ""pertaining to the industry,"" and provide that the Tribunal have power to inquire into all matters ""relating to the dispute, from the point of production to the final disposal of the commodity."" I have never been one to whittle down the powers of the Commonwealth, but have always upheld them. Once you establish the fact that the matter is relevant to the dispute, we have, in my opinion, the right to ask the questions, and, with the alteration I have suggested, the honourable member's quite acceptable to me. There is one other point at which I wish the honourable member to look. He adds the provisoProvided that by request of either party the evidence relating to any trade secret shall be taken in camerd and not be disclosed. I do not think that goes far enough, because, in the coal-mining industry, there is no trade secret. There may be secrets in the chemical or engineering trade, but not in the coal trade, which has simply to do with getting the coal out, and there is an end of the matter. tors say that there is a secret in regard to their business. on that point. In the times when files were cut by hand the. process was regarded as a trade mysterya secret-and was usually carried on in some cul-de-sac in Sheffield. The business brought great profit to the employers; but one day a donkey wandered into a cul-de-sac, saw through the window of a house a man cutting files, and then came out into a Sheffield street and ""hee-hawed."" Thus the secret was "" given away."" What, I think, the proprietors have a right to expect is that their business shall not be disclosed either to their rivals in this country or their competitors in others, and therefore we ought to strike out the words "" relating to any trade secret."" Section 85 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act providesNo evidence relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position, of any witness or party shall be disclosed except to the Court or published without the consent of the person entitled to the trade secret or nonA l l such evidence shall, if the witness or party so requests, be taken in private. I suggest to the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) that he adopt that section. With that emendation I am prepared to agree to the amendment. I am prepared to meet' the right honourable member. My only object is to make clear in the Bill what is needed.

68,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [18.15],"it is not provided for, and at a critical moment like the present it is important to"" make the provision clear. I agree to the insertion of so much of section 85 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as hag been read by the Prime Minister, with the substitution of the word "" Tribunal"" for the word "" Court"". entirely agree that only evidence relevant to a dispute can be admitted at the hearing of a case : but a Court of Appeal might hold that evidence which had been admitted as relevant, and which it was quite within the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth to take, was not relevant. Thus the* right of these Special Tribunals to take particular evidence might be challenged, and the evidence disallowed on other than constitutional grounds. hewing rate depends on the declared selling price of coal, which the miners contend means the real selling price. If in a dispute the miners said that they were not getting a fair; deal, evidence as to whether the declared selling price was the same thing as the actual selling price would be relevant, because it would embody the subject-matter of the dispute. of Appeal might declare, as a matter of law, that some of the evidence was not relevant. very well. vided that the decision of a Tribunal as to the relevancy of any evidence should not be challengeable in any Court other than on constitutional grounds. to enact that, and the enactment has been declared ultra vires. matter what we put into the B ill ; if we to the dispute, that clothes it with all the go beyond the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, prohibition will lie.

The right honourable gentleman knows how these appeals arise. Some coal magnate will be placed in the witnessbox and asked a question bearing on the profits made between the production of the coal and its purchase by the consumer, which he will refuse to answer. You will then have to take proceedings to compel him to answer, as was done in connection with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. He may then say that I think it might be prothe question is not relevant to the dispute, and the point will go on appeal to a higher Court.

In my opinion, provision should be made to render every shareholder in such a corporation liable to a fine of £500 and three months' imprisonment penalty should not be inflicted for failure to disclose information, or refusal to obey a summons, as is fixed for disclosing evidence already given. The man who, after hearing evidence in secret, discloses it, does that which cannot be recalled. The consequences of his action cannot be overtaken.

But the Government must be aware that the Federal Legislature has no power to legislate in respect of local disputes. I cannot understand why the Local Boards should be invested with the very wide and general powers proposed-o n the same lines, indeed, as the powers to be given to a SpecialT r i bunal.

It is not a Local Board appointed by a SpecialT r i b u n a l ; and it appears that, once a Local Board is set up, there are no limitations to its powers, because we shall have gathered up in the Local Boards all the powers which are Court of Conciliation and tion under the Act itself. honourable member cares to take the trouble to examine the A ct to determine exactly what i "" / point implies he w ill realize how tremendous are the powers to be vested w it h this purely Local Board. The Government will see that the amendments they have promised in regard to Special Tribunals are no Boards; that is, so f a r as concerns the determination of what a dispute is before the matter is heard by a Local Board. First, there may be a Local Board appointed "" in relation to a SpecialT r i bunal,"" and this Board, under the A r b i tration Act , may appoint Boards of reference. So, there w ill be a SpecialT r i bunal, which will have a Local Tribunal appointed in relation to it ; which, in ' t u r n , can appoint a Board of reference under the Arbitration Act. Where the powers of these Local Tribunals wil l end imagine. I opposed the B ill at its second reading stage as undermining the A r b i tration Act ; and, although I have made some honest attempts in Committee to i m prove it , I cannot understand .the position of these Local Boards. Their status should be more clearly defined, as being subordinate in their control to the Special Tribunals in relation to which they have been appointed. In the first place, if I these Boards operate at all, they w ill operate in regard to disputes over which this Legislature has no jurisdiction, and, if they have jurisdiction, the Boards w ill be merely duplicating and repeating the work of another' body. would like the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes) to closely examine this clause.

It would be f a r better to depend upon the honour and good sense of the parties to whom the B ill w ill relate. Throughout the arbitration legislation of both the Commonwealth and the States various penalties have been provided. If my recollection serves me rightly, while Mr Wade was Premier of New South Wales, penalties amounting to no less than £5,000 were imposed under the State Act on various organizations and individuals, but not one penny was collected-. That being so, these penalties go for nought. It would be more acceptable to the people if we relied upon them to honour any compact entered into by virtue of this measure. Let us take care that the B ill is in every respect conciliatory. We have provided at the end of the B ill that whatever penalties are necessary may be prescribed. all the penalties for which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides are incorporated in this B ill . MT . CHARLTON"" -Then we should introduce a further clause to overcome that difficulty. In justification of my point has alattitude I point out that when the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), during the war, appointed a Special Tribunal to deal w i th industrial troubles in relation to the coal mining industry they came to a certain agreement under the operation of the War Precautions Act. There were no penalties attached to a breach of that agreement, but they loyally abided by it , and it expires in October, about two ., months hence.

175,Mr Marks (Wentworth) [ 3 . 1 ],"Iister and Attorney-General) [3.4] I shall deal in a moment with the suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks). The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) proposes to delete clause 28. Let me put this to the honourable member: An employer is summoned before a Court, and refuses to appear. If there is no penalty for such a refusal he can continue to flout the Court with impunity. fine for contempt of CourtI have ever heard of. honourable member for Hunter has in mind is that there should be no penalty for breach of an agreement or award; but those are not the only violations of the law with which we might be called upon to deal. We have to get evidence, and if people will not come to the Court how can we get it? It may be necessary to put certain questions. We may wish to examine a man as to his selling price. We may desire to say. "" You state that the fair price is 17s. 9d.; but now, as a matter of fact, how much is it?"" He may know what we desire to ask, and may refuse to appear. I suppose that, if he were at liberty to do so without consequences, he would not appear in the circumstances, if he had any sense. gestion to meet the point the right honourable member is arguing? I am quite prepared to prescribe a penalty for any person who refuses to obey a summons. For instance, in sub-clause 3 of clause 19 provision is made that any person summoned shall attend a conference and continue his attendance as directed by the person or tribunal summoning the conference. I should be satisfied to add to that a provision for a penalty upon any one disobeying the summons. But clause 28 is a drag-net provision, covering penalties in all sorts of cases, and for breaches of regulations of which we have no knowledge. cannot overcome the difficulty in that way. I shall refer, not to a strike, but to a lock-out. We know that a lock-out is a monstrous and abominable crime, whilst a strike is that resolute indication of the onward march of the people towards the goal of eternal liberty. What the honourable member proposes is that for the crime of a lock-out there should be no penalty. Shame! Shame! Where are the banner-bearers of Bolshevism when such things are said? They are tied to the chariot-wheels of Capital. They are proposing to allow Capital to do with impunity just what it pleases. No, we must have penalties. How do Lenin and Trotsky deal with these matters? They say, "" Work. If you won't work, ."" Honourable members know what follows. MT.

I quite understand what the honourable member for Hunter has in view, and I am prepared to meet him this far: He says that we do not know what the regulations under this Bill will provide for. I admit that, and I am, therefore, prepared, in regard to the imposition of penalties, to adopt the regulations of the Arbitration Court. They have been in force for years, and honourable members know what they are. They would not hurt anybody. The honourable member has himself said that under them fines to the extent of £5,000 were imposed, and that not a penny of that money was collected. State Act. MT. HUGHES -Well, I do not know that, under the 'Commonwealth law, we have done any better. I remember that my union was fined a great deal of money, and if the accounts of the union are inspected I do not think that any item will be found on the debit side of the ledger to represent the payment of that fine. I do not know how they do these things, but they are done. We must be able to secure evidence, and if a man absolutely refuses to give evidence, and ignores or flouts the Court, we must be able to deal with him. I know of no other way to deal with such cases than by the imposition of penalties. The clause refers to a contravention of the Act or of the regulations under the",35,Industria L Peace Bill

For instance, there is nothing in that Act or rules relating to the Commonwealth Council, District Councils, or the non-appearance of witnesses.

That this Bill be now read a third time. think it will be admitted that the members on this side of the House have kept their promise respecting the measure. We said at the outset that we had no intention of obstructing it , but that we objected to the application of the guillotine to its discussion, because that might shut out the consideration of important amendn ents. I am pleased that we have been able practically to get through the Bill before the guillotine was applied. The Bill has emerged from Committee a much better measure than it was. Many improvements have been made in it . As I said on the second reading, the establishment of Local Boards capable of dealing promptly with disputes as they occur, is a step in advance in our industrial legislation, and I think something that the community is looking for. My regret is that the Government did not comply more fully with the wishes of the Opposition for the amendment of the B ill . Hadi t accepted the amendment of which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) gave notice, recognising the trade unions and industrial organizations of the country as those which should be represented on the Tribunals appointed, and had the penalty clauses been omitted, the Opposi-. tion could iiave accepted the measure, and rpcommended it to the workers outside. We showed that the amendment was vital to the success of the B ill , and did our best to impress the Government with the need for it . I repeat what I have saia in this connection. In passing industrial legislation, we are dealing with the existing organizations, not with organizations that may spring into existence at a time of industrial trouble. From the beginning, it is the industrial unions that have been recognised in connection with the settlement of disputes. That being so, I do not know why objection was taken to their recognition under the B ill . The indo nothing to help their fellows, but when dustrial organizations are the parliaments of the workers. The members of the Trades and Labour Councils, and the officials of the unions, are the representatives of Labour, just as we here are the representatives of our constituents. They have won their position by their abilities, and it is their duty to look after the industrial interests of their fellow men. Why then should we refuse to recognise them when we are trying to secure industrial peace? It is for the organized workers that we are passing this measure. I The Committee made a fatal mistake in negativing the amendment, and I must vote against the third reading of the Bill because of that action, and because of the penalty clauses. Nevertheless, I believe that this measure, when passed, will provide machinery which should be used to prevent the industrial crisis that appears to be brewing. The men who desire a Special Tribunal to settle their troubles quickly now have an opportunity to get such a Tribunal. The leaders of the men are often maligned, it being made to appear that they provoke strikes; but we have now provided a Tribunal for the settlement of disputes which will be constituted of representatives of the workers, representatives of the employers, and an independent chairman, and it can deal with the trouble promptly. I hope and believe that this machinery will be availed of by the miners. The big, strong, militan t organizations, such as that of the miners, are not injured by the refusal to give them the recognition in the B ill which we have contended they should have, but the smaller organizations are injured ; and the Prime Minister will do well to have inserted in the Senate a provision recognising the Trades Han Councils and the industrial unions in making appointments to the Tribunals provided for by the B ill . If he does that, and eliminates the penalty clauses, the measure will be, in my opinion, the best that has yet been passed by any Australian Parliament, Commonwealth or State. The concession for which we asked was a small one, and it has been demanded by trade organizations m all parts of Australia. It is only such organizations that will come under the B ill . Why, then, should we create the suspicion that the measure is providing for unknown circumstances, and the representation of non-unionists, men who in tin es of peace industrial trouble arises, do their best to injure them.

I have also been influenced to do so by the urgent assurances of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that some of the provisions were essential to deal with the present grave coal crisis.

I am relieved to some extent, however, to learn that the Government idea is that this should be only a temporary measure, and that they propose to later introduce a comprehensive measure which w ill coordinate all the leading features of the present arbitration law, and the principles embodied in the B ill . done, and the measure is an outcome of co-operation on the part of employers and employees, we may look for some real benefits. I hope that a big effort w ill be made to that end. We have also the asr surance of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that this B ill w ill be exercised only as an emergency measure. If that policy is followed, some of the disadvantages I fear may be minimized. The many amendments made in Committee are in themselves evidence that the measure was ill-digested and ill-considered before its introduction. amendments have improved the measure to some extent. I regret that I was detained in Sydney by causes beyond my control, and was thus prevented from being in the House during the earlier stages of the measure. TheB ill w ill duplicate the authorities set up to deal with the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, and w ill thus probably lead to -great confusion. I regret that during the -second-reading debate the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) saw fit to make an attack upon the -Commonwealth Arbitration Court. He made misstatements of facts, and I think it is our duty to say that we dissent from them. It is somewhat remarkable that in a measure providing for the creation of four different tribunals, we should provide that the principal tribunal shall inquire into matters that are well within our knowledge. We all know the main cause of industrial unrest. The present Government was largely responsible for it, owing to their failure to deal with The profiteering and their arbitrary exercise of the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act -If the Government would exercise their powers under the Constitution with regard to profiteering, and would also cease to operate the War Precautions Act, they would do much to remove the causes of industrial unrest. I cannot view with equanimity, or as sincere and bond fide, any measure which emanates from a Government who refused to take those steps to remove the main causes of industrial unrest. We are told that they seek to do that by means of this B ill . When the Commonwealth Parliament proposes to legislate, we must have close regard to the powers If that is contained in section 51 of the Constitution. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) with regard to .what he considers the two blemishes in this B ill , 1 say that this measure is at fault, inasmuch as it is not based upon all the powers that the Commonwealth Parliament possesses. On the contrary, clause 2 sets out that the measure shall apply "" to industrial matters in relation to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and.settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any' one State."" Why do the Government confine Those the basis of the B ill to such an extent? Why is not the B ill based on all the powers that this Parliament possesses. They have based it upon one power only, and when it is interpreted, the Courts w ill . hold that Parliament itself has expressed its intention to exercise'only one power, and that it was not its intention that the provisions of the B ill should be supported by any of the other powers conferred by the Constitution. This limitation satisfies me that the Government intend that the measure President of the shall, from a constitutional standpoint, prove futile. Almost any award that",40,Third Reading

212,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.56],"statistics. At the close of 1898 there were 4,554 females working in dressmaking, millinery, &c, at an average cost of 10s. Od. per week, and 3,813 of these at an average wage of 8s. 7d. I shall conclude with just one more quotation from the report, in the hope that this B ill will eliminate for all time the disputes which nobody on either side of the House wishes to continueOn this subject Miss (Juthbertson reportsIn some cases I have found that the 2s. Gd. per week is not paid at all, but is kept back for value received; in others the girls receive the 2s. Gd. and hand it back at once. Again, others are allowed to consider it their own from Saturday to .Monday. Some employers take it on the time-payment system of 10s. per month, while the luminaries of the dressmaking profession demand that it be paid down in a lump sum varying from £6 10s. to.£10. If these girls employed in the trade were able, when they had completed a period of some years to earn anything like a living wage, it would not be so bad, but the dressmaking statistics for the year 1897 show that the average wage paid in the trade for that year was 10s. lOd, and as the large salaries paid to the heads of departments were included in these returns, it will be seen that the wages of the "" rank and file "" of dressmakers must be very low indeed.

The honourable member must not apply that term to an honourable member. Prime Minister spoke in that strain, and if he had treated the House in a less cavalier manner he might have been able to have had his way. Honourable members of this Chamber are not prepared to allow the Prime Minister to treat them in such a manner. It is easy for the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to say that, if we had waited until the Bill was introduced, we would have known all about it. That does not meet the position at all. The Prime Minister could easily allow this motion to stand over until next week, but if there is any necessity for extreme haste the reasons should be given. The Government are seeking leave to bring in a Bill for certain purposes, and as the honourable member for West Sydney has stated, we may desire to widen the order of leave.

284,Mr Cunningham (Gwydir) [4.29].,"look to us to preserve their rights, and I submit my amendment because of the tendency, during recent years, to introduce into the islands surrounding Australia large numbers of Japanese, Hindoos, Malays, and crossbreds of every description. We -want to avoid what has occurred in New Zealand, where there have been what are known in the United States of America as race riots, because of the introduction of coloured aliens into the Dominion. A few years ago, no one would have dreamt that New Zealand would occupy the position she does today, which has been brought about by a Government of which we have had for the last few years a replica in Australia. Government have exercised under the War Precautions Act autocratic powers such as were enjoyed only by Governments in the Dark Ages, and these they seek to continue, although the war is over. Just as a tiger, having tasted blood, desires more, so the Government, having exercised these autocratic powers, are loth to part with them. Now that we desire to get back to pre-war methods of government, we find that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) is not disposed to be amenable to reason. with his usual unmannerly style, be has levelled all sorts of charges at those who seek to safeguard the rights of the Parliament. with his Senate scandal, and so forth,' ""and he needs to be pulled up. able member for West Sydney( Mr sire that Australian money shall be exRyan) reminds me, the Prime Minister has been intimately connected with many scandals in this Parliament M. Chanter.)-Order! I ask the honourable member to refrain from making imputations. lecture might very well have been delivered to the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), who has previously insulted the Chair, is distinctly out of order in making that remark. I called the Prime Minister to order for the same reason that I have just called the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr leave to continue my remarks on a future Cunningham) to order. Minister, ever since I have known him, has adopted a policy of bustle and bluff, and where he finds that insufficient to carry him through, he does not hesitate to be insulting. ferring to the Prime Minister's attitude outside the Parliament. We need to provide that the civil government of these territories shall be in accordance with the White Australia policy, because it is impossible to trust the Prime Minister to administer the mandate intrusted to us in accordance During the last five years, the with the desires of the Australian people. The history of the administration of the occupied territories during the war is in some respects not to the credit of the Government, and we have no desire that the same sort of thing shall happen in the administration of the territories now coming under our control, and for which we shall be directly responsible to not only the people of Australia, but the League of Nations. I am reminded by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) that during the last few In accordance days the newspapers have been full of statements showing that our White Australia policy is likely to be challenged within the next twelve months. It is quite possible that our neighbours, the Japanese, may endeavour to make their presence felt in these territories if any loophole is left for their introduction into these islands, as freely as they have entered New Caledonia. We do not depended in these territories merely to bolster up and support a large body of coloured aliens whose operations may at any time seriouslv menace the welfare of the Commonwealth. I trust that in future the Government tion to introduce new business, and that we shall have fewer exhibitions of "" bluff "" on the part of the Prime Minister than has recently been our experience. The failure of his "" b l u f f "" this afternoon will, I hope, lead to his taking up a different attitude. desire to second the amendment, and ask occasion.",47,Joseph Cook T H E Honourable
