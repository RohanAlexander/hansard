House adjourned at 5.00 p.m. Thursday, 11 March 2004 ----Western Australia: State Emergency Service Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (9.40 a.m.)-I would like to speak today about a group of people who risk their lives for us every day, a group of people whom we in Western Australia rely upon in our darkest times-the State Emergency Service. It is nearly time for the leaves to turn brown and for the onset of winter. In May last year, storms hit Perth with unusual ferocity. Around 21,000 homes in Stirling were left without power or suffered damage. There was a huge and expensive clean-up job left afterwards. That clean-up job would not have been possible without the efforts of the State Emergency Service. For years now West Australians have trusted the familiar orange uniforms of the SES staff and volunteers. These are people who are always ready to go out into the harshest conditions and the most dangerous places in order to keep our community safe. We hear a lot of talk of the great and the good, and that is all very well. But in the State Emergency Service we have a group of volunteers from all walks of life who get out there and get things done when it really matters. They perform a whole range of services, from disaster relief to searches, from education to logistical support. They are trained in a broad range of skills and we all feel the benefit of their strength and dedication. In my electorate of Stirling we have a great group of people out there helping the community. I would like to send a message of support to the Stirling SES unit’s local manager, Steve Perrie, and the 55 active volunteers in the unit. I would like to express the gratitude of everyone in Stirling for the risks they take and the time they put in. We are all better off for their efforts, even if at times we forget to say so! I would also like to mention the City of Stirling here as well. Our local SES are located in premises in Nollamara. Mayor Tony Vallelonga and the councillors and staff of the City of Stirling deserve our thanks for providing resources and support to our brave volunteers. The cooperation of the City of Stirling and the Stirling unit of the State Emergency Service is a fine example of so much that is best in our community: people quietly working together, getting on with the job, providing services and making our community a stronger, safer and better place. I thank them all. If people in Stirling want to become volunteers and contribute to our community, they should contact Steve Perrie and they will be welcomed warmly by Steve and his team. I hope that no damage is caused by this winter’s storms. However, if there is, I encourage people to ring the Stirling SES and Western Power or AlintaGas if their public utility supply is interrupted. It is best not to ring the police, because they are usually busy sorting out traffic and other things. So my message is: the Stirling SES are there, they are there to help us all and they are there in times of need. Do not forget them; put their number on your fridge. Like me, if you see them, thank them. MAIN COMMITTEE",113,Adjournment
204,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 9.40 A.m.,"Liberal Party: Wentworth Eastern Sydney: Infrastructure ducted by the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party on 28 February, I have been asked numerous questions about the process adopted by the returning officer and the methods of my erstwhile opponent. At some stage before long I will tell the story of what happened. Nonetheless, I have commended my opponent and again am bending my back doing my best for the people of Wentworth whom I have the honour of representing in this place. The most significant concern that I have for the people of the eastern suburbs of Sydney today is the prostituting of those people by an arrogant Bob Carr and a corrupt state Labor government. Everywhere one looks at the moment one finds the people of Sydney’s east neglected by a lazy Premier and an inept government that has forgotten what public administration is all about: the service of the people. My greatest concern is for an ageing and inadequate infrastructure, ignored by a treasury whose coffers are full of GST moneys from the Commonwealth and revenues from land deals particularly, if I may add, from a large number of transactions involving capital and land in my area, which is rather expensive. What is happening with all these moneys? Where are they being spent? They are not being spent in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, because everybody accuses-wrongly-people in that area of being silver spoons and, therefore, not needing any of those facilities. The exact opposite is the case, because it is the most densely populated part of Australia and the facilities are woefully inadequate. The rail system is the most recent and glaring example, with trains frequently late or cancelled. But worse in the longer term are the roads, which are literally crumbling, such as Glenmore Road in Paddington, Old South Head Road, Carrington Road, Bondi Road, and the list goes on. The roads are too narrow. There is no parking. The parking facilities are packed wherever you go. Daily it gets worse. We have a woeful and disgraceful situation in the eastern suburbs of Sydney so far as all the infrastructure is concerned. Down at Bondi Beach on a daily basis on streets and footpaths there are mattresses and all the debris of backpackers-the backpackers themselves are in substandard facilities. Schools are underfunded or being closed. Vaucluse High School recently closed. Community services are run down. Hospitals are full and there is inadequate space and care in those facilities for the large number of patients. It is a disgrace. Our infrastructure is beyond a joke. Something needs to be done about it now by those responsible. Tomorrow is too late. Foreign Affairs: Taiwan try of Taiwan into the World Health Organisation was debated in the House. Speakers from both sides rose in support of the motion. The Chief Government Whip said at the time: … this is not a political issue; it is a health ... issue. Well, I would go further and say that this is a humanitarian issue. Support for the motion came in the context of the outbreak of SARS in Asia and a large number of deaths in Taiwan, China and Korea. The SARS epidemic killed about 800 people around the world, including 349 in China, with a similar number of cases and some 30 deaths in Taiwan.

The SARS threat remains, and countries in the region are now faced with bird flu alongside increasing health problems associated with the unchecked spread of HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and the various strains of hepatitis. Taiwan’s entry into the WHO has been vetoed seven times by China, and when the vote was taken last year Australia abstained. The various epidemics mentioned above require a solution from the world community. With the increasing mobility of the world population, it is likely that Australian citizens will be affected by some of these modern-day plagues. We have an obligation as a modern and rich democracy to assist our neighbours in dealing with these issues and to play our part on the world stage in finding a solution. Support for Taiwan’s entry into the WHO would be in the best interests of the people of Australia. It would help to stem the tide of some of the aforementioned harrowing afflictions and it would ensure the WHO had easy and early access to a country which not only suffers from these outbreaks but also has a real problem-like other countries in the region-in containing outbreaks within its borders. Taiwan is a democracy with some 22 million people and our eighth largest trading partner. We have many economic and cultural ties. It is a friend and ally, despite the fact that we do not have official diplomatic relations. We should therefore assist Taiwan, as we do other nations in the region, in dealing with the various health crises it currently faces. As I said, Taiwan is in a special circumstance because is it not a member of the WHO and is therefore unable to gain access to the much-needed assistance that that organisation is able to provide in dealing with these new, fast-spreading diseases. More than 11 countries passed resolutions in 2003 supporting Taiwan’s entry, including the United States, Great Britain, Canada, the European Union and the Philippines. It is only the Chinese veto which is forestalling the ability of the world community to help the people of Taiwan deal with SARS and other pandemics. The Australian government can and should use its special relationship with the People’s Republic of China to advance the cause of Taiwan’s admission to the WHO. The abstention of the PRC would most likely result in consensus and subsequent admission. The news just last month that the Chinese cabinet had agreed to set aside differences and cooperate with Taiwan in dealing with the bird flu outbreak is undoubtedly a good sign. I hope that at the 57th WHO general assembly in May admission will take place, enabling us all to work together in combating the various health crises currently facing the planet. Financial Services a.m.)-Today is a historic day for financial services in Australia with the commencement on 11 March 2004 of one national licensing code for the entire financial services industry in Australia. It is a journey that began in 1996 with the election of the Howard government. Treasurer Costello resolved that it was of critical importance that Australia have a globally competitive financial services sector. So he commissioned Stan Wallis to begin the financial systems inquiry which has become one of the most influential inquiries undertaken in the life of the government. Stan Wallis has referred to the fact that the financial sector, across the whole gamut of financial service providers-retail banking, merchant and investment banking, insurance, credit unions, trustees, friendly societies and financial planners-is very fragmented. There are different codes of practice in place-some of which are self-regulated, some are regulated by the Commonwealth, some are regulated by the states and some are completely unregulated-and MAIN COMMITTEE",116,Statements By Members
207,Mr Ross Cameron (Parramatta,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.49consumers are participating in the economy at considerable risk and hazard. So we embrace this idea of a single homogenous national regime, from the financial planner working at home out of a study to the great global investment banks, and today that licensing regime commences. I want to acknowledge the vision of the Treasurer, who set us on this course in the first place. I also want to acknowledge two of my other parliamentary colleagues who have played a very significant role. The then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, my colleague Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, was instrumental in the carriage of the draft bill; and, likewise, my predecessor in this job, now the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell was a custodian of this measure for much of its life. SoI am merely the midwife-I stand on their shoulders-I was not there at the moment of conception but I recognise what an important moment it was. If you look at just my electorate of Parramatta, 4,000 of my constituents are employed in banking and insurance. Every day, 18.5 per cent of people travelling to the city of Parramatta are travelling to a financial services employer. This has involved higher standards of training, it has involved higher levels of disclosure to customers, it is improving the quality of the financial services product, it is making the industry more competitive and hopefully it is giving a better value proposition for Australian consumers. It is putting us at the forefront of the world in financial services. I commend the measure. Lilley Electorate their time on the weekend to clean up our local environment as part of the Clean Up Australia Day campaign. Some 10,000 people across Brisbane participated on the day, and a fair percentage of them would have come from our local community on the northside and would have worked at many local sites. On behalf of our local community, I want to thank all the local volunteers who put in an effort-volunteers like Pat Fawcett, Howard and Rebecca Gorton, Frank McLoughlin, Stephen Neve, Gino Giuliano, Brian Coates, Sandra Papas, Gerard Sommon, Anthony Hitzke, Kerrina King, Ken White, Jan White, Mick Walker, Ian Kubler, Margaret Klucis, Diane Bence, Suresh Balasingham, Catherine Cleary, Graeme Hughes and, of course, the very well known Harry Johnson. In the northern suburbs we really are blessed with an attractive and diverse natural environment-from Sandgate’s lagoons and Shorncliffe’s magnificent foreshore, to the remnant bushland at Chermside Hills and our local creeks that flow into our beautiful Moreton Bay. If you look at a map of the area, one of the most striking features is the 1,200 hectares of saltmarsh bush, ti-tree wetlands and mangrove forests that have been saved from development right in the middle of the north-side community. This of course is known as the Boondall Wetlands, and it can now be enjoyed by a new bikeway. It is satisfying to see locals-walkers and cyclists-enjoying this land. As a local member, in 1996 I was able to persuade the federal government to add 500 hectares to the reserve on which the bikeway is now built. Of course, in the past we did not always think about caring for the environment, but it is pleasing to see the Brisbane River come back to life and to see the extensive revegetation efforts at Seventh Brigade Park and Marchant Park and along our creek banks. Locals are doing wonderful things in our area through organisations such as the Shorncliffe bushcare groups, the Bennelong Park Association, the Downfall Creek Bushland Centre, the Keep Sandgate MAIN COMMITTEE",117,Statements By Members

Our environment is important to all of us, because it is literally about the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food that we eat. That is why it is important for the government to follow Labor’s initiatives in combating salinity, restoring environmental flow to our oncegreat Murray River, and ratifying the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reductions. I am pleased to see that there are literally hundreds of people who are active in their local communities and are doing their best to make sure that we leave a quality environment to subsequent generations. Health: Dubbo Region health services, and this is mainly because of Commonwealth initiatives in recent times. Dr Peter Regg-Smith is an example of someone who recently forsook practising in Sydney to go and settle in Dubbo as an anaesthetist at the Dubbo Base Hospital. Another example is Dr Newton, who went to Tullamore-with his wife, Barbara, who is a registered nurse-some time ago. We can attract very good, qualified health professionals in our area, and there are quite a few reasons for that. The Commonwealth established the Dubbo Clinical School, which is now in its second year of operation. The school enables medical students and graduates to come to Dubbo from Sydney or other areas, and they find that it is very rewarding to practise medicine in an area such as the central west. The Commonwealth has out laid an enormous amount for the establishment of a university at Dubbo, which last year had its first set of graduate registered nurses. The Dubbo area is getting together its own combination of people who can deliver health-and it is not just doctors and nurses but the allied services as well. Because we have got a university and a clinical school, we are providing an enormous centre of health. The Royal Flying Doctor Service base, one of the best bases in Australia, is now established in Dubbo, and the base also contracts for the air ambulance in New South Wales. The centre still needs an MRI, but Dubbo is certainly the obvious place in western or north-western New South Wales to service most of our region with an oncology centre for whole of cancer treatment. With its positioning, Dubbo is the obvious place where people as far west as Tibooburra and Bourke can come for health services. They can stay with or without relatives, and it is a very good place to stay without having to spend a fortune. There is nowhere else at all remotely close to this region that is providing cancer services now. The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney is very keen to work with our region in providing those services. der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded. Debate resumed from 11 February.

211,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, TourismThat this bill be now read a second time. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 is the second part in a package of amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (the act) that has been developed by the Howard government. It reinforces the government’s efforts to put in place a more effective deterrence and compliance regime, improve the operating efficiency and effectiveness of AFMA and promote the ecologically sustainable management of Commonwealth fisheries. Most importantly, the bill includes measures to help deter illegal, unregulated and unreported, or IUU, fishing-underscoring the seriousness with which the government views this problem. In addressing illegal fishing, it emphasises Australia’s commitment to, and leadership in, international efforts to deal with this problem. IUU fishing is a significant problem for the Australian community and is likely to continue to grow due to declining fish stocks in the Northern Hemisphere, excess global fishing capacity and increasing fish prices. It threatens Australia’s sovereign interests in our southern and northern waters, particularly the sustainability of fish stocks and the unique sub-Antarctic environment in the waters surrounding Heard Island and McDonald Islands. Unless we can adequately protect Australia’s waters from illegal fishers, future generations will not benefit from these valuable resources. Strengthening the Commonwealth’s fisheries legislation is a key means of further protecting Australian waters from illegal fishing. This bill contains two important measures that will help deter foreign operators from illegally fishing in Australia’s waters. These are an increase in penalties for foreign fishing offences and strengthening the bond arrangements for foreign fishing vessels that have been seized. The bill increases the maximum penalty available under the act for foreign fishing offences committed in the Australian Fishing Zone. This measure is particularly important because custodial penalties are not available for fishing offences due to international law. Currently, the maximum penalty in the act is 5,000 penalty units, which equates to $550,000. This bill increases the penalty to 7,500 units or $825,000-sending a clear message to offenders, the courts and the international community that the Australian government views illegal fishing as a very serious crime. The government recognises the inherent difference between the scale of illegal fishing carried out by organised industrial operators and small artisanal fishers. Consequently, the penalty increase will only apply to foreign boats that are 24 metres or above in length. This ensures that the higher penalties will apply to any illegal operators in the Southern Ocean and also captures the larger pair trawlers that occasionally fish illegally in our northern waters. Another sign of Australia’s determination to ensure illegal fishers are brought to justice are the amendments enabling the government to include the costs it has incurred in pursuing and apprehending a foreign boat in any security, or ‘bond’ placed on an apprehended boat. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Australian government is obliged to promptly release boats seized for suspected fishing offences. The aim of the bond is to allow expensive vessels to return to fishing while a prosecution is under way; the bond provides the government with security in case the boat absconds before legal proceedings are complete. The amendments will give the government the capacity to include all reasonable costs that the MAIN COMMITTEE government has incurred in the pursuit and apprehension of the vessel. This includes costs to return the boat to Australia for processing and those incurred by foreign governments that have assisted Australia. The bill also allows the government to choose to recover the costs of pursuit and apprehension from the owner of the foreign illegal fishing boat. The costs of pursuit and apprehension will be incurred in the form of a debt to the government that is recoverable, provided the boat is deemed forfeited and the boat owner does not successfully contest the debt in the Federal Court. The new provisions relating to the recovery of pursuit costs and bonds will apply only where a foreign boat is suspected of fishing illegally and pursued and apprehended after the master of the boat fails to obey certain commands of a fisheries officer. The debt to the Commonwealth will start accruing when the master fails to comply with a command from a fisheries officer to stop the boat to allow an officer to board it or to bring the boat to a specified place. The debt will stop accruing when the boat arrives at a port for processing. The bill provides a general outline of costs that may be included in the debt and that regulations may set out principles for calculating the Commonwealth’s pursuit costs. The bill allows the boat owner to challenge the debt in the Federal Court on the grounds that the debt is not payable because the master of the boat obeyed all commands of the fisheries officer or because the amount is not reasonable and/or was not correctly calculated. The costs will be payable as an administrative penalty by the boat owner. This measure provides the government with a mechanism to pursue, in a foreign jurisdiction, the owners of the seized boat for payment of the debt. The other amendments in this bill are a result of ongoing refinements in fisheries management practices and changing circumstances in Commonwealth-managed fisheries. They will improve the operating efficiency and effectiveness of the AFMA in its management of Commonwealth fisheries resources. These amendments have been prepared in full consultation with industry through AFMA’s well-established management advisory committee process, and have been considered and approved by the AFMA board. Currently under the act, fisheries officers have certain powers to stop and detain vehicles and aircraft, examine equipment, enter premises and make other requirements. In exercising these powers, the officers must produce written evidence of their identity, such as an identity card. An exception arises when an officer requires the master of a boat to stop and allow the officer to board. This bill allows for a fisheries officer not to have to immediately produce an identify card where it is impossible to do so-for example, when an officer on a patrol vessel directs the master of a fishing boat over the radio. Nonetheless, it requires that officers make all reasonable efforts to identify themselves and present their ID card at the first available opportunity after exercising their powers. There are no exceptions to this requirement-it will apply in all circumstances. The bill also enables AFMA to give, by notice published in the Commonwealth Gazette, directions regarding the closure or partial closure of a fishery. This provision will only be applicable in circumstances where: MAIN COMMITTEE AFMA is satisfied that such action is necessary and is consistent with the pursuit of its objectives; there is no plan of management for the fishery; and AFMA has consulted with the relevant management advisory committee and all fishing permits holders. Currently under the act, where there is no plan of management for a fishery, closures are effected mainly through varying permit or licence conditions. While this is generally effective in circumstances where there are multiple activities permitted by permit or licence, it is not satisfactory where the variation of the condition has the effect of negating any use at all of the permit or licence. Such use of permit and licence conditions may be ultra vires. This bill will ensure that the permit system is as effective as possible and that AFMA has the authority to ensure the Commonwealth fisheries are managed in a sustainable manner. The bill provides a measure to reduce the latent effort in fisheries by giving AFMA the authority to waive the levy payment, and any penalty for non-payment of the levy, if a fishing permit is surrendered. This will only apply in circumstances where the permit holder has not fished at all during the period to which the permit applies, despite holding a permit. It will not apply if any fishing activities have been undertaken under the permit. In addition, the bill contains provisions requiring the holder of any fishing right, permit or licence to return the original document to AFMA as soon as practicable after giving AFMA written notice that it has been surrendered. Under part 4 of the act, AFMA must keep a register of statutory fishing rights issued under plans of management. The register facilitates the trading of fishing rights and the efficient management of fisheries. However, as many fisheries are managed via short-term permits, the bill requires AFMA to establish and maintain a fishing permits register. The register will contain information relating to each fishing permit and will be available for inspection in accordance with regulations and on payment of a small administrative fee. Appropriate penalties will apply to parties found falsifying information provided to the register or purported to have been generated from the register. Finally, consistent with existing provisions for the chairperson of a management advisory committee (MACs), the bill contains amendments to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to allow the Remuneration Tribunal to set remuneration and allowances for other members of management advisory committees. This is consistent with the findings of an independent report into the performance of MACs, which recommended that MAC members be remunerated for their duties. In summary, I consider that the initiatives contained in this bill should support Australia’s efforts to combat IUU fishing, strengthen our domestic fisheries management arrangements and help to protect valuable Commonwealth fisheries resources. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Quick) adjourned. AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2004 Debate resumed from 16 February. MAIN COMMITTEE Second Reading and Resources) (10.11 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and Other Matters) Bill 2004 will make a number of important amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991, and is comprised of two major elements: the first contains the necessary amendments to enable Australia to give legal effect to our domestic obligations under the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations; and secondly, the bill contains a number of miscellaneous amendments to improve the operating efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) in undertaking its management of the Commonwealth fisheries resources. This bill, which is the first part of a package of fisheries amendments that is currently being developed by the government, will give effect to Australia’s international fisheries obligations and improve on the general management of Australia’s living marine resources. Schedule 1-The FAO Compliance Agreement As already mentioned, schedule 1 of the bill contains the necessary amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to enable Australia to give legal effect to its obligations established under the FAO Compliance Agreement. The compliance agreement is a major component in the framework of internationally agreed measures for the conservation and management of fisheries. It is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and forms a central element of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, which sets out the principles and standards of behaviour for responsible fishing. The compliance agreement was developed as part of the international response to the increasing levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on the high seas. In particular, it aims to combat the practice of vessels avoiding compliance with international fisheries management measures by ‘re-flagging’ to countries unable or unwilling to comply with those measures. It also encourages improved international cooperation and compliance by requiring flag states to implement appropriate systems for the authorisation and recording of high seas fishing vessels, whilst also requiring them to share information collected on the activities of those vessels on the high seas. The Australian government and the commercial fishing industry have a strong interest in supporting such international measures. The recent pursuit and arrest of the Uruguayan flagged vessel Viarsa has highlighted the need for countries to work together to combat the illegal operators that put their own personal gain ahead of the future of our valuable marine resources. The government remains strongly committed to regional and international efforts to regulate fishing activities to ensure the future sustainability of global fish stocks whilst, at the same time, expanding and protecting Australia’s national interests on the high seas. We are MAIN COMMITTEE",119,Fisheries Legislation Amendment Compliance And Deterrence Measures And Other Matters Bill 2003
212,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourismdetermined to maintain our strong and uncompromising stance in the fight against such destructive and unsustainable fishing practices. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties considered the compliance agreement in mid 2003 and recommended that Australia accept it. However, Australia cannot formally deposit its instrument of acceptance with the FAO until the compliance agreement has been fully enacted in Australian law. Whilst Australia already abides by the essential obligations contained within the compliance agreement, suitable amendments to our domestic law are required to provide for additional statutory functions and objectives for AFMA. The amendments set out in schedule 1 will specifically provide for: the creation of additional statutory functions and objectives for AFMA to enable the authority to ensure that fishing by Australian flagged boats on the high sea is conducted in a manner that is consistent with Australia’s international obligations. These new functions will also ensure that AFMA is able to give effect to the information exchange obligations established under the compliance agreement; a requirement for AFMA to authorise Australian flagged boats to fish on the high seas only where it is satisfied that to do so would be consistent with Australia’s obligations under international agreements; a power for AFMA to make suitable background checks on any boats applying for a highseas authorisation and, where appropriate, to refuse a boat nomination. This amendment will also expand on AFMA’s existing discretionary powers with regard to the nomination of vessels to permits within the Australian fishing zone; an extension in the powers of AFMA to cancel a boat’s authorisation to fish on the high seas if the vessel ceases to be entitled to fly the Australian flag; and the establishment and maintenance of a register of all Australian flagged vessels authorised to fish on the high seas, including appropriate penalty clauses for any party found to be falsifying information provided to the register or purported to have been generated from the register. Passage of the amendments in this bill will allow Australia to join with the other responsible nations who have already ratified the compliance agreement. Australia’s acceptance of the compliance agreement will help demonstrate to other countries, particularly to those not yet a party to the compliance agreement, that we are serious about our efforts to combat IUU fishing. It will also have the benefit of helping protect the Australian fishing industry and the communities that are dependent upon this important natural resource for their economic well-being. The industry, in 2001-02, was worth approximately $2.41 billion per annum to the Australian economy. Schedule 2-AFMA’s operating efficiency The second schedule of the bill contains a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 that will improve AFMA’s overall ability to deliver and enforce effective fisheries management in Commonwealth fisheries. These amendments cover a diverse range of subjects and are a result of the continuing refinement of fisheries management practices that has occurred since the initial introduction of the legislation in 1991. MAIN COMMITTEE The amendments have been prepared in full consultation with industry through AFMA’s well-established management advisory committee process, with the proposed amendments being considered and approved by the AFMA board in February 2002. I will now briefly outline the purpose of each of the amendments. The first amendment in schedule 2 will provide AFMA with a power to determine logbooks for the Commonwealth managed fisheries. Until recently, this power was provided to AFMA through a delegation from the Governor General. However, in late 2001 the Tasmanian Supreme Court found that this system was invalid on the basis that it was contrary to the power granted by parliament. Since this decision, AFMA has continued its logbook program through the use of conditions on fishing concessions, a course which was approved by the Supreme Court. However, as the completion of logbooks is central to effective fisheries management, a more formalised structure is needed. This amendment will provide AFMA with the capacity, though written determination, to ensure that holders of fishing concessions keep and maintain appropriate logbooks. The next amendment, and one that has been given serious consideration by the government, will provide officers operating under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 with a limited power to stop and detain vehicles and aircraft without a warrant or the consent of the owner. Currently, under section 84(1)(e) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991, officers have the power to stop and detain vehicles and aircraft either under warrant or with the consent of the owner. However, where there is reason to suspect that a vehicle may be carrying fish which is not correctly documented, there is not always time to get a warrant and, if the suspicion has foundation, consent may not be forthcoming. To overcome these difficulties and to ensure that there are minimal leakages from AFMA’s system of catch accountability, the bill will amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to enable officers to exercise those powers in the absence of consent or an appropriate warrant. To ensure that the amended power remains consistent with the government’s overall approach to stop and detain powers, the amendments will also impose a number of important safeguards. Firstly, the use of this power will be strictly limited to those situations where consent is not forthcoming and the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a vehicle or aircraft contains evidence of an offence under the Fisheries Management Act 1991. Even then, this power can only be exercised in those situations where the time taken to obtain a written, telephone or electronic warrant would frustrate the effective execution of the warrant. In using such a power, an officer is obliged to notify the owner or person in charge of a vehicle or aircraft (if practical) that they will be conducting a search without a warrant and the reasons for doing so. Added to this, the officer must, as soon as practical, record the reasons for exercising the powers without a warrant and, if requested, provide these reasons to the person affected by the exercise of the powers. The third amendment will give charter fishing a similar but separate status under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 as recreational fishing. This was an outcome of the recent ‘Looking to the Future’ review of Commonwealth fisheries policy. MAIN COMMITTEE Charter fishing sits somewhere between commercial fishing and recreational fishing, being a commercial activity that provides a platform and local knowledge for recreational fishing but does not involve the take of fish for sale. At present, the act provides that a charter boat and the person in charge of a charter boat are engaged in commercial fishing. This is in direct contrast to the Australian and state governments’ in-principle agreed policy on the management of recreational and charter fishing, which sees the day-to-day management of such fishing delegated to the states and territories. Given the current definition of ‘charter boat’, it is unlikely that charter fishing could be effectively managed without de facto management of recreational fishing. Accordingly, the bill will amend the act to give charter fishing a similar but separate status to that applying to recreational fishing. Lastly, an amendment will be made to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to allow Australia to more effectively implement any amendments made to the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Islands and the Government of the United States, more commonly known as the US treaty. Under this treaty, US tuna vessels are licensed to fish in the exclusive economic zones of the member nations of the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency. In Australia, US treaty licensed purse seine fishing may be conducted in the north-eastern part of the Australian EEZ well off the Queensland coast. At present, any amendment made to the treaty (which is included as schedule 1 to the Fisheries Management Act 1991) has no effect on Australian domestic law until it is declared by regulations to have effect. This can often be a time-consuming process and, if the amendment has no effect on Australia, is a relatively inefficient use of the government’s resources. The bill will amend the act to ensure that any amendments to the US treaty which do not affect Australia can proceed without parliamentary involvement. However, those amendments to the treaty that have the capacity to impact on Australia will continue to be promulgated by regulation. Such an amendment will ensure that the Australian government does not waste valuable time and resources preparing regulations that will not have a direct impact on our country’s interests. In summary, I consider that the initiatives contained in this bill build on the government’s commitment to delivering efficient, cost-effective and most importantly sustainable fisheries management both now and the future. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Quick) adjourned. Cognate bill: AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed. MAIN COMMITTEE been expressed to debate these bills together. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 is a bill that the opposition will support. It proposes to amend the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to put in place a more effective deterrence and compliance regime, particularly in relation to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. It also proposes to improve the operational efficiency of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority-AFMA-and to promote the ecologically sustainable management of Commonwealth fisheries. The bill proposes a strengthening of the existing regime for policing foreign boats in Australian waters by allowing the Commonwealth to recover the cost of pursuing boats fishing illegally and to increase the penalties for such activity. The bill also promotes amendments to the AFMA management regime including: creating a national register for fishing permits, giving AFMA direct control over closure and partial closure of fisheries, and relaxing the requirement of Commonwealth officers to identify themselves when making orders to vessels, with the qualification that identification must be produced at the first available opportunity. It also allows AFMA to waive levies for fishing permits that are surrendered before they are used and provides for remuneration and allowances to be paid to members of AFMA’s management advisory committees. As I stated, Labor will support this bill. We have been concerned for some time about the government’s failure to respond to illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean. This region is extremely valuable, both in a commercial and in an environmental sense. While the minister seems to have made some progress in getting some arrangements in place to limit illegal fishing in the area, the same cannot be said for the previous ministers Tuckey and Truss. Under the Howard government this fishery has largely been left to the illegal fishers to exploit, while the government has imposed very tough-and appropriate, I might add-controls on those Australian operators in the region. So we have a tough regime on Australian operators and we let the international pirates in this fishing zone roam free. This management regime for the Heard and McDonald Islands fishery is now one of the most sophisticated in the world. You may have a sophisticated management plan but it is worth nothing if illegal fishing is not controlled. There is no doubt that there has been a considerable amount of fish stocks taken from this area in recent years and that the government has largely failed to address the issue. These amendments are a step in the right direction and that is the reason we support them. We also support the amendments to the AFMA regime. The government has advised that these amendments have been prepared in consultation with the industry and have been supported by the AFMA board. Let me say to the government that that process of consultation is extremely important in these matters, not only with AFMA but with the industry, and we are pleased to see that that consultation has taken place. The Australian fishing industry is an enormous generator of wealth for this country, and I will have a little more to say about that. If it is managed properly it can be an enormous generator of wealth for the national economy and for regional economies-and I note the presence in the Main Committee today of the honourable member for Corangamite, whose electorate spans a significant section of the Victorian coastline. The fishing industry is of course very important to the economic development of Geelong and the surf coast region. Labor sees MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
213,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (10.25 A.m.),"I agree with the sentiments that havethis generation of wealth as the key policy objective and will continue to work with the industry to develop ways of achieving that goal. The second bill being debated in this committee is the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and Other Matters) Bill 2004. This is the second bill being presented which relates to Australia’s fishing industry. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991. This bill has two parts. The first part is to ensure compliance with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas in preparation for Australia’s acceptance of that agreement. This agreement was approved by the FAO in November 1993 but only came into effect in April last year. The government has advised that Australia has not yet accepted the compliance agreements because its laws do not at this point in time comply with the agreement’s requirements. The government has indicated to us and to the parliament that it will accept the agreement once this bill has been passed through this chamber and by the parliament. The compliance agreement was created in response to concerns about the depletion of fish stocks in the high seas as a result of increasing illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has recommended that Australia should participate in this agreement. The second part of the bill makes amendments to the Fisheries Management Act that are intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AFMA itself. The most significant amendment is an increase in the power of AFMA and other agencies, including the Australian Federal Police, Defence and Customs, to intercept, detain, board and search vehicles and aircraft without the consent of the owner or a warrant. Currently, these powers can only be exercised with the consent of the owner or operator or with a warrant. The government argues that this additional power is necessary because there is not always sufficient time to get a warrant if the suspicion has foundation and, of course, if consent is not forthcoming. Other amendments include changes to the management of logbooks relating to the use of a fishery, and charter boats are to be classified as recreational vehicles rather than as a commercial activity. There are also amendments contained here that will not require regulations to be made every time there is a change to the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Islands and the Government of the United States of America. Labor also are prepared to support these amendments. However, we do note the significant increase in power extended to officers to stop, detain and search boats without warrant or consent. We notice in this current political climate that the government has, not only in this piece of legislation but also in other areas of its legislative program, sought to expand the powers of Commonwealth officers and others in these matters, and I think a note of caution should be made here-governments of any political persuasion ought not be expanding these powers without full consideration of the import of that extension. I note that such actions can be taken if there are reasonable grounds to believe there may be something in the vehicle or aircraft that may be evidence of an offence and if a warrant simply cannot be obtained in a timely manner. In the practical policing in this area we believe this amendment is an appropriate one. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills considered the issue of extending powers in this way back in 2000. The committee concluded that such an exemption from the general principle that consent or a warrant should be required MAIN COMMITTEE could be justified on the grounds that it was impracticable to obtain that warrant, and on that basis we are prepared, after consideration, to support this amendment. I am required in the other chamber to speak on another matter but I will make some further comments. The fishing industry continues to be a major generator of wealth in this country. We produced $2.3 billion worth of seafood in 2002-03 but the value of our exports did fall by 12 per cent. The value of the dollar and the impact of SARS in Asia appear to be two factors that have influenced that outcome. I note in the chamber today the honourable member for Corangamite, who has joined us in the debate on fisheries. I must say there is something fishy when the honourable member for Corangamite, a squatter from the Western District, turns up to a debate on fisheries. He would not know a piece of flake from a fish patty. That is the truth of the matter. But it is good to see that he has taken an interest in the fishing industry, because it is an important one to the Geelong region and to Surf Coast Shire. The member for Corangamite is a veteran athlete of some note and we all in this House have a genuine admiration for his achievements. It looks as though he has turned his back on beef and mutton and he is coming over to fish. We know what is prompting the changes in his latent interest in the fishing industry. Be that as it may, we do welcome the honourable member for Corangamite into this very important debate. We will be supporting these two pieces of legislation. make the observation that we now have the shadow minister for everything and everyone. He is now an expert on potatoes, dairy, TCF, sheep, cattle and the Albion football club. I am delighted that the member for Corio did acknowledge the importance of the fishing industry to the electorate of Corangamite, and my particular interest stems from concern over the formation of the marine parks by the Bracks government and the poaching activities of some individuals, particularly of abalone. As the member for Corio has said, the southern part of the electorate of Corangamite does encompass large fishing zones, both offshore and deep sea, from Queenscliff to Portland. I have had a personal interest in the sustainability of fish stocks both domestically and internationally. My personal ability in fishing would be very questionable and I am sure the member for Corio would be pleased to note that. He might even beat me in that particular activity. This bill, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003, addresses poaching in Australian waters by illegal foreign vessels. The parliamentary secretary has alluded to that, as has the shadow minister. Poaching has become a serious problem in Australian waters, with some local fishers stating they have no option but to cease their operations. The first fisherman to legally pioneer Australia’s high Antarctic waters is pulling out of the region and has warned that ‘the rich toothfish resource is being strip-mined by pirates’. That is a very colourful description of international pirates attacking our deep sea waters. Queensland based fisherman Dave Williams said he had decided to pull out his state-of-the-art longline fishing boat halfway through the second season in the ice, stating that the high Antarctic’s toothfish fishing is in the history books already. The fact that local fishers are ceasing their operation highlights the seriousness of this poaching issue. This legislation forms part of the federal government’s plans to get tough on offenders caught poaching in our local waters. Specifically, the bill allows the Commonwealth authorities to recover chasing and apprehension costs from owners of vessels suspected of MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
214,Mr Mcarthur (Corangamite) (10.37 A.m.),"Before the member for Corio leaves, Ifishing offences that do not stop for officers when directed and that are foreign boats suspected of fishing or having fished illegally in Australian territorial waters that require pursuit involving the boat arriving in a place other than Australia. We have the situation, that most of the Australian public understand, of this farce in the southern waters where boats are being pursued, with lack of legal capacity by the Australian authorities to handle them on the high seas. The legislation increases penalties, for illegal foreign fishers with vessels over 25 metres, from $550,000 to $825,000. At least some of these penalties are becoming more realistic for international pirates who are upsetting our fishing industry. The legislation also directs powers to the AFMA to close or partially close a fishery, creating a more direct mechanism for control over the use of fisheries. I will talk more in a minute about the problem of sustainability of Australia’s fishing industry. Hopefully the AFMA can, along with gaining control of poaching, help to make sure the fishing industry remains sustainable. The legislation also creates a fishing permit register to provide a central record for permits and licences. Again, some of these activities have been undertaken by the states, but the AFMA will do this at a federal level. The bill also creates a requirement that permits, licences and other instruments be returned to the AFMA on the surrender of those rights. The bill allows the waiver of levies payable on fishing permits where no fishing has taken place under a permit, encourages the return of unused licences, issues new permits in place of unused permits and maintains a strict quota for fishing activity. Interpreted, that means that the authority is looking very carefully at the number of fishermen, the amount of fish stock and the important issue of fish licences being maintained both in number and the ability of those fishermen to take a catch. The legislation allows for a fisheries officer not to have to immediately produce an identity card where it is impossible to do so-for example, when an officer on a patrol vessel directs the master of a fishing boat over the radio. There is an interesting problem on the high seas as to the ability of the enforcement authorities to deal with so-called fishing pirates. The legislation makes remuneration allowances to members of the AFMA management advisory committee to emphasise the importance of their function and to make some compensation for time lost in which they would otherwise be fishing. The legislation is a significant step in signalling to the world that international illegal fishing operatives will not be tolerated in Australia. I think the legislation has general support. I am sure-and the member for Franklin who is closer to these fishing activities than I am could verify this-that across Australia people are upset that these international poachers can come into our waters and basically move away without any challenge. I am concerned about the link between poaching and overfishing in our waters. In the Northern Hemisphere, fish stocks have been considerably depleted. There is great debate about the ability of those stocks to regenerate. That encourages northern operators, some of them out of Asia, to come down to our more lucrative and better stocked southern deep sea fishing zone. Several studies have illustrated the examples of fisheries that have collapsed entirely, while other seem to have survived prolonged fishing activity. I would like to quote some of these studies. In late 2002 the European Council of Fisheries Ministers was criticised for implementing a subsidy policy that supported the modernisation of fishing vessels rather than addressing the MAIN COMMITTEE implication of dwindling fishing stocks in European waters. We have had a similar problem in Australia, where fishing vessels improve their technology and their ability to catch great tonnages of fish. On one hand, the numbers of vessels were reduced, but, on the other hand, their technical ability to locate stock and fishing grounds meant that the objective of maintaining a sustainable fishing industry was sometimes jeopardised. Facing increased public pressure, later in 2003 the European Council of Fisheries Ministers stopped short of imposing a ban on cod fishing, advocating a long-term recovery plan instead and implementing a measure of quotas and tighter policing measures similar to those measures being taken in Australia. Quota restrictions are directed towards curbing overfishing. In some countries, such as Canada, trial bans have been imposed to prevent further fishing activity. Studies reveal that overfishing is deemed to have a substantial impact on fisheries. That is self-evident. An excerpt from the second World Fisheries Conference, which was compiled by the CSIRO, quoted a journal submission by a consortium in the US who defined two types of overfishing: growth overfishing, which is fishing in such proportions that it exceeds the maximum growth potential of the fish-that is, the actual size of the fish in the fish stock; and recruitment overfishing, which affects the reproductive potential of the fish and leads to extinction. In my view, that is the real problem-the reproductive potential of the fish stock-so that some fish in certain fishing grounds become totally extinct, as I will mention in a minute. Recruitment overfishing is deemed to be a significant problem, as the spawning capability of the species suffers long-term impairment and may lead to the extinction of the species. The situation in North America compounds the argument. The Newfoundland Dogger Bank collapse-according to an excerpt from the technical paper of the CSIRO entitled Developing and Sustaining World Fisheries Resources-highlights three factors that have been identified as contributing to the collapse of the cod stocks in North America. The member for Franklin and others who have been interested in the fishing industry know that the collapse of the Dogger Bank was an ecological and fishing disaster-that that wonderful fishing ground could be so overfished by commercial fishermen that villages are a stark reminder of their former selves. Nobody is there; there are no fish left. It is a great lesson to all of us that if you overfish a stock, even though it seems abundant in supply, there will be a day of reckoning not far around the corner. This technical paper indicated three factors: the level of fishing activity; complex environmental factors such as ocean currents, complex circulation patterns and weather patterns; and the seal predation of cod. Those factors are said to have had an impact on the collapse of cod stocks. However, it is difficult to assess the relative importance of fishing practices, environmental change and the natural predators of stocks. As the member for Franklin would understand, if you overfish those valuable areas such as the Dogger Bank and the North Sea, inevitably the stock will be reduced to almost nothing. In turn, the scallop industry in North America suffered similar difficulties with the Science Magazine of May 2002 claiming that the scallop industry off the coast of New England requires a bigger population to sustain the current harvest. It stated: In 1998, scientists at the Northeast Fisheries Science Centre ... Massachusetts took on a huge challenge. They helped to calculate the mass of Atlantic scallops needed to support a stable and productive scallop industry. MAIN COMMITTEE Their answer: It would take a fivefold increase over the recent depressed mass of scallops ... to bring back what had once been the continent’s most product scallop fishery. Again, we see in the scallop area-we have had similar problems in our waters around Port Phillip Bay and along the coast of Corangamite-that if it is overfished it will inevitably be reduced to nothing. Across the Atlantic, in Britain an article in the New Scientist magazine states: Britain’s love of fish and chips means cod stocks have probably been battered beyond recovery. The stock is being harvested outside safe biological limits. The article concedes that natural variation may have played a role in the cod stocks’ decline. However it is interesting to note that the British have compared their plight to the closing of cod fishing in Newfoundland, where stocks have failed to return. Some scientists warn that the same fate awaits other fisheries around the world, including Australia. With the dwindling stocks in the Northern Hemisphere it appears that illegal boats may be pursuing Australian waters. The general sentiment in Australia is that illegal boats are coming to our waters at a time when the Australian authorities and both sides of politics are pursuing policies to maintain the stocks in a sustainable way. We are pleased that the parliament is agreeing to this bill and supporting the general sentiment that, if we do the right thing in fishing, illegal poachers should be dealt with in no uncertain terms. Fisheries are capable of diminishing rapidly in the absence of controlled and sustainable fishing operations. Again, that is self-evident. While it is possible to limit licensed fishing operations, the real threat to sustainable fishing operations is uncontrolled, illegal poaching. Again, as an aside, two of the problems in setting up marine parks around Australia, be it the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park or the marine parks off the Victorian coastline, are poaching during the hours of darkness and the ability of state authorities to handle poaching operations not only in the international field but also in the domestic field. I am very concerned about that. Illegal fishing and poaching, especially in large and modern international vessels, poses a significant threat to the sustainability of our fisheries. Again on the international field-and this bill deals with this problem-these big and well-equipped international pirates are difficult to deal with. This government has set about reducing the poaching of Australia’s patagonian toothfish, most recently with a new patrol vessel which will provide a full-time armed service in the Southern Ocean. An article by Christopher Jav in the AFR put it this way: The Government’s tough approach is designed to avoid any further ridiculous episodes, such as having to pursue a suspected poacher for 21 days across the Indian Ocean, even handing it advice on navigating among the icebergs in extreme weather, and still having to rely on South Africa to supply the armed force necessary to halt the ship. As the member for Franklin and other members would be aware, this was an amazing situation where the Australian government really did not have the power to apprehend these international poachers. I think the public at large were surprised that we lacked the legal capacity. The armed vessel will have a 0.5 calibre machine gun and a Customs boarding party with handguns and will specifically target illegal fishing vessels that are targeting toothfish. This bill, along with others, makes it clear that the Australian government and the opposition are committed to handling this problem of international piracy of our fishing stocks. It also sets a framework within which the government and the people of Australia are committed MAIN COMMITTEE to sustainability of the fishing industry and where disasters such as those of the Dogger Bank and the North Sea will not be part of the Australian fishing scene. I commend the legislation. I thank the member for Corio, the shadow minister, for his support, and I am confident that the member for Franklin will likewise support this legislation. speech today and for the enthusiasm with which he supports this legislation. As the member for the southernmost electorate in Australia, I can go back and historically look at the way Australian fishermen have decimated the fishing stocks in and around Tasmania and in the Southern Ocean, below Tasmania. I rise to support the two fisheries amendment bills, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 and the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and Other Matters) Bill 2004. I open my remarks with a review of some of the reasons why Australia’s laws need to conform to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas. As people have stated already today, the FAO conference first approved the agreement in November 1993. It does worry me to a little bit that it took until 24 April 2003 for it to come into effect. I was talking with my colleague the member for Corio about why this was so, why it has taken so long. Governments of both persuasions have had the opportunity to deal with this. It is partly a north-south issue, where you do not realise the potential of the fishing industry in the Southern Ocean until you suddenly have a collapse of the fishing industry in the Northern Hemisphere and people come down here and make huge amounts of money-tens of millions of dollars. So governments of both persuasions, our government and the Howard government, in that period between the FAO agreement in November 1993 and 24 April last year when things started to move, basically thought it was not going to happen in our neck of the woods. Then suddenly it is an issue and we have a legal problem where the Tasmanian Supreme Court can negate some Australian laws. We needed to get our house in order, and I think it is wonderful that we have actually done that. The good thing about it is that there has been huge consultation with the industry to try to sort the mess out. It was the expense of the great chases that finally convinced the government that it was necessary to comply with the FAO agreement. As the honourable member for Corangamite said, I am sure all members will remember the drama of the chase in 2001. Day by day almost, as we monitored the media, we were thrilled with the adventures of the South Tomi, a Togo registered fishing vessel-and I wonder what the Togo fishing industry is like-which, with a load of patagonian toothfish, was being chased by the Southern Supporter, an Australian fisheries patrol vessel. It was real Boys Own stuff as the Australian vessel attempted to apprehend the South Tomi and its cargo, which had been gathered illegally from within our exclusive economic zone. As the member for Corio said, two weeks of pursuit ended with the capture of the vessel off the coast of South Africa in a joint operation between the Australian and South African naval forces. That was not the first time illegal fishing had been detected in Australian waters but it was the first time a vessel of this size had been pursued and captured with its load intact. Australia paid for another chase in 2001, again using the Southern Supporter, until after 13½ days low fuel supplies forced the pursuit to end. MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
215,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.52 A.m.),"I congratulate the member for Corangamite on hisFive boats have been seized, most recently the Viarsa. The Lena has been sunk to become a diving wreck, which is making good use of an old fishing vessel, and I have been informed that the South Tomi will meet the same fate. These exciting chases and captures have, I am sure, hastened the government to introduce this legislation to bring our laws into compliance with the FAO agreement. I am pleased that this legislation is finally before us. The most significant change to the Fisheries Management Act proposed by the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 would allow the Commonwealth to recover pursuit and apprehension costs from owners of vessels suspected of fishing offences that do not stop upon request by an officer. The legislation allows AFMA to impose a penalty equal to the pursuit costs where, firstly, a foreign boat fails to stop or move to a certain place on the requirement of an officer; secondly, the boat is in an Australian fishing zone or an Australian territory or the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that it has been or will be used to fish in the AFZ; thirdly, pursuit of the boat is required as a result of its failure to stop or move to the required place; fourthly, the pursuit results in the boat arriving at a place in Australia or an external territory; and, finally, the boat is automatically forfeited under section 106A of the Fisheries Management Act. The parliamentary secretary’s second reading speeches on these bills both mention officers having the power to stop and detain vehicles and aircraft. One assumes that ‘vehicles’ means ships. It worried me a bit, as a layman, when in his second reading speech on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 the parliamentary secretary said: Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Australian government is obliged to promptly release boats seized for suspected fishing offences. I know we are proposing to belt them with $825,000, up from 5,000 penalty units to 7,500 penalty units, but I am wondering whether any discussion is taking place in the UN in light of the increase of these incidents-we have consistent offenders and there are issues of reflagging, repainting and renaming-in the Southern Ocean and oceans off other countries, especially in the South American region. I wonder if anything is being done to change that; as a layman, it seems a bit silly to me. I would be interested to know how our penalties relate to those of other countries which have to go through the same thing. Are we leading the way in increasing the penalties to $825,000? Is there an average internationally? Are we setting the benchmark? Hopefully we are. The other question when it comes to providing people with powers, and in relation to the chase across to South Africa, is: was power given to the Navy to be a sort of subsection of the fisheries industry, and what is the relationship between the Navy and the industry? I know the member for Corangamite stated that we now have a vessel with a weapon on it, but I do not know how that compares with some of the naval vessels. I do not think it is of the size and capacity to lay waste to someone who decides that they are not going to stop. SoI would be interested when the honourable parliamentary secretary comes back-I will not necessarily be here; I will be doing other things-in his comments on that relationship and how that power is delegated. As other speakers have said, there is a great temptation to poach patagonian toothfish from Australian waters. The hundred-tonne cargo of the South Tomi was valued at almost $2 million and, with the decline of the fishing potential in the Northern Hemisphere, this is why MAIN COMMITTEE poachers are coming down here. I congratulate the government on introducing this legislation. As the honourable member for Corio said, it is long overdue. We totally support it. It is going to give some real backbone to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority as it polices our Australian fishing zone. As I said before, there has been huge consultation with the industry and the AFMA board is supporting it. Hopefully some of these little remote countries-these mickey mouse countries-that take advantage of their capacity to register vessels will get the message and there will be less and less of this poaching going on and our fishing stocks in the Southern Ocean will be protected. Previously, we did not even know some of these stocks existed. Just a few years ago we had never heard of the orange roughy and suddenly it flooded the Tasmanian market and the Australian market. We now have the patagonian toothfish. parts of the world. Tasmanians have a few scars on their backs, especially with the scallop industry, which is now, thankfully, coming back. I remember when I first went to Tasmania in 1961 you could take your bucket to the wharf at Hobart and for a shilling you could fill it with scallops-they were that plentiful. But we decimated the fishing stocks and are now in a process of rehabilitation. I welcome and support these two bills. I congratulate the minister on introducing them and look forward to getting couple of answers to a couple of questions I raised today. I congratulate the Australian fishing industry for the work that they have done to ensure that this is up and running and implemented. contribution and support for this legislation, because it is very important that these measures are adopted. They are very important from both an Australian sovereignty point of view and an environmental point of view. So we appreciate the support of the opposition for the measures proposed in the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and Other Matters) Bill 2004 and the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 [2004]. This is a very important issue, as I initially said, which goes to the sovereignty of Australia. We can talk about border protection to our north and we can talk about border protection in our economic zone, but a lot of people fail to register that our economic zone extends to the Heard and McDonald islands. That is a very large fishing zone and we need to protect it. The member for Franklin was quite correct: in the Northern Hemisphere and in other parts to our north, fishing stocks have been depleted because there have not been measures like this put into legislation to protect the resources. To give you an example, I was fortunate enough to be a guest of the Kiribati government, which has a huge economic zone. The Kiribati government has one patrol boat, which the Australian government donated. Strangely, it is not used for patrolling their waters; it is used as an inter-island taxi. As a result, many nations are fishing out the valuable resource of a small nation like Kiribati, and the country gets little or nothing for it. We have to stop this plundering of our fish stocks. I will deal with the nub of the legislation before us today so we can get onto some detail. First of all, the purpose of these bills is to ensure that we give effect to the United Nations FAO agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas-the government has indicated that it will accept MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities

217,Mr Quick,I know-this is one of the things. We talk about what is happening in other,135,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
218,Mr Randall (Canning) (11.03 A.m.),"To begin, I thank the member for Franklin for histhe agreement once this legislation has been passed; in other words, we cannot enter into the agreement until we have our own domestic legislation; secondly, to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and give it extra powers to do its job et cetera; thirdly, to put in place a more effective deterrence and compliance regime as it affects illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our territorial waters; and, fourthly, to promote the ecologically sustainable management of the Commonwealth fisheries. It is great to see that we have the support of the opposition on this matter. The member for Braddon has spoken on this matter previously, and the member for Pearce introduced a private member’s motion into the House last year to deal with this matter, which had bipartisan support-so we are getting somewhere. This process has evolved, but it could have evolved a bit faster. We are finally going to do something about protecting this very valuable resource. I have had a personal interest in this matter for some time. A couple of years ago the Lena, the Volga and the South Tomi were tied up at a wharf in Henderson in the south of Perth. I was given the opportunity to go over the boats with the Customs officers to see what sorts of vessels they were. These vessels have usually been modified for the unique conditions of the Southern Ocean: they are closed-in, are built to withstand very high seas and the cold weather of the Southern Ocean, and have several tiers of crew. The captains, who have been Spanish, pick up people from the Philippines and the tiny Pacific nations like Kirabati to crew these boats and pay them next to nothing. Yet the valuable catches that these pirates-that is the only word for them-are plundering from our southern waters are worth millions of dollars. We need legislation like this because of the difficulty in tracking this absolutely covert operation. The companies are shelf companies that are based in one country and controlled in another. There are many layers of control until you get to the beneficial owners of these companies. As a result, it has been a tortuous process and without sterner legislation it has been even more difficult. Recently, as mentioned by other speakers, the Viarsa was captured. It was one of these farcical chases; as the member for Franklin reported, the whole world was watching the slowest chase in history, across the Southern Ocean towards South Africa, and laughing. The Southern Supporter, irreverently referred to as ‘the jockstrap’, was trying to keep pace with the Viarsa, but because it did not have any firepower the crew were basically knocking on the hull and asking, ‘Would you mind stopping?’ I was at the wharf at Fremantle recently when the MayaV was brought alongside by the Warramunga. Talking to the captain, I asked, ‘Did you have any trouble getting them to comply?’ ‘Not at all,’ he said. ‘See those things on the front of the boat there?’-in other words, the large guns-‘They are very persuasive. We just radioed them and said, “Would you start heading north.” They immediately headed north.’ So that is the difference. And this is what is going to happen with this legislation; we are going to give armed Customs officers and AFMA people the legislated authority to board these vessels, to take over and, with steaming authority, to sail them back to generally Australia or the most relevant port. As I said, the particular boat being sourced at the moment is a boat that can go into the Southern Ocean, with a strengthened hull to go into those icy waters. When the Warramunga came into Fremantle the other day, it was made very clear by the sailors and the crew that, although they were very proud of the fact that they had captured the Maya V, the Warramunga was not built for the conditions of the Southern Ocean, with its mountainous seas and freezing MAIN COMMITTEE cold. To illustrate this, they pointed out that the signage on the front of the Warramunga had almost been removed by the roughness of the seas down there-the rasping effect that the sea had on the Navy boat. It has a very thin hull, and they were worried that they were way down there, 4,000 miles away from anywhere else, and would not want to hit an iceberg or anything like that. So there is a lease out for a boat that is fast enough-not as slow as the Southern Supporter-to keep pace with these illegal boats and to have a 50-millimetre mounted machine gun on the front of the boat so that they can have a little persuasion power as well to deal with these people so that when they tell them to stop or comply they do. These measures will all be very helpful. The difference between legal and illegal fishing is that the legal fishing which we give licences for in the Southern Ocean is beneficial to Australia. It is beneficial for jobs. Based out of Western Australia, particularly Albany, there are quite a number of jobs associated with processing the toothfish and others-it is not just toothfish, but that is largely the catch down there. On the other hand, the pirate vessels take no heed of the biocatch. They operate quite differently from trawlers; they are long liners. Long liners are quite shameful because they catch everything and return nothing from albatrosses et cetera, they catch dolphins, sharks and all the other unnecessary biocatch. By the time they go back and get their huge, long lines, these creatures have drowned, so they are just thrown back into the ocean. However, the legal fishing vessels are required not to throw anything overboard and to return any biocatch that is alive so they do not upset the stability of the environment in that part of the ocean. Anything that is processed on board, such as heads and other pieces of fish, has to go into a fish mill to be turned into fishmeal on board. There are observers: they have environmental consultants on board and people from Fisheries that are making sure that they comply in every respect. The illegal fishing boats do not have to do any of that. Interestingly, initially the pirate vessels were operated by a group called Pacific Andes, largely based in Hong Kong. The last two boats, the Viarsa and the Maya V, were owned by a company called Navalmar, based in Uruguay. It is good to see that the Uruguayan government now understands the problems associated with this industry. On the wharf at Fremantle I met one of the assistants from the Uruguayan Embassy. She was there naturally to look after the interests of the citizens who were Uruguayan. However, it is no secret that some of the observers were brought back to Fremantle and that on the MayaV there was an observer on that ship who was released straight away and who went back to Uruguay. However, in the courts in Western Australia in the last few days five people have been charged: the captain and two of his senior officers and, interestingly, two of the recidivist fishermen. Until then, they had not been dealt with properly. The captain obviously has responsibility for the ship and responsibility for being down there. To see fishermen who return claim that they had no idea when they set off from their port where they were going is farcical. There is a far better database and check being kept on who is crewing these boats. The Viarsa was a boat worth roughly around $3 million. The owner was required to pay a bond of over $5 million, which goes to the cost of the boat and fines et cetera. But the MayaV was a far more sophisticated boat. It is currently in Fremantle due to the arrest. It is obviously worth far more than the Viarsa. We would be looking at something well in excess of $6 million in terms the value of that boat. Very interestingly, it is a very new boat, not one just MAIN COMMITTEE roughly modified like the other boats such as the Lena and the South Tomi. It is very sophisticated. In fact, we all observed that the tower on the MayaV was almost as high as the communications tower on the Australian Navy boat the Warramunga. This is because down in the Southern Ocean they want to see if anyone is coming to catch them in our economic zone. The previous practice was that as soon as they detected something they would either slip off into the French economic zone or slip out of the economic zone. Another practice when they were operating in tandem with some of their own associated company boats was for one of them to put out a mayday call saying that they were in trouble and sinking et cetera, so the Australian Navy were obliged due to law of the sea obligations to go and try and rescue that boat. While they were off dealing with this bogus mayday call the other ships would slip out of the zone and would not be arrested. The beauty about sending the Navy down there armed is that the capture of the Maya V, because it was one of the most valuable boats that this company had, has put the company on the run. The Navalmar company has obviously had quite a hole put through it recently because we have seized two of their most valuable assets in the MayaV and the Viarsa. That is going to put a dent in their fortunes and have them thinking twice about going back into the Southern Ocean. Also, I must congratulate the French because just recently the French formed a treaty with Australia to share information and to share radar facilities so as to check on movements and to gather and coordinate approaches. That in itself is an excellent result. Getting back to the Maya V, one of the things that we have had difficulty with is that everyone said that you could not relocate the satellite signalling of these boats. But it has been reasonably well established now that the MayaV seemed to be somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. It was not. It was down in the Southern Ocean, but they had been able to so skew their signal and corrupt their radar devices-or whatever the right term is-that they were believed to be somewhere else when they were actually in the Southern Ocean. This is where the cooperation and the commitment to these compliance measures are going to make a huge difference. Today in court in Western Australia. I will not comment on the merits or otherwise-are the rest of the crew of the Maya V. If form is any guide, they will more than likelyperhaps be aware of the sub judice issue and refrain from commenting on current legal proceedings. those people out of the country so that we do not have to put up with this anymore-as long as they understand that if they come back here again, like the previous two, charges will be far more substantial. It think it is quite in order to say that. At the end of the day, this is coming to a conclusion; with the rest of the cases involving these boats-some of them are ongoingthe best thing would be to sink the boats for dive wrecks. The South Tomi is about to be sunk off Geraldton, and that is a good result. I am sure that Wilson Tuckey, the member for O’Connor, will be happy, because he was the acting minister when the South Tomi was being chased. He gave permission for the chase to continue, and I think it is very appropriate that it be sunk near Geraldton. MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
219,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Gambaro),I ask the honourable member for Canning to,138,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
220,Mr Randall,"I am just saying that they are before the court and we would like to seeI am also putting a bid in for one of these wrecks-hopefully the MayaV or the Viarsa-to be sunk as a dive wreck off Mandurah in my electorate of Canning, because it would have an economic benefit. You cannot put these boats back out for auction, because they would appear back down in the Southern Ocean. As much as you might get several million dollars for them, at the end of the day you find that they will be back on the run. It is just logical that we do something fruitful with them rather than putting them back into service where they are going to work against us. The member for Franklin asked a few questions about boarding-what the legal process is et cetera. The fact is that this bill allows the pursuit of costs on top of a vessel’s value, and that is very important. There are a number of other questions, which I am sure that the parliamentary secretary will address in summing up, to ensure that domestic and international legal processes are followed prior to any of this occurring. This is done under the UN law of the sea requirements, which countries are obliged to abide by. In the last few minutes that I have, it is important to say that this is an investment by our government, to the tune of close to $100 million over the next two years, in the lease of this vessel and its crew. Customs have called for persons to be involved in training for boarding parties et cetera and for the expertise to crew this boat in these very dangerous waters. Ultimately, the patagonian toothfish, which is a rare treat particularly in countries like Japan, is a stock that we need to preserve. In closing, it is also interesting to note that we have an allocation of over 8,000 tonnes of legal catch yet the estimation is that the pirates are currently catching almost that much. There is some talk that maybe we should back off and not be down there until the stock replenishes itself. That is quite ludicrous, because if you are not down there you cannot see what is going on and you cannot monitor who else is in the area. This is cooperation not just between the agencies but between the fishermen down there. I commend this legislation to the House. It is important legislation and I appreciate the opposition’s support on this matter. (Time expired) Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 and the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and Other Matters) Bill 2004. CouldI just comment on the passionate speech by my colleague the member for Canning. Obviously, he is as concerned as most members of this House are about our sovereignty, fishing rights and, indeed, the future of the sea. I commend him on his speech. The sovereignty of our sea has been tested many times over the past few years, in particular in the Southern Ocean. We have all witnessed on television the arrest of the crew of the MayaV by the HMAS Warramunga and also the pursuit of the Viarsa I. These vessels, amongst others, have entered our waters and taken what is our sovereign right in fish, through piracy, and this needs to end. CanI say from the outset that I am glad that the federal government will be investing some $100 million over two years to build a vessel that is suitable. As a ship’s master-and I have been down in the southern seas-I say that no vessel is ever fast enough or big enough to handle some of the punishment that those seas can deliver. The main effort in the compliance and deterrence measures bill is that we need to deter illegal fishing, we need to deter unreported fishing and we need to deter unregulated fishing. The impacts that these are having on our fish stocks are rather dramatic. The amount of fish taken out of our Southern Ocean due to piracy, as we have heard, almost equals the amount of our allowable catch. We have seen over MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
221,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (11.23 A.m.),"TodayI rise to speak to the Fisheries Legislationthe years the decimation of the orange roughy stock. Now that we have AFMA with a management catchment plan we are addressing that situation, but how much of that stock has been pirated? It is only in the past few years that we have found out that the age of these fish is quite high, that some of these fish are 100 years old and that their breeding and life cycle times are quite extensive. So, if you deplete the stock, the replenishment time is quite a considerable period. The bill amends the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to, firstly, put in place more effective deterrence and compliance regimes to help deter foreign fishers from illegally fishing in Australian waters-something that we all champion. Secondly, it will improve the operating efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in its management of Commonwealth fishery resources; and, thirdly, it will promote the sustainable utilisation of Commonwealth fisheries and promote ecologically sustainable practices in Commonwealth managed fisheries. This bill is all about amending the act and providing for the increasing of penalties under the FMA for foreign fishing offences committed in the Australian fishing zone. It strengthens our bond arrangement for foreign boats that have been seized and forfeited to the Commonwealth, by enabling the Australian government’s reasonable costs of pursuit and apprehension to be deemed to be a debt owing to the Commonwealth and enabling it to be included in a bond or recovered from the owner of a foreign boat. I can support that because we have seen pursuits over many days. I think one of them went for 21 days, and the cost to our country off the bottom line was quite severe. We should have a right to recover those costs, and those costs must be borne by the people who have committed the acts of piracy upon our high seas. In addition, this bill provides for members of the management advisory committee to be paid remunerations and allowances, and so they should be for the work that they put into it. The bill also allows AFMA to waive a levy payment if a fishing permit is surrendered before any fishing has been undertaken. That is smart, because that allows people to avoid suffering a loss if they have not actually undertaken the fishing action, whereas, if they had a permit that they had paid for without being able to recover the costs of that permit, who knows what they would do with that permit or their vessel. I see that as contributing to a reduction in the fishing pressure. The bill also requires original fishing concessions to be physically returned to AFMA when they are surrendered, so that they cannot be hived off to pirates and the like. It also allows fishery officers, where it is not physically possible to present their identification, to exercise their powers without producing written identification-though they must present written identification at the first available opportunity. The bottom line is that this bill stands to put more effective controls and measures on our fishing industry. It has been put together with full consultation with the industry through AFMA’s management advisory committees, and it has been fully approved and endorsed by the AFMA board. AFMA have been making some great progress. Part of the problem is the need to determine management plans for all fisheries, as required by legislation. The reality is that many of our fisheries are managed under administrative arrangements or through permits rather than through actual management plans. Of the fisheries listed in the 2000-01 annual report as fisheries managed under the Fisheries Management Act as at 2 July 2002, AFMA has now determined management plans for the Northern Prawn Fishery, the Southern Bluefin Tuna Fishery, the South East Trawl Fishery, the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery, and MAIN COMMITTEE Heard Island and Macdonald Islands Fishery. In five other fisheries-Southern Shark, South East nontrawl, Bass Strait Scallop, East Coast Tuna and Billfish, and West Coast Tuna and Billfish-plans were expected to be in effect by 30 June 2003. We need to look at these things, because they are extremely important. It is a resource which is renewable, but over what period of time? We have seen the effect of unmanaged fisheries on the southern bluefin tuna, where in the random capture of tuna the size of the tuna is progressively getting smaller and smaller as time goes on, because through previous bad practices and poor management the breeding stock and juveniles were taken out of the chain on the way through. That has had a dramatic effect. That is not just the southern bluefin tuna. I also see the effect on our yellowfin tuna fisheries. In the two fishing ports that I represent, Port Stephens and Forster, we have seen a gradual reduction in the size of the tuna being brought to market. I remember that when I was working on tuna boats back in the eighties it was not uncommon to catch yellowfin tuna that weighed in the vicinity of 110 to 130 kilograms. These fish were not abnormal; if you picked up the right school at the right time of year they were the catch you had. TodayI regularly see tuna being brought to market that are only in the 30 to 50 kilogram range. What has happened is there has been overfishing. A few years ago I was fortunate enough to attend the South Pacific Forum and to have some discussions on fisheries. There is a huge effect where some of the US factory ships and the huge purse seiners are taking a lot of the breeding stock from international waters or from around islands where they have bought the rights to fish in those waters. The problem is that fish are not animals that you can put in a paddock and control; these are free-ranging predator species that roam the ocean looking for the next school of fish to feed on. Today they are in our waters; tomorrow they are in someone else’s waters. But there needs to be overall global management plans. SoI commend this bill. I would now like to address a couple of matters relating to the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and Other Matters) Bill 2004. This bill provides further amendments to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to enable Australia to give effect in its domestic law to the obligations it would have as a party to the agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas. That is extremely important; the value of this bill cannot be underestimated. This compliance agreement was unanimously approved at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation conference in December 1993, in which Australia participated. The compliance agreement will enter into force internationally upon receipt of the 25th instrument of acceptance on 24 April 2004. The compliance agreement was developed as part of an international response to the lack of effective flag state control of high seas fishing vessels by fishing nations. This has remained one of the main reasons for the increasing level of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on the high seas. The compliance agreement aims in particular to combat the practice of vessels avoiding compliance with international fisheries management measures by reflagging to countries that are unable or unwilling to comply with those measures. It encourages greater international cooperation and compliance by requiring flag states to implement authorisation and recording systems for high seas fishing vessels and to share the information required to be collected on the activities of those vessels on the high seas with the FAO, foreign countries MAIN COMMITTEE and international bodies. This is all about bringing people back to accountability. It is about managing the fish stocks on an international basis. Australia is a responsible flag state and already abides by the essential obligations within the compliance agreement. The amendments to our domestic laws are required to provide for additional statutory functions and objectives for AFMA to enable it to ensure that fishing by Australian flagged vessels on the high seas is conducted in a manner that is fully consistent with the compliance agreement to ensure that AFMA is able to record the requisite information about high seas vessels and give effect to the compliance agreement’s information exchange obligations. That is so important. But more important is what we are doing in the miscellaneous amendments under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 that improve the overall ability of AFMA to deliver and enforce effective fisheries management in our own Commonwealth fisheries. The amendments cover a diverse range of subjects, including: the power to require fishing concession holders to keep and maintain logbooks on their activities in a fishery; limited powers of an officer to stop and detain vehicles and aircraft without a warrant or the consent of the owner or person in charge of the vehicle or aircraft; giving fishing charter a similar but separate status to recreational fishing; and amendments to the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States, which is attached at schedule 1. Why are logbooks important? It is important to understand that there can be a vast difference between the fish caught and the fish that are actually brought to market, weighed and sold. The latter is a measure that can be undertaken at any time, but under a logbook situation what also must be recorded is the incidental by-catch. I bring the attention of the chamber back to a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs called Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier. I was on that committee at the time and, as we went around and talked to the different fisheries, what was horrific was the amount of incidental by-catch which was then discarded. As much as 56 per cent of the capture was discarded as by-catch. Logbooks enable proper management of the system so that we can ensure that our fisheries are there for the sustainable long term. The thing that really interests me in relation to my local operators is the change relating to charter fishing. The charter fishing industry out of Port Stephens and Forster perhaps even competes with Cairns for the number of charter fishing vessels that operate. Over the last two weekends we have had the interclub competition in Port Stephens where we have had 250 vessels competing in an international game fishing competition run by the New South Wales Game Fishing Association, and properly and professionally managed as well. The critical part of this bill is that it determines that charter boats will be deemed as recreational fishing vessels. In other words, the compliance requirement on them in relation to catch is not as it would be if these vessels were deemed to be commercial. That is very significant and should not be underestimated or understated in any way whatsoever. This gives charter boats a separate status under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 as recreational fishing. The amendment will bring AFMA’s responsibility for charter fishing in line with that for recreational fishing and it is consistent with outcome 24 of the report Looking to the future: a review of Commonwealth fisheries policy, which was published in June 2003. It means that the Fisheries ManMAIN COMMITTEE agement Act 1991 will no longer apply to charter fishing vessels within the Australian fishing zone, or outside the Australian fishing zone by an Australian boat. I welcome that and I know that all of the charter fishing boat crews in my electorate, one of which I occasionally skipper, will be very pleased with that. After you look at the removal of charter boats from being classified as commercial vessels, the other important thing is the item that repeals paragraph 15A(1)(b), which restricts the taking of blue marlin or black marlin in the Australian fishing zone to a holder of a scientific licence, a recreational fisher or a charter boat. It has been changed to the effect that it includes fishing from a charter boat as a subset of recreational fishing. That links in with the previous amendment in reassigning what the character is of a charter fishing vessel away from being a commercial vessel to being a recreational vessel. When the primary industries committee report called Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier was published, I put in a dissenting report. In my dissenting report I proposed that not only black marlin and blue marlin but also striped marlin and shortbill spearfish should be a prohibited catch. Unfortunately, during the debate on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 1998, which I debated in this chamber on 25 June 1998, that campaign was not successful. But we were successful when Senator Warwick Parer, the then minister, did move to have black and blue marlin made not able to be taken as a commercial species. I remember that back on 4 July 1996 there was a front-page article in the Daily Telegraph which stated that many tonnes of fish weighing as much as 700 kilograms-115 carcases of juvenile black and blue marlin-had been rotting in cold stores for 12 months. They were impossible to sell, so they were going to become fertiliser. That was a great trigger for the banning of black and blue marlin fishing. I recognise that the government is cleaning up the legislation but I would have preferred that it had taken the approach of banning the capture of striped marlin and shortbill spearfish. One of the inherent problems, as I have said in the House before, is that a black or blue marlin does not know that the hook which is set with a bait for a striped marlin is not intended for it. Long-line fishing practices are no different from those for catching striped, black or blue marlin or shortbill spearfish. Whilst those fish are no longer coming to market, they are being disposed of, usually dead, which is a waste. The reality is that the percentage of by-catch has not been reduced. The market for marlin is very limited. The market for broadbill, which is a different method of fishing from marlin fishing, is very high. The texture, taste and market appreciation of broadbill is quite considerable. But I believe that there is nothing to gain, either commercially or for the conservation of our fish stocks, from allowing the continuation of fishing for striped marlin or shortbill spearfish as a commercially acceptable species. The damage inflicted upon our fishery stocks is quite severe. In closing, fishing is perhaps one of the greatest bonding experiences between children and their parents, particularly from the point of view of male-to-male bonding. At the moment, while we are discussing in the parliament a whole range of issues and bills relating to the need for boys to have male role models, by making sure that we have a long-term, sustainable fishery we will provide greater opportunity for and greater enjoyment of the bonding of males just through going fishing. My young fellas, the twins, absolutely love fishing. Every opportunity we get, we go fishing. There is more communication between me and my sons when we are out fishing than when we are at home or doing any other activity. It is relaxing and we MAIN COMMITTEE are sharing a common interest. Making sure that we preserve our fisheries and that we manage them properly is something that I commend. Mr Brendan O’Connor-Do you catch any? tralians, we do not tend to bring home a lot for the frypan. What is important-and I respect them for it-is that my children de-hook and throw back 99 per cent of the fish that they catch. Nothing made me prouder than when the bigger of my twins caught his first marlin in the interclub competition last year. He made the decision to tag it and, by doing that, came second in the competition. If he had decided to kill and weigh it, he would have won the competition. An 11-year-old making a responsible environmental decision like that made me a very proud father. (Time expired) and Resources) (11.43 a.m.)-in reply-Even though this is a cognate debate, I would like to sum up individually the debates on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Compliance and Deterrence Measures and Other Matters) Bill 2003 and the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and Other Matters) Bill 2004. First, I thank the members for Corio, Franklin, Corangamite and Canning and my good friend the member for Paterson for his insight into responsible fishing-even though he does not catch any fish. I would like to thank the opposition for their bipartisan support for these bills. The member for Franklin questioned Australia’s obligation to bonded vessels apprehended for alleged illegal fishing. In response to his concern, I would just like to say to him that this is required under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The compliance and deterrence bill allows for the costs of pursuit-on top of your normal patrol costs-to be included in any bond amount. Australia in fact is setting the benchmark in paralysing illegal foreign fishing. This is best illustrated by the Volga case that went before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, where the proceeds from the sale of the catch were included in the bond amount, on top of the value of the vessel. This was a significant win and indicates an evolving view of the seriousness of illegal fishing by the tribunal, who were unaware of any other country pushing the envelope to the same extent as Australia. This bill is part of a package of important amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991. The bill promotes the ecologically sustainable management of Commonwealth fisheries and the improvement of the operating efficiency and effectiveness of AFMA. Most importantly, it reinforces the Howard government’s efforts to put in place more effective deterrence and compliance regimes and to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported, or IUU, fishing. Recent cases-the illegal fishing vessel Viarsa1 in Australian waters in the Southern Ocean and the apprehension of the suspected illegal fishing vessel the MayaV in the waters surrounding Australia’s Heard Island and McDonald Islands-demonstrate why the government is taking strong action to deal with this serious problem. IUU fishing threatens Australia’s sovereign interests, the sustainability of fish stocks and the unique marine environments. The level of IUU fishing is likely to grow as Northern Hemisphere fish stocks are overfished and global overcapacity increases. The Howard government remains determined to lead the fight against such destructive and unsustainable fishing practices, a stance that has seen the government since 1997 pursue and arrest eight vessels that were found illegally fishing in our subantarctic waters; establish a year-round armed paMAIN COMMITTEE",139,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities

Strengthening Australia’s domestic fishing legislation will help to protect Australian waters from illegal fishing. The passage of this bill will send an important message to illegal foreign fishers that this government is determined to fight illegal foreign fishing and is pursuing every avenue available to do this. In relation to the second bill, the member for Franklin also raised the issue of reflagging of vessels. The high seas bill, in allowing Australia to ratify the UN compliance agreement, has Australia joining other major fishing nations such as the UK, USA, Japan, Korea and others that require a vessel’s history to be considered prior to authorising it to fish. This bill is part of a package of important amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991. The amendment in schedule 1 of the bill gives effect to Australia’s international fisheries obligations under the compliance agreement. The amendments contained in schedule 2 cover a diverse range of subjects as a result of continuing refinement of fisheries management practices and are aimed at improving the management of Australian Commonwealth fisheries. The compliance agreement is a multilateral treaty governing the use of living resources on the high seas. It was developed in response to concerns about declining fish stocks as a result of increasing levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. It is an integral part of the framework of international instruments for fisheries management and conservation. Over 60 per cent of the oceans lie beyond the exclusive economic zones of coastal states. These areas are known as the high seas and are open access common areas. As fish stocks have declined dramatically in the Northern Hemisphere, interests have grown in the fish stocks in the high seas in the Southern Hemisphere. Because the high seas are beyond the jurisdiction of any state, the stocks are open to exploitation and open fishing. IUU fishing is jeopardising the conservation and management of global fish stocks and threatening Australian harvests of fish stocks within and beyond the Australian fishing zone. Australia’s acceptance of the compliance agreement will help demonstrate to other countries, particularly those that are not yet party to the agreement, that we are serious about our efforts to combat IUU fishing.

224,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Mossfield),"The question is that this bill be now read aASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee Report Debate resumed from 10 March, on motion by Mr Jull: That the House take note of the paper. on ASIO, ASIS and DSD is one of the most important documents delivered by a parliamentary committee in the life of this parliament. The committee includes amongst its membership some of the most respected people on either side of the chamber-from the Labor side, two former ministers for defence, who are regarded widely in the defence and security community as amongst the best defence ministers for a generation, and a former Speaker. Its deliberations are significant. The fact that it provides a report which is unanimous is even more significant, because as you go through the report what it identifies is that our security agencies and information gathering bodies by and large provided professional, capable and good advice about the situation that was unfolding in Iraq. What also becomes clear when measured against the statements that were in the public domain and particularly those that were promoted by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that the government was extremely selective, deceptive and misleading in the way in which it presented these things to the Australian people. I want to refer to a couple of the matters that are picked up by the committee in its report to expand on that deception and the way in which the Australian people were hoodwinked in the lead-up to the decision to invade Iraq. At paragraph 2.40 the committee records: The agencies provided hardly any explicit assessment on the question of the immediacy of threat posed by Saddam Hussein. In March 2001, ONA was of the view that ‘the scale of threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction is less than it was a decade ago.’ However, there are, in the more recent assessments, highly qualified references to Iraq’s capacity to ‘restart CW and BWthat is chemical warfare and biological warfareprograms within weeks ...’ But, agencies repeatedly say in respect of this that ‘there is no evidence that Iraq has done so’ and ... ‘some CW stocks will have deteriorated.’ The simple fact is that the best advice of our intelligence agencies to the government was that there was no evidence to support the argument that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to Australia or our allies. Indeed, whatever capability they had was seriously degraded from what it had been a decade earlier. Measure that against the comments that we got from the government. We all recall the hysteria that was being whipped up by the foreign affairs minister particularly, but also by the Prime Minister. I refer specifically, though, to the comments made by the foreign minister, Alexander Downer. Referring to the UN Security Council veto, he said: This denied the Security Council any further role in the disarming of Iraq, but it did not deny ... the clear and immediate threat posed by Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction to global security ... That is what our foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said on 18 March last year in a statement to the parliament-that there was an immediate threat posed by Iraq’s WMD, when in fact we now know, from an all-party committee report, that no such advice was ever tendered to the government. Indeed, the opposite was the case. Let me turn to another example that MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Fisheries Legislation Amendment High Seas Fishing Activities
225,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (11.52 A.m.),"This report from the Parliamentary Joint Committeehighlights this same propensity to be selective, deceptive and misleading-or, as one of their own members once commented, ‘mean and sneaky’. At paragraph 5.21 the report notes: ONA agreed that these judgementsThat is, judgments that had the been made by the Prime Minister and ministersquoted in the speeches, were not necessarily ones that they might have made, but that, as they were made on the basis of material ONA had not seen, the quotations in the speeches were not questioned. They were considered accurate quotations, in the sense of transcriptions, from the British and US documents. That is, that our government decided to quote directly from documents presented by British and US intelligence agencies. Furthermore: In response to a question about the threat of Iraq’s WMD being ‘real and unacceptable’, Mr Lewincamp thought it was not a judgement that DIO would have made. That is, the chief officer of the Defence Intelligence Organisation said, ‘Those things that our government were saying-that John Howard, Alexander Downer and others were sayingbased on information they were being given by UK and US sources, were not judgments that our own defence agencies would have made.’ But it gets worse. At paragraph 5.22, it says: Government presentations were in some areas incomplete, notably in respect of some of the available United Nations information on Iraq. ‘Incomplete’ is a very polite way of saying they were deliberately misleading, because, when you hear the rest of this, you will understand how misleading it was. In that same paragraph the committee noted: For example, in 1995, the United Nations debriefed Saddam Hussein’s son-in-law, Kamal Hussein. From this debriefing, Mr Howard quoted admissions by Hussein that indicated Iraq had ‘a massive program for developing offensive biological weapons-one of the largest and most advanced in the world.’ That is what John Howard said that Saddam Hussein’s son-in-law had said, but as this report notes: This description of Hussein’s admission was true, but the program he described related to a much earlier period, and the bulk of the Kamal Hussein’s debriefing made repeated statements about the failures of nuclear programs, the destruction of weapons and agents associated with the chemical and biological programs and the overall success of the UNSCOM weapons inspections. That is, the true picture was that in the early 1990s and late 1980s Saddam Hussein had a weapons of mass destruction program, described then by Saddam Hussein’s son-in-law in the terms that the Prime Minister repeated just last year. The Prime Minister pretended that the situation in Iraq that was described in 1990 still prevailed in 2002. The Prime Minister must have known that that information was misleading. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.59 a.m. to 12.16 p.m. and it is more in the line of a conclusion. In paragraph 5.16 the committee noted: ... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq’s WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations. MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Committees
226,Mr Bevis,"There is one further clause in the report that I think is important to refer to,We can all remember the threats and over-the-top comments from the government about that. The committee then concluded: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia’s two analytical agencies. There it is in black and white. The core aspect of the government’s case for the war on terror was that there was an unacceptable threat to the region and the world, and specifically that Iraq might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations. Answer: that was never the advice the government received. The committee’s conclusion was: This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia’s two analytical agencies. As the war with Iraq unfolded and as it became clear that the government’s case had been built on fabrication, exaggeration, selective quoting and downright lies, the government shifted position and said, ‘Well, we’re not going there for weapons of mass destruction, we’re going there for regime change.’ That of course was never part of the debate in the UN. The government also said, ‘We’re going there to liberate these poor oppressed people in Iraq.’ I do not recall that ever being one of the reasons advanced in the debate prior to the decision to commit our troops to the Middle East. asked by the government to support sending Australian troops there to liberate people in Iraq from what was no doubt an oppressive and violent dictatorship. That was not the reason. The reason was WMD. That is what the government said and that is what they based their case on, and this report shows us that that was a fallacy. The real tragedy of all this is that we did not have to wait until months after the war to realise that this government had based its argument for war on falsehoods, exaggerations and selective quotes. That information was out there in the public debate, and this government and this parliament refused to consider it. I want to repeat a couple of the assessments made at the time, which I have referred to in previous debates on this matter in the parliament. Let me go to the comments of General Anthony Zinni. He was the commander in chief of the US Central Command. This command was responsible for US forces in the Middle East and Central Asia-the very area in question-and he was the commander there from 1997 to 2000. He would have seen every piece of intelligence on that part of the world in the lead-up to these events. This is what he had to say in August 2002: Attacking Iraq now will cause a lot of problems. ... If you ask me my opinion, Gen. Scowcroft, Gen. Powell, Gen. Schwarzkopf, Gen. Zinni ... all see this the same way. It might be interesting to wonder why all the generals see it the same way, and all those that never fired a shot in anger and are really hell bent to go to war see it a different way. Then he cited a number of things that were far more important than George Bush’s, John Howard’s and Tony Blair’s desire to wage war on Iraq. He said: The Middle East process, in my mind, has to be a higher priority. Winning the war on terrorism has to be a higher priority. More directly, the situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asia needs to be resolved, making sure al Qaeda can’t rise again from the ashes ... Taliban cannot come back.

228,Mr Bevis,"Indeed, as correctly pointed out: not by the government. We were not beingHe was absolutely right. On many occasions, inside and outside the parliament, I have endorsed those comments as an eminently reasonable and sound strategic analysis-all of which was ignored at the time. Remember that he said that in 2002. There are further examples. General Brent Scowcroft, a former national security adviser to Presidents Ford and Bush Snr-a Republican security analyst-said: ... the central point is that any campaign against Iraq, whatever the strategy, cost and risks, is certain to divert us for some indefinite period from our war on terrorism. And he was perfectly right. That is the cost that America and the rest of us have paid since. America has seen its position in the world after September 11, when there was virtually a united world view of sympathy with and support for America and a commitment to deal with terrorism, eroded quickly because of the way in which President Bush has mishandled the war on terror, blinded by his desire to proceed with the war in Iraq. General Joseph Hoar, who also had been Commander of Central Command, told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that a case had not been made to connect al-Qaeda and Iraq. He said, ‘To the contrary, there is no clear and convincing pattern of Iraqi relations with either al-Qaeda or the Taliban.’ General Hoar told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that America’s first and primary effort should be to defeat al-Qaeda. But you did not have to look to American generals who had access to this intelligence. You had people here in Australia, on the Liberals’ own side of parliament, trying to tell them that it was the wrong thing to do. John Valder, a former national president of the Liberal Party said: Does anyone seriously believe that Iraq constitutes the greatest problem confronting the world? Even a former national president of the Liberal Party was moved to comment publicly that this was not an intelligent thing to do in the interests of national security; yet, in the face of the advice it was getting from our security agencies, the government persisted to press down that road. I was also taken by the comments of a number of other people in that period, warning us all of these errors. Scott Ritter, who is a former UN weapons inspector in Iraq and a US citizen, went to Iraq and addressed their parliament. When he addressed the Iraqi parliament in September 2002, he said: My country seems on the verge of making an historic mistake, one that will forever change the political dynamic which has governed the world since the end of the Second World War; namely, the foundation of international law as set forth in the United Nations Charter, which calls for the peaceful resolution of problems between nations ... As someone who counts himself as a fervent patriot and a good citizen of the United States of America, I feel I cannot stand by idly, while my country behaves in such a fashion ... He went on to make a number of very important comments which I do not have time to go into but which I should say are fully included on my personal web site. There was also the resignation of a US career diplomat, John Brady Kiesling. I do not have time to read the details into Hansard but I encourage members to catch up with them on my web site. Finally, I want to refer to a speech by US Senator Edward Kennedy in March 2003. He said: In a desperate effort to justify its focus on Iraq, the Administrationthat is, the American administrationMAIN COMMITTEE long asserted that there are ties between Osama and Saddam-a theory with no proof and widely doubted by intelligence experts. Two weeks after 9/11, Secretary Rumsfeld claimed that we had ‘bulletproof’ evidence of the link. But a year later, CIA Director Tenet conceded in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Administration’s understanding of the link was still ‘evolving’ and was based on ‘sources of varying reliability.’ In fact, the link is so widely doubted that intelligence experts have expressed their concern that intelligence is being politicized to support the rush to war. That is exactly what John Howard did and it is exactly what George Bush did, and the committee report exposes that. (Time expired) the parliamentary report titled Intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. I find interesting the literary device of the use of the word ‘intelligence’ in the title of this report. At issue are not only the use, misuse and abuse of intelligence by this government but also the intelligence of those who advanced the argument for war against Iraq. I speak in particular about the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He began this debate with insults. Anyone who opposed war in Iraq was labelled an ‘appeaser’. Even a cursory understanding of what ‘appeasement’ means shows that the foreign minister knows nothing about it, historically or intellectually. But we were labelled ‘appeasers’. The other insult near the end of the debacle of Australia’s involvement in Iraq is that those who opposed the war and the government’s case for it were labelled pro-Saddam. What an insult! I was pleased to see that those with a strong background in things military and intelligence who had doubts about this war were so offended by this label that they publicly attacked the foreign minister’s assessments. Air Marshall Ray Funnell, who was Chief of Air Staff from 1987 to 1992, was strongly opposed to the war and took great umbrage at the foreign minister’s ridiculous insult, as did Admiral Mike Hudson, Chief of Naval Staff from 1985 to 1991, and General Peter Gration, Chief of the Australian Defence Force from 1987 to 1993. I think I can also include Major General Phillips, retired, who was at one time head of the RSL. I personally take offence at anyone who would level at those who question the involvement of this government, the United States and the UK in the war in Iraq a charge that they supported Saddam Hussein’s regime. The third major insult was when the Prime Minister and the foreign minister of this country insulted the intelligence of the Australian people. When we commit our forces to service overseas it is a very important and grave decision. We need to know the real reasons why the government believes we should commit those troops. This report clearly indicates that the reasons advanced could not be substantiated in detail by the intelligence that was available to us. When you look at the reasons advanced by the Prime Minister in his formal parliamentary rationale on 18 March 2003 for sending our troops to war and committing this nation and its future to the consequences of that decision you see that the reasons offered-the clear and present danger to the world because of the existence of weapons of mass destruction and a clear and present danger to Australia’s future and our national interests-are not the arguments now being advanced by the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, because they are now arguing for regime change.

Health: Dental Services worse acts of vandalism when it abolished the former Keating Labor government’s Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. The government continues to ignore its responsibility to provide dental care for low-income Australians. Yesterday’s announcement illustrates the Howard government’s mean-spirited attitude towards lowand medium-income families. Many Australians do not seek dental appointments, because they simply cannot afford them. A recent national survey found that one-third of Australians in the $30,000 to $50,000 household income bracket had not been to a dentist for over two years, due to their inability to pay. Poor dental health means pain, inconvenience, poor general health, embarrassment and discrimination. Despite the state governments’ increasing expenditure on dental programs, there is now a huge unmet demand for publicly funded dental programs. In May 1998 the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Public dental services found that when the Commonwealth dental program was abolished there were approximately 380,000 Australians waiting an average of six months for public dental care. By May 2000, that figure had blown out to half a million people waiting for between eight months and five years for public dental care. The collection of national figures has since been stopped. In the central Victorian region that I represent, the dental waiting period stats are as follows. In Bendigo the wait for general dental treatment is 38 months, and the number of patients waiting for it is 6,001; there are 372 patients waiting 19 months for denture treatment. In Maryborough the wait for general dental treatment is 45 months and there are 1,498 people waiting for that treatment; there are 40 people waiting for dentures, and they have to wait eight months. In Daylesford the wait for general dental treatment is 20 months and there are 858 people waiting for that treatment; the wait for dentures is 33 months, and there are 133 people waiting for that. In Sunbury the wait is 10 months for general dental treatment and the number of patients waiting is 1,083; for dentures treatment the waiting period is 55 months and the number of patients waiting is 334.

232,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (12.30 P.m.),"The Howard government committed one of itsper year for our program when it is fully operational. Labor will work in partnership with the states and territories to implement Australian dental care. A genuine partnership with states and territories will deliver services to agreed national benchmarks. This will provide up to 1.3 million extra dental procedures for Australians, enough to clear the existing backlog and substantially reduce the waiting lists. Many people on the waiting lists for dental care are elderly, and we can and must do better as a nation and as a government to treat these people. Australian dental care will revive Ben Chifley’s vision when he inserted an amendment into the Constitution in 1946 that said that affordable dental treatment was as essential as other medical treatments. Dental care is a national responsibility, something the Prime Minister would have us believe he has recently discovered. The changes announced yesterday by the Minister for Health and Ageing are a weak attempt at a political fix in the run-up to a forthcoming federal election. The Prime Minister has left Australia as a waiting list country with a waiting list government. Yesterday’s announcement means that the Howard government has allocated a miserable $5 million for four years, and only for dental patients with additional chronic health illnesses caused by their dental problems. These patients must suffer dental related chronic health problems for six months before they can get assistance. For pensioners and low-income earners, this amounts to nothing less than torture. Under Labor, the federal and state governments will join together in a great national effort to fix the dental health crisis. The quality of services provided under Australian dental care will be subject to rigorous data collection and benchmarking. Under Labor’s plan, concession card holders-such as pensioners, health care card holders and their dependants-will get free check-ups when they need them as well as subsidised dental treatments, restorations and dentures. Labor’s plan will also assess the dental health of every person admitted to residential care and will put in place action to provide ongoing care. Under Australian dental care, a Labor government will provide $300 million over the forward estimates for the provision of dental services to health care card holders and their dependants. When fully operational, the $120 million per year will be allocated for Australian dental care. Of this $300 million, $13 million will be earmarked for dental assessments of older Australians entering resident aged care and $18 million will be earmarked for providing services to Indigenous Australians. State and territory governments will spend $384 million on dental services for health care card holders and schoolchildren this financial year. Labor’s plan for Australian dental care means the Commonwealth will also meet its responsibility. This is one of the basic services of a civilised society. We need to dramatically reduce these outrageous waiting times, and only Labor will provide the policies to do it. Medicare: Reform Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.35 p.m.)-I would like to congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing on his historic reforms announced yesterday, including the additional money that is being spent on the MedicarePlus program, taking it from $2.4 billion-the original package-to $2.85 billion. I have to say, having listened to the member for Bendigo, that a colleague from my side said, ‘We are in Utopia!’ We would love as a government to give money to every single health aspect of the portfolio, but there just is not the money to do that. When you consider that Medicare pays out $8.1 billion a year, how is that to be done? That is $8.1 billion. I would like the opposition to tell us where they are going to find the money to provide all of the dental care in the world to everyone who requires it. But we are MAIN COMMITTEE providing a much-needed service to 23,000 patients with chronic medical conditions, and it is important to highlight that. Thanks to the assistance and support of the Independents, who were able to look at this very objectively, this package will pass. Congratulations to Meg Lees, Brian Harradine, Shayne Murphy and Len Harris. They were able to look at this as a total package and say to themselves that all of Australia, not just one particular aspect of it, would benefit from this. With a limited health budget, you have to ensure that it is provided to those people who need it the most. I would like to say that, in all of this debate, the only thing that the opposition health spokeswoman, Julia Gillard, could say was that we are eroding Medicare as a universal health system. I would like to say to the opposition health spokeswoman that Medicare is universal. Anyone at any time in Australia can go to any doctor and get the same rebate. It does not matter whether it is me or Kerry Packer, we can all go to a doctor who will see us, and we will get the same rebate. I do not know where she gets this non-universality aspect from. One of the most important things that has occurred with the package is that the payments to doctors have been increased, so it will now be $7.50 for cardholders and children in regional areas. There have also been some top-up payments in areas such as South Australia and Tasmania. Those areas traditionally have had very low bulk-billing rates. The government has also lowered the out-of-pocket expenses threshold, which is now $300 for cardholders and $700 for other families. Let us not underestimate the importance of that measure. If a woman, for example, has breast cancer and needs to have treatment-and there are many; this is a disease that affects about one in 15 women-they have to have 20 or 30 treatments, and they will be out of pocket many thousands of dollars. This measure will ensure that women in that category will be able to apply those out of pocket expenses to this, so they will not be out-ofpocket thousands of dollars as they have been before. Also, it goes to things like ultrasounds. A visit to get an ultrasound, for example, can be a very costly experience, and people can be out of pocket for a considerable amount. So these are very good measures. The measures address a number of other areas. They address a number of things that we as a government have looked at. One of the things that we are trying to do is make sure that people have access, particularly in regional, outer metropolitan and rural areas. By providing more incentives and benefits, those people will be able to go to a doctor who will be able to receive additional benefits. Nobody can tell doctors whom to bulk-bill and whom not to bulkbill. The Labor Party cannot do it, and we cannot do it. As much as the Labor Party kid themselves, doctors are able to opt in and out and to decide whether they wish to bulk-bill. But 12 million families will be covered by this measure and by the $300 safety net measure. They will be covered with the 80 per cent out-of-pocket expenses, and it is important to highlight that. As I mentioned earlier, bulk-billing incentives will increase by 50 per cent for the rural, regional and remote areas of Australia, and in Tasmania doctors who bulk-bill concession card holders and children under 16 will benefit from a 50 per cent increase in the bulk-billing rate, from $5 to $7.50. We are about ensuring that all Australians have better health outcomes in all areas, not just in one narrow focused area. I would like to say that the access to allied health services, such as psychologists, as part of an enhanced care program is a very welcome part of this package. I know that many of my constituents in Petrie who have been unable to access MAIN COMMITTEE those services will be very pleased to be able to access them as part of an enhanced service program. I want to say how terrific the package is. (Time expired) Social Welfare: Poverty Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (12.40 p.m.)-This week is an important one for those of us concerned about the rising level of poverty in this country. I want to refer here to the release this week of the report by the Jesuit Social Services, called Community adversity and resilience: the distribution of social disadvantage in Victoria and New South Wales and the mediating role of social cohesion, which is a report which tracks areas of systemic, entrenched and intergenerational poverty. The findings of this report are alarming, firstly, because in the political battle for the middle ground efforts are made to win over the aspirational classes often at the expense of the poor; and, secondly, because Broadmeadows in my electorate of Calwell emerges yet again as a place that has not shared in our nation’s sustained economic growth. Broadmeadows is a suburb which historically carries social stigma and a reputation of hardship. The 11,800 residents of Broadmeadows endure, according to the 2001 ABS statistics, double digit unemployment rates of 18.7 per cent, compared to 6.6 per cent for the Melbourne statistical district. More recent unemployment figures show marginal improvements, but there are sustained high levels of long-term unemployment. At the last census, the average weekly household income was only $536, compared to $888 for the Melbourne district, and over 1,400 Broadmeadows residents-or more than one in 10-are dependent on a disability pension. The highest level of education achieved, to the level of year 12 or equivalent, is 23.7 per cent of its population, compared to 43.2 per cent for Melbourne as a whole. A 2003 report called Undemocratic schooling found that half of the teenage boys in Melbourne’s north-west suburbs did not complete year 12. Overall, Victoria’s retention rate is 82.9 per cent. In many ways this report by the Jesuit Social Services is a report card on how successful we have been in dealing with disadvantaged communities, and if we measure our civil society on the way we treat our most disadvantaged then it is fair to say we have failed the people of Broadmeadows. In two successive reports over four years, Broadmeadows has remained one of the nation’s most disadvantaged postcodes. Factors identified in the report as contributing to social disadvantage include, as I mentioned earlier: unemployment, long-term unemployment, low income, noncompletion of year 12, a low-skilled work force and a high dependency on disability and sickness allowances. The report is important because it seeks to identify practical ways of responding to and tackling entrenched and generational disadvantage. It calls for collective efforts to combat socioeconomic deprivation and for increased social cohesion and points towards successes in what it terms ‘collective efficacy’ in reducing crime and other social problems. Similarly, a report to be released next Monday of an inquiry into poverty in the city of Hume in my electorate of Calwell called ‘Tackling poverty together’ attempts to give a human face to the struggle of financial hardship and barriers to opportunity. This inquiry into poverty, commissioned by the City of Hume as part of the implementation of its social justice charter, sought new insights into the nature and causes of poverty. It covered a wide range of communities and experiences and confirmed that a critical factor in tackling poverty is to empower communities by their inclusion in the decision-making processes that affect them. I am pleased to say that it was adopted by council at its meeting on Tuesday night, and its findings MAIN COMMITTEE will be a source of guidance to council, community leaders, local members of parliament and the Broadmeadows community in general as to what steps can be taken to address poverty and disadvantage. Today has also seen the launch of the report of the Senate inquiry into poverty and financial hardship, which I understand has also yielded similar results to the two previous reports I have made mention of. Governments have a lot to learn from these reports. If we truly feel a sense of responsibility as policy and decision makers, we will take note of their recommendations and action plans. We should not just confine ourselves to attending launches, briefly talking about the issues and then filing them away somewhere. This government is always keen to talk up its economic successes, but it shies away from talking about the rising level of poverty and the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. Labor understands that we can no longer ignore poverty. I would like to draw the House’s attention to the address to the National Press Club yesterday by Labor’s opposition spokesperson on family affairs, who acknowledges the need for a whole-of-government approach to the needs of the 2.4 million families surviving on incomes less than half of the average wage. We really need to thank the people and the organisations that have a deep commitment to identifying causes of poverty and identifying solutions for the eradication of this poverty. Their work is valuable. I commend these reports to the House. (Time expired) Canning Electorate: Graffiti Task Force to speak up for my local government authorities in the electorate of Canning. The local government authorities have been abandoned by the state government in relation to the graffiti clean-up issues in the electorate. By way of background, in 1996 the previous government set up a graffiti task force to address the rising incidence of graffiti in Western Australia in general. However, on its election, the Gallop Labor government disbanded this graffiti task force and has thrown the responsibility back on the local government authorities. The local government authorities are being required by the Gallop Labor government to become more and more servile and compliant. This can be seen in the fact that such things as the collection of the FESA fees are now required to be done by local government authorities for and on behalf of the Gallop Labor government. In relation to the graffiti task force, graffiti is not just an issue of ugliness; it contributes to a perception of lawlessness and other crime in the area. In fact, it is a symptom of social decay. If you go through some of the countries of the world, whether they be dots in the Pacific like Kiribati or European countries of low socioeconomic standing, you notice that the greater incidence of graffiti is endemic. It says something about the way the society feels about itself; the fact that it allows it to go unchecked says something about the way the community addresses this sort of lawlessness. For the Gallop Labor government to withdraw the graffiti task force and put the responsibility back on the local government authorities is just appalling. The real cost to the task force over that period of time on an annual basis was something like $400,000-a drop in the bucket. We know that young taggers-kids that have a spray can in their hand-love to see their tags up on walls, whether it be someone’s front fence, the factory wall, the bus shelter or in some cases, as has happened in Western Australia, all over the local transport authority buses. The best thing you can do to stop this is to remove it straight away. It is a well-known MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Adjournment
233,Mr Randall (Canning) (12.45 P.m.),"I would like to use the opportunity this morningfact that if you get out and remove those tags straight away it actually reduces the inclination of those tagging to continue to do so. But for it to be left there for some time is the greatest indication that it is okay and a bit popular to do. Putting the responsibility back on the local government authorities has led to a lack of coordination. There are now a number of bodies dealing with the issue and a number of people having to pay up for it, where previously the state government had a mobile clean-up team and local councils paid for some of the consumables. Clean-up areas were identified by a public hotline and daily inspections-this was the way it was dealt with. I urge the state Labor government to stop being so petty and stop putting all this responsibility back on the local government authorities. Some of the local government authorities in my area are not wealthy councils. To have this responsibility put back on them is patently unfair. There needs to be a coordinated approach. Already the state opposition under Colin Barnett have set out that, if they win government at some time in the future, they will put a plan in to deal with the graffiti issue. The plan will include providing resources to the graffiti task force, providing staff to all councils wishing to join the graffiti removal partnership, expanding the network of local government partnerships through a campaign of promoting the task force to all municipalities as a coordinated approach towards graffiti clean-up, supporting local councils with education and planning information, and requiring the task force to work with Transperth-the transport authority-to ensure timely removal of graffiti from trains, buses, bus shelters and rail stations. This is not just a light issue; this is an issue that appals so many people in the community when they see it as a growing issue. It has grown since the graffiti task force was abandoned by the Gallop Labor government. I urge the councils in the area to let their feelings be known and stop being used by the government of the day in Western Australia. I urge the government to re-fund the graffiti task force, because particularly in my area of Canning graffiti is something that all residents and community members wish to see reduced and done away with. Education: Fairvale High School in question time last week my colleague the shadow minister for education, Jenny Macklin, accused the Howard government of releasing an inaccurate fact sheet which depicted Fairvale High School, which is in my electorate of Prospect, as being better off than King’s School at Parramatta in the government grants that it receives. By way of explanation, King’s School will receive $3.4 million in funding from the Howard government in 2004-an increase of over $2 million, or 195 per cent, since 2001. It also received a further $1 million from the state government and over $20.3 million in fees. This does not include other sources of income. Over the same period, the government increased funding to Fairvale High School by a miserable $200,000-an increase of 20 per cent. One does not need a computer to work it out: a 195 per cent increase in government funding compared with a 20 per cent increase in government funding is no reason to say that Fairvale is better off. I believe Fairvale was used as an example because it has a similar number of students to King’s School, but it is only fair that, when examples are shown, the figures are accurate and the information supplied is total information. But for the moment I would like to leave aside the matter of funding. Let me tell you about the spirit that exists among the students and teachers of Fairvale High School. Bear in mind MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment
234,Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (12.50 P.m.),"I would like to remind the Main Committee thatthat Fairvale High School is one of the government schools which our Prime Minister has described as ‘being too politically correct and too values-neutral’. Less than 24 hours after the question time. I mentioned-on Wednesday, 3 March, to be exact-a school bus carrying 55 students and teachers from Fairvale was involved in a smash involving five cars and a truck carrying highly flammable acetone. Those 55 students and three teachers were returning to the school from an excursion when, for some reason which is still being investigated, the bus careered into five cars on the busy Cumberland Highway and then slammed into the back of the truck. In what can be described only as a minor miracle, no-one was seriously hurt, although two teachers required surgery and 20 passengers-the students-were taken to various hospitals. Despite their injuries, the teachers on the bus-one with a broken wrist and the other with broken glass embedded in his leg-took charge of the scene and ensured the safety of the students until emergency crews arrived. As soon as the news reached the school, the relieving principal, Keith Ellis, dispatched other teachers to the scene of the accident and to the hospitals to reassure the students and their parents. All of the shaken, but uninjured, students returned to the school-not home, as might be expected-because, in the words of Keith Ellis, ‘The school is their comfort zone; this is where they felt safe.’ Counsellors were provided by the education department and a special assembly was held that very afternoon. It was remarkable that, without exception, the student body showed genuine concern for their classmates-concern which continues to this day. And what of our Prime Minister’s ‘politically correct and value-neutral’ teachers who, despite their own injuries, ensured the well-being of their charges before worrying about their own conditions? I cannot speak more highly of the staff and student morale at Fairvale High School. But it is only one of the 10 government high schools in my electorate, along with some 30 other government and denominational primary schools-I might add that I also have in excess of four Catholic high schools in my electorate-and I am inordinately proud of all of them. Perhaps King’s School does deserve more funding than Fairvale High School. Perhaps King’s School can provide better facilities and amenities for its students. But I doubt that its students could be any more loyal to their school or have better academic staff than those at Fairvale High School. I was brought to order because I interjected, inviting the minister for education to come to Fairvale to meet the students and teachers. I might add that at this stage he still has not accepted that invitation, but I will extend it again quite publicly: come and see the students; come and understand what the schools are all about in electorates such as mine. Then truly you would understand why we on this side of the House are concerned when information that is being provided to help the government’s propaganda is not factual. That is what it needs to be and that is all we ask for. I do not want apples to be compared with oranges or, in this case, private schools to be compared with our state schools. I just want facts so that parents and the public at large can understand what we are about when information as supplied by government is out there and is not accurate. Again, I praise the teachers and the school and I wish the students well. As for MAIN COMMITTEE the two teachers who are still having health checks, I wish them all the best. I commend that school as a prime example of public education in Australia. (Time expired) Immigration: Border Protection extreme contrast between the border protection policies of this government, led by the Hon. John Howard, and the supposedly effective border protection policy proposed by the Labor opposition. In particular, I note the comments in the Sydney Morning Herald in relation to the reworking of the ‘coast guide’ policy of the Labor Party. That is the proposition that, with the scrapping of the seabed radar system and the expenditure of some $612 million, the responsibility of the Royal Australian Navy to patrol our border oceans will be removed and replaced with a ‘coast guide’ system. That system will involve a number of what are referred to as water taxis by the Hon. Alexander Downer, our foreign minister, and a few helicopters. With the opposition’s soft policy on border protection, it would seem that we will see deployed in our north-west ocean area a process of finding and guiding illegal arrivals to our shore rather than keeping them out. We know quite well that the policy of the opposition Labor Party is to welcome all visitors to this country, regardless of their illegal status, and to process them onshore, getting them involved in that very long and very expensive process that will result in more and more people recognising that as an entree to this fine country-and they will be queuing to come here. In creating an environment where people smugglers know that they and their cargoes are not welcome on our shores, the Howard government has managed to reduce the great flood of illegal arrivals to what of late has become a trickle. That situation has been created by giving this very stern and solid message: ‘If you come here illegally, you will not be made welcome. You will be processed until it can be established that you are a legitimate refugee, and then you will be given every protection under the treaty. But don’t come to these shores expecting to get a free passage in preference to jobs for Australians in Australia.’ The soft policy of the Labor Party is not one of just being more charitable or humanitarian; in reality, it exposes Australian agriculture to exotic diseases that we simply cannot tolerate in this country. We have thousands of kilometres of uninhabited shoreline. If we encourage people smugglers to engage in their horrendous trade of taking advantage of those less fortunate in the world and encouraging them to come to our shores, we have no guarantees whatsoever regarding the exotic diseases, plants and agricultural pests they will bring with them, and we have no way of knowing what illegal animals will arrive. Imagine rabid dogs coming ashore at our coastline and interacting with our own wild dogs. They would have a horrendous effect throughout our pastoral regions. The risks are too great to allow the soft border protection policy of the opposition Labor Party to prevail. We face the risk of the very nature of what is unique and desirable in Australia as a destination being destroyed by those who would choose to come here because of it. With unfettered arrival there would be a great likelihood of disease being spread across the north-west coastline. My pastoralists will not stand for that, thank goodness; but many out there do not understand the risks to quarantine et cetera and they can be lulled into a false sense of security. I make this plea to people: wake up and realise that it is not just a case of being warm and fuzzy about border protection; there is a real risk to the agricultural industry of this country-and MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Adjournment
235,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (12.55 P.m.),"I rise today in this place to draw attention to thethat industry is so valuable in Australia and to so many Australians that it needs to be protected at all costs. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m. MAIN COMMITTEE The following answers to questions were circulated: Environment: Renewable Energy (Question No. 2022) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 16 June 2003: (1) Has the Government been approached by Energy SA requesting an increase in the funding allocation for the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program in order to meet the growing demand from pastoralists who wish to install a photovoltaic energy system on their properties. (2) Is he aware that Mr Andrew Pobke of Arcoona Station near Woomera has applied unsuccessfully four times for funding to promote renewable energy as reported in the Adelaide Advertiser on 4 June 2003. (3) Is the Government taking any action to meet these requests. (1) Energy SA has not approached the Government requesting an increase in the funding allocation for the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program (RRPGP) in SA. However, the South Australian Minister for Energy did write on 9 December 2002 seeking a greater portion of funds under the RRPGP. I responded to the Hon Patrick Conlon MP pointing out that any reallocation would require the agreement of the other States and the NT to forgo some of their own allocation. I also noted that SA had not spent all of the $7.6 million that had been approved for the RRPGP in SA and that other States supplement their RRPGP allocation with additional State funds. (2) The RRPGP in SA is delivered through the SA Government by Energy SA. I am aware that there have been difficulties for some people in accessing rebates under the RRPGP in SA. This problem is due to demand for rebates outstripping the rate that Energy SA is prepared to release RRPGP funds. (3) The Government has worked cooperatively with Energy SA to improve access to rebates under the regarding the issue of high demand for rebates under the RRPGP in SA and proposed changes to the guidelines and the prioritisation process to improve access to rebates. On 27 March 2003, I agreed to the proposed changes in the interests of maximising the availability of renewable generation rebates for people in remote parts of SA. Calperum Station (Question No. 2023) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 16 June 2003: (1) What are the current management arrangements for Calperum Station. (2) Is it the case that the current contractual arrangements for the management of Calperum Station expired on 30 April 2003. (3) What process has the Director of National Parks, as holder of the Deed of Assignment to the station, instituted to ensure ongoing felicitous, transparent, and accountable management of the station. (4) Will community representation form a part of the ongoing management of the station.",158,Adjournment
236,Dr Kemp,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,160,Questions On Notice
237,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Calperum Station (together with the adjoining Taylorville Station) is managed by Austland Services Pty Ltd, a company established by the Australian Landscape Trust, under a contract with the Director of National Parks. An operational plan is developed annually by Austland Services, for approval by the Director, for the purposes of planning, costing and implementing the services provided under the contract. A management plan covering Calperum and Taylorville is currently being developed. (2) The current contract runs from 1 May 2003 until 30 June 2008. The previous contract concluded on 30 April 2003. (3) The Director’s staff administers the contract and monitors implementation of the annual operational plan to ensure that management services are delivered in a timely and effective manner. Regular site visits are undertaken by the Director’s staff. (4) Community involvement is an important feature of the management of Calperum. The contract requires Austland Services to foster community participation and in 2002-03 some 250 volunteers donated over 8,000 hours of voluntary time to a variety of management activities. Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines (Question No. 2812) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 1 December 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2456, is the Radiology Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to which he refers titled “Radiology Quality and Outlays-Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists and the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association-1 June 2003 to 30 June 2008”. (2) Does the MoU state at (a) paragraph 9.23 that “Any final adjustments required to ensure projected expenditure meets the MoU’s final outlays, will be implemented by 1 November 2007”, and (b) paragraph 8.5 inter alia that “The modified MRI Monitoring and Evaluation Group (MEG) will not make decisions regarding the funding of MRI activity…”; if so, who is responsible for making decisions regarding the funding of MRI activity, and if no one is responsible, why is no one responsible and who will be assigned this responsibility. (3) Does paragraph 9.1 state that “The Radiology Management Committee will be responsible for the management of this MoU and making policy recommendations to the Minister in relation to Radiology services”; if so, (a) has the Radiology Management Committee made recommendations to the Minister in conformance with paragraph 9.1, (b) what deadline, if any, has been set by him requiring those recommendations to be submitted, and if no deadline has been set, why not, (c) is there a process of project management to ensure the timely completion of the procedure seeking recommendations and action flowing from those recommendations as prescribed in paragraph 9.1; if no project plan and project schedule is in place, will a project plan and project schedule with discrete completion date for submission of those recommendations be made and if no project plan and project schedule is required, why not. (4) For the purposes of MoU subparagraph 5.8(a), will he remove the provision that funding be negotiated based on the Consumer Price Index in favour of the Average Weekly Earnings index; if not, why not. (1) Yes (2) (a) Yes (b) Yes. The Monitoring and Evaluation Group (MEG) has operated as an advisory committee and does not make “decisions”; rather it makes recommendations and provides advice (inter alia)",160,Questions On Notice
238,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:on priority sites for new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) units. It is envisaged that a modified MEG would operate in this manner also. Decisions regarding the funding of MRI activity are a matter for Government. Expert advice from the Radiology Management Committee will be taken into consideration in making any such decisions. (3) Yes, paragraph 9.1 states that “The Radiology Management Committee (RMC) will be responsible for the management of this MoU and making policy recommendations to the Minister”. (a) Following the 12 August 2003 meeting of the RMC, three recommendations were made to me in regard to the overall management of radiology, for inclusion in the 1 November 2003 reprint of the Medicare Benefits Schedule: The removal of the term ‘thermography’ from mammography items 59300 and 59303; The correction of the reference in item 59318 from 30361 to 31536; and The addition of items 63003, 63103 and 63273 to items that Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons may request. Further information about these changes is attached and can also be found under ‘What’s New’ at www.diagnosticimaging.health.gov.au. (b) The RMC has not made recommendations in respect to MRI funding. I have had discussions and sought advice from peak radiology groups on the issue of expanding Medicare access to MRI. A record of these discussions is attached and is also available on my website. (c) A project plan is currently being finalised by the RMC. This plan sets out key objectives and tasks for completion and includes indicative timeframes. It covers the full range of issues (including MRI) that are encompassed by the MoU. (4) To clarify, paragraph 5.8 of the MoU actually allows funding to be renegotiated if either, or both, the Consumer Price Index or the Average Weekly Earnings varies by more than 1.5%. I am not aware of any parties to the MoU seeking to remove or modify this clause. Changes to the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) Effective 1 November 2003 Background The Diagnostic Imaging Services Table (the Table) and diagnostic imaging services notes in the MBS are based on legislation specified in the Health Insurance Act 1973, Health Insurance Regulations 1975 and in the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations (the Regulations). The Regulations are remade each year with effect from 1 November and supplementary amendments to the Regulations are usually made with effect from 1 May. Amendments to the Regulations are advised (where relevant) in the 1 November MBS book and in the 1 May MBS supplement. The Radiology, Cardiac Imaging, Obstetrics and Gynaecological Ultrasound and Nuclear Medicine Management Committees are responsible for reviewing their part of the Regulations and recommending to the Minister for Health and Ageing amendments to the Regulations where required. These committees were established as part of the “2003-2008 Quality and Outlays Memoranda of Understanding” signed between the Commonwealth (as represented by the Department of Health and Ageing) and the relevant professional representative groups. Changes to the MBS, with effect from 1 November 2003, for diagnostic imaging services include: the description for items 59300 and 59303 in the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table has been amended to delete the words “(with or without thermography)”. This decision was made based on several studies undertaken which note that there is no scientific evidence to support the use of thermography in the early detection of breast cancer and in the reduction of mortality; and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (OMSs) can now request under Section 10 (1)(a) of the Health Insurance Regulations 1975, three additional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) items 63003, 63103, 63273. The descriptor for item 59318 has been amended to delete the reference to item “30361” and insert item “31536”. Item “30361” was deleted from the General Medical Services Table in November 2002 and replaced with item “31536”. Record of meeting held from 4.30pm to 5.00pm on 2 December, 2003 between the Minister for Health and Ageing and the peak bodies representing radiologists, RANZCR and ADIA. Present: The Hon. Tony Abbott, MHR, Minister for Health and Ageing Dr Lawrence Lau-Incoming President, Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) Dr Ron Miekle-President, Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association (ADIA) Dr Jeremy Druce, RANZCR Ms Sandra Keogh-Acting CEO, RANZCR Dr David Brand-ADIA Mr Allan Roche, Ministerial Adviser Mr Chris Sheedy, Department of Health and Ageing Representatives from the RANZCR and ADIA made a presentation on the management of the previous Agreement and the benefits of the new Radiology Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The key topic of discussion then focussed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and how to expand access to this technology to more Australians. While Mr Abbott is determined to address MRI access issues in Australia, he noted that radiology is subject to a funding agreement with the profession and that the Government is not disposed to offer more funding than is already provided under that agreement. The profession has agreed that funding for Medicare eligibility for four new MRI units can be managed within the agreed funding level. Mr Abbott indicated that he would therefore act on the advice of an expert committee that had reported to Senator Patterson in 2002, and move to tender for new providers of MRI services in four regional locations which will be announced shortly. However, he advised the representatives of his concern that this will not respond sufficiently to the significant need for MRI services in other areas, including in metropolitan areas and in public and private hospitals. Mr Abbott also advised the profession of his view that MRI scans can be provided at a price considerably less than the current Medicare rebate-evidenced by the fact that many MRI units without Medicare eligibility charge patients less than $300. This compares to the Medicare rebate of $416, on top of which patients are often charged over $100. The ADIA and RANZCR representatives challenged the viability of units charging such a low fee, indicating their view that for units that do not attract Medicare rebates any fee was better than no fee. Mr Abbott believes that benefits from a lower real cost of provision should accrue to patients needing MRI scans and that the benefits of government funding should be more widely available. For this reason, he proposed to RANZCR and to ADIA that they should consider a significant reduction in the Medicare rebate for MRI scans, which would allow (within the total agreed funding levels for radiology) a significant increase (perhaps 20 in total) in the number of Medicare-eligible MRI units. He also indicated that he would ask his officials, in consultation with an expert committee, to provide advice on priority sites for new MRI units, and to seek market information from potential providers on the price at which they would be willing to provide services. an expansion by four units (a 5.5% increase in the number of Medicare-eligible units) was sufficient to respond to current needs and that they did not believe there was a crisis in availability of MRI services; a longer term process to match supply and demand should be developed, with a focus on clinical criteria rather than geographic access and cautioned about moving too quickly to expand MRI; tendering, with a focus on price, had too great a potential to favour the public sector over the private sector in any future allocation of MRI. This would lead to obsolescence in the private sector; profitability in the industry was falling and depended on current levels of cross subsidy from MRI; cost shifting from the States, and current funding arrangements for public hospital MRI machines, mean that funding which should be available to the private sector is inappropriately accessed by the public sector; and that WKHSURIHVVLRQKDVDOUHDG\DJUHHGWRIHHFXWVDQGPDGHHIILFLHQF\JDLQVRYHU the last five years to fund the expansion of MRI. There is limited capacity to achieve further efficiencies to fund additional MRI within the funding available. Mr Abbott noted the position put by the profession and, in particular, undertook to ensure that tendering processes allow for a level playing field for all potential providers. However, he asked the representatives to consider carefully the proposal that he had outlined to them, to discuss exact figures and processes further with Departmental officials, and to advise him of how they wished to proceed by 9 December 2003. He also reinforced to the representatives that decisions on sites and providers for any new MRI units need to be made in way that ensures that all potential providers of MRI have equal access to information. For this reason he advised that he would post this record of discussion on his website. 4 December, 2003 Yarra Valley Golf Pty Ltd (Question No. 2890) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 10 February 2004: (1) In respect of his recent decision to approve the construction of the Henley Golf Course within the Yarra River floodplain at Kangaroo Crossing, did he grant this application to Yarra Valley Golf Pty Ltd before requesting baseline studies be carried out on existing sediment and pesticide levels in the Yarra River; if so, why. (2) Could the failure to establish this preliminary baseline information and undertake continual monitoring during construction render any future audit useless due to the fact that no reference to the river’s pre-existing condition can be made. (3) Can he explain the potential impact of sediment deposition in the Yarra River on the availability of appropriate spawning sites for species such as the Macquarie Perch, the Australian Greyling and the Murray Cod, particularly in the event of a flood event occurring during the construction of the golf course. (4) What action will the Government take to ensure the ongoing viability of these species. (1) Yarra Valley Golf Pty Ltd is required to undertake studies on surface water, groundwater, soil and sediment data on the Henley Golf Course and its discharge points to the Yarra River. These studies will complement the on-going fish surveys being undertaken in the Yarra River.",161,Questions On Notice
239,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) No. (3) The approval conditions placed on the proponent are designed to minimise any potential impacts of sedimentation deposition in the Yarra River and the listed species. (4) The Government is continuing to monitor Yarra Valley Golf Pty Ltd’s compliance with the Commonwealth’s approval conditions. Environment: Great Barrier Reef (Question No. 2900) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 10 February 2003: (1) In respect of the article in the Courier Mail on 6 December 2003 which reported that the Government was planning to “pour $300 million over the next four years into cleaning up rivers which drain into Reef waters”, is the priority for this expenditure to improve water quality in the Reef. (2) For each of the financial years covered by the announcement, can he provide a breakdown of the proposed expenditure indicating (a) the relevant Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (RWQPP) strategy and actions, and (b) whether the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) Board has approved the forward expenditure and showing the amounts under the (c) National Action Plan (NAP) including (i) priority projects, (ii) NRM Plan implementation (iii) foundation funding, (iv) state level investments, (v) national level investments, (vi) other (provide details), (d) NHT including (i) Envirofund, (ii) regional delivery, (iii) priority projects, (iv) Natural Resource Management (NRM) Plan implementation, (v) foundation funding, (vi) state level investments, (vii) regional competitive component, (viii) other (provide detail) and (e) non-NAP/non NHT including (i) Great Barrier Reef Coastal Wetlands and (ii) other (provide details). (3) What is the balance of Commonwealth investments available through the NAP, the NHT extension and Non-NAP / Non-NHT ‘over the next four years’ to address all non-Reef water quality issues such as native vegetation clearance, protection of Queensland’s World Heritage Areas, Ramsar wetlands and the Murray-Darling basin catchment initiatives. (1) I did not provide any figure, or announce any offer, to the Courier Mail journalist. (2) Not applicable. (3) Not applicable.

241,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The scale of fees under Schedule 11 to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity (EPBC) Regulations 2000 is: Commercial Photography Kakadu National Park-$30 per permit (no time limit) Pulu Keeling National Park-$30 per permit (no time limit) Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park-$20 per day Commercial Filming Kakadu National Park-$250 per day Pulu Keeling National Park-$250 per day Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park-$250 per day (2) The sum of money raised by these charges in 2002-03 was $ 20792.68. This was paid into the Australian National Parks Fund, as per s514S(c) of the EPBC Act and contributed to the management of Commonwealth national parks. (3) No. However, the US National Park Service system is not without limitations. Photographers of US National Parks may freely market images from anywhere that is accessible to the public only if: there is no product or service advertisement involved; there are no talent/models, props, crews or sets involved; the project does not have the potential to disrupt other park activities or visitors; nothing more than just hand carried equipment is utilized; access into an area outside of normal public use hours is not required; the project does not carry a potential risk to park resources; and the activity does not raise safety concerns. The most basic permit fee for such an activity is US$150. Personnel services such as monitoring, scouting, conferencing for filming activities cost much more: Hourly rate = $50/hour for 2 hour minimum 4 hours 11 hours = $500/day (flat rate) 11 hours + = $500/day (flat rate) in addition to $50/hour for each hour exceeding first 11 hours) Cancellation = $100 minimum In Australia, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National and Kakadu National Park have unique cultural heritage. The US model would not necessarily fit these parks. Current arrangements reflect the fact that traditional Aboriginal owners of Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu sought, via regulation, provision for the Director of National Parks to place prohibitions or restrictions on image and sound capture, for cultural protection purposes. Traditional owners have expressed concern that images of their country have been used in ways that are culturally insensitive-such as promoting products and services that have nothing to do with their country, or detract from its presentation and cultural values.
