As I have already told the House, new ships will come into service in the near future and should help to alleviate the position. WOOL. Minister for Primary Industry a further question about the future of country wool selling centres, especially Goulburn. Has the Minister seen the reported statement by the deputy chairman of the Australian Wool Board that the board is examining the adequacy of country centres and is warning that no major capital expenditure should be undertaken in those centres until the board has made its final recommendation? As this statement is in conflict with the Minister's reply to my question last week in which he said that the marketing investigations of the board do not affect country wool selling centres and that their future is entirely a matter for the State Governments, will he now make a comprehensive statement to clarify the position ? statement referred to by the honourable member, but the marketing committee that has been appointed under the relevant act is investigating all aspects of marketing, including the adequacy and economics of wool marketing centres. That statement is not a contradiction of anything I said earlier. That committee will report to the Australian Wool Board. I point out to the honourable member that the Wool Industry Act does not give the board any power to deal with wool marketing centres. The board will make recommendations to the Australian Wool Industry Conference. I also point out that the conference has no power to deal with wool marketing centres. That power does not reside in the Commonwealth; it resides in the State Governments. Defence a question. AlthoughI was very impressed by the answer given by the Minister for the Army in relation to the Special Air Services company, I remind the Minister for Defence that, in reply to a question that I asked him on 26th February of this year about the shortage of officers in the defence services, he statedI am hoping that in the course of the next few weeks 1 will be able to make a submission on this matter. Can the Minister inform the House of the present position regarding that submission and when it will be made to the House? weeks very intensive work on this subject has been carried on between the departments primarily concerned. That work is still proceeding. Minister for the Navy. Are floating docks of similar design to the A.F.D.I7 which at present is lying in the Captain Cook Dock usually efficient for at least 40 years? Was the floating dock that is now in use at the State Dockyard, Newcastle, built in 1929, and is that dock still working and docking ships to its designed capacity? What was the condition of the A.F.D. 17 when it was taken over from the Admiralty in 1947, only five years after it was constructed? If, at that date, it was in a reasonable condition, why has it not been maintained correctly? On the other hand if it was in need of maintenance in 1947, why was not the necessary maintenance carried out? Why was that valuable piece of equipment allowed to rust away in fifteen years, compared with the normal effective working life of other docks, namely 40 years? member's question is far too long. I ask him to direct his question. has the Royal Australian Navy any similar dock which could be towed to advanced areas of operations to carry out running repairs, which was the war-time work of the A.F.D.17? member has a mixture of fact and fiction in his questions.

If he will take his mind back to the time when it was put up for sale by the Admiralty, he should remember that all State instrumentalities were offered it, and they refused it. They had no use for it and therefore did not want to buy it. Honourable members opposite are interjecting. I am not here to engage in an argument with them. I am attempting to give an answer to a question that was far too long. If the honourable member for Newcastle is not satisfied with that answer, and puts his question on the notice-paper he will get an answer. possess the very high intelligence possessed by the honourable member for Oxley.

By way of explanation, I say that knows all the facts. this morning the Government announced that it had arranged a fall in the price of honourable member that I and my pretetracycline drugs which will save the people decessor have given this matter a good deal of Australia £500,000 annually. Although of consideration over a period of yearsit would appear that general congratulations As is the practice when the Budget is being should be in order, the president of the New prepared, requests for taxation relief in one South Wales branch of the Pharmaceutical form or another will be considered with the Service Guild, Mr Pinerua, said that if many hundreds of other similar requests that the price of drugs generally dropped too are made to us. low chemists would have to demand higher dispensing fees. I now ask the Minister: First, does the Government intend to recognize any lower limit below which the price of drugs will not be reduced? Secondly, Navy state whether the facilities which were has the Minister any comment to make on offered to counsel appearing before the the somewhat surprising statement by Mr royal commission in Sydney into the Pinerua? by the Minister would be out of order. of the further reduction in the price of this from the press for a party of some proporvery valuable drug, which has brought about tions to accompany counsel.

That is very satisfactory. As to the request to establish a base price for drugs, this is a matter upon which I am not competent to comment. I shall refer it to my colleague, the Minister for Health. In relation to the comment by the president of the New South Wales branch of the Pharmaceutical Service Guild of Australia, I find it very hard to follow that approach to the matter because my understanding is that fees and other payments are on a fixed basis and that a variation in the prices of drugs will not affect the overall income of pharmacists. However, I shall refer that aspect also to the Minister for Health to see whether any further information is available. Forces to be exempted from income tax?

Other factors were also involved. The pressmen could not have been on the bridge or in the communications room because of security factors, and this would have been extremely inconvenient for them. In the circumstances I thought it advisable not to accede to the request. However, the pressmen were given permission to interview the people concerned in the exercise if they wished to do so, and it was up to those people to give any information to the press that they wished to give. External Affairs say whether the Government has had an explicit and specific assurance from the United States authorities that under the ANZUS Treaty America will be obligated automatically to come to Australia's assistance if any attack is made on our forces in Malaysia? If no such assurance has been given, does this mean that the Government believes that under the treaty the United States has given Australia a blank cheque, underwriting any decision the Government may make as to what it considers to be appropriate defensive action in the context of the strained relations in this area? Has there been any specific United States official endorsement of Australia's recent action in supplying arms and personnel to Malaysia? I answered questions about this treaty and pointed out its strength. I do not know whether the honourable member is implying that Australia wants a better assurance than that treaty, though that is what the question appears to me to suggest. The Government is content with the treaty and is not uncertain as to its meaning. Let me add that the treaty has been through the American congress, so constitutional requirements to that extent have been complied with. Trade and Industry read a report in the ""Financial Review"" of 21st April headed, "" Australia * Lacks Courage'. Japanese Economist's Blast at Industry "", and listing a number of points of criticism concerning what is evidently considered an unduly small volume of Australian purchases of Japanese goods? Can the Minister give the House actualfiguresfor imports from and exports to Japan, and has he any other information concerning trade with Japan that would be of interest to honourable members? observations on, and, I suppose, criticism of, Australian enterprise by a Japanese economist who has recently been in this country. It did not move me very much. I have no doubt that the economies of many industries are related to the dimensions and scale of those industries. Many Japanese manufacturing industries are more economical than similar Australian industries because they produce a vast volume of goods. That is understandable. On the other hand, it is clearly understood by the Japanese that the economies of our agricultural and pastoral industries, which are conducted on a very large scale, leave theirs for dead. So we break even at that point. Part of the report is to the effect that there is an untenable disparity in the balance of trade between the two countries. I do not accept this. I have pointed out to the Japanese Government and the Japanese business community that it is not to be expected that a country of 11,000,000 people, buying principally goods which are manufactured in competition with our own enterprises, will buy goods of the same value as will a country of about 90,000,000 people, buying principally foodstuffs or raw materials for their industries which create employment rather than reduce the level of employment. I have pointed this out. I have also made another point and, in this regard, I shall give the House thefiguresthat I used when I was in Japan six or seven months ago. They relate to per capita purchases, and I regard this approach as a fair test. The figures I cited were for the year 1962-63, in which Australians bought 4,800 yen worth of Japanese goods per head of population, while the Japanese bought 1,500 yen worth of goods from Australia per head of population. Translated into Australian currency, we bought in ihat year £6 worth of Japanese goods per head, while the Japanese bought £1 17s. 6d. worth of Australian goods per head. This, I think, is a pretty rational",17,Taxation

There is a general supervision of this trade by the Australian Wine Board under the jurisdiction of my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry, but the names attached to Australian wines are decided by those who sell them. We presume that the sellers are guided by the commercial results that they expect. the Minister for External Affairs. I preface the question by mentioning that the ANZUS Treaty states that each party will act to meet the common danger if one of the parties is attacked. Would an attack by Indonesia on Australian troops stationed in the Borneo territories under the direct control of the Malaysian Government, and fighting for Malaysia, which is itself not Tariffs and Trade, provided the British a party to the treaty, be regarded as an attack on Australia as one of the parties, and mean the involvement of America? treaty is expressed in singularly plain language. It does not need any glosses or interpretations. As the Prime Minister pointed out last night when reading from the treaty, it states that an attack on any of the parties in the treaty area calls for action by the others. That action, of course, no doubt would be appropriate to the circumstances. It calls for action according to the constitutional processes; that is an expression which the Americans always require to be written into a treaty. In answer to an honourable member's question a few minutes ago, I mentioned that in relation to this treaty one of the constitutional processes is its affirmation by Congress. The treaty has been affirmed by Congress. A specific application of the treaty must depend always on the events of the moment. Any one who would answer a hypothetical question, such as the honourable member's question, is, I think, very foolish. AND TRADE. addressed to the Minister for Trade and Industry, who will recall that when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was ratified in this House, fear was expressed that it would progressively limit reciprocal trade between Commonwealth countries. I ask: Has the agreement had this effect, and to the Minister's knowledge is a change in the provisions of the agreement contemplated in the future? observations or criticism to which the honourable member refers and that perhaps at the time he was one of the critics. To the extent that trade is canalized between Commonwealth countries, it rests to a certain degree either on a sentimental basis, on historical trade links, or on the competitive position of the items, and their availability from other sources of supply. But predominantly trade has been determined by the British preferential system of tariffs and the General Agreement on preferential system may be maintained. It has, in fact, been maintained almost unimpaired, and any variation that has occurred in the sources of origin or destinations of Commonwealth trade is not to be regarded, I think, as attributable to the operations of Gatt. addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry.

58,Sir Garfield Barwick (Parramatta,"(1) the Senate be asked to appoint seven of its members to serve on such committee. 5. That the committee have power to consider the minutes of evidence and records of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs appointed in the previous ParUament relating to any matter on which that committee had not completed its consideration. 6. That a message be cent to the Senate requestbound, at the request of a member who ing its concurrence. Honourable members who carry in their minds the terms of the motion for the appointment of this committee in the last Parliament will observe that some changes have been made in the motion that I have just submitted. I should like to say that this committee, in my view, has done useful work, and the Government has held the hope that in this Parliament the Opposition would participate in the work of the committee and appoint members to serve on it. With that object in mind, I looked through the terms of the motion for appointment of the joint committee to see whether I could make changes that would remove difficulties that the Opposition believed were preventing it servicing the committee. Let mc explain the changes that I have made, without going into them in too much detail. Under the current proposal, the ability of the committee to consider foreign affairs generally will be more explicit and clearer than it was formerly, though the committee's ability to report to the Minister for External Affairs in a formal way stands, as it was before, dependent on a request by the Minister. However, it had been thought at some earlier time, apparently, that, because of the previous form of the motion, the committee was unable to communicate with the Minister or to give him what I may call an informal report-that is, to give him a report informally-excep t at his request. In point of fact, in dealing with the committee as previously constituted, I followed the practice of receiving from it communications for which I had not asked and of discussing matters with members of the committee from time to time. The motion now before the House makes it quite clear that the committee can communicate with the Minister without his request. I should like to make it plain that the communication can take the form of what is in substance a report on some matter into which the committee bas looked and about which it wants to inform the Minister. There is a stipulation that both the fact that the communication has been made and the contents of it must remain confidential. Previously, there was no provision for a member of the committee to express his dissent. The present motion provides that the chairman of the committee shall be wishes to dissent from a conclusion of tbe committee, to note the fact of that dissent and to append to a communication or report an agreed summary of the reasons for that dissent. Honourable members will readily appreciate that there must be some mechanism by which the expression of dissent is kept brief and relevant. It was thought that a summary agreed on by tbe member concerned and the chairman would adequately meet those requirements and ensure that a member would not be likely to be embarrassed by a misunderstanding about the reasons why he had dissented. As constituted formerly, the committee was not at liberty to have persons before it to give evidence or express opinions, unless the committee informed the Minister beforehand. That requirement will now be dispensed with, and the committee will be at liberty to ask persons-no t being departmental officers-to appear before it and express views. As I recall them, Mr Speaker, those are the principal points of difference between this motion and motions constituting the committee previously. As I have said, the changes are made in the hope that the committee will be more acceptable to the Opposition and that Opposition members will serve on it. I should like to say something about the nature of the committee that I think is worth saying. In our parliamentary system, this committee is, in one sense, an anomaly. In presidential and other systems found elsewhere, committees perform functions quite different from those that the Foreign Affairs Committee will be asked to perform. This committee is not at all like the Public Works Committee or the Public Accounts Committee. Each of those committees has the duty to see how the Executive gives effect to what is in substance a parliamentary resolution or mandate. Those committees overlook the actions of the Executive and report to the Parliament on them. But there is nothing comparable in the realm of foreign affairs, which is exclusively an executive function in point of policy, with no question of a report to the Parliament on the way in which the Executive implements policy or what the policy is. Nor is this committee, in any sense, a forum for public education. I have heard it said at times that it is a pity the committee is not used to educate the public. This is not a function of the committee. There are private bodies such as the Australian Institute of Political Science and the Australian Institute of International Affairs that exist for the education of the public. The function of the Foreign Affairs Committee is to afford members of the Parliament who are chosen to serve on the committee an opportunity to become more specifically informed about international affairs and to be admitted to a considerable degree to the confidence of the Government so that they may make better contributions to the work of the Parliament and so that there may be some basis of continuity in the foreign policy of a country such as this. It is not a pleasant prospect to think that the country's foreign policy is condemned always to be subjected to partisan views. The committee, therefore, is unable to sit in public ao do other committees, and what the members of the committee learn at its proceedings is not appropriate for repetition or circulation. The Government has at its disposal from time to time a great deal of information, much of which it derives from other governments and for the use of which, in a sense, it is accountable to other governments. We are not at liberty to put this information into the public domain. One of the advantages of a committee of this kind is that it can be permitted to some degree, in confidence, to have access to a proportion of that information. The committee being admitted to the information, it follows quite clearly that the committee's sittings need to be in camera and that which the members learn needs to be, very strictly, highly confidential to the committee. Sometimes, of course, one finds a situation in which the Government has information that the public also has, and a member of the committee may very well ascertain from public sources the same information that the Government has. It is necessary for honourable members to remember that the disclosure by a member of the committee that the information that was in the public domain was also vouchsafed to him in the proceedings of the committee would give to that public information a quality that it would not otherwise have. It would give it a sponsorship and an authenticity of government which is very important and may have very far-reaching consequences in some quarters. Consequently, even with information that is within the public domain but which is given to the honourable member in the committee, either before he learns it in the public domain or afterwards, whilst he is quite free to use the information in the public domain, as every other citizen can, he cannot disclose that he learnt it also in the committee, so that he does not give it authenticity or currency that it does not otherwise have. In this resolution, the need for the maintenance of confidence is retained. I think the House will appreciate that this committee is essentially different from all other committees of the Parliament. It is. somewhat of an anomaly. It is of great assistance to the Minister, who is able to work with it, because as the members become more familiar with the details they are able to think about problems and, under this resolution, in confidence to proffer their views to the Minister. The Minister for his part, I am quite sure, as has been my experience, is very willing to go to the committee and talk frankly to the very limit that he can as a Minister about the current affairs of the nation. This is a useful committee, but its utility depends essentially on the close observance of the confidential nature of the communications and a clear realization of the peculiar situation such a committee occupies in our parliamentary system where the responsibility for the policy is with the Government and the Minister and where the Minister has to take that responsibility both at home and abroad. The responsibility cannot be passed over to committees or similar bodies. It will be, to me personally, a matter of great regret if the Opposition has not seen itself able to serve on this committee, for I have taken as many steps as I can to do as much of what the Opposition, in my view respectfully, can properly ask me to do. This resolution represents the very end point to which I have been able to go in liberalizing, if I may use that word, the formal resolution of the House. Deputy Speaker, on 14th March, 1962, I gave my party's reasons for refusing to join the Foreign Affairs Committee under the terms of the resolution then proposed and repeated from previous years. When this Parliament met, the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) spoke to me about the objections I had expressed on that occasion. He later sent me a letter with the resolutions he proposed for setting up a committee in this new Parliament. between us that I would put these proposed resolutions before my executive so that it could frame a recommendation upon them for the consideration of the full Federal Parliamentary Labour Party. My executive wished clarification of three points of the resolutions proposed by the Minister and he replied on those three points. My party's attitude, therefore, and the Minister's attitude on the points that were not clear between us can best appear if I read the two letters involved. On the 10th of this month, I wrote to the honourable gentleman in these termsThere are three matters in your letters on which my Executive asks for clarification before it can make a recommendation to the Pederal Parliamentary Labour Party on your proposed terms of resolutions to set up a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The first matter concerns the composition of the committee under paragraphs 2 and 4 (e). Do you agree that the usual practice should apply under which the Government has one more member than the Opposition among the committee members from eaoh house and the Prime Minister names the Senators and Members of the House of Representatives who are to represent the government and the Leader of tbe Opposition those who are to represent the opposition? The second point concerns the confidential character of evidence before the committee at its sittings in camera under paragraph 4 (j). Is it your understanding that a member of the committee would be free to state facts and express views which had been submitted to or received by the committee if he has been able to ascertain or verify these matters from outside publications or persons? Thirdly, would you agree to provide that any member have power to add a protest or dissent to any report or communication, as is normal with joint or select committees, instead of merely providing that the Chairman record the fact of a dissent, as under proposed paragraph 4 00? Yesterday the honourable gentleman sent a reply in these termsimplications of the request you make in the second paragraph of your note of April 10. I regard the Democratic Labour Party as entitled to maintain the representation it' now has on the Committee. With that understanding, I am prepared to accept the position that the Government parties have one member more on the Committee from each House than other parties. (This works out with the Government having seven members and the opposition six from the House and the Government four senators, the ALP. two senators and the D.L.P. one senator.) I am prepared, if thc opposition wishes, to have seven Government members and It was understood five opposition members from the House with four Government senators, three ALP. senators and one D.L.P. senator. I think the position with respect to information fin which for this purpose I include both facts and opinions) which is acquired by a member in camera, needs more explicit treatment than your formula in the second sentence of your second paragraph, r have no desire to preclude thc use by members of the Committee of information which is in the "" public domain "" by reason of the fact that at a t'ime anterior or posterior lo that information coming into the public domain it was acquired by the member himself in camera in the proceedings of the Committee. But it must be clear, firstly, that the member cannot' by any means induce the information into the public domain and secondly that he cannot expressly or by implication reveal that the information which is in the pubhc domain was vouched to him-and thus as it were confirmed-in fhe proceedings of the Committee. The infonnation in the public domain would be available to him for comment or repetition in no different sense, and with no different authenticity or weight than it would be to any member of the public not associated with this Committee. You will readily agree that the endorsement of Government, with its sources of intelligence, for the use of which it is often accountable to other Governments, of any item of information gives that information a quality and authenticity which it may not or generally will not have when not so endorsed. Lastly, the question of a member having the right to express his reasons for dissent' has already been given much thought by me. I have sympathy with the view that a dissenting member should be protected against misunderstanding but on the other hand I cannot give any scope for the reports or communications of the Committee becoming mere vehicles for disproportionate advocacy. I feel that a provision that the Chairman should be bound to append to the report or communication an agreed summary of the dissenting member's reasons for dissent from any conclusion of the Committee expressed in that report or communication would adequately protect both the member and the Minister, as well as ensure brevity. I am prepared to agree to such a provision but I am",22,Foreign Affairs Committee
59,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [3.28],"MrI am not sure fhat I perceive the purpose orafraid I cannot go further. May I say that I am under some pressure to bring this matter to In the new Parliament elected at the end finality and must ask you to let me have an answer tomorrow, to permit of the necessary resolutions being moved. Accordingly, my executive considered the Minister's reply at a meeting it was holding when the reply was received yesterday afternoon. It made a recommendation to the full parhamentary party this morning. We decided that we should not join the committee. I communicated our decision to the Minister while his party was having a meeting this morning. It will be noted that the points of difference between the Government and the Opposition have never been put so precisely or narrowly. It is true that the committee as now proposed by the Minister would meet two-almos t three-of the objections which I expressed on behalf of my party two years ago. First, the committee will now be able to call non-official witnesses without the permission of the Minister. Secondly, the committee will now be able to express its views to the Minister without his request. Thirdly, it would be possible for any member of the committee to express a dissent, although in qualified terms. In all these matters, it is clear that the Minister has sought to meet the objections which I expressed on behalf of my party. The remaining objections appear from the correspondence. What my party would desire if it were to join the committee is clear from the letter I sent on 10th April on behalf of my executive seeking clarification. May I elaborate on two points? The first relates to composition of the committee. The composition of the committee does not appear from the resolution which is now before the House; it appears by inference from the supplementary resolution that certain named members be members of the committee. When the committee was first set up in 1951, provision was made for seven Government members and six Opposition members in this House and four from the Government and three from the Opposition in the other House. During 1955, members of the Australian Labour Party (AntiCommunist), who had previously been honourable gentleman that if there was any members of the Australian Labour Party, division on this committee the voting would took two of the positions allocated to be twelve to eight. The Minister seeks members of the Opposition in this House. of 1955, Senator Cole took one of the positions allocated to the Opposition in the other place. The objection which my party feels at this stage is this: Under either of the proposals by the Minister there would be eleven Government members-eleve n members from the Liberal Party and Australian Country Party-o n the committee. Under both proposals of the Minister there would be eight members of the Australian Labour Party from the two Houses. Under one of his proposals there would be six members from this House and two from the other place. Under the other proposal, there would be five members from this House and three from the other place. That is, on this committee there would be eleven Government members to eight members of the Opposition, or, to put it in party terms, there would be eleven members of the Liberal Party and the Country Party, and eight members of the Australian Labour Party. The position is complicated by the Minister's insistence that Senator Cole should be on the committee. Members of the Australian Labour Party will not admit that Senator Cole is a member of the Opposition. I take it that members of the Liberal Party and the Country PartyI hope I am being fair to them-wil l not admit that he is a member of a Government party. But on all crucial matters in the Parliament and certainly on all matters of foreign affairs, it is clear that Senator Cole would support the Libera] and Country Parties rather than the Australian Labour Party. It is clear also from everything that the honourable gentleman and his supporters say outside the House that that would always be the position in matters of foreign affairs. If anything, Senator Cole would criticize the Government parties from a position further to their ideological right. That is, he would unquestionably object to the Government allowing China to divert Australian wheat to Cuba and Albania, as it has done; he would go further and object to the Government parties selling wheat to China at all. There can be no doubt in the mind of any apparently to preserve the position so that if for some reason Senator Cole voted with members of the Australian Labour Party or if they voted with him, the Government would still have eleven votes to nine. I tbink in all these matters one has to be practical. The situation I have just visualized is never likely to arise. It is clear from fhe Minister's statement that he asserts that Senator Cole must be regarded as a member of the Opposition. The Opposition cannot accept that position. Nor can Senator Cole's inclusion be justified on the basis of the composition of the Parliament. The British practice, which, by implication, applies in this Parliament, is that committees should be a miniature of the Parliament itself. There are 103 members of the Government parties and 81 members of the Australian Labour Party in this Parliament. If the committee were a miniature of the Parliament it would have a ratio of ten members of the Government parties to eight members of the Australian Labour Party or perhaps eleven to nine. But the Minister insists that there should be representation for a party of one. owe him a lot. on motives in this matter. I am stating the because there has been a greater clarificapolitical situation and probabilities. After tion of issues on this occasion than there the 1955 election, when Senator McManus has been between the Minister or his prewas elected in Victoria, and afteT the 1958 decessors and the Opposition in the past. election when Senator Cole was re-elected I feel that I should now make some more as a member of the AustraJian Democratic general statements. The Minister takes the Labour Party it might have been thought attitude that this committee should fulfil that there was some justification for having the function of educating members rather a representative of that party on a relatively than that of educating the public. When large parliamentary committee such as the I spoke on this matter on the last occaForeign Affairs Committee. But there can sion, I said that one of my party's objecbe no justification for thinking along those tions to serving on the committee was that lines in the light of the last election for the the committee did not sit in public, did not House of Representatives. It is altogether make public reports and so on. I made likely, looking at the results of tbe last the objection that the committee did not elections in Tasmania and particularly in fulfil the function of educating tbe public Victoria, and the results of the by-election a in the way that similar committees do in couple of months ago in Denison, that there the American Congress. I said that I will be no representative of that party when appreciated this Parliament comes to an end. This said also that one of our grounds of objeccommittee is the only parliamentary comtion was that this committee did not fulfil mittee on which the representative of the the function of educating the public. Democratic Labour Party serves. Whether or not there are other differences between this committee and all other committees, make that objection on this occasion. We this is certainly one difference. Tbe have limited our objections to those matters Opposition finds that, despite the Minister's which would be embarrassing or obnoxious agreement on other issues of importance, his insistence that the Democratic Labour Party be represented is too provocative for it to accept. I hope I have time left to make one other objection, and that is to the nature of the dissent which members of the committee may append to any reports or communications to the Minister. We feel that it is unduly paternal or patronizing to say that a dissent should be in a form agreed upon between tbe chairman of the committee and the person who makes the dissent. We feel that any dissent appended to a report or communication of this committee should be just as free as the protest or dissent appended to the report of any other committee. Why should there be a distinction in this case? A party as a wholewhether it be the Liberal Party, the Country Party or the Labour Party-choose s its representatives on committees. If a party chooses a representative to serve on a committee and the Parliament goes through what may be regarded as the pure formality of electing the nominee to the committee, tee with relevance and propriety.

There is a very considerable body of opinion in universities, societies and learned bodies interested in foreign affairs which criticizes this committee because it cannot make a bigger contribution to debating public issues and enlightening the public on them. I will not trespass on the generosity of the House in giving me an extension of time by quoting what Associate Professor Beddie, of the Australian National University, said on this subject at the end of last January at the summer school of the Australian Institute of Political Science. His criticisms were directed largely to this deficiency. One could quote many other persons in the same sense. On this occasion I also want to eschew any criticisms which have been made public by members of the committee itself. On the last occasion, I quoted what the honorIt is claimed that there would be general Opposition if members of the Opposition agreed to serve on this committee. It is Asia? made no reports on South-East Asia. I did not intend to deal with the subject matters or quality of the reports of the committee, but let me say that when all the South-East Asian matters of the last few years were coming up the only report that the committee made was on Berlin. There have been no reports on Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos or South Viet Nam. The Labour Party has wanted to learn about these matters, and it was on the initiative of the Labour Party that last year a parliamentary delegation, consisting of equal numbers from both sides of both Houses of the Parliament, visited South-East Asia. It was on the initiative of the Labour Party that select committees were set up to deal with voting rights and land tenure for aborigines in the Northern Territory. In 1960 the Labour Party sought the appointment of a committee on New Guinea, and the Government refused that request.

63,Mr Whitlam,"The committee hasthrough committees dealing with subjects on which first-hand knowledge can be obtained and decisions can be made. On the general subject of information on foreign affairs being made available to members of the Opposition and private members of the Government parties, a definite matter of principle is involved. The with this committee either. Members of system of responsible government will not work better if members of the Opposition and private members of the Government parties have to depend on the Government for their information. They will be better informed as the public itself is better informed. For instance, the position would be met if the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the only national news medium in Australia, were as free and as bold as is the British Broadcasting Corporation; if there were any national newspapers in Australia; if any of the newspapers were themselves to employ diplomatic and defence correspondents; if, may I say, Ministers in general were as co-operative as the late Athol Townley was in making service chiefs and departmental heads within his jurisdiction available to our committees and, I have no. doubt, to Government committees as well. But the basic thing surely must be to have fuller and better and more independent sources of information available to members of Parliament. Members of missions stationed in Canberra, certainly all visiting members of the United States Administration, make a point of meeting and talking with leaders of the Opposition in Canberra. In addition, leaders of the Opposition receive the same confidential documents as are circulated by the Department of External Affairs to Ministers. The great difficulty in this Parliament is that we have not the library facilities, in particular, which are available in Washington. Further, without suggesting that the parliamentary library facilities in London are better than those in Canberra, there are means of information available in London which are incomparably better than are those in any Australian city, including Canberra. The deficiencies of our parliamentary [3.58] -As an ex-chairman of this comlibrary are such as to prevent members of mittee I fee! that I should take up one or the Parliament, in particular members of two points made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and private members of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). The House the Government parties, from obtaining information from sources independent of the Government. We need more public information on, and discussion of, foreign affairs. The solution of this problem for the public clearly does not lie with this committee. The solution of this problem for the Parliament does not lie primarily an opposition and private members of a government party will not carry out their tasks in the deliberate process by becoming more dependent on the Government for sources of information, but they will carry out their tasks by becoming less dependent on the Government for sources of information. I have had instances where it was easier, quicker and more satisfactory to obtain information from the Library of Congress than from our own Parliamentary Library. Often the Parliamentary Library contains only one copy of a document. When replying to questions the Minister for External Affairs very often says that the relevant information is available in the Library, and it turns out that the Library has only one copy of the particular document. This is not enough on which to mount a full-scale debate. The librarians themselves often have, to ask, ""Do you mind if we get the information from the department concerned, or can you afford to wait till we get it from overseas? "" It is no solution to suggest that we should just join a committee which inevitably and naturally, on a subject of this kind, will be a government committee, a committee responsible to and supervised by the Minister. I regret that the Minister was not able to meet the other proposals that we made in our letter of 10th April. Meantime, we believe that it would be invidious for us, as the Opposition, to join a committee which in those respects still differs from all other parliamentary committees. Haworth) -Order!

65,Mr Mackinnon (Corangamite),"will receive with regret the Opposition's decision not to make membership of this committee available to its members. I know from my own experience as chairman how much we would have appreciated Opposition representation on the committee so that in reality it would bave been a joint parliamentary committee. I should like to clear up one or two inaccuracies in the honourable gentleman's remarks. The first is the statement that the committee takes all its advice from Government sources. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker, well know, that is completely untrue. The committee has the opportunity to call before it people of many shades of view, and in fact has done so on a number of occasions. Members of the committee receive a reasonably broad spectrum of infonnation which is readily available, and also the greatest degree of co-operation from the Minister. At this point let me say how much I appreciate the lengths to which the Minister has gone in his new resolution to meet the objections of the Opposition. It is a great pity that the Opposition has not decided to meet bim half-way and to accept membership of the committee. There seem to be two main reasons, one of which I can understand, for the Opposition's attitude to the committee. The first appears to be its basic objection to the rule prohibiting committee members from discussing with other members of their party documents of a confidential nature which may have been the subject of discussion within the committee. I think that is inherent in the Opposition's attitude. I can understand that attitude, but I cannot understand the second obvious objection, and the stress laid on it by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-the inclusion of a certain senator on the committee. Tbis is such a spiteful petty attitude on such a major issue that I cannot understand the thinking behind it. Despite the rather querulous interjection so that he may enjoy tbe advantages that by the honourable member for Barton( MrI have enjoyed for eight years. Reynolds), which was extremely disorderly, that the caucus was unanimous on this matter, I still feel, after discussion with gratulate the Minister on the lengths to certain Opposition members for whom I which he has gone to make it possible for have some regard, that the decision, while Opposition members to join the committee. perhaps being physically unanimous, was by I hope that soon they will see the error of no means morally unanimous. unanimous. Speaker, that was another of those querulous interjections. The Minister pointed out in very clear termsI appreciate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition accepted this principle-that under our system of governmental responsibility it is impossible to have a committee on the same lines as the United States Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs. There is no official joint committee on foreign affairs in the House of Commons, although each parliamentary party has its own committee. Under the British system of parliamentary responsibility, in which the Ministry is part of the legislature and the decisions are made at the Cabinet level, and in which there are, and always will be, back-benchers on the committee, obviously this cannot be a policymaking body. The system under which it works-that of being able to refer to the Minister-is the only satisfactory way in which it can work. Despite the Opposition's feelings as to the shortcomings of the committee, I am sure that it appreciates the opportunities that are available* to members not only to get to know the way in which governmental policy on foreign affairs is worked out-it is vitally important that the Opposition, if it hopes to be in government, should see how this has been done-bu t also to have the opportunity of personal contact with a number of our very prominent, very wellinformed and extremely capable members of the Department of External Affairs, as well as with other senior departmental officers who might be called upon for information. With some deep regret I shall not stand again for re-appointment to the committee. I have found the work fascinating, but I have been a member of it for eight years and I think it is time to make way for some more recently elected honourable member I regret the Opposition's decision.

I He said: "" All right. We will have four think the Melbourne "" Age"" also has senators and the Australian Labour Party already published this allegation. I shall will have three. Then there will be Senator make some comment on it, because at no Cole. But then in the House of Representatime in the discussions of either the Oppotives the Australian Labour Party's represition . executive or the Opposition caucus sentation will be reduced because Senator have I heard any bitter references to Cole has been appointed to the committee Senator Cole. We have no objection to Senator Cole's presence. He can be on the committee if. he is nominated by the Government. Our sole objection is to the persistence displayed lian Labour Party and the Democratic by the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) in taking it upon himself to reduce the representation of the Opposition to make way for Senator Cole. We have 27 seats in the Senate; the Minister would generously give us two members on the committee. The Government has 31 seats in the Senate and it would have twice as many members on the committee as we would have. It would have four members. Then the Government says that the normal Opposition quota, which is one less than the Government's quota, would be made up by the appointment of Senator Cole. Although the Australian Democratic Labour Party regards the Australian Labour Party's foreign policy as poisonous, the Minister persists in saying that one Australian Labour Party man must be dropped to make way for Senator Cole. We have no objection to the presence of Senator Cole; we object to the dropping of a Labour man to make way for bim. I have no personal objection to Senator Cole at all. We served together on many conferences of the Australian Labour Party. We served on many federal conferences, each of us being one of 36 delegates. He has since discovered that we were faceless men, but that is his business and I harbour no resentment on that account. There is no personal dislike of him. We simply object to his being treated as a member of the Labour Party, and to the Labour Party's chance of selecting its own members being reduced. What the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr from the Upper House."" I do not want to give any great importance to this matter of Senator Cole. Fanning the differences between the AustraLabour Party is a major feature of press activity. I have no belief that the correction 1 have given to what the honourable member for Corangamite said will be published as widely as the honourable member's own statement, because the suggestion of spitefulness on our part fits into a pattern that the press has been building up for years and which the Democratic Labour Party has been taking to its heart for years. Therefore it will be highly acceptable as a means of giving further support to a fiction created in the minds of the public. But let it be perfectly clear that what we are objecting to is the reduction of our representation. The Minister has stated that the purpose of this committee is to help to ensure continuity of policy. If this is so, then the absence of the Opposition from the committee over the last ten years has been a fatal defect. If it is envisaged that the Opposition might some day come to power and would then, because of membership on the committee, have an informed body of opinion in the party to carry on a continuous policy, then the absence of the Opposition from the committee means that the committee might as well be dispensed with. But the fact is that the committee has existed for many years without the Opposition, because of these differences that exist, so it must have other purposes. I cannot understand why the Minister will not take his hands off and let us see",30,Foreign Affairs Committee
68,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [4.4],"On ewhether the committee can work without all these controls that he is trying to impose on the Opposition. It is not secret information that causes differences between the Government and the Opposition. Our main differences in this House have been notoriously on questions of policy. The Opposition supported the Government up to the hilt when the Korean war was being waged. We believed that we were supporting the restoration of international order. We opposed the Government tootb and nail in relation to the Suez affair. This was not on the basis of secret information. It was on the basis of a different diagnosis of the policy that should be adopted. When Egypt tried to nationalize the canal the Government said, in effect, "" An Egyptian should be shot,"" and it supported a policy of force to which we were completely opposed. We thought the whole policy was inapplicable and would be disastrous in its effects on public opinion in the Middle East. In fact, it helped the Soviet Union to get away with the policy it adopted in Hungary, because the policy we adopted when our will was crossed in Egypt was no better than the policy adopted by the Soviet Union in Hungary. Our differences have not been related to secret information. I do not know what the Government wants of the Opposition on this committee. Presumably it wants the mind of the Opposition on public matters. The attitude of the Government is that the mind of the Opposition on foreign affairs is almost beneath contempt. That was the attitude displayed by the Prime Minister in the debate last night. He is quite entitled to think along those lines; that is his business. This has been the situation, as I remember it, over the last ten or twelve years. I do not know, therefore, why the Government wants the Opposition on the committee at all. Dr. Forbes -To broaden your minds. superiority is supposed to do something to assist people like myself who, on the whole, have been inclined to feel that we ought to make the experiment with this committee. It is supposed to encourage the doubters. In other words, we would get information which would make our foreign policy like yours-lik e yours in respect of the Egyptian crisis, shall we say? I doubt that this is a question of information at all. It goes to the basis of men's philosophies. I can quite appreciate that on some matters involving secret information you might find an Opposition mind of some value, and that you would consider this helpful to the committee. I am very pleased about that. But what is quite inconsistent with that proposition is the Minister's attempt to control what the Opposition will say to him confidentially. He tells us that the chairman, a Government member, will work out an agreed summary of any reasons for dissent that any member of the committee might have. The member of the committee may be a Government supporter but I am'just postulating that he might be an Opposition member or that it might be the Opposition members as a group. This is proposed because there is a need for brevity or something of that kind. It is assumed that the Opposition dissenters are a group of idiots who will pour volumes of objections at the Minister and who are incapable of putting up an acceptable expression of their reasons for dissent, and that therefore the chairman must have the opportunity to vet what they say and put it forward as a summary. No committee of the Parliament goes on like that. Why should this committee hav: to go on like that? As to the matter of secret information, I think we can agree with the Government that we might be given ambassadors' opinions about heads of state and so on that no one would want to hawk around, but, all the same, we have never been given prima facie evidence, either in the debates in this House or in publications by Government members, that things have worked out in this way. The Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes), before he was appointed to the Ministry, reviewed a book by Lord Casey. The review appeared in the "" Australian Book Review"" for August, 1962, and it contained the following passage:I remember a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Melbourne not long before Lord Casey retired. He was giving the committee a review of the international situation as he saw it after returning from several high-level conferences and from visiting a large number of countries. A member of the conimittee sitting next to me wrote down on a piece of paper each subject as he dealt with it. Alongside each he wrote some such comment as, "" Read in newspapers two weeks",31,Foreign Affairs Committee
69,Mr Beazley,"This patronizingago""; ""Heard on the ABC news last night""; it has by transmitting to the Minister the "" FuUy covered in February edition of ' Time'"". views that the committee has arrived at, The instinctive caution with which Lord Casey habitually approached the Foreign Affairs ComI should think they would agree that, with mittee is apparent in this book. A lifetime habit the Opposition's viewpoint being expressed, of playing his cards close to his chest, and revealthe committee would have served the ing information to the minimum number of Minister perhaps even better. The attempt people, has been too much for him even after retirement. I do not suppose that we missed, in that era, any particularly secret information, if this is an accurate description of the operation of the committee. I would just like to say that we appreciate the fact that there has been the correspondence which we have had with the Minister. We appreciate his attempt to meet the Opposition's objections. I think that this is about the . only committee in which, because of its very nature, all the liabilities rest upon the Opposition. Ji we are to serve on a foreign affairs committee with the Government, there must be an atmosphere of complete freedom-and I do not mean complete freedom about secret information. However, if on the basis of what we believe is secret information which the Government possesses, we think that the Government's foreign policy is disastrous or that it is making a disastrous mistake in the way it is handling that policy, and if this view is put to the Minister but the policy is proceeded with, what should we do in a debate in the House? Should we be silent about all the reasons why we disagree with the Government? This committee is not a public works committee or a public accounts committee; it is a committee dealing with what may be life and death issues or issues which may lead to war. It is a committee in which there may be profound disagreement about warlike action on the part of the Government, such as we had over the Suez affair. It is not very easy for an Opposition which entertains strong dissent in such matters to be identified with the Government. I feel that on this committee all the sacrifices would be made by the Opposition. It would have been easier to serve on members opposite still find some reasons the committee if the Minister had not tried why they should not serve on it. The to impose so many controls on how dissent reasons given are not always the same. is to be expressed, and if there had not been such a manifestation of fear on the part of the Government in the rules by being a study group and with doing nothing which the committee is to operate. If the else but read the documents provided for honourable members who have served on it by the Minister for External Affairs. We the committee believe that it has been a who have served on the committee have committee of tremendous value, and one been charged with being a body of people which lus served the Ministry, as no doubt who are not able to think for themselves. The to control expressions of dissent, which reveals an unsatisfactory and untrusting attitude on the part of the Minister, makes it very difficult for the Opposition to serve on this committee. The previous speaker said he felt there was no moral unanimity. I was inclined to the view that we ought to serve on this conimittee but I am fully satisfied now, from the exchange of correspondence that we have had, that we should not do so. When the matter is discussed in the House and a former chairman of the committee attributes to us spite in relation to the appointment of Senator Cole, I am more than ever convinced that we should not serve. usually has a high regard for the thinking of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) on matters of this kind, but I am sorry to say that the reasons he has just voiced on behalf of the Opposition for not joining the committee make me wonder whether the Opposition really wants to serve on it. The Opposition has not been represented on this conimittee despite the fact that, from year to year, certain positions on it were filled by members of the Government parties who were prepared to relinquish those positions at any time if the Opposition agreed to join the committee. This showed a genuine desire on the part of the Government parties to make this committee truly representative of both sides of the Parliament. It is surprising to me that, despite the fact that year after year the Government has broadened the constitution of the committee to meet the wishes and desires of the Opposition, honourable The committee has been charged with",32,Foreign Affairs Committee
70,Mr Failes (Lawson) [4.18],"On echarge has been made also that we can discuss only those matters which are referred to us by the Minister. It is not for me, as a member of the committee, to state what the committee does. One of our highest traditions has been that nothing done or said by the committee at its meetings shall be talked about outside. It is not my intention to tell the Opposition about the discussions that we enter into, but I can say that our work is particularly valuable. On many occasions the Minister, especially the present Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick), has joined with us to discuss certain matters and has given us great opportunities to improve our knowledge of those matters. It was saidI think by the Deputy Leader Opposition has as much opportunity to inform itself on foreign affairs as have the members of the committee. I need only say in reply that a couple of years ago the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) showed himself to be very ill informed on the Indonesian question, because he made a statement that I do not think would ever have come from the mouth of any member of the committee who had had the opportunity of studying the Indonesian question at that time. The points of objection by the Opposition and to serving on the committee have been mentioned by both the Deputy Leader of the Opposidon and the honourable member for Fremande. The honourable member for [4.25] -The honourable member for Lawson Fremande said that the Opposition's main ( Mr Failes) opened his remarks by stating objection was based not on the appointment that in view of the position taken by the of a representative of the Australian Opposition he rather doubted whether the Democratic Labour Party but on the Opposition genuinely wished to go on to the fact that the Opposition's representation Foreign Affairs Committee. There is only was reduced to make way for that one inference, which is very plain, that the representative. That is a most peculiar honourable member for Lawson can take from objection to take. Deputy Leader of the Opposition did Opposition does not wish to go on to the not say so in so many words, I gathered committee upon the terms which the Governthat he based his objection on the possibility ment offers to it. However, I could add, for that there could be party alignment in bis information, that in this matter the voting on the committee because of the Opposition's view is unanimous. Furtherappointment of one senator to represent more, I believe that no self-respecting oppothe Democratic Labour Party. It surprises sition, of whatever political colour, would me that any person should think that there accept the conditions which the Government would be a political alignment of votes is now offering to this Opposition. If the on this committee. I assume, as I think Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield most other members of the committee do, Barwick) were a member of an opposition that we meet to inform ourselves and that we are required to pass our opinions on to the Minister for the benefit of Australia, not for the benefit of any particular political party. We speak as a true foreign affairs committee, not as a foreign affairs committee representing one side or other of the House. Tbat point should be remembered when we are discussing a committee such as this. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition went even further and said that the inclusion of a representative of the Democratic Labour Party was provocative. I fail to understand his meaning. I can only come to the conclusion, as I said earlier, that the Opposition just does not want to be represented on this committee and that it is simply making a good deal of noise to avoid that being known, as it has done each year when the committee is being appointed. This matter has become a hardy annual. Whenever the question of the appointment of this committee is before the House, the Opposition raises objections to serving on it-and the objections are not always the same. The Opposition has objected again this time. I do not think the matter calls for any further comment except that the attempt made by the Minister this year to meet the Opposition's requirements or to overcome the Opposition's objections has delayed the appointment of the committee for some time. That has been so on this occasion, I am sure the Minister deplores it as much as the committee does. Although the the Opposition's statement; that is, that the",33,Foreign Affairs Committee
71,Of The Opposition ( Mr Whitlam),that the,34,Foreign Affairs Committee
72,Mr Allan Fraser (Eden,"Monaro)to which a government offered these terms, I do not believe that he would recommend his colleagues to accept them. I cannot believe for a moment that any self-respecting opposition would do so. The honourable member for Lawson said that it was rather surprising to find year after year that attempts by the Government to broaden the conditions governing the committee in an endeavour to obtain the Opposition's co-operation, had failed to obtain that co-operation. The honourable member is, of course, quite mistaken. There has not been any attempt by the Government in previous years to broaden the conditions governing the committee. The honourable member's remarks are a mis-statement of fact. He has allowed himself to be deceived by a faulty recollection. I assure him that what he said is not true. The Government has not in previous years attempted to broaden the conditions. This is the first occasion on which it has attempted to do so. So there is no truth in the suggestion he is niaking that year after year the Government has attempted to meet the Opposition on the very real difficulties which the Oppo* sition faces in accepting the request of the Government to join the committee. This is the first time that the Government has gone any distance at all to meet the very serious objections raised by the Opposition. I think it reasonable at least to suggest that there is considerable doubt about the real desire of the Government to obtain the co-operation of the Opposition on this committee. I think that the proceedings in the House this afternoon increase the strength of the suggestion that members of the Government prefer that the Opposition should not be on the committee, so that the Government can misrepresent the Opposition's attitude as being a refusal to cooperate on important national issues, rather than to present conditions which would enable the Opposition to be represented on the committee. We have seen evidence of that in the House this afternoon. We saw an immediate attempt to make party-political capital by misrepresenting the position plain the very real and genuine objection taken by the Opposition. I am not opposed to any one making party-political capitalon one or two rare occasions I bave done this myself-bu t I do suggest that when this issue is immediately made one for making party-political capital it throws very serious doubts on the motives of the Government in presenting this proposition to the Opposition. The honourable member for Lawson said that if members of the Opposition had been on this committee two years ago they would not, and could not possibly, have made the serious mistakes that they made then in their references to Indonesia and in the policy that they adopted in the Indonesian crisis at that time. If that is so-if the Opposition would not have made these mistakes had it had the information that was available to the Foreign Affairs Committee two years ago-ho w does it come about that the Government's own policy on Indonesia misfired so very badly at that very time two years ago? Only two explanations occur to me. Either the Minister did not tell his Foreign Affairs Conimittee the real score, or the Minister did not heed the views expressed by the committee at that time. I do not know what other explanation could be offered. Then the honourable member for Lawson raised a very interesting point. He deprecated the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) had suggested that there might be a party alignment on this committee. The honourable member said that that was something to be deprecated very much indeed. He said that it was not a party committee at all and that it did not consider things from a party point of view. He said that matters that came before it were not in any sense party matters. If that is so, why is the Minister so extraordinarily insistent that there must be a Government majority on the committee. If it is not a party matter, why does he insist that one party must have a clear majority of the membership of the committee? on any other committee. Leader of the Opposition reminds me, a bigger majority than the Government has sought on any other committee of the Parliament. I raise that point only to make of the Opposition to the proposals for the committee now put before the House by the Minister. I share the view expressed by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). I am not at all confident that the real attitude of the Opposition will become widely known and understood by",34,Foreign Affairs Committee
73,Mr Whitlam,A bigger majority than,35,Foreign Affairs Committee
74,Mr Allan Fraser,"As the Deputythe Australian public because experience has taught us that every attempt will be made by Government supporters and by newspapers throughout Australia once again to misrepresent the Opposition's attitude. Therefore, I propose to state our attitude in my own words, as simply as I can. The basis of all committees of this kind is that there are Government representatives and Opposition representatives-that is all-and that the Government representatives are nominated by the Prime Minister and that the Opposition representatives are nominated by the Leader of the Opposition. That is the basis of all committees of this kind, and it is not the Opposition that is departing from that basis-it is the Government. If the basis on which all committees of this kind that have been appointed were followed in this case the Government would not now be seeking to nominate the members in the terms of the Minister's letter. I repeat, it is not the Opposition which is departing from the basis on which these committees are appointed-it is the Government. If this is the reason why the Opposition is unable to join the committee, the responsibility rests not with the Opposition, which has not departed from the basic conditions, but with the Government, which has departed from those conditions. Let us look at this proposition just a little enough to know that if by any chance, further. The Opposition is agreeable that the Government should have a majority on the committee. This has been the traditional practice with such committees and the Opposition does not contest it. So the Opposition would agree that the Government should have seven members, and the Opposition six members, of the House of Representatives on this committee, and that the Government should bave four senators and the Opposition three senators on the committee. But the Government will not agree to that. It will not allow that to be the position of this committee. It accepts the view that there shall be Government members and Opposition members, but it insists that it shall nominate one of the Opposition representatives, even though we do not accept him as a member of tbe Opposition. But that is immaterial. We would still object if the Government nominated another member of the Opposition as a member of the committee. This is the right of the Opposition and the right of the Leader of the Opposition and in the past has always been understood to be our right. Therefore, when the Government insists on reducing Opposition membership so that it can appoint an additional member, it is claiming the right to appoint an Opposition member. This is a proposition which no self-respecting Opposition-Libera l Party, Country Party or Labour Party-coul d ever adopt in this Parliament. I am certain that the Minister on reflection will realize that he would not accept it if we were in Government and he were a member of the Opposition and we proposed to appoint one of the members of the Opposition to the committee. Sir Garfield Barwick -It is too hypothetical. what you are doing. I appreciate the point of the Minister's jest-that it will be a long time and it is far too far-fetched to contemplate the Opposition ever being on the Government benches. Let me remind him that in 1946 members of the Labour Party Government felt exactly the same way. We laughed to scorn any suggestion that the then Liberal-Country Party Opposition could be the government of Australia again within twenty years. But those parties did form the government of Australia again with an overwhelming majority within three years. I think that the Minister is realist the present Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) departs from the scene and if he the Minister for External Affairs becomes Prime Minister, an Opposition victory at the next general election will be almost certain. So the honourable gentleman cannot regard my proposition as being completely hypothetical. It is one for which I think he must have real regard. This is not a parliamentary committee. The fact that the Minister has laid down these conditions shows that it is not. The Opposition is blamed for not joining a parliamentary committee, but by the very terms the Minister lays down he makes it a government committee. He makes it an instrument of his government and of himself as Minister for External Affairs. It would be an entirely different proposition if we bad a committee on foreign affairs, appointed by this Parliament, in no way responsible to the Minister or subject to the Minister, but on the contrary, with power",35,Foreign Affairs Committee
75,Mr Allan Fraser,"That is exactlyto request the Minister to come before it, explain his policy and answer questions, as is done in many other parliaments all over the world. The Minister has raised one point which, apart from any others, is completely fatal to Opposition acceptance of membership of the committee; that is the insistence that the Government must have the right to nominate one of the Opposition representatives. further, because they have nominated a man whom we do not accept as a member of the Opposition; but our objection would be equally strong if they chose to nominate the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr is one of no note and that it should not be Daly), the honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson) or any other member of the Opposition. We object on the ground of the principle that it is for the Opposition to nominate its own representatives on this committee. M i . MALCOLM FRASER (Wannon) [4.40] Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) has done this House a service by making a very real effort in trying to create conditions in which one might expect a reasonable Opposition to join the Government in forming the Foreign Affairs Committee. I believe that this debate could be important, because I cannot see any government at any time being able to make concessions additional to the ones made by the Minister. Therefore, the decision that the Australian Labour Party has taken on this matter probably means that throughout the period of office of this Government at any rate, there will never be a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs. For this reason I think it is necessary to try to understand why the Opposition is taking objection, because I do not really believe for a moment that the verbal quibbles and the quibble over numbers constitute a valid reason for the Opposition remaining off the committee. 1 shall deal with the point raised at some length by the honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) in relation to numbers. I understand that it is the Opposition's view that the numbers in the House of Representatives should be in proportion to the numbers of people in the Parliament. If you take the alternative proposition that was put up-seve n Government members to five Opposition members from the House of Representatives-and then look at the numbers in the Senate, as this proposition requires, this would involve the appointment of four Government and three Opposition senators and one member of another political party. It is not a question of appointing an individual from the other Opposition; it is a question of appointing a representative of another Government supporters go political party. The mere fact that the political party happens to be represented by one member does not alter the position. I hope that the honourable member will not try to say that the political party concerned recognized in this fashion, because quite clearly, despite its representation, it is one of some influence. If honourable members opposite are serious in these matters, perhaps they could have introduced into this debate alternative propositions in their quibble over numbers. But they have not done so and I believe that their quibble may well have been used to hide their real reason for not joining the committee. Is the reason, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said, that perhaps they will be controlled by the Minister? Is it perhaps because the chairman, with the agreement of a dissenting member, will write a dissenting report? I cannot really accept these reasons as valid. The only reason that I believe stands out in any real sense has not been mentioned. The Opposition may feel that by having members of the committee it will be accused in some measure of supporting or being responsible for Government policies in relation to external affairs. If this is the belief of Opposition members and their reason for remaining off the committee, they should say so in this Parliament and end the nonsense and arguments about matters which are not all that important. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) examines the report of his speech, I think he will find that he contradicted himself on more than one occasion. At one stage he seemed to imply that he dropped the thesis that the committee should be used to educate the public, that it should be used to employ tbe powers of committees formed under the United States congressional system. But in the closing stages of his remarks he seemed to forget this implicit argument and again drew attention to the fact that the committee will not do these things. As1 understood him, he was putting this forward as one of the reasons why the Opposition could not and would net take part in the committee. The honourable member quoted the remarks, or the import of the remarks, of Professor Beddie, who attended the Australian Summer School of Political Science in Canberra earlier this year. I shall take a few minutes to say one or two things about the debate that took place during the political science symposium, because it is important that there should be an understanding of what the committee has done and what it can do in our parliamentary system. If the Minister has done nothing else, he has done the Parliament a service in affording an opportunity for debate on these matters so that they can be defined in a more reasonable manner than they have ever been defined in the past. I shall try to convey to the House the sort of thing that Professor Beddie said in putting forward his Lhesis about our parliamentary system as a whole. His thesis was that Parliament as Parliament has lost control. He described the present situation as something that is new, as something which has arisen in the last two or three decades. In doing this, Professor Beddie has fallen, as I think I said at the time, into a traditional error of many political philosophers who argue about what they would lie the position to be instead of about what could be the position in relation to the facts and the way politics work under our system of government. We should understand, and outside commentators from universities or any other fields should undersarily strengthen Congress as opposed to thc stand, the facts of life in relation to these matters. Where the executive is part of the Parliament, it is wrong to say that the Parliament has lost control because the authority of the executive is perhaps importan or overwhelming. The fact that the executive is part of the Parliament and that the Parliament without the executive perhaps has not the overriding control that some outside commentators may wish it to have does not mean that the Parliament as a whole has lost control. Such a contention, I believe, is without validity. F.3907/64 -R -[52 ] Again, where the executive is part of thc Parliament, criticism by the supporters of the executive tends, and, indeed, under our system, is bound, to be voiced to some degree in private. This will continue to be so no matter which party holds the Government benches, because people who are in office, regardless of the party to which they belong, do not want to strengthen the hands of those in opposition by voicing criticism always in public. So, much of this criticism will be uttered in private. This will continue to be the situation also because in our system, unlike the congressional system, an adverse vote in this Parliament can, and in most instances will, lead to the resignation of the government of the day. These are facts of life that we cannot get away from in our system. Quite clearly, there is a very powerful motive for the supporters of the present Government to take notice of these facts, because the resignation of the Government as a result of a vote in this Parliament, and the consequences that would follow, are beyond the contemplation of honourable members on this side. In the United States of America, where the executive is not part of Congress and cannot be overthrown by Congress, criticism is much freer and much more readily expressed, and it may be said that the average congressman has more importance and is more effective than a private member on the Government side or an Opposition member in this Parliament. However, it does not necessarily follow that greater freedom of criticism, of action and of voting for a member under the congressional system leads to a greater control of the executive by Congress. The greater freedom may lead merely to a greater volume of public criticism', and that would not necesexecutive. Indeed, it can well be argued that there is much greater parliamentary control in Australia because the Parliament has the authority to dismiss the executive, whereas, in the United States, Congress cannot dismiss the executive. Because of the basic misunderstanding of our system and the confusion between it and the congressional system, we often find people saying that the Parliament should be going about things different'y and that committees of the Parliament should act in a manner difierent from that in which they have customarily acted. For the same reasons that members are at times constrained in their activities in the Parliament because of the nature of our system, committees of the ParUament have similar constraint put upon them. In our system, as opposed to the congressional system, joint parliamentary committees could not have power to control, shape or initiate legislation. If, in fact, this Parliament ever worked. Finally, by reporting to the intended to give them these powers, some real abuse of our parliamentary system could occur. We should note in particular that on such committees the government of the day will always have a majority. Thc government majority, no matter what may be the political complexion of the administration in question, will not wish to endanger or unnecessarily embarrass its own executive. For this reason, again, under our system, joint committees work in private, and will have to continue to work in private. This will remain a necessity while our parliamentary system, as opposed to the American congressional system, continues to exist. The two systems are quite different in concept. The information, made available to the Foreign Affairs Committee, as the Minister for External Affairs told us when he submitted the motion, by reason of its very nature and the sources from which it is obtained, often must remain secret while it is not available from othei sources. This is another reason why the work of a committee such as this should remain relatively private compared to the work of committees in the United States. Sources of information must be protected. Sometimes, the information conies from other governments. Sometimes, it comes from people outside this Government and all other governments. Honourable members opposite, if they were to serve on the committee, would realize that the persons who appear before it talk much more freely and much more frankly than tbey would talk if they believed that what they said would be brought into the full light of day. This is one valuable feature of the committee's work that would be iost if its proceedings were to be made public. Because of a basic misunderstanding of one House or the other to be appointed what committees such as this can and should or over the way in which dissent from a do in a British parliamentary system, people report may be communicated to the have often looked for reactions from the Foreign Affairs Committee that they cannot reasonably envisage and have no right to expect. The committee's purpose is to inform honourable members and to report to the Minister for External Affairs on any matters that it thinks fit. If that was not precisely the position in the past, it was in fact the way in which the committee Minister, the committee may have some innuence on policy. It is quite improper to judge the committee on its published documents, as I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did, and as Professor Beddie certainly did when he addressed the Summer School of Political Science in Canberra earlier this year. The reports of the conimittee are not intended to be published. They are designed to be presented to the Minister for External Affairs, and only by accident would a report of the committee be suitable for publication. Tbe committee's purpose is not to publish material. The assumption that because a report on one subject was published the committee may have been steered away from or prevented from examining other matters is false and bears no relation to the premise on which it is based. Honourable members opposite, if they were willing to serve on the committee, would realize that in the matters that it wishes to examine it has a pretty free hand. In fact, the committee has examined those matters that it wants to examine. As I have said, Mr Speaker, this debate is important. I believe that this is the last time that a genuine attempt can be made to persuade Opposition members to serve on the committee. I do not believe that any future Minister for External Affairs would go to the lengths to which the present Minister has gone in delaying the constitution of the committee for several weeks or even months. This delay and the attitude of the Opposition are regrettable. I repeat that, as I understand the situation indicated by the differing views expressed by Opposition members, the real reason for their refusal to take part in thc work of this committee is not that they have some quibble over the number of members from Minister, but that they have a basic misconception about what the committee can do, the influence that it can exercise and the primary purpose that it can usefully serve in helping to inform members of the Parliament so that they may make reasonable and sensible judgments on some aspects of foreign affairs. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [4.53] Mr important to the Government than the Speaker, I believe that this debate on the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr motion for the appointment of the Foreign Wentworth) is.

In addition to this, any one who leadership and the Minister for External knows the attitude of this gentleman in Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick), conditions another place to questions of external affairs governing the position of the Opposition in and the attitude of the Government will relation to this committee have been careknow that on almost every issue, if not fully considered.

As a result of the lengthy discussions, negotiations and correspondence that have taken place, three conditions became the subject of examination. The first related to the membership of the member of another gentlemen place, who is a senator for the Australian encouragement. Democratic Labour Party. The position that the Opposition takes in respect of this gentleman is that he in every sense of the word is a supporter of the Government. He and his party work outside the Parliament in every conceivable way to benefit and to elect the Government. Mr Clyde Cameron -He is more Dr. J. F.

77,Mr Speaker,"Order! I would notI will deal now with thc question of a minority report. The conditions defined by the Minister give the chairman of the committee the right to summarize minority reports. In fact, the chairman of the committee is given the right to say how much will be put in a minority report which might come from the Opposition. We know the chairman of the committee is a supporter of the Government. Therefore, in this condition, a supporter of the Government is given the right to say what the Opposition would put in its minority report. This is a condition we cannot possibly accept. We believe that the attitude of the Government should be that members on the Opposition side, like members on the Government side, must be given the right to say what they think in a minority report. I believe v/e can assume that honourable members on this side of the House would show as much responsibility and discretion as honourable menibers on the other side of the House would show in saying what they believed should be said. We believe that the Opposition members of the committee would need to have the right to decide themselves what they should say in their minority report. The third condition that I want to refer to briefly before sitting down relates to secrecy. I think it is quite likely that some matters would arise in thc course of the discussions of the committee that should be kept secret, but I believe that this question of secrecy is very much overdone. The Minister for the Army in a very considered statement has pointed out that very little of what was sent to the committee on more than one occasion by the former Minister for External Affairs could ever be considered secret. The Minister for the Army made an excellent job of stating how he bad read in the "" Daily Telegraph "" , "" Newsweek"" Time"" or some otber magazine the information that the previous Minister for External Affairs was telling the committee was highly classified material. I do not think the Minister for the Army can give a satisfactory reply to this merely by shaking his head. I think there is a hebit of being too much inclined to treat information as highly secret. matter of representation on the committee, It does the ego good, I suppose, to think that information we have is so important and so highly secret. I do not think that this condition lhat has been given to us by the Minister would work out very well in practice. He said that a member of the committee would not be prevented from divulging what he had heard in the committee provided he had heard it somewhere else and was not responsible for introducing it into the public domain. This sounds like a reasonable proposition at first, but I suggest that it would be very difficult to make it work in practice. This committee should be encouraged to study, to work on and to make public far more than the present conditions would allow. There is nothing that this country of ours needs more than authoritative education on matters of external affairs. 1 regret that there is still a tendency to treat this committee as a very restricted study circle for the education of people who ought to be sufficiently well educated already in these matters. For the three reasons I have now attempted to summarize, the Opposition finds itself unable to accept the conditions offered to it by the Minister and the Government for joining the committee. I emphasize that these are conditions offered by the Government. Thc responsibility for defining them is on the Government and if the Government wants the Opposition to provide members of the committee the responsibility is on it to make the conditions suitable for the Opposition to accept. very shortly to say how sorry I am that the Opposition has taken the attitude on this matter that it has taken to-day. I think that the correspondence, to which most honourable members who have spoken have referred, shows that there has been a desire on both sides of the House to narrow the gap that has existed between us in the past and to see whether some arrangement could be made to enable all parties to be represented on thc committee. It is quite obvious from what has been said that the gap has been considerably narrowed and that very little now divides the main parties in the House and prevents tbe Opposition from joining the committee.

Under the Government's new proposals, when these measures have been passed by the Parliament, only one levy will be imposed on the wool-growers, and it will embrace both promotion and research. Hitherto, apart from a contribution for research, there has not been any governmental contribution for the purpose of promoting wool in the markets of the world, except in one brief period. I remind the House that the principle of levying which is involved in these measuresI will come to subsidization lateris very important. The ostensible purpose of the levy is to raise money from the people most directly concerned. It is hoped that a body appointed to administer the funds --in this case the Australian Wool Board and its associate, the International Wool Secretariat-wil l act so as to gain more revenue in order to improve the living conditions and incomes of the wool-growers of Australia. Of course, to the extent that their living conditions and incomes are improved, particularly by the sale of their products overseas, the overall welfare of the people of Australia will be improved. We might ask whether, even if the money that is to be raised is spent effectively, it is was introduced in this Parliament. There necessary to spend such a large amount? The objective is a very desirable one. I point out to the House-particularl y to members of the Government parties-that the levy provision involves a principle which, I am willing to confess, has been adopted in my time by every political party represented in this House. From some source representing the people upon whom the levy will be imposed or inflicted there is assent to the levy. I candidly admit that the best way to receive assent would be through a poll of the growers concerned, but up to the present I do not know of any government of any political colour which has resorted to that method of ascertaining whether or not a levy should be imposed. I think the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) will agree with me on that point. The point to which I am coming is that in this case, as in other cases, the acquiescence to the levy comes from two major organizations which in combination constitute the Australian Wool Industry Conference. On that conference there is 50 per cent, representation by the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council and a 50 per cent, representation by the Austrahan Wool and Meat Producers Federation. The conference consists of 25 delegates from each of those organizations and is presided over by an independent chairman, Professor Sir John Crawford. As provided for in recent wool industry legislation, the Government accepts the decisions of that conference on certain matters, and accepts its recommendation as an all-clear signal to impose a levy. Other sections of the Australian community, such as those comprising the trade unions, levy their members in the form of dues, and sometimes impose additional fees, for the same purposes for which the wool growers, through those two organizations, have assented to this levy-namely , to improve the standards of living of their members. To the extent that they are successful in achieving that aim and to the extent that the available purchasing power is more widely distributed in the community, the national well-being is improved. I wonder what would be said if a proposal to levy trade unionists and to pass the money over to the union organizations to spend for the benefit of the unionists would be a hue and cry, as there was in regard to the Hursey case, and it would be said that that was a compulsory imposition of a levy on some rank and file members of trade unions who would be unwilling to pay the levy. That question could arise in regard to the levy proposal that is now before the House. I am not sure that the Parliament is justified in assenting to the proposed levy merely because 40 members of the Australian Wool Industry Conference assented to it. Mr Allan Fraser -It is not, if we listen to the argument relating to the trade unions. of the argument against compulsory levies imposed on trade unionists, at the request of the executives or representative bodies of the unions, in order to improve the living conditions of the trade union members. I just throw that in as a reminder.",43,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed
88,Mr Pollard,"It is not, in the lightWhat is the background story to the focal point in the bill-the levy and subsidy proposals? The former Australian Wool Board, which this Government renamed the Australian Wool Bureau, coasted along with a modest levy on wool producers. I believe that the old board, under the chairmanship of the late Sir Douglas Boyd, did reasonably good work and that there was justification for the work that it did. Generally, every one accepted that the work done was desirable and valuable. Back in 1948 this country witnessed the operation of a wool marketing scheme for the disposal of the war-time surplus and of the current and incoming clips. That scheme was highly successful. It made a profit of £93,000,000, whi;h was distributed to the participating growers. It was money from heaven. The scheme was excellently managed and had the co-operation of brokers, appraisers, growers, governments and everyone else. When that successful operation concluded there arose from thousands of Australian wool-growers, who had fear in their hearts, an agitation for a continuation of that form of marketing. The growers remembered thc experiences of 1921 after the First World War when William Morris Hughes, finding that ths price of export wool fell as low as 6id. per lb., invoked the Customs Act and gazetted a regulation prohibiting anyone from exporting wool at less than 8d or 9d. per Ib. Almost immediately after the Customs Act was invoked the world's wool buyers came to the party in Australia, and up went the price of wool. However, eventually that protective shield was withdrawn. Then the 1945 legislation relating to the Australian Wool Realization Commission was enacted. But the growers had not forgotten their experiences in 1921, so when the 1.939 war ended there arose further agitation for some marketing legislation of a protective character. Thc wool industry is divided fairly clearly The committee travelled the world. One in its representation from various organizaman was sent to New Zealand to look at a tions between the ultra-conservatives and plan operating there what might be termed thc ultra-radicals. The ultra-conservatives, with their links with committee. wool-growers, wool buyers and commercial houses, including banks and various other interests which now run the wool futures The committee did not go as a whole to organizations and so on, have never spared take any evidence, but the members took any effort in tbeir endeavours to kill any action by this Parliament or by any one else to get a practical wool marketing scheme into operation. On the other hand, the ultra-radical seciion of the industry has been active and has done its best. In 1951 this Government put to thc wool growers an organized marketing schemea reserve price plan. This was rcjectcJ out of hand for a variety of reasons that I have stated previously in this House and do not want to elaborate on now. There were the Ti per cent. levy, the 20 per cent, tax deduction and so on. Since 1951 the wool-growers have continued their agitation because in 1958 or thereabouts the price of wool fell to about 42d. per Ib. Eventually the Government, pressed into a corner because it had become well known in Australia that pies were operating-al l kinds of people ganged up to depress the price of wool; it still goes on-appointe d the Wool Marketing Committee of Enquiry. That conimittee had a fairly wide charter of inquiry but did not have any of the power normally vested in a royal commission. Indeed, in its report the committee pointed out that it had not the power to send for certain information and to demand that it be supplied, or to require a witness to give evidence on oath. That was a great weakness. The end result if the activities of this hand-picked committee-picke d to reflect clearly the Government's outlook in the economic sense committee. mittee? Get out!

Honourable members on the Government side expressed themselves as being completely opposed to any Government subsidy. As I have said, Sir William Gunn and Mr Vines, and others whom they called to their assistance, met with resistance. They were astute men. What happened then? Sir William Gunn and representatives of the Wool Board and of the Wool Industry Conference went as a deputation to the Government. Professor Crawford was there.

They were the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies), the Treasurer ( Mr meant a grower contribution of 27/per bale and Harold Holt), the Minister for Trade and for Primary Industry. I do not know what was said to them, but I could make a shrewd guess. It would be something like this: We are having one hell of a job to get these wool-growers to consent to a levy of 44s. a bale, and unless we can get some subsidy from the Government we are sunk. These four Ministers appeared at a most appropriate time, just after the election date the Government has instituted this extra had been announced by the Prime Minister. Lo and behold, they came forth from the conference looking pleased and within a few daysI can give the exact date if you wish; it was just before the general election-the Government announced that it had undertaken to pay a subsidy of £1 for £1 on every amount in excess of 10s. a bale being paid by the wool-growers at that time. What did that mean? Abandoning the attitude adopted when the Labour Party in 1962 suggested a subsidy in this House, the Government came right out with a most substantial subsidy. It said to the growers, "" You arc now paying 10s. a bale. You will pay an extra 17s. a bale, bringing your contribution to 27s., and we will pay 17s. a bale, making a total of 44s."" This offer was put to the Australian Wool Industry Conference and was accepted. Well, I think the growers were led up an alley. This party is in the clear on the matter, because this is what was contained in the Labour Party's rural policy speech for the 1963 election:Do you remember that as recently as February 1961, Sir William Gunn, as chairman of the now defunct Wool Bureau campaigned for the following promotion levy programmePer bale. 196162 . . .. .. . . 10/1962-63 10/1963-64 14/1964-65 15/1965-66 . . .. .. . . 16/6 1966-67 . . .. .. . . 20/Recently, Sir William Gunn, as chairman of the new Wool Board, launched a campaign for a 44/per bale per grower levy. This is 30/per bale higher than what Sir William proposed less than two years ago, as being suitable for the season 1963-64. This new proposal met very strong grower resistance. The executive of the Australian Wool Industry Conference and Sir William Gunn then approached the Commonwealth Government for a contribution. On the eve of this election the Government agreed to a proposal which, if it became operative, a Government subsidy of 17/per bale. Labor's pledge on promotion. A Labor government will not increase the present 10/per bale promotion levy until growers have voted at a poll on a reserve price auction plan at an early date. A Labor government will submit such a plan for growers' approval at a poll. If the plan is accepted by growers, a Labor government would review the levy need and subsidize, pound for pound, growers' contributions. Well, that proposal was not accepted and 17s. levy. This is now expressed, together wilh the present 10s. levy, as a 2 per cent, levy and will be applied to the grower's proceeds as received from the wool broker -hi s gross proceeds, his cheque. It does not sound much; but let us look at some figures. When this levy is imposed on the growers there will be some shocks. I have some figures that 1 took out, based on information in one of the publications of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, I think for the year 1961. These figures give cost of production and so on. They were arrived at after a survey of 70 farms in the high rainfall zone of Victoria, of sizes ranging from 200 to 10,000 acres, with an average size of 772 acres and an",46,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed
97,Industry ( Mr Mcewen) And The Minister,"average flock of 1,192 sheep. I want to explain that in the figures showing gross returns I have included some small income of these people, who are mainly wool growers, from cattle and the sale of sheep, but the overall effect of the levy will not be substantially altered. In each case I have taken the three years 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60. In 1957-58 the wool price was 62.45d. per lb., in 1958-59 it was 48.57d. and in 1959-60 it had picked up a bit, being 57.78d. These interesting figures are revealed: With a gross return of £4,403 the 2 per cent. levy would amount to £88. The costs in this case would be £2,953, leaving a net farm income of £1,450. These are the bureau's own figures. On a net income of £1,450, the levy incidence is 6 per cent. This does not take account of the operator's allowance of £756, and surely the wool-grower is entitled to that. If we deduct the operator'sallowance of £756, the return to capital and management is £694. I might mention that these percentages do not take account of the Government subsidy. On tbe basis of £694, the 2 per cent, levy that it is proposed to inflict on the grower becomes a 12.6 per cent. levy. That will make some of the growers grieve, and I hope they will realize who has put this impost on their backs. Let us take the year 1958-59. In that year the average gross return on the 70 properties was £3,658. The2 per cent, levy on that would amount to £73.16. The costs amounted to £2,801, so that the net farm income for the year was £857. The levy incidence there is 8.5 per cent. If the grower is allowed an operator's allowance of £773, to which he is entitled, the net return to capital and management is only £84, and the levy incidence is 87 per cent. That will hurt, will it not? That is what this means. Now let us take the j'ear 1959-60, when thc price of wool was 57.78J. per lb. In that year, the gross income was £4,767, and the 2 per cent, levy amounts to £95.34. In that year the costs were £3,012, so that the net farm income was £1,755. In this case, the levy incidence is 5.4 per cent. The return to capital and management, after deducting an operator's allowance of £818, was £937 on which the levy incidence is 10 per cent. I have quoted a series of facts, and I challenge contradiction of them. conjurer if you can convert 2 per cent, into 87 per cent. man says I am a conjurer. Let me explain the position to him again. I repeat that the figures upon which I have based my calculation have been supplied by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. In the year 1958-59, the gross return was £3,658 and the costs were £2,801. This left a net farm income of £857. If we deduct from that the operator's allowance of £773, we get a net return to capital and management of £84. The2 per cent. levy on the gross return of £3,658 is approximately £73 and the relation which the £73 bears to the net return of £84 OD capital and management is 87 per cent. The Minister can work it out for himself. IfI am wrong, I will apologize. the costs. but you can look it up for yourself in the report I have mentioned. The honourable member for Mallee can laugh. Jt is easy fo laugh. Perhaps he would like me to read tbe details out to him, but I can give bim the exact reference to the report. He can read the report for himself, and 1 assure him that I have not excluded one cost figure that has been included by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. If the honourable member doubts my veracity, he can check the figures. Then he can come back and explain the matter himself. I remind him that thefigurespublished by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics are accepted as being almost gospel. I have outlined the facts. Because the position is as I have stated, I propose, before resuming my scat, to move an amendment. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) may shake his head, but the Minister will not deny that the levy of 2 per cent, will be applied at the point where the woolbroker writes out a cheque for the wool grower.",47,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed

Thcy do so knowing that the figures will be reduced. Did Sir William Gunn, who is chairman of the Australian Wool Board, or his colleagues challenge the claim that £11,000,000 was essential for the promotion of wool in overseas markets? It does not look like it. So the estimate of £11,000,000 was accepted. expenditure of that amount on promotion save the growers of this country? Will it prevent a price decrease? Nobody can say. The expenditure of this amount is a calculated risk. I suggest that the amount is extravagant in the light of all our experience. I have been a fairly ardent reader of various publications of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Periodically the bureau publishes ""The Australian Sheep Industry Survey"", which provides information on the wool situation. Over a number of years the bureau's publications Mr Deputy Speaker, about three years have suggested probable reasons for the ago the International Wool Secretariat, a slump in wool prices. I believe the reasons creation of the world's wool-producing are that the international situation is countries and in particular of Australia, difficult, war is thought to be in the offing New Zealand and South Africa, made a or people are buying clothing made from comprehensive survey of the effort required materials other than wool.

As my time has almost expired I shall conclude by moving an amendment which is in line with Labour's policy and is designed to protect Australian wool growers from what is the most despicable and calculated burglary that has ever been perpetrated on the wool industry by a designing set of men acting through other men who, in my opinion, are innocents abroad.

The third object of the measure is to give to the Australian Wool Board, through clause 5, power to borrow. I would like to say at the outset that the promotion levy scheme has been referred to the growers' organizations and has received their approval through the Australian Wool Industry Conference. I do not think there is any need for me at this stage to stress the a large-scale promotion campaign and it importance of the wool industry to the Australian Commonwealth. It is obvious. I also think that it is unnecessary for me to illustrate the necessity for us to do all in our power to ensure a continuing worldwide demand for wool at satisfactory prices to the growers in the face of fierce and continuing competition from the synthetic fibres industry, as well as from the competition of other fibres. I refer to the fibres used in clothing, carpets and in other forms of manufacture where wool is normally used. During the course of his speech the honorciple and is one which may not have able member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who appealed to the wool-growers of the past. is leading the Opposition in this debate, used what I can best describe as somewhat member for Lalor referred to the conservaextravagant language in dealing with the tive attitude of a number of Australian objects of the promotion campaign.

He concluded by moving an past by the wool-growers. However, the amendment which seeks the rejection of the point I wish to make is that the woolidea of a promotion campaign until the growers of the past were not faced with growers have had an opportunity to express the scientific developments that have taken their views about the introduction of an place in the synthetic wool-substitute fibres orderly marketing plan. Those of us who industry, or with the large-scale industry have devoted considerable study to this proengaged in the production of these synblem will realize that the amendment prothetics; nor were they faced with the imposed by the honourable member is simply mense resources of advertising used in the a smoke-screen to try to get around the direct encouragement of consumer appeal. major object of this legislation, which is to encourage the organization we have set up to carry on with the very important matter for the Government of Australia and far of promotion. I feel that there will be time too important for the general well-being of and opportunity to discuss wool marketing the Australian economy to be dismissed as when it comes before the House, but it has something that is purely the prerogative j f nothing to do with the bills now before us. the growers. Philosophically that is the I repeat that the extremely extravagant point we have to remember. The wool language used by the honourable member for industry is so vital to the general economy Lalor in regard to marketing could be better of Australia that irrespective of the growers' indulged in on another occasion. The wishes to keep the industry out of governthought came to my mind, as one who has ment control, the promotion proposals conthe interests of the industry at heart, that tained in the legislation before us are so it would be a poor day for the Australian wool industry if its administration at government level fell into the hands of those who have the same way of thinking as the honourable member for Lalor. In October last, the Government recognized the importance of meeting the competition of the synthetic fibres industry in particular and the competition of other fibres used for similar purposes to wool. The Government adopted the principle of was announced by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) at the time that the Government was prepared to contribute towards promotion an amount equal to the growers' contribution in excess of the sum of 10s. a bale determined in previous legislation. Under the measure before us, the levy to be imposed will include the existing levy of 2s. a bale for research. The total levy of 2 per cent., to which I shall refer later on in my speech, will therefore cover not only promotion but also research. Admittedly, this is a completely new prinOn a previous occasion, the honourable The wool industry is far too important important that government responsibility must be and obviously is involved. Promotion is to be undertaken by the International Wool Secretariat under the very able administration of Mr Vines, an Australian with a vast experience in international trade as a senior executive of a famous paint manufacturing firm. As a young man he gained a background knowledge of wool production and had a close association with the wool trade in his more mature years. The International Wool Secretariat has prepared a scheme for promotion founded on the idea of creating a separate image for wool as the pre-eminent fibre for human apparel, for furnishing fabrics and for many diverse uses. The promotion campaign seeks to withdraw wool from normal association with other fibres so that pre-eminence may be given to it in consumer appeal. I think that answers to a certain extent the criticism of people who ask what the necessity is for a promotion campaign when we are actually selling all our wool. If honourable members realize that the object of the promotion campaign is to draw wool out of association with other fibres they will appreciate that it will attain pre-eminence and greater appeal to the public generally. If the promotion campaign succeeds, wool will be placed on a pedestal of appeal for human consumption. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the success of any promotion compaign. Obviously, when one spends a lot of money on advertising, it is almost impossible to make an appreciation from day to day of the results of the expenditure. Wool promotion involves the spending of huge sums. The current plan has set a target for an annual expenditure of £16,250,000 over the next five years, of which Australia will provide £11,000,000 per annum. The present strong market for wooi has probably been partly brought about by the very severe winter of 1962-63 in the northern hemisphere and also perhaps by changing fashions and a high level of prosperity in the wool consuming countries. This strong market may produce thc thought that promotion is not necessary. However, we have already been conducting a promotion campaign to a certain degree and, if we believe in the success of advertising, it is reasonable to assume that the campaign that has already been conducted has brought some measure of success. The present promotion levy is imposed on the basis of 10s. a bale, a fadge or a bag. From now on, the levy will be imposed as a percentage of sale value. With this change, I completely agree. I believe that the decision by the Minister for Primary Industry and the Government to change to a percentage basis has been wise. This decision was based on a wise recommendation by the Australian Wool Industry Conference. The new basis for the levy will in fact produce a much more equitable distribution of the burden of the levy than the old bale basis. To make this clear, 1 have only to cite the comparison between a bale of high-quality merino wool selling at £120 or £140, or even more, and a bale of lower-quality wool selling at £40 or £50. This shows how inequitable is a levy imposed by the bale. The percentage of thc Jevy on the new basis will be a maximum of 2 per cent., and the actual rate to be imposed in any one year will be fixed by the Governor General by regulation on the recommendation of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. This will impose on the conference a heavy obligation, for determination of the results of the expenditure on promotion in thc past and evaluation of the promotion programme in the future will not be easy. The recommendations made by the conference naturally will be greatly influenced by thc advice that it receives, for individual members would not have the personal experience of knowledge to make really informed decisions. Therefore, I believe, in the interests of the growers, a very large section of whom will be represented on the council, and also in the interests of the Government, which will contribute a substantial subvention, and of the taxpayers of Australia, any decisions ought to be made only after a very careful examination of thc accounts and recommendations of the International Wool Secretariat and the Australian Wool Board. It is not my intention to discuss this matter at great length, Sir, because many other honourable members on both sides of the House wish to take part in this debate, but I wish to say that if the Australian Wool Industry Conference is to receive thc full support of the growers, it should be truly representative of the general body of growers. Currently, an approach is being made for representation on the conference of the Australian Primary Producers Union, which is a more recent addition to the organizations that represent growers. That body, in its comparatively short history, has shown that it adopts a responsible approach to the problems of the wool industry. It has produced several men with real ability and understanding of those problems. I sincerely trust that the way will be opened for the representation of the union on this all-important Wool Industry Conference, thereby making the conference more truly representative of the Australian wool-growers. Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Lalor involves the rejection of the proposition that promotion of the sale of wool is urgently needed. I believe in promotion. I believe that it is necessary. The honourable member has merely drawn across the trail a red herring related to a completely different subject. Apparently, he has in the back of his mind an idea that promotion involves some subterfuge and that a successful promotion campaign will delay a proper examination of the problems of the orderly marketing of wool and an appeal to the growers to approve action necessary to solve those problems. In my view, the honourable member's proposal must be rejected immediately. In considering these measures, we are considering promotion. I believe the legislation is necessary. The Australian Wool Industry Conference, which is a body of some substance, believes that it is necessary. It has been recommended and vetted by the International Wool Secretariat and the Australian Wool Board. Not all the growers have adopted a uniform attitude towards the government's proposals, I admit, but at least they have them fairly clearly in their minds now. In my view, an attempt now to delay the wool promotion campaign on the ground that something else is wanted in the way of wool marketing proposals would be wrong. The amendment represents an attempt to defeat the Wool Industry Bill, and 1 will have none of it. I support this legislation. I believe that thc Minister has done a remarkable job in achieving unity between the two major wool organizations. I appeal to him to do all he can to further the interests of the Australian Primary Producers Union, which, I believe, has already shown a marked degree of responsibility. Representation of that body on the Australian Wool Industry Conference would add strength to the conference and make it more fully representative of the wool-growers as a whole, Deputy Speaker, I support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), which is important because the Wool Industry Bill is concerned with the promotion and merchandising of wool. That is a very worthy cause. It is important, also, that the growers receive proper returns for their product, and therefore they must be able to sell at just prices. Inquiries that have been held have proved that, under the present arrangements for the marketing of wool, pies and various activities prevent the producers from getting just prices. We believe that the assurance of just prices to the producers is equally as important as any other consideration and should receive equal attention in the contemplation of any arrangement for the promotion of the sale of wool. As the honourable member for Lalor has pointed out, wool has found a ready market every year. I think it will continue to do so, because it has no equal as a product and possesses many qualities that are not found in substitutes. The wool industry is very important in the life of Australia. In 1962-63 it earned £407,000,000 overseas, representing 38 per cent, of our total exports of merchandise. An industry that produces export income on such a large scale is important not only to the people actually engaged in it, but to the whole of Australia, and especially to country towns, which are supported by wool-growing. Stability in the wool industry promotes stability and employment in country towns and in the cities. For these reasons, as I have said, the industry is very important to all Australians. The Australian Labour Party is not opposed to the principle of the promotion of the sale and the use of wool. We are opposed only to the methods now to be adopted and to the heavy levy to be imposed",50,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed
112,Mr Clark (Darling) [8.17],"Mron producers. We believe that many wool growers will have difficulty in paying the high rate of levy, particularly in bad years due to droughts or adverse grazing conditions. Many young men in the wool industry to-day are paying off their properties. They are rearing large families and, because they live in isolated areas, they have to meet heavy expenses in sending their children to school. Many of these young men can ill afford to pay the high levies on wool. A prosperous grazier would have no difficulty in finding the money, but I believe that tbe small grower would have difficulty. Wool marketing is important. The Government has said that it is important to establish new markets for wool. One would think that the Government would do everything within its power to find new markets or to take advantage of any opportunities to sell more wool, but this is not so. I do not know what the tariff on synthetics is now, but not very long ago the present Government reduced the tariff on synthetics coming from America and other countries from 50 per cent, to H per cent. Synthetics are the chief competitors of wool, but the tariff on nylon was reduced from 50 per cent, to l i per cent, at a time when we were paying a duty of 25 to 28 cents per lb. on wool going to America. Before reducing the tariff on American nylon and rayon coming into this country, the Government should have negotiated with the American interests to have the duty on wool entering America reduced in the same proportion as we reduced the duty on synthetics coming from America. This is one instance in which the Government could have increased the sale of wool by having the present American embargo eased, but it did not take any action. On the other hand, it encouraged the use of synthetics in Australia by reducing the duty. The wool industry has suffered many ups and downs. It has gone through periods of great prosperity and periods of slump prices. During a slump, many growers will have some difficulty in meeting the levy on wool. If the Government is anxious to assist the wool industry and to help the grower obtain a better price for his product, it should keep in mind that it is equally as important to obJoint Organization scheme concluded. In tain an increased price as it is to obtain an increased market for the product. I believe that the whole of the clip is being sold at present. We have a mounting burden of shipping freights. Periodically the shipping combines increase their charges on wool. Time and again the Government has been urged to take some action to stabilize the freight charges on wool, but it has done nothing. This is one way of assisting primary producers, but the Government has done nothing about it. More credit should be made available within Australia for the purchase of wool. Most of the finance for the purchase of wool is made available overseas. I have been informed by buyers from other countries that at times they have difficulty in obtainingfinanceabroad and have certainly not been able to obtain it in Australia. A few years ago, the interest rates on money provided for the purchase of wool were increased, and were higher than the general interest rates obtaining in the community. This imposition was responsible for a reduction at that time in fhe price of wool. Interest rates have recently been increased and there is little doubt that the interest rates on overdrafts will also be increased. Many wool-growers have overdrafts-som e have substantial overdrafts-and the interest rates they pay will be increased. The Government says it wants to help wool growers. If it is sincere, it can help them by keeping down interest rates on overdrafts. I do not wish to speak at great length on these matters, but I want to emphasise that an orderly marketing scheme for wool is important. As I said earlier, it is important that we should get the highest possible price for wool. The financial section of "" Rydge's Business Journal"" contained the following statement:Had a floor price scheme been established at the commencement of the present selling season, I feel certain there would be a very different position in the trade to-day. The journal pointed out that marketing schemes were adopted in New Zealand and South Africa after the Joint Organization scheme finished, and both countries have found that their marketing schemes operate very successfully. The price of wool in New Zealand has been maintained at a higher level than the 1952 level, when the 1952 the Australian price was 44 per cent, higher than the New Zealand price, but the price in Australia to-day is about 4 per cent, lower. If we had maintained the price as it was at the end of the Joint Organization scheme we would now be £1,000,000,000 better off. All these matters are of importance to the wool-grower. But the Government has done nothing at all to adopt an orderly marketing scheme for wool. The Australian Labour Party has moved this amendment in an effort to have some action taken to establish an orderly marketing scheme. We believe that this is as important as, if not more important than, finding new markets for the product. After all, all the wool we produce is sold on the markets that we have now. One of the problems facing the growers to-day is that the number of buyers is decreasing. I am informed that about 60 per cent, of the wool sold on the Sydney market is bought by about seven buyers, about 15 per cent, by twenty buyers and the balance of about 25 per cent, is bought by about fifteen buyers. Mr Malcolm Fraser -Ho w many buyers are operating altogether, do you know? buyers are operating altogether. The number was substantially greater a short time ago. There is a tendency to-day for pies to be formed and lot-splitting has forced many of the small buyers to pull out of the business. They have not been able to survive against the monopoly that is buying more than 60 per cent, of our wool. Some men are continuing to buy wool in a small way, but they are forced to split their commission in half and share it with the monopoly. Thcy do their buying, retain half the commission and give the other half to the monopoly. If they do not do this they will be pushed out of the market altogether. They have to pay the price laid down for them by the ring. The impact of synthetics is certainly imexperts and other independent people who portant. It raises a problem which we unforhave been asked to form a judgment, tunately must face. I realize that there must be a promotion campaign of some kind but we feel that the funds sought to be raised under the present promotion scheme are excessive. A levy of 2 per cent, on a bale fetching £70 would amount to £1 8s. That is an excessive charge. Synthetics that compete with wool are being used in many ways to-day. Recently questions asked in the House revealed that blankets purchased for our Army contained a percentage of synthetics. At one time Army blankets were all wool. One would think that in a country which relies so heavily on the wool industry the Government would stick to woollen blankets, but our military forces are using substitutes for wool. I emphasize that matter. Our amendment seeks to have a poll of wool-growers on the question of an orderly marketing plan. We believe that if wool growers have the opportunity they will support overwhelmingly an orderly marketing plan. We believe also that if the wool growers are required to meet excessive charges in order to establish a stabilization scheme they will be inclined to turn it down. The original proposal to establish a marketing scheme should be adopted. The Government will pay a subsidy only on the increased charges that are to be levied. The Government will not pay a subsidy on the original 10s. levy that is being paid by the wool-growers. During the election campaign the Labour Party stated that it would pay a subsidy on the original 10s. levy. Wool helps not only the primary producer who grows it but the nation as a whole. It is a valuable national product. The Government should shoulder a greater responsibility and should pay a greater percentage of the amount which the primary producer is called upon to pay. [8.32] -On e fact stands out in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) and supported by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark). It is that the Opposition is opposing quite blatantly the subsidy that this Government bas said it is prepared to give for additional wool promotion and which the wool industry, on the advice of its regards as absolutely essential for its future. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Lalor and supported by the honourable member for Darling quite clearly means that the Opposition would oppose the giving of a government subsidy and would like to see nothing done until the system of wool marketing is altered. ThisI believe to be a quite fantastic situation.",53,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed

114,Mr Malcolm Fraser (Wannon),"Shortly before the last election, the Labour Party said that it would support wool promotion on some basis. Perhaps it was a £1 for £1 basis; I do not know. When legislation dealing with the wool if he had the responsibility of acting in the industry was introduced into the last Parmatter. I am sure that he would have acted liament the Opposition said that it would as this Government has acted. support a system of wool promotion. The decisions of the Government, to which effect is given in this legislation, are not about a marketing scheme. He referred to far out of line with the views of the Oppoa marketing scheme in the same easy terms sition on a former occasion. Those decithat have been common in recent times. sions have been taken by the Government I readily agree that certain statements made on the advice of the Australian Wool Board just before the last election by leaders of and the Australian Wool Industry Conferthe Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers ence. I find the Opposition's attitude in Association acknowledged that the fight for this matter extraordinary. Frankly, I a marketing scheme had been won. A cannot understand the Opposition's attitude. great deal of the impetus for these moveI wish to make one or two comments on Victoria. Those statements were to some the remarks of the honourable member for extent difficult to understand because the Darling. He charged the Government with people making them could not show how lack of foresight or concern for the wool the situation at that time differed from the industry because customs duties on certain situation that existed a few months presynthetics coming into Australia had been viously, but it is worth noting that there lowered. The honourable member surely has not been a great deal of agitation on ignored the fact that the synthetics that this matter in thc last few months. enter this country come largely from the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and the United States of America, and that of those of wool is one of the factors that has led countries the United States is the only one to the easing of pressure for a marketing that imposes a duty on raw wool. If this plan, we should not forget that only in May Government had maintained a relatively of last year thc Australian Wool Board high rate of duty on synthetics coming into was given statutory responsibility for marketthis country, we would have invited the ing and that in accordance with legislation United Kingdom, Italy and Germany to that this Government passed at the request impose a duty on the raw wool that we of the wool-grower organizations a marketexport to them. Those countries have some ing committee was established. That comof the world's greatest textile industries and mittee has been conducting an exhaustive their cloth is second to none. If we had technical examination to try to ascertain invited those countries to impose a duty on what kind of marketing is best for the Austhe raw wool that they buy from Australian wool-grower and for Australia as tralia, we would have done the Australian a whole. wool industry a much greater injustice than the honourable member for Darling might realize. We must remember that 95 per cent, of would be best. It is possible for all those the product of the wool industry-the people to advance arguments to support greatest of Australian industries-is sold on their cases. Still others advocate a scheme the world's markets and only 5 per cent, is of acquisition plus free auction. They say used inside Australia. So it is the markets that a combination of the two would prooutside Australia that are of prime concern vide the best results for Australia and the to the Government and to the wool industry. Australian wool-grower. The marketing We must do everything we can to preserve committee has given itself the not altogether and improve those markets so that we may easy task of outlining the differences obtain from them the highest prices possible between the various schemes and has for our wool. The Government's action in accepted the obligation to report to the relation to customs duty on synthetics coming into the country was fully in accordance with its policy. If any honourable member opposite wishes to deny that, let him think for a moment what he may have done The honourable member for Darling spoke ments for a marketing scheme came from WhilstI fully agree that the present price It is very easy to say that a floor price scheme would be best but other people claim that an acquisition or appraisal scheme Australian Wool Industry Conference and then to the wool industry the proposals it recommends for Australia. It may well be that the reputation of the chairman of the Australian Wool Board, Sir William Gunn, will stand or fall on the recommendation that comes forward. At various public meetings the chairman has said that he is certain that when the final recommendations of the marketing committee are endorsed by the board and put to the conference, the majority of people in the wool industry will be satisfied that thc best recommendations for the future of thc industry have come forward. Clearly in this most important and contentious matter Sir William Gunn has laid his reputation on the line in the recommendations that arc likely to come forward in only two or three months' time. The honourable member for Darling also charged the Government with neglect in this matter. He said that it had done nothing to try to formulate a marketing scheme to take some of the vagaries out of the auction system. The honourable member must have a fairly short memory, because a former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, as the portfolio was then called, introduced a floor-price scheme at the request of wool-growers organizations. Having received the assurances of the two major wool-growers' organizations at that time that they both supported the scheme, and having argued before the purchasing countries that the Australian growers wanted the scheme because it would provide a fair wav to sell the Australia wool clip, he illogical for the honourable member for returned to Australia to find that at a Darling to argue that this Government referendum the scheme was rejected by the has shown neglect in these matters. It has wool-growers at the rate of four votes to shown a much greater concern for the wellone. I know quite well that circumstances have honourable member for Lalor who, by the changed since 1951 or 1952, when those amendment that he has moved, has shown events occurred; but that does not mean a partisan approach which ignores tbe that the forces who would oppose any wishes of the industry and seeks only to alteration of the marketing scheme would further divide the industry at a time when not still be ready to use any difference of it should be united. opinion that might exist in the wool industry. That is why I say that it is important not require a great deal of debate. In not only for politicians but also for the effect, what this Parliament is doing is only industry as a whole to wait with patience, giving effect to the decisions of the if they can, for the recommendation of the Government which were announced last marketing committee and for the endorseOctober, which were repeated in the policy ment that is expected to come from the speech of the Government and which Australian Wool Industry Conference. Not surely were endorsed by the Australian only in the political world but also in the primary-producing world referendums are difficult to carry. If one of the major organizations, or a political party, or any major important group were blatantly and openly opposed to a recommendation for change, if one were submitted, it would be difficult for that recommendation to be carried al a referendum. The organization which has been established by the Government at the request of the wool-growers' organizations, and the procedures that have been laid down, give a much better chance of achieving unanimity of purpose in this matter than have any other procedures that have been envisaged over past years. If changes in the marketing sj'stem arc introduced-as , quite frankly, I believe they will be-muc h of the credit for those changes will be due to the organization which has been established at the request of the wool-growers' organizations; but credit will also be due to the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) for his prompting, his patience and his undoubted hard work in bringing the organizations to the stage of being able to agree on a single overall organization for themselves, lf this problem of marketing is solved, as I hope it will be, by the Australian Wool Industry Conference, the marketing committee and the Australian Wool Board, it should not be forgotten that much of the credit will be due to the Minister. Therefore, 1 believe that it is quite being of the wool industry than has any member of the Opposition, particularly the I would have thought that this bill would people in the election that was held in November last year. The Government's decision of last October to subsidize wool promotion was endorsed, in effeot, by the Australian Wool Industry Conference in January of this year by 40 votes to 10. As the Minister pointed out in his second reading speech, in that conference there are 50 wool-growers and an independent chairman, and 40 of the 50 wool-growers voted for the present proposals, voted in support of the subsidy that the Government has said it is prepared to give, and voted in support of the change in the basis of collection of the levy from so much a bale to a percentage of the wool-grower's overall wool cheque. For reasons that have been given, it is clear that the new basis is a much fairer means of collecting the levy than the old basis of so much-10s. , 15s. or £1 a bale. This proposal has been endorsed not only by the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the organizations which are constituent parts of it but also by the Australian Primary Producers Union, which is outside the conference but which has an application for membership before the conference at the present time. The A.P.P.U. has shown a responsibility, a foresight and an initiative in wool industry affairs which should have been recognized long before this by the other two organizations. I hope that when its application finally is considered by the conference in June or July of this year its position in the industry will be properly recognized. Some statements by the Minister, in which he said responsible-decide d that it would approach that he expected that the A.P.P.U. would receive recognition, should be taken note of in this regard. As I said in another debate, if the. Australia if our partners in the International tralian Wool Industry Conference does not recognize the A.P.P.U., this Parliament cannot renounce its responsibility in a matter which concerns justice as between industry organizations and as between individual producers in a particular industry. The Governmem has done and is doing everything it possibly can do to try to persuade these individual organizations to solve their own problems by negotiation between themselves. Surely that is the best approach, if it can be achieved. Jf it cannot be achieved, the organizations that already are represented on the Australian Wool Industry Conference should not deceive themselves by thinking that the Government or this Parliament will let the matter rest if they say "" No"" to the A.P.P.U.'s application for membership of the conference. I hope that no one in this Parliament or outside it will suggest that that is in any way a threat to the organizations represented on the conference, because it is not meant to be such. It is meant to be a statement of political realities. In seeking basic justice as between the organizations concerned, these are matters which the Parliament cannot ignore. It might be pertinent to recall the original decision of the Australian Wool Board to approach the Australian wool-growers, seeking £11,000,000 from them as Australia's share of a total budget of between £16,000,000 and £17,000,000 for wool promotion throughout the world. Shortly after the Australian Wool Board made its approach to the Australian wool-growers, the shares of New Zealand and South Africa were endorsed by the respective organizations in those countries. That left it up to Australia to decide whether or not the new plans for wool promotion would be accepted. It became clear in the very early stages of the campaign conducted by Sir William Gunn that the plans of the Australian Wool Board would not be accepted as conditions were at that time. For that reason, the Australian Wool Industry Conference^-no t the Australian Wool Board which put forward the plans, but the conference to which the board ultimately is the Government to see what support the Government would give. Quite clearly, it would have been very embarrassing for AusWool Secretariat accepted their obligations and Australia did not accept its obligations. Obviously, that was one of the reasons why the Government felt that it was able to come forward with a proposal which will result in £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 of the taxpayers' money being made available for wool promotion. In my opinion, the two most important factors which moved the Government to support the request of the Australian Wool Industry Conference were, first, the importance of wool to Australia and the predominant part that wool plays in earning overseas funds and keeping alive tbe prosperity of our rural industries; and secondly, recognition of the very real challenge of synthetics and the necessity, for Australia's sake, for the wool industry to do something about that challenge. For those reasons the Government came to the decision which ' has resulted in the legislation that is now before the House and in a subsidy of between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 going to the Australian Wool Board for the pur, poses of wool promotion. As I pointed out, under the terms of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lalor, that subsidy would not be available to the wool industry. Thus, from the terms of his proposed amendment the inference is quite clear that, in spite of the of synthetics will be spending much more request of the Australian Wool Board and the decisions of the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the wool industry organizations, he is opposing the Government's decision to subsidize wool promotion. This is a quite incomprehensible decision for some one who, on behalf of his pany in previous times, has come forth offering to subsidize wool promotion, knowing full well that there was no possibility of his putting such plans into effect because there was no possibility of his ever being on the treasury bench again. I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman's record as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in a previous government and his activities in relation to the wheat industry are facts which the primary producers of Australia had in mind at the last election as well as at others. The honornational Wool Secretariat is to create a able member has shown quite clearly, by this proposed amendment and in other ways, that he is prepared to substitute his own political judgment for the considered judgment of the industries concerned. He is prepared to brush aside the federal organizations of the industries and to tell them that they know nothing about their own business. In other words, he is prepared to say to them: "" No matter what you want for your industry, you know nothing about it. I , the honourable member for Lalor, shall decide what shall be done."" This is one attitude that we on this side of the House, and others who do not agree with the Opposition's views, do not like; though at least we can regard it as honourable of the houorable member that he maintains this attitude with fervour in the years that he has had and will have in opposition. The questions have been asked: Why is promotion necessary? Why must we spend as much money as we do on promotion? 1 admit that it is not possible to define in precise terms or by some mathematical formula the benefits that we receive from promotion. It would never be possible to say precisely what price we would get for this product if its sale were not promoted; but in these days, when we know that the manufacturers of fibres that compete with wool are spending vast sums of money on promotion, it is surely only reasonable to expect that wool must at least try to stay in the race. Even with the additional funds that are to be available, the manufacturers on promotion than will the wool industry. I think vve can take it for granted that if two products of equal value and equal quality are put on the market, and one is well promoted and the other is badly promoted, the one that is well promoted and well advertised may out-sell the other and drive it off the market. This is very much the position as between wool and synthetics. If we do not enter this field vigorously and energetically, if we do not, as the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) said, create a quality image for wool so that we break the price relationship between wool and these cheaper and lower-quality synthetics, we will find the wool industry in great danger in the years ahead. One of the great objectives of the Interquality image for wool, to lease a trade mark to various manufacturers who produce goods of a certain quality and calibre, so that when people see this trade mark they will know that they will be buying something of high quality, the genuine article. It is believed that it will be possible to persuade people to pay a premium price for a woollen garment which will be better than an equivalent garment made from synthetics. But this kind of image cannot be built up on a shoestring, and this is another reason for the bill now before us. I do not think it is always recognized or, if it is, I do not think due recognition is always given to the fact, that the prosperity of any industry, and of the wool industry in particular, depends upon four things. I shall mention them not in order of importance, because probably they are all equally important. One is promotion. Another is marketing. I am' one of the first to agree that promotion and marketing are complementary in many senses. Research is the third of the important factors and productivity-whic h involves efficiency in production-is the fourth. By this bill we are seeking to achieve something by promotion. We have been doing a great deal in the field of research through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and research committees have been established. I should like to see us doing more in the field of productivity and in trying to get the results of research to the farmers more quickly than has been the case, so that they will become more efficient in production. In accordance with the statement made by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) in his policy speech, discussions on these matters are now proceeding with the States. I should like to see our marketing system made more efficient. But because we are ready to do something now about one of the four factors that I have mentioned, does this mean that we must wait until we are ready to do something about every one of these four, which are of equal importance to the future of the wool industry before we can act? It is nonsense to suggest that. No matter how we sell wool, we cannot afford to overlook the advantages of better promotion. I have suggested, not in private but in public, quite radical marketing changes for the wool industry. If these changes are proved to be the best thing for the wool industry and for Australia. I would want to see them launched at a time of very vigorous demand for wool. Irrespective of whether you advocate a floor price scheme, an acquisition scheme or any other scheme, you should launch your plan when you have a firm, vigorous and keen demand for wool. Nothing would be more difficult than launching a marketing scheme, no matter of what, in a year like 1958, when Australian wool averaged only 48d. per lb. You would be left with the slow, laborious job of buildjust after the end of the war. This was ing up the price to what would be regarded in some senses as an economic level. But if you have a scheme ready to be implemented, a scheme that has been recommended and endorsed by the Australian Wool Industry Conference, you should introduce it at a time like the present, when the price and the demand are good and when it is much easier to continue that price as something of a recognized fact and something that is regarded as normal to the industry. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Lalor, who has an ardent desire to have one kind of marketing change introduced into this industry, opposes more vigorous promotion, which in itself would provide a greater opportunity for the successful introduction of the marketing changes that he wants. In the present circumstances the honourable member's attitude seems to me to be incomprehensible. I should like to make a few comments about the Australian Primary Producers Union. The marketing committee of the Australian Wool Board will be advancing its proposals to the conference in June or July of this year, and the conference will then come to a decision on them. At the same time another sub-committee of the conference will be making its decisions concerning the membership of the A.P.P.U. in the Australian Wool Industry Conference. It may well be that the marketing changes proposed by the marketing committee, and perhaps endorsed by the conference, will involve legislation by the States because of the restriction of the Commonwealth's powers. This would not be anything new. It is well known that the marketing authority of the Australian Wheat Board rests upon complementary legislation in all the States. It is well known also that the original, completely socialistic proposals put forward by the Labour Government in, I think, 1946, were postponed for a year or two because some of the States would not agree to the limitation on production which the original wheat stabilization proposals involved. Thus because of the necessity for complementary State legislation, some States found it possible to hold up the first stabilization proposals for the wheat industry, which wete suggested towards the end of the war or not so very important at that stage, because wheat marketing continued under powers that had been invoked under a different heading in the early days of the war. But in the wool industry we have an entirely different situation. There is no warconference "". It has shown that it recognizes time organization with any influence in these matters, and if marketing proposals that may be introduced depend u.pon State legislation in any field, then it is most important for the wool industry that the Australian Wool Industry Conference should be able to command the support of the various State governments. If the wool industry were united I would say without any hesitancy that there would be no trouble at all in getting the support of the various State governments. But if there are two organizations represented in the Australian Wool Industry Conference and there is one organization not represented, then the organization that is not in the conference now but which should be in it will have the power and the authority in certain States to hold up legislation in those States until that organization is admitted to the conference. It may well be that future events will inevitably follow this course. The results are in the hands of the Australian Wool Industry Conference, because it is within its province to grant appropriate shillings per bale. membership to the Australian Primary Producers Union. But if it does not do this and if it, at the same time, recommends marketing changes wbich are dependent upon complementary State legislation or upon the States handing over powers to some marketing authority, then quite clearly in one State at least, and, I believe, in more, the Australian Primary Producers Union will have the influence and the authority to prevent the appropriate State legislation being passed until the organization is admitted to membership of the conference. I would not blame this union for one moment if it adopted these tactics and used this power in certain States because it has shown a patience in this matter of representation which has not been exhibited by its rivals in the field. It has shown patience and reasonableness concerning the legislation which established the Australian Wool Board and defined the relationship between the conference and the board. If it had not been for the attitude adopted by the Australian Primary Producers Union the legislation could well have been defeated at that time in the Senate. If it had been defeated it would have resulted in injury to the wool industry as a whole. The union realized this and said, "" The legislation must not only in increasing sales of wool but also be passed even if we are left outside the a responsibility to the industry. Now it is up to the rest of the industry, and particularly the two organizations at present comprising the Australian Wool Industry Conference, also to show some responsibility to the industry as a whole. [9.3] -The Opposition does not oppose a more vigorous promotion scheme, as the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) suggested it does. Mr Malcolm Fraser -You are opposing it with your amendment. position clear I shall read again the amendment that we have proposedThat this House declines to give the bill a second reading as, in the absence of arrangements for a poll of wool-growers in relation to an orderly marketing plan, the proposals increase the contribution by the wool-grower for promotion purposes above a rate equivalent to ten shillings per bale and do not provide for a matching contribution by the Government at a rate equivalent lo ten The proposals in the Opposition's amendment are quite clear and do not in any way constitute a rejection of a more active promotion scheme. We are proposing lhat the Government should immediately match the 10s. a bale contribution by the wool-growers, which would double the amount available for promotion and that, before any further impost is loaded on the wool-growers, arrangements should be made for a poll to be conducted so that the growers can give their opinions on an orderly marketing plan. This is very different from what the honourable member for Wannon suggested was the attitude of the Opposition. Although the members of thc Opposition are not opposed to an extension of promotion activities, they are not in the state of mind of the honourable member for Wannon and some of his colleagues, who show themselves to be promotion crazy. They look at promotion and they fail to look at the other aspects of the problem. They have allowed themselves to be dazzled and conditioned by the immensely powerful advocacy of the provision of more money for promotion which has been presented by those whose business is promotion and who, of course, have an interest",55,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed

116,Mr Allan Fraser,"To make thein the business in which they are engaged, which is the business of promotion. This is a very expensive business indeed for those who have to pay the piper. In this connection let me give an example I think a very audacious example-by referring to the booklet entitled, "" Australian Wool Board-Report to Woolgiowers"" for 1963, which was published, of course, at the expense of the wool growers. The whole publication appears as a concentrated endeavour to persuade the wool-grower that he must provide far more money for promotion, lf you look at the list of those who, instead of attending lo the tasks that they should undertake in this field, devote themselves to writing articles to convince the wool-growers that they should provide more money for promotion, you will find that it includes, besides Sir William Gunn and that extraordinarily astute man, Mr William J. Vines, a great salesman and a great advocate for promotion, gentlemen holding rhe positions of Regional Director for Europe, Director for the United States of America, Director for Japan, Director of Market Development, Asian Region, Director of Research, Director of Product Development and Technical Service, Director of Economics and Director of Publicity. They have produced a concentration of arguments to sell to the wool-growers thc idea that they should put far more money into the coffers which contain the funds for promotion and out of which these gentlemen are paid. statement. it is an unjust statement. 1 accept the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr relationship of expenditure to net income Mackinnon) as a man of great knowledge on this subject, but he wili agree that each of these gentlemen has, as every one of us has, an interest in his own career. Thc honourable member will agree that they are not altruistic people philanthropicalfy devoting the whole of their time and energies to increasing sales of wool and the demand for wool throughout the world. They have also, obviously, as is the case with all of us, their own careers to serve. 1 think it is wrong that the wool-growers' money should have been used to prepare a report to wool-growers which consists entirely of articles by gentlemen in the category I have mentioned. That is why I say that those who have allowed themselves to be conditioned by these experts have become, as the honourable member for Wannon has shown himself to be, if I may so with great courtesy, quite promotion crazy. The honourable member's mind is filled with this suggested solution of the problems of the industry, almost to the exclusion of all others. He said, of course, that this task cannot be carried out on a shoe string, as though the amount at present provided was something infinitesimal and the amount to be provided under this bill entirely reasonable and not one which would not impose any hardship on the wool-growers. Well, that is not the case with wool-growers in the electorate I represent, and I doubt that it is the case with wool-growers in the electorate of Wannon.

I hope that the honourable member will look it up and repeat those sentiments to show that he is consistent and that he has not changed his attitude, because he said then that the amendment proposed by the Opposition for a matching grant represented an attempt to bribe the producers. He had already explained that it involved a contribution of £2,000,000 from the Commonwealth Government, and then he went on to say, and the logic was supported by his colleagues of the Country Party, that this £2,000,000 would not be provided by the Commonwealth Government as might appear, but would be a bribe provided with the producers' own money. He saidMost graziers pay pretty heavy taxes, and, as 1,192 sheep.

I certainly look forward to seeing the honourable member for Lawson rise in his place to-night to repeat tbose sentiments and to express, therefore, his objection to this bill. In the limited time that I have leftI should bave liked to speak on this measure much longerI want to reiterate the figures provided to the House this afternoon by the honourable member for Lalor.

I realize that facts of this kind, which involve giving a lot of figures, may take quite a bit of study.

146,Mr Hallett (Canning) [9.30],"Thc time. I believe that there is still scope forincreased sales to Japan, which is now the major buyer of our wool. I beheve that many other countries may profitably be explored as avenues for trade agreements in order to encourage exports of wool to their markets. In my opinion, there is a tremendous field open for the export of wool, provided that the necessary arrangements can be made. There is no doubt that the promotion of wool is necessary and important, but at the level of the end-user it will not solve the problems of the Australian wool-growers. Ample evidence is available from past experience to support this contention. Expenditure on promotion has varied over the years. In the past few years, £2,500,000 has been devoted to promotion. Outstanding fluctuations have occurred in returns to individual wool-growers and to Australia. Since 1950, when peak prices were obtained, fluctuations to the extent of many millions of pounds annually have occurred. Inter-fibre competition today is very real and must be faced. For example, wool consumption in the United States of America between 1949 and 1951 fell by over 140,000,000 lb a decline of about 21 per cent. Decreased consumption was the result of the substitution of other fibres tralia, and to some extent in the eastern for wool. Much is being said about the use of substitutes for wool and the competition from synethetic fibres. It cannot be ignored. It is obvious that the chemical world, through advances in scientific knowledge, can work wonders to-day. Following tbe decline in the consumption of wool in the United States, people who had turned to syntheticfibresreturned very strongly to wool because of its superior wearing qualities. The advantages of wool have been discovered in many parts of the world. A promotion campaign without a complete survey of the present system of placing our raw wool on the world's markets is quite unrealistic. Australian wool-growers need protection from the violent fluctuations in wool prices and returns. Our textile mills are also affected and should receive services of the highest standard. A tremendous amount of work has to be done. Visitors to Australia have criticized our poor classing. Press reports and general criticism have pointed thc finger at the wool-growers' classing. I do not believe that a case can be made against the growers. From experience I have had in this field, I believe that the main fault Is in the overseas presentation of our wool. Some work has been done in this respect and it is being undertaken to an ever increasing extent. We have found that wool has to be placed on the world's markets to the best advantape of both the Australian wool-growers and the purchasers. In the past we have relied upon sales in small lots-sometime s in large lots-o n the floor, with no pre-classing in lots. However, pre-classing is now undertaken with considerable advantage. In his second-reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) saidSome 95 per cent, of our wool is exported and the world demand for wool is therefore of crucial importance to Australia. It is essential that this demand should continue at a level which will return remunerative prices for the wool-grower and yield satisfactory export earnings. The prices obtained for wool are indeed important, not only to the industry but to every field of commerce in Australia. We have reached the position where wool prices have become more important than ever before. The great developmental works being undertaken mainly in Western AusStates, involve tremendous sums of money. Huge amounts of money are tied up in banks. We can imagine the situation that would arise if wool prices fell. I can imagine the concern not only of the wool growers, but also of the bankers, the merchants and everybody else. Even at present prices, Mr Speaker, there is not a great margin. I think the crux of the whole argument is the problem of how to provide reasonable protection for this very important industry. What is required to protect the wool industry and the Australian economy from the violent fluctuations in prices that have been the pattern of the wool industry? There is plenty of evidence of the violence of thesefluctuations.These bills that we are now debating are designed to step up the promotion of wool throughout the world, and I think that we should perhaps look for a moment at the results of promotion undertaken in the past. It is always difficult to judge the results of promotion. Indeed, I believe that it Is almost impossible. Let us see what has happened to world wool stocks since the war. At first July, 1945, they stood at 2,255,000,000 lb. weight. That is on a clean basis. At 1st July, 1963, they had fallen to an estimated 7J ,000,000 lb., on a clean basis. These figures indicate that although we have had this fluctuation in prices, which has been rather dramatic at times, the tendency has been to continue to sell not only the current clips of the world but also the rather large stockpile that had accumulated towards the end of the war. I would say that between 1945 and 1963 returns to retailers and manufacturers were reasonably stable. I am sure that any graphs or other information on this point would verify that statement. However, the situation with respect to returns to the growers has been very different. The growers seem to be the ones who suffer. When they suffer because of thesefluctuationsin prices, of course, the whole Australian economy suffers. Our expert advisers consider that this legislation will assist in preventing some of these fluctuations of wool prices. Sir William Gunn, Chairman of the Australian Wool Board, in bis campaign last year for approval of a promotion scheme, declared that if the board were voted additional funds it would raise by promotion the returns for woollen goods. In this way, he said, the returns to wool-growers would be increased because raw wool prices would rise. However, he said, it was important not to raise wool prices to too high a level, because there would then be greater danger from synthetics. Since Sir William made those statements, wool prices have risen substantially. So it is apparent that, even with the best of information, one does not know what will happen to wool prices. In the eight months ended in February, 1963, the average price per lb. was 58.2ld. In the eight months ended in February, 1964, the average was 71.84d. The rise in twelve months was quite substantial. Sir William Gunn said, during his promotion campaign, that we should not raise the price of wool too rapidly or too high because of the danger from synthetics. Tn other words, he warned against the danger of overpricing wool. All the available evidence and experience over the years indicate that under our present system there is little or no relation between the price of raw wool and the price of the finished article. The reason for this is somewhat of a mystery, but this is a fact. When the price of wool falls, the price of the finished article remains almost stable. If the price of wool rises-particularl y if it rises dramatically as it did in 1950-the whole economy feels the effects and all prices rise very rapidly. But there is little direct relation between the price of raw wool and the price of thefinishedarticle. Promotion has a place in the wool industry-indeed , an important place. Since we sell 95 per cent, of our wool overseas, we must keep abreast of the times, and especially of modern developments in the northern hemisphere. We must keep up our promotion efforts. I believe that this is the first time in Australian history, as I mentioned before, that the taxpayer has been called on to invest in wool promotion. No doubt, the taxpayer will look for returns, because he also is vitally interested in the wool industry, regardless of the industry in which he himself is directly engaged. The promotion of wool simply at the level of the end-user is not the total solution to the problems of the growers, and the growers' problems are the problems of Australia as a whole. The responsibility of the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the Australian Wool Board is to produce complete machinery that will protect the wool growers and the Australian economy. We know that the recently established conference and the newly constituted board have this responsibility, and I understand that they are now examining the woolmarketing situation. I believe that this is all important, because research, promotion and marketing must be linked. 1 think that we have a responsibility to the overseas buyers of wool, for instance, and that we must market our wool to the best advantage of all concerned. I am sure that we have not been doing this in the past, and I believe that there is room for improvement. Exactly what measures should be taken nobody yet knows. Experience throughout the world in promoting and selling raw materials indicates that most industries that are producers of raw materials have more stable markets than our wool industry has. I do not care which product one considers. This applies to oil, steel, superphosphates, cement and all the other important raw materials marketed throughout the world, including wheat. Only in the last few years, however, has our great wheat industry been assured of stable prices. Over the last fifteen years, the average sions as to where I stand, let me inform him price of wool has varied considerably. In that I support the amendment moved by 1950-51, it was 144.19d. per lb. From the honourable member for Lalor Mr 1951 to 1958 it fluctuated between 61d. and Pollard). As honourable members know, I 82d. per lb. In 1958-59, it fell to 48.6d. per seconded the motion. lb.

147,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [9.52],"Ia lb. in the price of wool means a loss of £7,000,000 to the community. I would like to make a few observations about wool production. Australia's sheep population is about 16 per cent, of the total world sheep population. Australia produces about 37 per cent, of the world's apparel wool, 53 per cent, of the world's merino wool and 43 per cent, of the world's trade in wool. Australia consumes 5 per cent, of its total wool production and 3 i per cent, is exported in semi or fully manufactured condition. We export 95 per cent, of our wool and in the last financial year this brought us £407,000,000. These facts show how vital the wool industry is to Australia's economic welfare. The Minister said that in 1962-63 the wool industry provided 38 per cent, of our total merchandise exports. The expansion of Australia's economy in recent times has meant a terrific demand for more imports of such items as petrol, oil and machinery and even know-how. It is to thc wool industry that we look for a large increase in our export income, and promotion is essential in a ^ery highly competitive world. This was recognized by the wool-growers themselves when they agreed to increase the levy. Promotion is the handmaiden of marketing. We all know that there is room for some countries to increase their use of wool. We know full well that there are great opportunities in Asia, for instance. Japan has displaced the United Kingdom as our best customer for wool and Japan consumes internally 90 per cent, of the wool she purchases. Only 10 per cent, is re-exported in manufactured condition. It is true, as the Minister observed, that potential threat to Australia's wool industrv. in recent years a challenge has been thrown The quality of Russian wool is poor comout to the wool industry by synthetics. pared with Australian wool.

Over the years F.3907/64 R [53] such as elasticity. I will not go through all the qualities of wool. However, synthetics may maintain their price margin and still sell, even when the world market for man-madefibresis saturated. We of the Opposition are conscious of the effect on the economy of this nation of a serious fall in our income from wool. That is why we believe in wool promotion. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred to statements made by the Australian Labour Party about wool promotion during the last election campaign. Of course we advocated promotion on the stump in 1963. But we advocated it on the basis that there should be another approach that would enable the wool-grower to get a little bit of justice and a better price for his product. The wool-grower should not be left at the mercy of the open auction: he should have the benefit of a reserve price system. We know that time is short and that the International Wool Secretariat wants £16,250,000 for wool promotion. These bills will have the effect of providing £11,000,000 of that sum. The improvement in living standards throughout the world will have a good effect in opening up markets that did not previously exist anc! in expanding existing markets. The ever increasing demand in Japan for our wool indicates the extent to which living standards in that country have improved. Many countries which to-day use cotton will, as their living standards improve, turn to wool. This will apply particularly to Asiatic countries. Russia's wool production, from about 160.000,000 sheep, is about 50 per cent, of Australia's present production, but it is a I turn now to wool prices and their effect we have seen the price obtained for a particular quality wool vary from' sale to sale and even at the same sale. From this experience, it is obvious that some growers are not getting as much for their wool as they should. The variations in prices have been far too frequent. It is anomalous in these days of monopoly capitalism to see variations that cannot be explained. This is one of the reasons wby the Opposition insists on an orderly marketing plan to be associated with the wool promotion drive. It is true that wool prices may be affected by world conditions but a grower-controlled and government-supported marketing plan can, in association with a wool promotion plan, meet any difficulties that may aiise with a greater degree of justice to growers than does to-day's catch-as-catch-can method. To indicate how essential an orderly marketing plan, coupled with a wool promotion plan, is, 1 point out to the House that in the seventeen months from May, 1957, to October, 1958, the price of wool fell by 46 per cent. In the seventeen months from January, 1954, to November, 1955, the price of wool fell by 30 per cent. How can promotion alone offset such falls? The price variations in the twenty years prior to the Second World War are interesting. In 1922-23 the price of wool was 46 per cent, higher than in the previous year. In 1923-24 it was 30 per cent, higher than in 1922-23. In 1924-25 it was 14 per cent, higher than in 1923-24. There was no threat from synthetics at that time. The world was pasing through a period of prosperity. In 1925-26 the price of wool fell by 36 per cent. Over the next two years the price of wool rose slightly. In 1928-29 there was a drop of 16 per cent, in the price of wool. In 1929-30 the price fell by 37 per cent, and in 1930-31 it fell by a further 18 per cent. The greatest rise in price was 82 per cent, in 1933-34, following the depression. The greatest fall in price was 38 per cent, in 1934-35. Surely the law of supply and demand was not responsible for creating a fall in price of 82 per cent, in one year and a rise of 38 per cent. In the next. Those factors must have indicated to the people of Australia, let alone the wool growers, that it was aboul time the government of the day looked into the marketing of wool. Is it any wonder that something should be done? We do not want to return to those starvation conditions. We do not want to see our local industry impoverished and the living standards of our people lowered. We do not want to see the wool-growers held to ransom as they were in 1933-34 when the price obtained for their product fell by 82 per cent. Good Lord, you talk about business people budgeting for the future. How can a grazier or anybody else budget for the future when the price he obtains for his products can fall by 82 per cent, in one year? It is true that Australia's annual wool clip has been cleared. But with a predetermined reserve floor price clearances would be just as good as they were in the days of the Joint Organization and at the right price-no t at the price determined by some buyers who are most likely mixed up in pies. I do not want to get on to lhat subject, Mr Deputy Speaker, because il is outside the ambit of the legislation. If there were a fixed floor price there would be no question that the grower would get a fair price for his product Floor price plans operate satisfactorily in South Africa and New Zealand. Australia is to join with South Africa and New Zealand in spending the £16,250,000 that is required for wool promotion. What is good enough for South Africa and New Zealand growers surely should be examined in this country so that Australian wool-growers may have an opportunity to say whether they want a reserve floor plan. The Division of Agricultural Economics established by the Chifley Labour Government can supply all of the necessary information required to determine floor prices. The amount spent on wool promotion is admittedly small compared with the amount spent by producers of man-made fibres. There is no doubt that the promotion of wool will be a very costly business. That is why the chairman of the Australian Wooi Board asked growers to agree to a levy of 44s. a bale instead of the 10s. a bale they now pay. Honourable members will recall the campaign conducted last year to increase the levy. I am sure the honourable member for Wannon will remember it because the campaign was opened in his electorate and there was an incident associated with the opening. The Opposition says, in effect, that the levy should remain at 10s. a bale but that the Government should subsidize the growers' contributions on a f l for £1 basis until such time as a poll is taken of the growers to see whether they want an orderly marketing scheme. The need to establish an orderly marketing scheme has been brought home forcibly by two statements that were made recently. As reported in the Melbourne "" Age"" of 6th October last, Mr K. C. Clarke of the Japanese branch of the International Wool Secretariat said that Japan wanted Australian growers to receive better prices in order to encourage higher production. Mr Clarke stated that this fact was conveyed to him by representatives of Japanese wool textile manufacturers. On 3rd February, 1963, the Melbourne ""Age"" reported from Osaka, Japan, thatThe Japanese Woolspinners Association is considering a plan to curb the current trend of raw wool import prices. Surely that ought to indicate the Japanese line of thought and also the need for the Government to consider the establishment of a floor price scheme for wool. If such a scheme is not implemented, before we know where we are the position will be detrimental to the best interests of the wool-producers. During February of 1961, Sir William Gunn, as the chairman of the now defunct Australian Wool Bureau, campaigned for a promotion levy commencing at 10s. a bale in 1961-62 and rising to £1 a bale in 1966-67. But last year, as chairman of the new Australian Wool Board, he launched a campaign for a levy of 44s. a bale. That proposal met very strong resistance from the growers. Then, on the eve of the last election, this Government agreed to a proposal which meant a grower contribution of 27s. a bale and a government subsidy of 17s. a bale. The wool-growers were very fortunate that the election was coming up. In the election campaign the Labour Party pledged that under a Labour government the levy would remain at 10s. a bale until a poll of wool-growers on a reserve-priceauction plan was taken, and that if the wool growers approved of that plan the Labour government would review the levy and subsidize the growers' contribution on a £1for-£l basis. In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lalor, I say that the Opposition wants a vigorous promotion plan and a plan of orderly marketing at a price that is fair and just to the growers. The Opposition believes that the promotion scheme should be financed on the basis of the growers' contribution being subsidized on a £l-for-£l basis. It gives me great pleasure to support the amendment. I rise to support the bills and to oppose the amendment. The wool industry has been very fortunate in having a government as benevolent as this Government and a Minister who has been prepared to look at the needs of the industry and to agree to the Government making the contributions proposed in the measures that we are considering to-night. The Government has agreed to support the promotion plans which Sir William Gunn submitted to the wool growers of Australia on behalf of the Australian Wool Board and the International Wool Secretariat. The plans of the Australian Wool Board have come under considerable criticism, as I understand it, by members of the Opposition in the debate to-night. They say that two years ago, when Sir William made his previous request for additional funds for wool promotion, he should have declared his hand and stated explicitly that the amount of money he required over the next few years was not necessarily determined at that stage. There is no doubt that, if the Australian Wool Bureau had not been re-constituted as the Australian Wool Board and if Mr Vines had not been appointed as managing director of the International Wool Secretariat, the estimates that were given originally might not have been so far from the mark. But if we look at the results that were achieved as a result of the previous increase in expenditure on wool promotion and also at the rises that have occurred in the price of wool in the last three years, there can be no doubt that, whilst it is difficult to correlate exactly the increases in prices and expenditure on promotion, we in the wool industry are far better off to-day than we were two years ago when the first increase was announced. One of the difficulties in regard to wool is that the wool-growers are very dependent",69,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed
148,Mr Sinclair (New England) [10.12].,"on receiving an adequate price for wool and lhat Australians, as a nation, ace even more dependent on continuing to receive a fair price for wool. In the past, unfortunately, every time there has been a fall in wool prices there has also been a considerable fall in Australia's export income. Those falls have resulted in considerably adverse effects in other sections of the Australian community. Not only have the people in rural areas, including the wool-growers, been is meant by wool and a new vision of wool affected, but every man and woman in Australia has suffered. I believe that the Government, at this stage-no w that Mr Vines has come into the newly created International Wool Secretariat, now that we have a re-organized Australian Wool Board, and now that new plans for the expenditure of promotion funds have been put forward -seein g the advantages that have accrued to Australia from promotion in the past, is confident that the new plans for promotion will meet with success equal to, and possibly even greater than, that of past promotion. In particular, we as Australians should look at the project as it is envisaged by the International Wool Secretariat. The secretariat has the concept of advertising wool as a quality article. That is the reason why wool-growers have agreed to contribute additional funds and the reason why we are now considering these measures which provide government assistance. This new plan for promotion envisages the establishment in the consumer's eye of the vision of a product that is a little different from the product that has been promoted in the past. Those honourable members who heard the members of the Wool Board team wbo went out on the hustings, as it were, to promote the new levy, heard those men say that what they are after is not a Rolls Royce concept of the manufactured woollen article, or a concept of something in the cheaper motor vehicle class. They are aiming at a concept of something in the middle price range, in the Humber or Rover category. In order to bring about this completely radical view of wool by tbe wool industry and the consumers, it is necessary to undertake a very extensive advertising campaign. 1 have no doubt, in spite of all that bas been said about the managing director of the International Wool Secretariat, that he is a very competent advertising man and a very competent salesman. I have no doubt that this budget, for the expenditure by the International Wool Secretariat of £16,250,000 in each of the next five years, has been well and truly calculated to encompass the project of establishing in thc consumer's eye a new vision of what as a quality article. In view of all of that, we realize that we must do something. After the project had been put to the wool-growers, it was put to the Government. I believe that the Government, by coming into this matter at this stage, has shown its sense of responsibility not only to the wool-growers but also to every man and woman in Australia. The only way that I can see to keep our nation solvent is to continue to receive big cheques, particularly for wool, which, as the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) said in his second-reading speech, has accounted for not less than 30 per cent, of our total export income in each year, except one, in the last half century. It is absolutely essential that we continue, in this changing day ancl age when synthetics and other products are entering in'o competition with our product, to endeavour to promote our product and to persuade people to buy more of it. One of the big problems that beset the wool-growers is that conditions are changing continually. In the debute to-night .mention has been made of criticisms by Japanese wool-buyers of the classing of Australian wool clips. If we are to continue selling our wool we must ensure that it is saleable on world markets. It is no use overseas buyers coming to Australia and saying, "" We want you to class your clip but we are not prepared to pay you anything additional for doing so '. Tbat is one of the problems that confronted us in the past. Although overseas wool buyers have been critical of our classing, at any rate for the last twelve months, they have not been prepared to pay a premium for better-classed wool when they attend our sales. It is all very well for the wool manufacturers also to tell us that if we class our wool belter and present it more attractively they will be prepared to pay more for it, but it is useless for them to say that unless they in fact do pay more. One of our problems in relation to the subsidy scheme is that if we are to promote wool as a quality article we must ensure that the manufacturers will get suffitogether or-thi s is the way we hope it will cient return for their end product to be able to afford to pay the premium for the improved classing. This is one of the benefits that will flow from the additional amount being spent on promotion. If we go to the extent of classing our clip better than we have been doing, it is essential that we be paid a little more for doing so. The proposal now before us is one of the few ways by which this objective will be achieved. Another aspect that I want to mention is that in the Australian Wool Industry Conference we have seen two of the major primary producing organizations getting together and beginning to resolve some of the difficulties with which, unfortunately, our primary industries seem to have been beset in recent times. It has been mentioned that one organization has been left out of the conference. WhilstI appreciate that very weighty arguments have been advanced for further consideration of the Australian Primary Producers Union as a possible member of the conference, I submit that to date the federal organizations of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council have got together more closely through the medium of the conference than at any previous stage in their history, and there appear to be good prospects of these organizations continuing to work together for the benefit of the industry. I am not too sure that if we bring in another organization, whatever its merits, that might not disrupt some of the harmony that is apparent at present. By the organizations working together at the top level there is a greater opportunity for unanimity of thought and action in our primary producer organizations. It is on this basis that there is possibly a case for the admission of the A.P.P.U. However, one of the problems associated with this is the number of numbers that the A.P.P.U. will have on the conference. Will it have 25 members as the other federal organizations have, or will it have a smaller number? In any event, will the representatives of the A.P.P.U. vote as a bloc? If they do, they will be able to determine the result of a vote if the other two organizations vote be-the y will come to this top level conference prepared to forget their organizational associations. Instead of being representatives only of their particular industry organizations they will be representatives of primary producers as such and so will be able to bring about a greater degree of unanimity among the industry representatives than we have ever known. This is the peculiar difficulty that besets the sub-committee of the conference that is presently considering A.P.P.U. representation. This is not an easy problem to resolve. If the A.P.P.U. is admitted it is difficult to see at this stage how the conference will function. I feel that a great deal could be lost if the A.P.P.U. were admitted and, instead of the harmony which has been so apparent to date, we find a wedge driven between the two bodies presently on the conference. This would be a great pity. However, there must be a greater degree of unanimity in thc future between primary producer organizations, particularly in such a major industry as the wool industry which after all is the backbone of the whole Australian economy. The Opposition's proposal, which in fact was submitted to the electors as part of Labour's policy not so many months ago, once again indicates that its members are not prepared to face reality. They suggest that before we proceed with promotion we should accept their proposal that a ballot of wool-growers be conducted on an orderly marketing plan. In the first place, we have no description of the Opposition's orderly marketing plan other than the implications of the statement that the Joint Organization was highly successful, which I do not deny, and that we should reintroduce the Joint Organization scheme. Not only have conditions changed materially since the Joint Organization went out of existence, but also the funds which stood to its credit have been -ver y rightly so-returne d to the wool growers. This means that a very considerable sum of money will need to be raised if anything similar to the Joint Organization is established. The Opposition shows no concern about that aspect. In fact, in the proposal before us there is no mention even of anything similar to thc Joint Organization, l f we accepted this proposal we would be accepting an orderly marketing plan. This surely would be taking out of tbe hands of the producers one of the tasks for which wii re-organized the Australian Wool Board. I am confident that the present committee of the wool board which is investigating wool marketing is far more competent thaD is any government body to formulate a plan which will be acceptable to at least most members of the wool industry. This is such a controversial topic that unless vii have a body which is representative of primarv producers; which is representative of wool growers; which is considering this .natter in. bale of wool from the Lyndhurst property, at least to some extent, an independent way: which is endeavouring to see tbe merits of the position from the point of view of both the sellers and the buyers, not only would it be rejected by the wool-growers in a referendum but in fact it would not necessarily be to the advantage either of the wool-growers or of the Australian ci mmunity as a whole. It seems to me that as we have a subcommittee of the Wool Board investigating this very proposal, and as this committee has stated that it expects within the next few months to bring down its findings on this issue, it would be extremely frivolous of this House to consider such an amendmem as has been presented to us to-night. As to a promotion scheme, I believe that this is something which every wool-grower must have considered. 1 know that there are arguments on thc one hand for some form of acquisition and appraisement. I know that strong arguments have been put forward, not only by members of the Australian Labour Party but also by many leading representatives of thc wool industry. In fact I have an idea that the present chairman of the Wool Board was one of the advocates, at the time of the disbandment of the Joint Organization scheme, of some continuation of the scheme. This is a most controversial topic with primary producers themselves. Supporters of various wool sales schemes have been keenly advocating their own ideas, and it would be very dangerous for this or any other responsible government to decide arbitrarily to implement a particular scheme or even to submit a particular plan to the wool-growers without some kind of prior rational consideration of possible alternatives. Unless we have some independent body, such as this existing Wool Board sub-committee, to consider all aspects of these suggested measures, we certainly will not achieve any degree of unanimity amongst wool-growers themselves. Let me take a brief look at some of the aspects of this bill. I refer, first, to the change from the basis of so much per bale to the percentage basis in imposing thc levy. There is no doubt that thc wool producing community is very happy about this change. I come from an area where a good deal of superfine wool is produced. A near Armidale, recently brought the highest price ever recorded on the auction floor for a bale of wool. If you grow these superfine wools you must be prepared to contribute a little more than a man who submits just a bale of crutchings. You know that if you submit a good article for sale, and you promote it, you will gel more for it. Honourable members will have noticed from newspaper reports that the purchaser of this high-priced wool is not going to put it through the manufacturing process immediately; he will display the fleeces in this bale, because thcy are magnificent fleeces and any grower would be extremely proud to have produced them. This will be an advertisement not only for thc wool growers but also for wool itself and, of course, for the manufacturer as well. Every alert and active primary producer must of necessity be also an active businessman and, as such, be interested in promoting his product. For this reason I suggest that the producers of superfine wool in our community-and certainly in my electoratewill be only too happy to contribute slightly more on the percentage basis in order to promote the better article. It is only right that they should do so. The people who grow only a few bales of wool, almost as a by-product of their fat Ir.mb raising, should not be charged on thc same basis as those who produce superfine wools. I am very pleased that the Government has been able to arrive at a formula acceptable to the industry. I believe it is a very happy event that we have been able to establish some form of percentage calculation which does not bear heavily on any one section of the community but rather favours the proposition that if you have a quality article you pay a little more to produce it and a little more for promotion, and then get more advantage from the promotion, a higher price for your product and a more assured spot in the world market for your quality article. As I said earlier, we have heard a great deal of criticism of the standards of classing of our wool clip. The implementation of this proposal to impose the levy on a percentage basis will help to ensure better woolclassing. If honourable members have followed my tortuous argument they will appreciate my proposition that if you pay a little more 'for your promotion you will get a little more for your product, and I believe that this is a worth-while objective. Finally, let me say that I support the whole concept of wool promotion. I believe that members of the Opposition who have said that there should be no increase in promotion activities without an orderly marketing plan are not being realistic. The needs of the wool industry are quite acute. We must continue to look for a high price for our wool if we are to continue to develop our wool-producing areas. The development of Australia is of major concern to us all. As many honourable members are no doubt aware, there is an increasing trend to-day towards a capital-intensive agricultural economy and away from a labour-intensive agricultural economy. This trend was referred to by the Stanford Research Institute in the report that members of the Opposition have been so ready to quote in this House. This is a trend which, unfortunately, many members of the grazing community have not been fully aware of, but which we must increasingly consider. Unless we are going to get a greater return for our products and more money as income from the sale of our wool we will not be able to develop our country. Some mention has been made in the House during the last few days of the shortage of superphosphate. I feel sure that one of the reasons for this shortage is that wool cheques have been larger in the last twelve months, and one of the ways in which primary producers have been using the extra money is spending it on their farms-in other words, helping to develop their country-so that they can grow and sell more wool. This brings us back to the very reason why we have a change in the method of imposing this levy. The only way that I can see for us to continue to increase our farm income and get greater returns for greater output is by introducing this kind of scheme. Unless we get more for the increased effort and increased capital we put into our grazing areas we will not be able to continue to expand our production. With a world shortage of wool, it is essential, of course, for us to expand our production if we are to continue to benefit from the demand for more textiles, and if we are going to continue to hold our proportion of the fibre market. I feel that by these bills the Government is actively assisting in many ways the development of the country and at the same time is actively assisting in meeting the criticism of the Japanese manufacturing interests. The Government is to be complimented on the measures that it has submitted. I think that the members of thc grazing community and the wool-growing industry generally have been extremely well served. Primary Industry) [10.41] -in reply-the bill has been canvassed fairly thoroughly. The progressive plan with which it deals is but another important step taken by the Government lo cater for the wool industry. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) made what I thought were slighting references to the Wool Marketing Committee of Enquiry. I do not propose to quote his exact words, but he suggested that that committee did not submit any substantial proposal. I draw his attention to the committee's report. I think it was a very good one. Rather than submit an immature marketing scheme, the committee suggested that the first essential was the setting up of a central organization to speak, work and plan for the industry. That organization has been established. In addition, comprehensive legislation has been passed, establishing the Australian Wool Board and containing a provision that a wool marketing committee shall be appointed. I think the Opposition is very short sighted in its approach to this matter. The",72,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed
149,Mr Adermann (Fisher,"Minister foramendment that has been proposed amounts to a proposal that the bill be rejected. It can mean nothing else, because the operative words of the amendment are, ""This House declines to give the bill a second reading"". Although it is embellished with other words, those are the operative words of the amendment. This Government is committed to the proposals contained in the bills. The amendment proposed is directly contrary to the plan which has been considered at many conferences and is now substantially endorsed by the Australian industry. It has also been endorsed by South Africa and New Zealand, both of which countries are our joint partners in the International Wool Secretariat. Honourable menibers opposite would have us balicve that levies for the purposes of wool promotion are, in effect, tax collections for which there is no recompense. Promotion, effectively implemented, must improve returns. This matter has been considered fully by the growers. It has been canvassed by them and openly explained to them at meeting after meeting over a period of six months. With the knowledge that it has before it, the industry has substantially endorsed the proposal that it shall pay more for promotion. What matters is not only what you pay by way of a levy but also the return to be gained from expenditure on promotion. No one will argue lhat if you spend £1.000.000 on promotion there will be no return from that expenditure. All the pros and cons must be weighed one against thc other, and what counts is the result to be expected. If we look back to last year and thc year before we see that, although all the wool that we produced was sold, the price was unsatisfactory. The pertinent factor to consider is the result of the promotion that has been undertaken, and already we have seen a good result. Because of this progressive approach to the industry, prices have been much better this year. No matter how much the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) may apologize for the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Lalor, the fact is that its operaDevine, I . . T. tive words are, "" This House declines to give the bill a second reading"". fn other words, it is in direct opposition to the Government's proposal to contribute approximately £4,250,000 a year to help our economy and to improve our export position by helping this big industry. Therefore, we say that the Opposition is very short sighted in its approach. 1 repeat that, in effect, the Opposition is rejecting the considered opinion of the industry itself. I now leave the matter to the House. Question putThat the words proposed to be omitted ( Mr. Pollard's amendment) stand part of the question. Thc House divided. ( Mr Deputy SpeakerMr E. N. Drury.)

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In committee: The bill. direct the attention of the committee to the fact that the bill contains six clauses which are comprehensive and refer to Wool Tax Acts (No. 1), (No. 2) and so on. By clause 5 it is proposed to amend section 33 of tbe principal act to empower the Australian Wool Board to borrow money for temporary purposes on overdraft from an approved bank. I am not sure what borrowing powers if any, were conferred upon thc board under the previous act. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Adermann) may be able to enlighten me on that. I have read the report of the newly constituted Australian Wool Board for the two or three months that it has been in operation. In the section of the report relating to finance I noticed an item which showed that the board had paid a substantial sum of money in advance to the International Wool Secretariat. I do not remember seeing an item of that character in reports of the board as it was previously constituted. It appeared to me, from reading this item in the report, that this amount had been acquired for payment to the International Wool Secretariat in anticipation of the passage of this measure, the imposition of an additional levy and the collection of the sudsidy which will accompany the levy. In those circumstances a sum of money, which appeared to me to be in the vicinity of £500,000, was paid in advance. IfI am correct in that assumption it would appear that the borrowing power whicb it is proposed to give the board is to cover moneys borrowed on overdraft during thc period until the increased moneys will begin flowing to thc board. I hope that I am wrong in that assumption. If that sort of thing Calwell. A. A. has been done 1 think it is very wrong Brvant, G. M. indeed. That action may have been proSexton, J. C. L. voked by the type of expenditure incurred Benson, S. J. by the board when campaigning for an Barnard, L. H. increased levy. At that time the board brought to Australia from all parts of the world prominent members of the staff of t .e ! International Wool Secretariat. That was a pretty expensive sort of business. One prominent member of the International Wool Secretariat visited Bendigo, the centre of a very important wool-growing area. Whilst there he apparently made a statement to the press. I realize that the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) has already referred to this matter. The member of the secretariat was reported in the press as having saidThe demand for wool was growing fast and manufacturers wanted growers to receive bcilcr prices to encourage higher production. I shall not name thc gentleman. Apparently he is a very good citizen and he probably meant well. The report states that the gentleman saidAll hell will break loose in Japan next year when most of the synthetic patents expire which will mean an all-out price war in synthetics. We are trying to prevent this war from dragging wool down with it. In effect, he was indulging in a scare campaign with the wool-growers' money in thc prominent provincial centre of Bendigo in an endeavour to get the support of the wool-growers for the proposals to increase the .levy. He said that the Japanese wanted the Australian wool-growers to receive higher prices so that we would grow more wool. As the honourable member for Kennedy pointed out, a report in the Melbourne ""Age"" of 9th February, 1963, statedThe Japanese Wool Spinners Association said to-day it was considering a plan to curb the current uptrend of raw wool import prices. The wool-growcrs are asked to pay for such nonsensical statements, if the report is correct. It is just about time that somebody investigated the extent to which our money is being wasted overseas. I have another report to which I wish to refer. In it a gentleman is quoted as saying that the Japanese wool textile industry, realizing the value of the present increasing demand for wool, voluntarily subsidized all International Wool Secretariat",76,Wilfrid Kent Hughes Tion That Course Will Be Followed

Unemployment International Affairs Immigration Social Services Royal Australian Navy. Motion (by Mr Adermann) proposedThat the House do now adjourn. Mr Speaker, I rise at this late hour to bring to the notice of the House a very serious situation that exists within my constituency. I represent the major part of the industrial city of Greater Wollongong. This is a matter that I have raised on several occasions by questions in the House, and 1 believe that I would be recreant to my trust as a representative of the people if I failed fully to inform honourable members of the reasons for the questions lhat I asked, of the present situation and of the remedies that I seek. First, I shall give the cold statistics. Employment statistics issued last week by the Minister for Labour and National SerSouth Wales as a whole 11,420 women, both seniors and juniors, were unemployed. The State has a population of 4,250,000. In Greater Wollongong, with a population of 145,000, no fewer than 1,053 women and girls are at present registered as unemployed. Greater Wollongong contains 3 per cent, of the population of New South number of females unemployed. Therefore, the unemployment situation within my constituency is at least three times as bad as the situation in New South Wales as a whole. This causes great alarm to me and my constituents and it has been the subject of considerable and scathing comment by the local responsible press. I shall now skim briefly through the details in the limited time at my disposal, Mr Speaker. On 4th April last, at the store of Bebarfalds Limited, at Wollongong, in response to an advertisement, some 300 women and girls joined a queue in search of jobs. That was the number counted up to lunch time. Mr Taylor, the manager of the store, said that he ceased to count the number at that time, although interviewing of applicants continued throughout that and the following days. On the second day, a further 150 women and girls were interviewed. In March, the store of G. J. Coles and Company Limited, at Corrimal. received applications from literally hundreds of girls for 40 jobs. On the reported statement of the manager of the store, the stack of written applications was more than one foot high.

161,Vice ( Mr Mcmahon) Revealed That In New,"fewer than 240 applications from junior girls for one position as a junior general assistant in the office advertised in March. No fewer than 350 applications, mainly from juniors, were received at the State Lotteries Office recently opened at Wollongong. I have personal experience of this office, appointments to which were under the control of the New South Wales Public Service Board. The"" South Coast Times "", also published at Wollongong, received applications from 100 women for six part-time jobs as wrappers in February. The proprietor of one dress fabric store has informed me that no fewer than 90 girls applied for one junior position. He does not want his name disclosed, but I shall give it to (he Minister in confidence if he wants it. The proprietor of this store told me that he shared with a number of storekeepers in Wollongong a fear of advertising because of the adverse effect on business due to the disappointment, resentment and frustration expressed by women and girls attempting to obtain employment. Earlier this year, the Council of the City of Greater Wollongong called applications for the appointment of two junior library trainees. There were 120 applicants, 23 of them with thc Leaving Certificate. NowI conic to the most weighty and perhaps the most responsible evidence of all the transcript of a television programme known as "" Four Comers"" that was telecast on 4th April. In the passage that I propose to read, Mr Penlington, the interviewer, was questioning MrA . Parrish, general manager of Australian Iron and Steel Proprietary Limited at Port Kembla. The transcript reads as follows:Parrisli: Well, it's more than a shortage of work for married women in this area-it' s a shortage of work for women generally and this has had a rather unsettling effect on labour, pardetails of the most scathing newspaper ticularly European labour, in this district, we're woefully short of employment for women in the Wollongong general area, and we have lost quite a number of our people who were quite satisfied with their employment at the steelworks but felt that they could not carry on because there was no opening for their wives or their daughters to supplement their earnings which supplementation was available to them in other centres. As a consequence, many families have left the .district and scores that are within my personal knowas I said, had somewhat of an unsettling effect cm thc general labour force. So we do urgently require industries which will employ women in this district. Penlington: Well, who is to step in and create ihese light industries for the employment of women? Parrish: We are a very young centre down here and of course our emphasis to date has been on heavy industries, and as a consequence we are somewhat of an unbalanced community. If you look at Newcastle you have knit-mills and all the tremendous diversity of secondary industries in which women can be employed usefullylamp factories and the like. These things have not yet come to Wollongong. If the Minister chooses to examine the whole transcript, he will see repeated statements by women that they were going out to work not merely to supplement the family income in order to buy luxuries but to supplement it in order to buy stark necessaries. One of the factors that is causing women in my constituency to go out to work is the shortage of housing. Greater Wollongong is growing at the rate of some 6,000 people a year. To former rural employees, it is nothing less than a promised land in terms of employment. Having been displaced by mechanization on farms, they come to Wollongong and find that houses are not there for them, despite the wonderful contribution to housing made by the Ctate Labour Government, which has built 5,000 homes in the district. In New South Wales as a whole, the percentage of home ownershipI am speaking of actual or potential and of people who are still heavily indebted by way of mortgage-is approximately 85 per cent. The lack of housing in Wollongong is just another of the reasons why women there go out to work. Another reason is an old one: In a district in which there is semi-automation, the wages paid to skilled and semi-skilled workers are utterly and completely inadequate. Under the limitations of time imposed on me by the Standing Orders, I do not propose to regale the House with the full comment on the Minister's reply to my last question on this subject. 1 will be charitable to him and leave it at that. But he can peruse the press cuttings at his leisure. He can take it from me that all the cases I have quoted are well authenticated. They are merely a selection from ledge or have been reported to me. I am not here to make political points. I speak as a responsible member of the Parliament and I speak in the name of my constituents. We demand and we arc entitled to assistance. This is not merely a matter of statistics; it is a matter of common Christian near-full employment or perhaps over-full charity.

Longwe have a massive problem, but I do beterm problems would be created for the whole of the Australian community. SoI am prepared to state positively that the Commonwealth Government has done a magnificent job in obtaining the present state of full employment, or a very high level of employment, with the very few difficulties that we have to face. What about the problem of the employment of women in the Wollongong-Port Kembla area? I think the honourable gentleman ought to know-h e was formerly a Labour member of the New South Wales Parliament-that during the course of this year the Commonwealth Government has made available to the States £20,000,000 specifically for the purpose of finding employment in various areas where some degree of unemployment had developed. If the New South Wales Labour Government was prepared to accept its responsibilities, it could spend part, even a large part, of its share of the £20.000.000 in ensuring that there was diversification of industry in the Wollongong-Port Kembla area. An incentive would have been given for the textile industry and other light industries to develop in the area. As the honourable gentleman well knows, I paid a visit to the Wollongong-Port Kembla area during the course of the last three or four months. I had the great pleasure of opening there a District Employment Office, so that the needs of the area could be looked after. About SOO people a day pass through this office. They do not come only to seek employment. They come to obtain guidance as to how to obtain better jobs or better methods of training and as to other ways of getting greater satisfaction out of their jobs. There service readsare now eleven officers there. The staff has been increased and the office is specifically designed to look after the requirements of the Wollongong-Port Kembla area. I hope now that more time may be devoted to looking after the problems of women resident in the Wollongong-Port Kembla and surrounding areas. I have to agree with Mr Parrish, who knows this area probably as well as any one does, that we have some problems there. I am not prepared to admit that lieve that there must be a co-operative effort by the Commonwealth Government, the State Government and the local government authorities. The Commonwealth has made funds available to enable the States to approach the problem of decentralization in a wise and sensible way. The States should do that. They now have the money and they should be providing the incentives for light industries to move into those areas where unemployment has been a problem. Inevitably when you have heavy industry localized as it is in the WollongongPort Kembla area you have a problem in getting other industries to go to the area as quickly as you want them to. The people to whom the honourable member referred, particularly the young women, deserve sympathy and help, but I repeat that this is not an occasion when the Commonwealth should be applying itself to a general stimulus of demand for labour. The Commonwealth has given £20,000,000 to the States for purposes of decentralization-to provide job opportunities for people in the small areas where they may be concentrated. I believe that the honourable gentleman, who obviously takes this matter deeply to heart, would be wise to direct the attention of the New South Wales Government to the problem and ask it to make some major contribution towards its solution. [11.31] Mr Speaker, 1 direct the attention of the House to an item broadcast tonight on national radio stations.

The item as provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission A Washington report by Associated Press of America quotes officials there as saying that the United States is reluctant to be drawn into any military commitment over Malaysia. The agency says Australia's decision to send increased military aid and a squadron of Army engineers to Malaysian Borneo has aroused some concern in Washington and has led to a close study of the ANZUS Pact. Associated Press of America says it is conceded that technically the United States could become involved under the treaty. However, the",82,Adjournment

176,Mr Allan Fraser,"I turn now tochildren. The case I propose to refer to is typical of very many. A constituent of mine applied for endowment for a student child. The department wrote to her and saidYour application for endowment for your student child has been carefully examined but approval cannot be given for the following reason:The child is not a student child within the meaning of the Social Services Act. It is obviously impossible for the mother to get any enlightenment or satisfaction from a reply so brief and curt as that unless she has a copy of the act with her. The people to whom I refer are citizens and are entitled to be told why their applications have not succeeded. In the case to which I have referred the application did not succeed because the child is engaged as a student teacher and therefore, as we in this House know, does not come within the definition of a full-time student. But surely the least the department can do is explain to the parent concerned, and to others in similar situations, why the application is refused. The situation is not helped by such statements as were made by the Minister for Social Services( Mr to refer to a matter on which questions have Roberton) as reported in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" on 20th April last. The report readsStudents' endowment is available to the parents or guardians of full-time students at schools, colleges or universities who are not receiving paySydney. BeforeI go any further, I thank ment from an employer or prospective employer. The Minister did not refer to the categories of student that were ineligible for the endowment, such as student teachers, apprentices and so on. Not one person in 1,000 reading that report would know that the Minister was referring to such cases. They would imagine that their children were eligible unless they were actually being employed in industry. never have been misled in the first place. were misled in the first place because, as the honourable member for Barton reminds me, the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) made no reference in his policy speech to qualifications or restrictions of these kinds applying to the benefit. The report continuesThe Minister for Social Services, Mr H. Roberton, said today there had been confusion among parents about the payment of the new endowment. The simple test of eligibility was one of payment under an agreement with an employer or prospective employer. If the full-time student was receiving payment under such an arrangement eligibility could not be established. But every application was considered on its merits and on the facts of each individual case, Mr Roberton added. Every honourable member who took part in the debate on the Social Services Bill, who read the bill and who heard the explanations that the Minister gave in this chamber knows that that is not so. These cases are not considered on their merits at all. The act categorically states that people in these classifications are not eligible because they are not defined as being full-time students. The least the Minister could do, in fairness to all of the mothers who are concerned with this matter, is to make the position plain in his press statements and to ensure that when an application is refused the parent is given the real reason why it is refused. Why should the Government be afraid to do that? been asked recently by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr O'Connor), the honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson) and me, namely, the dock which at present is lying in the Captain Cook Dock in the Minister for the Navy( Mr Chaney) for allowing me to go over the dock last Friday. I also thank Captain Bell, the general manager of Garden Island, and Mr Sankey for their co-operation and assistance in explaining what had taken place in relation to the dock. That is the only complimentary thing that I can say about the Government in its handling of affairs in connection with the dock. As one who has had some experience in shipbuilding, ship repair work and the like, I say that the way the dock has been allowed to deteriorate into the condition in which it is to-day is something which the Government has to explain. The Government has to explain why the dock, which was only fifteen years old when it was offered for sale, has been allowed to deteriorate until to-day it is only a rusty old hulk. It would be dangerous to shift it out of the Captain Cook Dock in its",84,Adjournment

A considerable amount of money would have to be spent on it to ensure that it was seaworthy enough to be towed out of the Captain Cook Dockthat is, if it could be got out of the dock. Perhaps the Government intends to cut it up in the Captain Cook Dock and send it to the scrap merchants in that form. Up to date the Minister has evaded the questions that have been put to him. TodayI asked him a number of very simple questions which he should have been able to answer if he had been briefed on this matter and if there were any answers to be given. I ask the Minister, who is now sitting at the table, in the time that will be allowed to him later to-night, to tell the House what was the condition of the dock in 1947, when it was taken over from the Admiralty. was fifteen years old. in 1947, because it was constructed in 1942. lf the honourable member wants any further information on this matter, it is in the reply that the Minister gave to a question asked by the honourable member for Dalley last Tuesday week. This dock was five years old in 1947, when it was taken over from the Admiralty. Why in ten years was it allowed to deteriorate until it was only a rusty hulk? Why was it not repaired during that time? Why was not adequate maintenance carried out on it to ensure that it would be available if it were needed in some forward area to maintain Australian shipping? I hope that such a need will never arise. This Government is one of the worse sabre-rattling governments that this country has had. In 1939, under the same Prime Minister we were found wanting in our preparedness for war. What is the position of our Air Force, Army and Navy now? The recent unfortunate tragedy involving "" Melbourne "" and "" Voyager"" only goes to prove what a parlous condition this country is in, as far as its defence preparedness is concerned. point of order. reference to that matter. member is aware that he has no right to refer to the collision between "" Melbourne "" and "" Voyager "". That matter is now before a royal commission. passing reference to it. member is out of order in doing that. ing any further reference to it. Australia to-day is not prepared for war. I want members of the Parliament to realize that this dock, now that it is out of action, is of no further use. The only floating docks that are available in this country are the one stationed at Newcastle and a small dock at Garden Island which is of no great value at present. The idea in having these docks is that they can be towed from place to place so that maintenance or running repairs can be carried out to vessels that have been damaged, whether in action, in a collision or by going aground. In the event of Australia becoming embroiled in a war, our position is that we have no docking facilities which could be taken to a forward area. The Minister and the Government must be asked to tell us what the real position is. The Minister sits at the table and smirks in his arrogant fashion. To-day, when I asked him a number of quite reasonable questions, he made a nasty display of temper. He has to answer the questions; not us. I keep on pressing these points: Why has the Government allowed this dock to deteriorate in half the normal life of a dock of this type? In Europe docks that are 40 and more years old are quite common. The dock in Newcastle is 35 years old, and it still has a number of years of life left in it. But this dock had had it after fifteen years. In 1957, when it was docked it was found that an expenditure of £250,000 was required to repair it. I agree that at that stage it would have been ridiculous to spend that amount on repairing a dock which then would not have been up to the standard required to carry out ship repair work. The point is that it should have been maintained. When it was taken to the Cockatoo dockyard it should have been looked after in the correct manner, just as the dock at Newcastle and other similar docks throughout the world have been looked after.

187,Mr Jones,"I will refrain from maknational asset, which could have been of immense value to our armed forces in time of war, has been allowed to deteriorate. We know that it will cost about £1,000,000 to replace this dock. But this is not a question of money; it is a question of the time taken to construct such a dock. The Government has destroyers and other naval craft in mothballs; and, if necessary, this dock should have been placed in mothballs. The Minister said during question time to-day that the dock had been offered to State instrumentalities. I say to the Minister that it was offered on terms which were not acceptable to the State instrumentalities. If necessary, this dock should have been given to them to look after on the basis of normal wear and tear being their responsibility and normal running repairs and maintenance being tbe responsibility of the Navy. Australia is a maritime nation; it is not a land nation. We must depend on shipping, particularly in war-time. Yet the Government allows national assets to rot, rust and deteriorate. No care is taken of them. 1 make this charge against the Government: Jt has been negligent in its responsibility to maintain this valuable asset of the Navy so that in time of war it would have been available to help to put ships back into action. It is no good if you have to tow ships hundreds of miles back to docks so that they can be repaired. We have a small graving dock in Brisbane, one in Sydney, and a floating dock in Newcastle. These are the only facilities that are available for repairing ships. In my opinion, it is the responsibility of the Navy you. to ensure that docks are suitably placed throughout the Commonwealtb. If necessary, this dock could be stationed in Adelaide, Perth or Melbourne. Give it to some of the ship repair establishments to enable them to carry out normal commercial merchant shipping repairs. If this were done the dock would be used and would not deteriorate. 1 ask the Minister again to tell us what circulated:the Government has done about this dock. What is the Minister's explanation for having allowed this dock to deteriorate? That is what the people of Australia, particularly General, upon noticethose who are interested in shipping, want to know.

The honourable member The matter has been made worse again by delays will appreciate that there are very great demands which have occurred in obtaining supplies of being made on the Treasury for expansion in automatic exchange equipment at the dates which many and various directions and it is proving were originally anticipated. In 1960, the telephone extremely difficult to meet some of these at a service was closely examined by an expert departrate sufficient to satisfy public demands.

The committee therefore recomfor the increasing demands upon the post office, mended to the Government at the time that the and I am giving very special attention at the new policy be approved, and this was adopted present time to this problem. finally in 1960. Briefly, this policy called for a rapid change-over of manual exchanges to automatic methods in order to reduce the rapidly rising costs associated with manual methods of operation. In addition to the cost factor, the manual exchange systems, even in the trunk line field, are unable to cope with modern requirements upon noticeand every overseas administration faced with similar problems has decided to adopt a similar standing in each of the following Sydney suburbs:solution.

However, this particular situation is rapidly improving and quite a number of new exchanges as well asextensions to existmg exchanges are now progressively going into service. 4.

202,Mr Hulme,"The answers to the honorQantas Empire Airways Limited. (Question No. 150.) Mr Benson asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Civil Aviation, upon notice1. Did Qantas Empire Airways Limited pay the 10 per cent, marginal increase to its pilots who were not members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots as from 27th April, 1963, and to federation members as from 1st July, 1963? 2. Do thc non-federation and federation members carry out similar duties and are their conditions of employment similar? 3. Is there any discrimination between the two sets of pilots? If so, what is it? 4. Will the Minister take the action necessary to correct any discrimination? 5. How many disputes covering all persons employed by Qantas are awaiting settlement by this organization? 6. What are the names of the bodies concerned? 7. How long have these disputes been awaiting settlement? 8. Have Qantas hostesses been negotiating with the organization for some four and a half months? 9. Will the Minister investigate the management side of Qantas and if disputes are outstanding give such instructions as are necessary to put employeremployee relations on a more harmonious line? Aviation has supplied the following information: 1. All Qantas pilots, except supervisory pilots, were paid the 10 per cem. marginal increase with effect from 1st July, 1963, which was the day following the expiry date of the ""Overseas Airline Pilots (Qantas) Agreement-196 2 "". This particular agreement was of short term duration (fourteen and a half months) and was specially sought by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in lieu of the normal long term agreement, l n exchange for this consideration the federation agreed not to seek salary increases during the currency of the agreement. The Qantas supervisory pilots are members of a separate association and they were not bound by the restriction on salary increases mentioned above. They were paid the marginal increase with effect from 15th May, 1963. 2. The duties of supervising pilots are dissimilar from those of operating pilots to the extent that they are principally engaged on supervisory and administrative duties associated with flying. For this reason their conditions of employment differ in certain respect from those of operating pilots, particularly in relation to hours of duty. 3. The company applies the same salary conditions to operating pilots whether or not they are members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. As already mentioned, supervisory pilots are members of a separate association and their conditions of employment are not the same as those of the operating pilots. 4. There is no discrimination made in the application of the respective conditions of employment. 5. There are nine claims, eight of which are being currently discussed with the unions concerned. 6. The organizations which have claims with Qantas are as follows:-Australia n Federation of Air Pilots, The Airline Hostesses Association, The Australasian Airline Navigators Association, Local Employees Union at Rome, Singapore M.A.L./ Qantas Employees Union, Professional Radio Employees Institute, Australasian Transport Oflicers Federation, A.C.T.U., Federated Clerks Union of Australia. 7. All the matters listed above are current. Discussions with the unions mentioned above have taken place on dates agreed upon between the parties and there has been no undue delay on the part of the company in negotiation of the issues in question. 8. Qantas has been negotiating with the hostesses association on their existing award since 4th November, 1963. However, there have been no discussions during the past three months because Qantas has been in almost continuous negotiation with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots whose representatives also represent the hostesses' association. 9. All current issues between the company and the unions are being given prompt and full consideration. The management of Qantas is responsible to the Qantas Board of Directors, the members of which are appointed by the Government and all have had extensive experience in the management of a large enterprise. The conduct of thc company's industrial affairs is clearly a management/ board responsibility. Papua and New Guinea. (Question No. 223.) Mr L. R.

Census data (including age) are not tabulated for Commonwealth electoral divisions but only for census collectors' districts and local government areas. Neither census collectors' districts nor local government areas can be aggregated to give precise figures for Commonwealth electoral divisions because aggregations of either do not always coincide with boundaries of electoral divisions.
