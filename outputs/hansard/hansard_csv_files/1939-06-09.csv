A census or censuses of male persons oi classes of persons wlio have attained the age of eighteen years and have not attained the age of 05 years shall be taken in such I have not seen the States, Territories or parts of the Commonwealth and on such day or days or within such period or periods as the Governor General by proclamation directs.

The nature of the particulars required to be furnished by the persons or classes oi persons of wliom a census is taken under this section shall be specified in the proclamation. way of amendmentThat after tlie word "" yearssub-clause (1), the words "" and a census of property "" be inserted. [10.53] -Last night, the Ministerf o r I shall do Defence( Mr Street) repeatedly referred to statements made by me and other honorable members regarding the national register, and made it appear that our only objection to the proposal was that it would create a psychology of fear and distrust among the workers. I admit that I frequently made such a statement during my second-reading speech, but I did not suggest that that was the only objection T h is is a matter I had to the proposal. I pointed out that the action of the Government in excluding the Commonwealth Government as an employer under the provisions of the Supply and Development B ill , and the absence of a census of wealth from the national register proposals, would deW ill the Postmasfinitely create a feeling of distrust and antagonism. Apart from that phase of the matter, however, I have very definite objections to the proposal. 1 suggest that tlie amendment of the honourable member for Perth( MrN a i r n ) has no real substance in it . It does not offer any compensation to the people for having to submit to a registration of manpower. Every body knows that, for many years past, some of our people have been fed upon this pap of of those a census of wealth, but the fact is that the mere making of a record of who owns the wealth of the country will not affect the issue in any way whatever. It may be useful as giving a picture of the distribution of wealth, but it will have no bearing on the question now before us. No useful purpose w ill be served by preparing a census of wealth unless the Government means to commandeer some of it , and every one knows that the Government has not the slightest intention of doing that.

44,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"has said that the Government already has power, in event of an emergency, to commandeer anything it wants. The Government already has power under the taxation laws to take as much of the income of the people as it thinks fit, but whether it will have the courage to exercise that power to the highest degree is another matter. Two proposals were submitted to the Government in connection with the census of wealth. The honourable member for Perth proposed that a census should be taken of the property of every one in the community, from pensioners upwards. honourable member has not seen the later amendment. to put the position unfairly. The honorproposed that only those persons owning net capital to .the value of £1,000 or more should be required to make returns. The Government, of course, did not want to accept either proposition, but when it had to yield to pressure, it decided to accept the proposal that roped in all of the poor people. That decision, plus the decision to exempt the Government as an employer under the Supply and Development Bill, will certainly create suspicion in the minds of the people. nitely stated that those owning only a small amount of property will not have to make returns. made that statement, I know, but he will not be able to address meetings all over Australia and make the people understand what is in his mind. I have said that there is a suspicion in the minds of the people as the result of what has happened in the past, and that suspicion cannot easily be dissipated. When the time arrives, the Minister for Defence will have no more effective power in the administration of this provision than had the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) when he was Prime Minister during the last war. He told the people that no search warrants would be issued unless they bore his signature, that any others should be ignored; but, as a matter of fact, none of the search warrants bore his signature. In the past Brigadier Williams, or somebody else, signed them, and the present Minister will have no more power than any of his predecessors. Consequently, the fear and mistrust which I have described exist among the people. The Minister has not misquoted me in that respect. I agree with the statement he made last night that the acceptance of this amendment does not make the slightest difference, because the Government now has the power to tap income when it feels it necessary to do so. One point mentioned in that respect, of course, was that such information must be The secret. The Minister also said that he did not want to probe into the income tax returns, that he simply wanted to be able to cut a slab off the aggregate income of the taxpayers. I agree with that view. But this amendment will not make the slightest difference in the matter. It does not hold out any hope to the people, because they can see through it just as easily as anybody else. To them it is pure hooey, as* the Americans would say. I am certain that .this proposal to hold a wealth census will not be fully carried out. Forms might be issued, and the information obtained might be summarized, but the information will then be pigeon-hpled and never used. I do not. propose to vote against, the amendment, but I do intend to vote against the bill as amended. I have expressed my opposition to it, and made it clear to the people that I am not. attempting to fool them with this proposal. honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) quite unconsciously misrepresented the position when he said that the amendment involves the making of returns by every person possessing property, however small its value. He should have studied the proposal in conjunction with the two further amendments which have been forecast. They show clearly, as was stated by both the Minister( Mr Street) and myself last night, that the Government does not intend to ask for returns from all of the people. able member's amendment make that clear ?",12,National Registration

Here is a to this act setting out the particulars specified fresh piece of what the honourable member in that form. That amendment makes it perfectly from the Metropolitan Council of the clear that only persons possessing property Western Australian branch of the up to a certain value will be obliged to Australian Labour party setting out the furnish a return. The honourable member following resolution which was passed for Melbourne Ports also-argued that this at a public meeting held under the census will be of no value. It is qnite auspices of the Australian Labour party clear to me that whenever honourable in the Unity Theatre, Perth, last Friday members opposite get what they ask for eveningthey do not want .it. Their speeches prior to the acceptance of this amendment by by the Menzies Government is the first step the Government had one feature in comtowards mon, namely, the complaint that this Metropolitan Council of the Australian Labour measure did not provide for the taking of party, strongly protests against and declares a census of wealth, but only for a census its determined opposition to such a register, of man-power, with the result that the contending moneyed interests would escape. That was manhood. the burden of their arguments before my amendment was accepted. Now that they have been given what they asked for, [11.7] -Afte r listening to the honourable tbev realize that they have been deprived member foT Perth( Mr Nairn) and the of their best election talking point.

57,Mr Nairn,The honourable member,14,National Registration
58,Mr Thompson,"(New England)made to the country. I understood clearly that one of those commitments was that this register of man-power was merely a preliminary defensive measure, and that it had no political significance whatever -but also outside-and , of course, AusThe actions of certain alleged supporters of the Government have definitely removed the defensive feature of this register and converted the whole matter into a political issue. As a matter of f-.iet, the honourable member for Perth himself indicates quite clearly that if the Government proceeds with this proposal, it will not only get itself into an unholy mess with regard to this register, but will also raise an issue that need not be raised at all-a n issue which will divide the community, one section holding the view that the ultimate intention behind the register is to make a capital levy on the wealth of this country. When speaking last night the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) made what T. regard as the most significant speech in this debate. He made it clear, unless I am doing him a very serious injustice, that nothing short of -a capital levy will suit him. He was bitterly disappointed at the possibility that no such capital levy would be made. In that respect he appeared to be quite out of touch with a section of his colleagues who do not desire to reveal at this stage that the Labour party has any intention to impose a capital levy for defence purposes. Judging by the statements made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports this morning, one result of this amendment-and probably the only good result -is the creation of a definite cleavage in the ranks of the Opposition. would like to think so. Minister for Defence that if it is not intended to make a eapital levy sooner or later, a wealth census is of no value at all, because, quite obviously, any government, irrespective of its political colour, can obtain all the finance it requires through the ordinary legitimate channels, such as income tax, without resorting to a wealth census at all. We are told that in 1915-and most of us remember the occasiona census similar to that now proposed was taken, but nothing was ever done with the information then obtained, the whole of the returns eventually being destroyed. Why repeat such a farcical procedure? Why hold over the he.ids of vested interests not only here tralia's economy like that of every other country is based on vested interests-the threat that Australia is in panic and propose? to do something that has never been suggested in Great Britain but is peculiar only to totalitarian countries? We know th.it a capital levy has been in operation in Italy for a number of years. I suggest that the slump evidenced in connection with our recent London loan was due to the fact that our intimation of the likelihood of Australia doing something of this kind was given abroad. As I said the other d.ay, I believe that unless the Government removes from the minds of the people possessing limited resources, who are required to invest in all Government undertakings-and in spite of all they did to help this country in the Great War, and all they .are doing now and will do when called upon-the threat of confiscation of their wealth as a purely political gesture, it will create a serious position in this country, which we are not prepared to face at the present juncture. Some honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Martin( Mr MoCall), declare that the people are failing to respond sufficiently to Government loans for defence. In the last four years £105,000,000 has been taken out of the pockets of the Australian people and vested interests to finance government commitments and only a small proportion of it has been for defence needs. The Treasurers will be in Canberra in a few days to make colossal demands on the remaining financial balance of this country. Talk in this Parliament about, the conscription of wealth such as has occurred in the last few days is the best means available to cripple the legitimate financial requirements of the States and to prejudice the chances of the success of Commonwealth loans for purposes of defence. Why not tell the people that this census of property will 'be of no practical value at all ? I do not expect the Minister to answer that question because it is too difficult to answer. I realize the difficulties that the Government is facing, but if the Govern-",14,National Registration
59,Mr Martens,The honourable member,15,National Registration
60,Mr Thompson,"I agree with themailt explored the support that it could get before rushing into sham fights and then beating hasty retreats it would find itself in a better position. Property consists of such things as houses, land, stocks and shares and such things, as well as actual cash, but the people have very little actual cash lying loose in the banks; what little there is is generally used by the banks for the general purposes of the community, particularly for subscriptions to Commonwealth loans. said by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) himself, this proposed census of property will cause to the people concerned a great deal of brain-racking trouble in the preparation of complicated returns which the Government never will and never can use. Bather than go on with this Gilbertian procedure, which will completely destroy the efficiency and tbe value of the man-power register, the Government should courageously face the issue, withdraw the bill and tell the people that it is impossible to do anything, even to make a beginning in the regimentation of defensive measures because of the political issues that are intruded. ""Psychology"" is a word that has been over used. Honourable members opposite have made frequent recourse to the word during this discussion, but can any honourable member analyse those psychological reasons"" about which they have made so much play? Have they any value? If the Government, withdrew the bill and advanced its real reasons for doing so it would receive more support from the people, and the blame for the failure to meet an important requirement in the defence programme would fall where it rightly belongs-o n the Opposition and on those sections of the Government party which, for political reasons, do not show any enthusiasm for getting on with a -job which, we, at the last election, as members of the coalition government and supporters of this Government, said must he done. Our first obligation is to make this country safe. I listened with great interest to the arguments advanced 'by the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) in favour of the taking of a census of property as well as of man-power, but it was merely camouflage. There is a great difference between human life and property. Human life is sacred and its value cannot he assessed. The census of man-power has as its purpose the pressing of the young men from IS to 21 years of age to undertake the greatest tasks with the greatest risks to life and limb. In my second-reading speech I said that I should never compromise with any government on any question in which human life was involved. The honourable member for As was New England( Mr Thompson) made a case for wealth against human life. kind. which the honourable gentleman puts on human life he takes up an inhuman attitude. gentleman in order in making an offensive statement? It is offensive to me for him to say that. I am inhuman or have put up a case for wealth against human life. I take strong exception to the honourable gentleman's remark. It is slanderous and I ask for its withdrawal. If the honourable member thinks that he has been misrepresented he will have an opportunity later to make a. personal explanation. honourable member made "" a statement which is offensive to me. He said that I was inhuman. That is an unparliamentary remark and I wish to have it withdrawn. member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) said that the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) was inhuman member for New England thinks that I have injured him in any way I am prepared to withdraw, but I give the honourable member credit for the fact that he put up a case for wealth against human life. later. member said that wealth would suffer more from this census than would human life.",15,National Registration

I am well acquainted with the sufferings that have been experienced by many men who went to that war. The people who helped to finance that war have had no sufferings as the result of it. On the contrary, they have grown fat on their income from the interest on the money that they so wisely invested in the conflict. power, will be available for use to the Yet the honourable member for New England has the temerity to suggest that the mere taking of a census of property is waving the big stick over the moneyed classes and that to do so is objectionable.

He tried to intimidate me. I was able to overcome the shock, but I object to the adoption of such methods. I am opposed to any procedure which will enable recruiting sergeants to intimidate young men and force them into the army by a process of economic conscription. That method was used during tlie last war. Recruiting sergeants came on various jobs and, in the presence of the bosses, said to young men, "" I understand from your recruiting cards that you have certain qualifications for active service. Why do you not enlist?"" That cruel and unfair form of compulsion was frequently adopted during 1915, 1916 and 1917. During those years I personally suffered very severely.

The proposed schedule in relation to the wealth census is now available for distribution. It will not be necessary, therefore, to wait until the bill Russia, which has a population of is before another place for the information to be furnished to honourable members. The schedule will now be included in the bill, and no Government will thereafter have power to alter it by regulation.

90,Mr Thompson (New England),"moments ago that I had made out a case for wealth against human life. I do not see how anything that I have said in any of my speeches on this measure could be so interpreted by reasonable people. My attitude in opposing the inclusion in the bill of the provisions for the so-called wealth register, which is purely a property census, has been more or less endorsed by such distinguished members of the Opposition as the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr threat of compulsion. If those concerned Holloway), and, unless I am doing him an injustice, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). 1 listened to the speech made last night by the honourable member for Batman, and I concluded that he was opposed to the census of wealth for the reason that it could have no practical value unless it was intended to lead ultimately to a levy -on wealth. I take the 3ame view. That is the whole of my case. Unless the Government has some practical objective in mind in taking this census which has not yet been disclosed, no rational purpose can be served by taking it, I do not think it can serve any useful end in strengthening the defence measures that the Government is taking. It might, be useful for the purpose of imposing a capital levy, but merely to take it for statistical purposes is to deceive the public. I am not in favour of a capital levy for reasons which I have already given. Our experience during the last war showed that there was no, need to compel the people of this country, who control our financial resources, to furnish the sinews of war. that our people are ready to respond with all the resources at their disposal terest ! able member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) stated yesterday that the Scullin Government had carried out the most successful conversion loan in the history of th<* world up to that time. I remind him that all parties co-operated in connection with the floating of that. loan. ""What had happened, of course, was that interest rates had grown to such a point that it was beyond the financial economy of the country to meet them. That being so, the Scullin Government, with the cooperation of the Opposition parties at the time, floated and carried through conversion operations which had the effect of reducing interest rates. It was not a party issue. I remind honourable gentlemen that berind the procedure adopted at that time was a definite had not converted their holdings, they would have been compelled to do so. In those circumstances, the conversion loan was carried out speedily and completely. I wish to make it very clear that I am opposed to a capital levy. This may be an important issue at the next general elections. I have a considerable respect for the honourable members of the Opposition, but I would not trust all of them ""to state my position in this regard clearly during a general election campaign. Therefore, I take this opportunity to do so myself. There is no truth in the suggestion made by the honourable member for Denison that I am endeavouring to make out a case for wealth as against human life. No such construction could possibly be placed upon my remarks by any reasonable or fair-minded person. I have no objection to the Government taking action to compel the youth, of this country to make their contribution to national security, and I shall be prepared at all times to support any practical measures, whether involving compulsion or not, to ensure that those who control the sinews of war in Australia do their part should emergency arise. I shall always support any legislation which I regard as vital to the safety of the country, irrespective of any influence which may be brought to bear by wealthy interests. I hope that the Government will not be misled into supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn). That amendment has no logical basis, and it involves differentiation in the so-called wealth register, which, in effect, is actually a register of property. In my opinion the people, of Australia will strongly resent any differentiation, and I see no justification for it. Any",18,National Registration

94,Mr Thompson,"The right honorperson who is required to fill in a registration card with regard to his ability to perform certain work in time of emergency, should also be obliged to fill questions relating to his financial position whether he has any property or not. Any information with regard to wealth will of course be supplemented through ordinary statistical channels, and so the Government will have in its possession a complete record of private financial resources. I fail to see the urgency for the compilation of a national register in regard to man-power, but if it is regarded as necessary, then it should hot have added to it this purely political or psychological factor providing for the investigation of wealth resources. Moreoveri f there is to be this degree of differentiation which the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth envisages, then there will be strong resentment among the people of Australia. In my opinion the working people will not be afraid or ashamed to indicate whether or not they have any property. Such information would be kept confidential by the Government and therefore no injustice would be done. before the Government gives its support to this amendment, it should thoroughly consider whether or not any section of the community should be excluded from the property census. If all men are to be compulsorily required to fill in cards setting out details of their ability to perform certain work as a contribution to national security, then they should also be asked to give details regarding what contribution they could make from their property or wealth resources. regret the necessity for this clause and for the bill itself. I believe it will have a detrimental effect on the freedom-loving youth of Australia, who will have imposed on them restrictions similar to those exj sting only in totalitarian countries. Sub-clause 2 of the clause now under consideration statesThe nature of the particulars required to be full information regarding the private furnished by the persons or classes of persons of whom a census is taken under this section shall be specified in the proclamation. I point out, however, that the proclamation will not be in the schedule. The terms of this clause should be varied to such a degree that the proclamation cannot alter anything set out in the schedule, which, I presume, will be introduced by the Minister for Defence to-day. for the compulsory registration of all males between the ages of 18 and 65 years of age, despite the fact that some of them may be mentally defective, and inmates of institutions. It also includes those young fellows who to-day are seeking to make their way in life by pursuing courses of higher education. In some cases the parents of these boys have had a very difficult task in saving sufficient money to educate their families. A census such as this will take from these young men their desire to launch out into various professions, because they will feel that at any moment their education may be interrupted, and they may be called upon to take their places in some branch of defence activity. Probably those who will be charged with the administration of this legislation will not be possessed of the spirit of humanitarianism. OneI strongly urge that member of the National Register Board will be the Commonwealth Statistician, a man who deals entirely with figures. Possibly the executive officer of the board will be a. military "" brass-hat "" who thinks only in terms of platoons, companies, battalions and divisions. No consideration will be given to individuals who seek exemption from the provisions of this legislation. I am strongly opposed to the inclusion of youths between the ages of 18 and 21 years in this measure, and I request that it be withdrawn. tend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) which provides for the taking of a. wealth census. It is intended to use compulsion with regard to the compilation of a register of man-power, and in the event of serious trouble arising the Government should have at its disposal wealth existing in this country. There is no doubt that in time of war money is a most important factor. It is useless to argue that during the last war ample funds were made available by investors. It is true that many patriotic citizens did",19,National Registration

When the time for the conversion of war loans arrived, those who had been patriotic enough to put their money into war bonds, had to accept a lower rate of interest, while the other wealthy people to whom 1 have referred continued to draw the same high rates. Both in Australia and in England a great mistake was made in connection with war loans. In time of emergency every citizen should be compelled to make some sacrifice. If war is threatened then subscription to loans, according to ability to pay, should be made compulsory, and only a low rate of interest should be paid. In my opinion money borrowed for defence purposes should not carry interest exceeding 2$ per cent. Had such a figure been fixed during the last war, instead of paying up to 6 per cent., a huge saving would have been effected. In addition to high interest rates on all war loans, huge profits were made in Great Britain and many people who at the beginning of the war years had very little money were worth anything up to £16,000,000 or £17,000,000 at the end of the conflict. That money was amassed while other citizens were making sacrifices in the interests of their country. While the figures relating to wealth would be of little value to the Government in time of peace, they, would undoubtedly be of great value should war occur, and I hope that the committee will agree to have provision for a wealth census incorporated .in this bill. It was very interesting to me to listen to the special pleading on the part of wealth, made by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson). That honourable gentleman said that wealth has always played its part in times of emergency, but I submit that, in the history of census would cause visions of a capital this world, wealth has only played its part when a high rate of interest has been offered. referred to' the record conversion loan the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), and claimed that subscriptions to that loan were made under threat of compulsion. Surely that is an answer to his own argument that wealth has always played its part. While investors were drawing huge sums from war loans during the Great War, 60,000 Australian men sacrificed their lives, and to-day their loved ones are expected to exist on a pittance. When Commonwealth loans were arranged by outside agencies in former years, the average charge was £2 7s. 6d. per cent., but when the Commonwealth Bank took over that work, it was carried out at an -average cost of 7s. 6d. per cent. It ill becomes the honourable member to suggest that the wealthy section desires to do its share towards assisting in the defence of the country, because experience shows that it invariably makes no sacrifices, but insists on drawing full interest rates on all money lent to the Government. The workers, on the other hand, are urged to fight for their country when called upon. member in favour of interest-free loans ? wealthy sections to do their share. ' The workers are asked to sacrifice their lives in times of national emergency, but the sections which control the money protest at even the slightest reduction of interest rates. [12.3] I have had an opportunity to peruse the schedule and the amendments proposed by the Minister, but I still stand on the same ground as that taken by him originally in regard to the wealth census. The statement made by some of my friends on the Opposition side last night that the census would not serve a useful purpose, is true. It. would involve a waste of public money, but, worse than that, it would have a serious effect upon the financial and economic stability of the country.

I was hoping that the proposed national register would yield something of calculable value. I endeavoured unsuccessfully to have certain additional information obtained by means of the questionnaire, and I said that if , for political reasons, it was considered inadvisable to ask for that f u r ther information, it was clear that the altered attitude of the Government regarding the wealth census was, due entirely to political considerations. maintain that it was on account of political reasons alone. Probably the Government has not calculated the reaction which must follow its acceptance of the amendment submitted last night by the honourable member for Perth( MrN a i r n ) . The glee with which the Opposition regarded its acceptance by the Government, and the way in which the Opposition used that fact to its own advantage, is proof positive that I am right in my. contention. the bill has been seriously diminished, and I suggest that, even at this late stage, it would be wise for the Government to reconsider the matter, with a view to securing a more satisfactory result than that which I contemplate. The Government is entitled to the information that it desires to obtain, but economic stability and public confidence should be preserved. oppose this clause. sity for a register of the man-power of the country to induce tbe people to rise to the occasion in the event of their services being required for defence purposes. I am convinced that the wealthy interests would contribute nothing voluntarily to the defence of Australia. Great War, while the toilers made enormous voluntary sacrifices, the wealthy sections insisted on receiving their pound of flesh in the shape of f u l l interest rates. I was surprised to hear the honourable 1.371 son) suggest that the Labour party might eventually use the information which would be obtained by a wealth census in I say emphatiorder to impose a levy on capital. The Labour movement has never announced that it would impose a levy on wealth. The honourable member for New England remarked that a wealth census would be useful, but that only persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years should be called upon to supply returns; but I point out that large numbers of people over the age of 65 years control an enormous amount of. wealth. Of course, one expects the honourable member to be in favour of excluding persons over the age of 65 years because, in this chamber, he represents wealthy interests. TheI deny that. returns contemplated would be useless as a record of the wealth of the community, and the Government should withdraw the bill . Why should youths between the ages of 18 and 21 years be . called upon to register,' when they are not even given the right to vote? If they did not register, they could be cast into prison for three months, or fined £50. The same penalties would be provided for the man on the dole as for the wealthy. This is unfair.

The fact is that the families of the wealthy will also have to register. Every male between the ages of 18 and 65, whether rich or poor, will have to register, and the Government now proposes to make a register of wealth also. Tho Labour party seems to be nonplussed now that the Government has accepted its proposal, and is trying to retreat from the position which it formerly took up. I cannot see that there is any reason why the clause should not be agreed to. I ments for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron). Two enthusiastic when he dwelt upon what unionists would probably have to suffer in time of war, but now, when it is proposed to make a register of wealth, and there is some suggestion that the wealthy interests also might be called upon to make sacrifices, his indignation knows no bounds. We are told that, if any action is taken to suggest a possible levy upon wealth, capital will become scared. Some one has said that the banks might close down, and that capital would leave the country. We have heard all of those stories before. As for the suggestion that wealth might leave the country, that is too stupid to be considered as an intelligent argument. The wealth of a country consists of its resources. Has any one ever sent abroad? Admittedly, some persons might try to take their cash resources away, but that can be easily prevented. For my part, I would not be satisfied merely to ask the wealthy interests to disclose the extent of their resources; I should like to make them disclose how they obtained their wealth. I would make them tell how much watered stock had been issued, how much concerns upon which they were paying dividends. I would ask some pointed questions of those who sit on directorates, and draw princely fees for a couple of hours' attendance a week. They are just hangers-on in industry. Theirs is the kind of wealth which the Government would be justified in confiscating almost entirely. I have said before that, if Mrs. Kelly were alive today, she would not allow Ned to play with some of the men of whom I have been speaking.

The honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) is always loud in the defence of those thieving interests. I suppose he developed that psychology when he was debt collecting from the unfortunate workers. The Minister for Defence( Mr Street) said that one advantage of taking a census of young men between 18 and 21 would be to prevent qualified men from joining services in which their talents would be wasted.

Evidently it is proposed to take only the unfortunate men who have no trade or no profession. The attitude of the Government towards such persons seems to be that of Malthus who, a hundred years ago, said of the same class, "" There is no place for you at Nature's banquet. You were born into poverty, and in poverty you must live."" The Government says to them that they can take their place on the battlefield, but the sons of the wealthy will be exempt. I am not opposed to higher education, but if the promise is held out that young men attending the university w ill be exempt from military service, there -will not be universities enough to hold all those who will want to attend. I know the shift's which wealthy persons employed in order to keep their sons from serving in the last war, particularly when conscription was threatened. If apprentices, as well as university students, are to be excluded from service, who w ill be left? What does the Government want? honourable member's own leader has proposed, make a survey of man-power. that it is not proposed to break into the training of youths at the university? Of course, the Minister approaches this matter in a different way altogether from the way in which the Labour party approaches it . It is evident to me that the proposed register can mean only industrial and military conscription. Honourable members opposite, who objected to the taking of a census of wealth, said that it could be of no possible use unless it was proposed to make a capital levy. NowI employ the same argument, and say that it is of no use to make a register of man-power unless it is proposed to compel the men to render service of some kind. the Labour party want a register for? The Minister did It is p a r t of its policy. information "" to the honourable member; he will have to depend on If it .is proposed the Lord for the brains to understand it. As I said in my second reading speech, it is tragic that the Government should seek to put its hands on the youth of this country in this way before they even exercise a vote and are still recognized under the laws as minors. Furthermore, if our young men do not comply with the provisions of this measure, they will be treated as criminals. Such legislation, I suggest, harkens _ back to pagan days when all kinds of pain and penalties were inflicted on human beings, and the common people were denied any say in government. It is most unjust that the youth of this country should be subjected to the pains and penalties prescribed in this measure before they even have a vote in the election of their national government.

129,Mr Lazzarini,"My leader sugfor a specific purpose, but the Government says that it does not want this information for any particular purpose. It denies, however,' that this register is a camouflage for conscription. If that is the case, why should it require this information from young men between the ages of 18 and 21? member's time has expired. surprised at the attitude adopted by honourable members opposite towards this amendment. Apparently they are of the opinion that no opportunity should be afforded the youth of this country to be trained as soldiers in the event of Australia being attacked. I suppose that many honourable members are the fathers of boys. They at least will realize the necessity for preparing our young men in this way to meet any possibility of attack. If Australia should be attacked by Italy, for instance, and that country sent a few capital ships to harass our shores, we should be foolish to rely upon untrained lads to defend this country. Every parent realizes that it would be most unfair to neglect the military training of the young men of this country, particularly when that the forces of any invader would be fully trained and equipped with The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr organize the defence of this country, Lazzarini) complained that university students were to be exempted, and wanted to know if similar treatment would be meted out to apprentices and other young men undergoing courses of study. suggest that university students would be more eager than any other class of young men to equip themselves as defenders of this country. As a father of three .boys who have undergone compulsory military training, I have no doubt that the average young man finds military discipline irksome. At the same time, however, every father realizes that it is essential that his sons be taught to handle a gun in order that they may be of use in the defence of this country should it ever be attacked. rest assured that any force which might attack this country would be highly trained and equipped with the most modern weapons. We .cannot disregard the big advance which has been made in the modernizing of weapons since the Great War. As the result of this development every country to-day is forced to rely more and more upon specially trained men. Honourable members opposite say they fear that the Government intends to show preferential treatment to educated lads. 'They suggest that university students and skilled artisans will be exempt from the real risks involved in war. Such a suggestion is ridiculous, and I do not believe that honourable members are sincere in making it. The honourable member for Werriwa said that the Government's proposal savoured of the tyranny of pagan days. The main object of this measure is to prepare the man-, power of this country in order to fight paganism. Apparently the honourable member needs to revise his ideas of what constitutes freedom. His suggestion that our youth will object to giving this information for the purpose for which it is required shows that he does not understand democracy. Various statements have been advanced as to how this measure will affect young men, particularly those between the ages of 18 and 21. Is it suggested that because the Goit is evident vernment merely asks our young men to supply their names and addresses, and the most modern weapons. other essential particulars, in order to they will be penalized in any way? It is clear from the speeches of honourable members opposite that the Labour party has no sound policy for defence. I hold I the view that our young men of all classes, including university students, the skilled and the unskilled, will respond readily to the Government's efforts to defend this country effectively. Knowing what is happening on the other, side of the world, we cannot be blind to the possibility of war, perhaps in. the near future. Honourable members opposite should abandon the argument that the compilation of this register is intended by the Government to be the first step towards conscription. Such a suggestion As I said earlier, we can is false and wicked, and could only be made by honourable members who do not realize the meaning of democracy, and who reject the principle that it is the duty of every Australian man to train",24,National Registration

131,Mr Lane (Barton) [12.35],"I amhimself to defend this country in its hour of need. I hope that the Government will reconsider its decision to take a census of wealth. I feel sure that in a time of emergency the so-called wealthy would be the first to fulfil their duty towards this country. That fact has been emphasized on more than one occasion in the past. Previous attempts to conscript the wealth of Australia have not only failed miserably but have also defeated the very objective which those who advocated that policy had in mind. The money has been raised in the past by loans, income tax, land tax, property tax and increases in all other forms of taxation, calling upon those with the highest incomes <and greatest wealth to pay the larger portion of defence expenditure. While we may have the registration of wealth, the method of collecting the finance to carry on against an aggressive foe will always be through the Taxation Department, levying where the greatest wealth lies. Sitting suspended from 18.45 to 2.15 p.m. amendment is nothing more than a political makebelieve. We should have a wealth census, but i't should be taken at the proper time, namely, when the general census is taken eighteen or twenty months hence. A census of wealth taken under the same conditions as the proposed census of man-power, that is from males of from 18 to 65 years of age, would be futile, whilst a complete recording would involve unnecessary extra, expenditure. So many returns are already expected from the people that every additional one adds a new pin-prick to harass the taxpayers. [Quorum formed.'] The Government has wisely accepted the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn). Although every year we have a practical census of all the wealth of Australia under the income tax law, company and land laws, and by local government bodies, there is no harm in obtaining particulars as to that property in a specific way in a national register. The Government has adopted the policy of ""one in, all in "" . I welcome the expressed intention of the Government to exempt owners of small property from the compliance with the provisions of the amendment. I impress upon the Ministry the fact that not all property in Australia is liquid, in fact, that a large proportion of it is held against overdrafts in industry, and that disturbance of conditions might adversely affect employment. No government, whatever be its political allegiance, can be too careful in making use of any information gleaned from a census of property, but I have no doubt that this Government is sincere in its intention to exercise due caution. However the protection to those sending in these census forms lies in the fact that the contents are to be kept by the Taxation Department and cannot be divulged to any one outside that department. The Minister for Defence( Mr Street) said that there would be certain classifications which would be exempt, not from registration, but from service. He specified university students, and, by way of interjection, apprentices. Many apprentices have volunteered for service in the -This militia, and they seem to be able to undergo their training without interference to their careers. If this bill become law, will apprentices be withdrawn from the militia? out of the militia forces. Government is anxious to discriminate against the sons of the less fortunate people in the community who are to be trained to bear the brunt of battle whilst the sons of those parents who can afford to pay university fees will be exempt. That discrimination supplies an additional reason, if any be required, why the Opposition should support the stand taken by the trade unions against this legislation. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made a speech at the Sydney Town Hall in which he said that wealth must play its part in defence. How does the Government intend to compel wealth to play its part ? The Minister has made it plain 'that he accepts the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) merely to placate ""a minority of the committee, because he feared that that minority with ""the sup-",25,National Registration

136,Mr Ward,"It would appear that theport of the Labour party would constitute a majority on a division, and he added that the Government had no intention to make use of the information that would be gained from a census of property. If the Ministry does not intend to impose a capital levy or to impose increased taxes on higher incomes-neithe r the Minister nor the Prime Minister has said that that will be done-in order to make wealth play its part, the only remaining ,way in which the defence programme can be financed is by an extension of the policy of raising loans. 1 Order! The honourable gentleman is out of order. census, surely we can answer the arguments advanced by the Minister, who claims that the Government has adequate power to compel wealth to make its contribution. I am endeavouring to elicit from the Ministry the plans which it has formulated in order to make use of that power. If the Government proposes an extension of the loan policy instead of ""a capital levy or higher tax rates on the higher scales of income, it should not involve this country in the expense of gathering information which, on the admission of the Minister, it does not intend to use. If the Labour party were to make a survey of the resources of the country, including wealth, it would make use of the information so gained in order to give effect to some plan to compel the more fortunately placed members of the community to make their contribution towards the financing of the defence programme. The honourable member for Perth himself was not sincere when he moved this amendment, because he said, "" All that I propose to do is to take tion of the Government was to allocate away from the Opposition an argument that it would use in the electorates to defeat the effects of this legislation "". for East Sydney is extremely careless of the truth. 1 repeat my assertion. Moreover, if I were to judge the honourable member for Perth on his various statements I should say he is a direct descendant of Ananias. orable member for East Sydney must moderate his language. honourable member for Perth was sincere in submitting this amendment. No limitations have been proposed in respect of -the examination of the circumstances of invalid and old-age pensioners, but the same searching inquiry is not likely to be made into the affairs of the wealthy people of this community in connection with the proposed wealth census. Unless the information secured is to be used for some definite purpose the Government is not justified in incurring the expense of obtaining it. A real justification for such an amendment would be that the information obtained is intended to be used to oblige wealthy people to make a more adequate contribution towards defence expenditure. But the Government does not intend so to use it. The Minister is silent in regard to my inquiry as to whether the Government intends to increase the rate of taxation on higher incomes in order to assist in financing our defence programme. We have been told that the purpose of the man-power census is to enable the Government, on the information so obtained, to allocate the services of the men of this community in the most effective manner in a time of emergency. In my opinion the men will be allocated for service not according to their capacity, but according to whether their parents are wealthy and move in fashionable circles or not. member is again departing from the subject before the Chair.

Many of them are constantly carrying their swags from one centre to another. Can the Minister state what these men would be called upon to do?

It says in effect, "" We intend to register not only life and labour but also wealth. The register of life and labour is not for the purpose of records only, but will be used should an emergency arise. We want to know where each man is, and what he can do, so we may be able to use him industrially or militarily to the greatest advantage. We do not want to register wealth in order to use wealth to the greatest advantage in a time of emergency, but we propose to rely on the orthodox methods of taxation and loan of using wealth should an emergency arise "". I suggest that if the Government really wants to take a census of wealth in a workmanlike fashion, it should raise the minimum proposed here to a much higher figure. Otherwise, a vast number of people who, in no circumstances at all, could be asked to put their property at the disposal of the community, will be asked to fill in these forms. That information will be of no use whatever, even if the records are complete, because to be complete the records must be of property below, as well as above, the value of £500. I submit that the minimum should be made much higher than £500. value as a conspectus of wealth. of no value at all as a conspectus of wealth unless it brings in all property, and, if the Government wants a record of the private wealth of the community, it must bring in all property. For instance, a single man living with his parents might have no obligations at all, yet he might have an income of £500 a year. His wealth would, 'to a large degree, be surplus wealth. On the other .hand a married man who is bringing up.a family might have partly paid off .a home.and furniture to a greater value than £500. If the Government wishes to secure an actual picture of the wealth of the community for the sake of having a record then.it will need to secure a record of the property of everybody. If it does not want to do that, but desires to secure merely a record of the resources of the community to be used iu case of emergency, then if must make its minimum much higher. I repeat that this is only an attempt to make this unpalatable mear sure more acceptable to the people by giving them ideas that if a requisition is made it will affect not only labour and life, but also the wealth of the community. The Government repudiates the idea of taking wealth in any emergency no matter what that emergency might be; but no matter what the emergency might be, itproposes to make a requisition on the lives of the people and to subject them to industrial and military conscription. Whatever finance it requires, it will raise by the old methods of taxation and loan, and we shall find, as happens in every war, that the poor will .emerge poorer and the wealthy will emerge wealthier. wealth except by taking what it produces ? What does wealth amount to unless it produces something? disturbed by taxation and loans. People who were moderately wealthy at the start of the Great War amassed great wealth during the war. When you levy taxes you -merely take from the income of people, and you can take wealth without taxing the incomes of people. You can take property for which people have no need without taxing income. I am not saying that that should be done, but I suggest that should a crisis arise in which the people are to be called upon to serve or work, then it is of sufficient magnitude to entitle the Government to say that it will also take surplus wealth of the wealthy in order to use it for the benefit of the nation. However, in any war carried on by this Government, the workers and the young men .will be called upon to make the maximum sacrifice of life and labour, while wealth will .not be called upon to make any permanent sacrifice. The wealthy are merely tocontribute by way of -taxes and loans, interest on which will be exempt from tax; the wealthy will not he required to make any permanent sacrifice. Therefore; I submit that this legislation is a .mere sham. The Minister for Defence( Mr Street) has been quite frank with the committee.

Because it consents to take a census of property, it believes that the young men of this community will more readily be persuaded to register themselves for military and industrial service when required. I am not attacking the Government for adopting that position. It gets itself into a difficulty where it is met with the argument that wealth, as well as life and labour, should be called upon to make sacrifices, and in reply it says that it is not going to exact any sacrifice for wealth commensurate with those which will be made by life and labour; and it adds, in effect, "" Buti f you are satisfied that we should have a register of wealth without taking any part of that wealth we shall go that far with you "".

It will be obvious to honourable members that if a police officer clothed with the power sought to be conferred by this clause visits the home of a citizen given to persons who subsequently are and asks questions, the individual concerned will not feel that he is in a posiof that authority. tion to refuse to furnish the desired information. A householder may be confronted by an officer, other than a policepower to enter homes and submit the man, and may not be aware of the power of interrogation possessed by that officer. to produce documents. This clause gives to To a great degree provisions such as this take away from the people the protection given by having a statutory form unalterable except by Parliament. If an officer is sent to a house to question an occupant then it is likely that that occupant will supply whatever information is desired without knowing whether or not the officer has been authorized to ask such questions. An ordinary working man confronted by a policeman who produces his authority under this bill, is not going gives to officers the power to seek inforto say, "" You have no right to ask me these questions "". I submit that the Government should rely upon the form. If anybody makes untrue statements in the form then a prosecution may be initiated and the prescribed penalty imposed. The Government should not supplement that form by the inquisitorial procedure provided in this clause. The spirit of this provision is quite contrary to that conciliatory spirit which has actuated the Minister in making the concessions which he has granted so far. Statements by the Minister have been to the effect that Parliament only would have the right to authorize the asking of questions Tinder this legislation. If an officer to whom power is delegated by the National Register Board is to have the authority to question a person who has made a return, or who has not made a return, then a great deal of the protection given by the Minister's amendments is taken away. I submit that this clause should not he agreed to. the honourable member for Bourke( Mr when the people are usually not in a norBlackburn) I have strong objection to this clause, the effect of which will be to taken of the atmosphere of hysteria to permit an officer of the Crown to enter premises and interrogate occupantsa power that this Parliament should not be prepared to give, particularly in view of the fact that authority is given elsewhere in the bill for the National Register Board to delegate its authority to any officer. The Labour party knows from experience that authority is very often found to be incompetent and unworthy Apart from that aspect, however, I am strongly of the opinion that no officer should be given occupants to questioning, or to force them an officer power to ask questions which are not provided for in the bill. The Minister for Defence( Mr Street). has seen fit to amend earlier clauses in order to satisfy objections raised by. honourable members, and he gave an assurance that the schedule would not be altered or added to unless Parliament were consulted. I understood that the questions to be asked were to be confined to those appearing in the schedule, but this clause obviously mation far and above anything contemplated in this measure. As the honourable member for Bourke pointed out, this authority might be invested in police officers. Honourable members know from their reading of court proceedings how often authority is abused by such people. In the course of their ordinary duties, police officers are bound by law to inform persons whom they interrogate, that they are not bound to answer questions, and that they are entitled to have a legal adviser in their presence when the .questions are asked. Unfortunately, there is no such provision in this bill, and officers might endeavour to intimidate people in order to obtain information not provided for in the schedule. The officers themselves might not know that they are not entitled to ask certain questions. Again there will probably be some officers who, knowing that they have not the requisite power, will seek by intimidating methods to go further than this legislation permits. This legislation is supposed to be availed of, not at a time when all is cool and calm, but at a. time of national crisis, mal state of mind.

[Quorum formed. | for Defence) [4.22] -This clause provides that the Commonwealth Statistician or any officer, authorized by the statistician may ask questions and require the production of documents for the purpose of properly carrying out the provisions of this bill.

That is the basis of our freedom, of which we boast so proudly. We want to be assured that the officers who take this census are men who can be trusted. [ record my protest against the proposal, and I hope that the Minister, in the interests of national unity, will withdraw the'measure altogether. -The Minister for Defence( Mr Street), and the Prime .Minister( Mr Menzies), by interjection, defended the clause on the ground that it is a reproduction of a section in the Census and Statistics Act, under which, they say, the officers will have the same power as it is proposed to give them under this measure. which they have mentioned provides for the periodical taking of a census, and a periodical collection of statistics. In connection with the census, tlie collector may, if invited to do so by the occupier, help with the filling in of the form, and he may ask questions relating to matters set out, in the form. It is a limited provision. I am referring to section 14 of fhe act, which is as follows:Every person shall, to the best of his knowprepared to answer any questions put to ledge and belief, answer all questions asked him by a collector necessary to obtain any information required to be filled up and supplied in the house-holder's schedule. Part IV . of the Census and Statistics Act deals with the collection of statistics. The obligation on a person to furnish statistics is very different from the obligation which will be imposed on persons under this proposed legislation. Under the Census and Statistics Act the citizen is obliged to furnish information upon which statements, reports and other publications may be made regarding certain matters. legislation, the obligationis to make statements from which certain records may be made regarding man-power, &c, but also upon which the individual may become subject to certain liabilities that lie does not want. The person who furnishes statistics regarding population, employment, exports and imports, &c, is not imposing on himself any ulterior obligation. Once he has made the return, he is finished with the matter. No personal consequences can follow to him from making the statement. Then, -in section 19 of the Census and Statistics Act, the Statistician, or any. officer appointed by him, may enter a workshop, mine or place of employment to inspect and make inquiries. No obligation is imposed in that section to produce documents, but even if it were, the next point of distinction is this: the officer who makes those inquiries under the Census and Statistics Act is directed by the act to take an oath of secrecy. That requirement is omitted in this bill, because it is clear that the officer making the inquiries is not to keep the information secret. He may be directed to disclose it to the Minister, or to any officer whom the Minister appoints. Therefore, the Census and Statistics Act The act, does not afford a precedent.. . The Prime Minister said that the person questioned may say to the officer who asks improper questions, "" You have no authority to ask me that""; but how will the man questioned know the extent of the authority of the questioner; or, for that matter, how will the policeman himself know the extent of his authority? It is well-known that a poor man, whose house is entered by a policeman, is usually him if he can honestly do so. -When I heard the Minister attempting to make a comparison between the Census and Statistics Act and this bill, I felt that, he was going back a-long way in order to justify .the action of the-. Government. The Census and Statistics Act was passed in 1905, and there have been some subsequent amendments. The purpose of that act was to collect information for civil purposes. Such -information is collected Under this proposed in most civilized countries in the world, and relates to such matters as population, employment, occupation, &c, required for statistical purposes. The atmosphere surrounding the taking of such a census is very different from that which will surround the taking of this census.

Tbe argument of the Minister falls entirely to the ground in the light of the explanation of the honourable member for Bourke, and the Minister does not seem to have anything else with which to justify his position. For instance, there is no provision in the Census and Statistics Act, regarding the production of documents. There is a provision in that act for imposing an oath of secrecy on officers, but tliere is no such provision in this bill. the bill? make provision for the imposition of an oath of secrecy. to me to be a mass of contradictions. The contents of one clause do not square with the contents of another. Honourable members can imagine the legal arguments that could take place regarding the rights of officers under this legislation. As for testing the powers of officers, concerned about the intrusion of clause we all know that the great majority of those who will be affected by this legislation will not have two "" bob"" to test anything under the law. They would have to submit to the bullying of the officers taking the census. The Minister in charge of the bill will not be policing it throughout Australia. For my part, T resent very strongly the suggestion that an officer of the Commonwealth Statistician's Department is to have the right to come into my office or home and turn over my documents and records, and examine my pass-book. ber's proposal is that there ought not to be any means of inquiring into the truth of the returns is on the parties concerned to furnish information.

I leave the matter at that, and hope for a satisfactory reply from the Minister for Defence. It seems rather an indication of perversity on the part of the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) that he is not prepared to make a common-sense concession in regard to a clause-afte r all, it is only one clause in the bill-iwhic h has excited so much opposition and necessarily so much acrimony.

270,Mr Brennan (Batman) [5.8],"law-abiding people of this country. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) raised a question as to whether we are prepared to test tbe truth and accuracy of a return already furnished. There are many acts of Parliament in this country which impose obligations on the citizens, notably the Income Tax Assessment Act. I speak from, memory, but I do not think that honourable members will find any parallel to this clause in the Income Tax Assessment Act, though for specific and proper purposes it gives wide powers, and it is very important that truthful returns be furnished, and there is a strong incentive to inaccuracy and suppression of truth. I confess that there is a good deal of evasion of the truth in high places, but, generally speaking, the people of this country manifest an extraordinarily and almost universal respect for the law of the land. A significant, example of that is offered by the compulsory voting law, and the small number of persons who leave themselves liable for not obeying that act, although the penalties are .smaller than those provided in this bill. Under the Pensions Act there is an obligation on. the general public to give information to the pensions authorities, and I am sure that you, yourself, Mr Temporary Chairman, can equal my experience of receiving letters from the Pensions Department requiring me to supply it with information relative to the property of an individual who has made application for a pension. The method adopted there is the method of a polite letter, but that letter bears upon its face the stamp of authority and contains, perhaps, a significant reminder of the section under which the request for information is made. The information is usually supplied if it is within the knowledge of the person asked. It assists in the administration of the act and incidentally assists the person who is an applicant for the pension. Mark the significant difference in this hill ! This clause questions, or suppress facts or be guilty does not come into operation until a subject of the King has presumably complied with the law and furnished a return. It is not specifically directed against a person who has not sent in a return. It may be applied against a person who in good faith has sent in a return, and at that stage the Statistician is empowered to authorize some person, any person, no matter what his status may be or how inferior that status may be, to call upon another person, presumably in the privacy of his home if he is not to be waylaid in the public street, and require him to produce papers and to answer questions. To my mind it is a terrible thing that a kind of irregular and secret court should be set up in which some subordinate officer will become an inquisitor and back a citizen up against the wall of his own home perhaps and demand that he answer all questions that are put to him -becaus e there is no test of relevance, necessity or importance of the questions; nor will there be any method of testing, at a later stage, the validity of the proceedings. No one knows better than you, Mr Nairn, from your wide experience of court procedure, that the evidence of even a subordinate official who carries the stamp of officialdom is received in a police court with more readiness than that of a private individual. The private individual is generally unskilled and inexperienced in court procedure. He becomes confused and frightened. For this reason, also, the court, almost of necessity, accepts the evidence clearly presented by an official. Sometimes heavy penalties follow the evidence of these officials against private citizens. This bill has awakened the antagonism of a very large section of the general community, which the Opposition has not hesitated to manifest. direction. continue to do so. We object to this clause on the ground that it is not even necessary. No reasons have been advanced in support of it except those given by the Prime Minister. It has been suggested, however, by innuendo, that some persons may tell lies in answer to of evasions. Eveni f the clause were not in the measure, penalties could be imposed for that kind of thing. This provision, as a matter of fact, is a very severe, obnoxious, and objectionable "" extra "".

How can it be said, except on the balance of evidence from a number of witnesses, that one man is telling the truth and another man is not telling it? Corroboration of one kind or another is essential. In all the circumstances, I hope that the committee will reject the clause. We have no assurance that competent persons will be appointed to discharge these onerous and objectionable duties. Moreover, who is to decide whether the questions asked are proper or improper? How can the person being questioned satisfy himself on that point? How is he to know whether the documents which he is requested to produce should be produced? Is a man, if requested to do so, to produce his riage certificate, if he be married, or the title deeds to his property? Apparently a man may be required to produce any and every document in his possession, and for that reason I regard the power to be conferred by this measure as far too wide. There is no guarantee that officers selected to carry out the inquisitorial work of this National Register Board will be acceptable to the witnesses, or persons who are to be examined. Imagine, for instance, authority being conferred upon me to make inquiries into the affairs of, say, for instance, the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Henry Gullett). How would that honourable gentleman like me to ask him the questions which are provided for in this bill and perhaps others which are not specified? Should he refuse to answer these questions he would be arraigned before a court, and possibly the position would arise in which I , as the authorized officer, would give evidence that the honourable gentleman had said certain things or had refused to produce documents. Sir Henry Gullett on the other hand might deny the evidence given by me. 'That, I suggest, is a most vivid illustration of the situations which may arise under this legislation. The word of one man is as good as the word of another. That the rights of the people should be safeguarded not only by providing that the officer carrying out the inquisition must be acceptable to. the person who is to be registered, but .also by allowing the person required to answer questions to insist upon the presence of an adviser. In my opinion, people would be justified in resisting an officer who is repugnant, to them or whom they may not like. Why should I be called upon to produce all documents which are in my possession? I might be asked who my grandmothers, grandfathers, aud great-grandfathers were, and it might be revealed that one of my ancestors was a pirate out of Penzance. Such arbitrary inquisition will not be acceptable to the people of Australia, because it is not in accord with the Australian conception of democracy. I am satisfied from information which has been conveyed to me that in this opinion, I am backed up by. a vast, majority of the people. Consequently I birth certificate, or his maram opposed to the clause. take very strong exception to this clause. A portion of it which honourable members should certainly not be willing to support is that under which powers may be delegated to "" any officer"", because these powers are not specifically defined.

This clause still permits the delegation to officers of power not fully specified, and serious injustice may be caused by those officers acting in a way which may greatly prejudice the position of citizens who are questioned under the provisions of this bill. I strongly urge the Minister.to review this clause. It is quite evident that even he has serious doubt as to the wisdom of conferring this wide power, and must realize the seriousness of situations which may arise. ister should look into this phase of the",45,Chairman Mr Prowse Compel Certain Individuals To Furnish

He must recognize that' there are portions of this clause which make possible situations which may alienate the feelings of a large section of the community. The liberties which we possess and the freedom which we enjoy have been won by hard effort and bitter suffering, and we should not be justified in permitting the Government to adopt arbitrary power of this character. This legislation provides for the delegation of wide powers not merely to ordinary departmental officials but also to other persons unspecified. I protest strongly against the action of the Government in refusing to reconsider or withdraw this clause, because I feel it subverts the right of freedom to the citizen, and is likely to place upon officials, not clearly defined, very grave responsibilities. Endless litigation may be caused. The clause is very badly drafted, and does not give a clear interpretation of the Government's intention. No parliament should be prepared to sanction this delegation of power, and I feel that the Minister is rather unfair in expecting this committee to agree to such a proposal. I hope that, even at this late moment, he will be prepared to give further, consideration to this matter. Is he fully satisfied that the conditions which prompted him to accept amendments in other parts of this bill do not also apply to this clause? Action on the part of officers to whom power to administer 'this clause is delegated may go beyond the legitimate enforcement of the law. It is a dangerous clause and the Minister is not justified in asking the committee to accept it. | Quorum formed.] There are three ways under which the Government could obtain the desired information. The first is by means of the questionnaire set out in the schedule; the second is by questions asked in accordance with regulations; and the third is th< reprehensible method sugj gested in this clause of allowing any offibe permitted, and no protection would be cer authorized by the Minister to ask an unlimited number of unspecified questions. ""Whether members are in favour of the bill or not, there might be something to be said in favour of allowing the questions set out in the schedule. The Minister asked the committee to amend the previous clause by deleting the power giving to some authority the right to extend the questions beyond those mentioned in the schedule. Of his own volition, he submitted an amendment which had the effect of limiting the number of questions to be asked to those provided, for in the schedule, by the deletion of the words "" or the regulations"". Now he asks us to accept a clause giving to an officer power to ask unlimited questions, and to demand the production of documents. There is nothing in the bill that would limit the right of this officer to ask any questions he might desire. Why should the committee limit the right of the Executive to frame questions by regulations, and yet give to some individual power to frame questions of his own? It would be entirely illogical to give to a servant of the Crown, a right that would not be given to the Parliament or the Executive. The bill contains no reference to the standing of the various officers who would operate under this measure in the various States and in the territories of the Commonwealth. As the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) pointed out, the officer who would be made a grand inquisitor, and could ask questions that even the Executive would be prevented from asking, might be a garbage remover -it Darwin. If these officers were men of standing in the community, one would still object to the granting to them of even limited unspecified powers, but, in the territories of the Commonwealth, particularly, powers would be given to certain unspecified officers of unknown ability and standing in the community which would be denied to the Parliament, and even to the Cabinet itself. Why should these persons be given the right to pry into the intimate personal affairs of the people? Clause 19 would at least, limit the number and nature of the questions that might be asked; but, by the clause under the consideration of the committee, unspecified questions would afforded to individuals who might become the victims of inquisition.

An even stranger provision in this bill is this: A boy of under 21 years of age and over IS years of age who fails to notify a change of address will be liable to a fine of £50 or imprisonment or both. Under the Electoral Act the adult who fails to notify his change of address is liable for the first offence to a penalty of 10s. and for the .second a penalty of £2. Such discrimination between adults and boys is absurd, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider this matter before the bill is sent to the Senate. I direct the attention of the committee to the fact that in the War Census Act of 1915 the power to authorize prosecutions was reserved to the Minister, whereas in this bill a prosecution can be launched with the consent of the Minister or a person authorized by the Minister. I see no reason for the departure from the scheme in the 1915 act. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr penalties to the person. The powers that Holloway) has pointed out, the provision in the 1915 act was a sort of safeguard. NowI come to clause 27. This empowers the Government to make regulations not inconsistent with the act and necessary or convenient to be described. The word "" convenient"" is of the greatest significance. It means in effect that, so long as the Ministry does not go outside the powers conferred by the act, it can make any regulation it likes. I can cite an opinion by Mr Justice Isaacs, afterwards Chief Justice, to that effect. followed in subsequent cases. ter is reminded of the opinion he says it has not been followed 'by other judges. setting one opinion against another. That does not mean that the opinion of Mr might have said: "" If you go to the war, Justice Isaacs is wrong. In fact, hfe went with the majority in the case to which I refer. Whatever other judges may think, whatever the Minister says, no one can fail to attach great weight to the opinion of one of the greatest lawyers of the English-speaking world. Justice 'Isaacs, in the case of Gibson v. Mitchell, saidThose words in that collocation mean necespresent employers. It should be sufficient sary or convenient from the standpoint of administration. Primarily they signify what the Governor General may consider necessary oi convenient, and no court can. overrule tliat unless utterly beyond the bounds of : reason and so outside the power the act. consistent with the act. It is within the power of the Governor-GeneTal to consider a thing necessary or convenient unless it is expressly forbidden by the act or is unreasonable in the opinion of a court. That is the effect of the opinion expressed by Mr Justice Isaacs with the support of the other judges in the case cited. . . then the words are unnecessary. provision inserted in the bill, the Minister calls to his aid an act that collects information and is not involved in the Government is taking to make regulations are too wide, even though we have succeeded to some extent in-cutting 'them down. The next matter to which I refer, is the schedule. I submit that it is undesirable that a person who is rendering a return should be called upon to state the name, business address and business of his preent employer. For what reason can he be required to furnish that information but, to enable the Commonwealth Government to get at him through his employer? The only interest that the Commonwealth not Government can have in knowing that John Smith is now employed in Alcocks butcher's shop in Union-street, Ascot Vale, is that it, can exert pressure on his employer. That kind of thing was done in 1915 when men were compelled to enlist, by pressure put, on their employers. An. employer I will keep your job, but if you do not go, I cannot keep you. Pressure is being exerted oh me. If you do not go -to. the war, I shall have to dismiss you or-otherwise I shall lose my business connexions.""

I wish to refer to clause 26 which is the most objectionable provision in the bill, and that is saying a lot when we consider the others. This clause throws the onus of proof on to the individual in the event, of his being prosecuted. Paragraph a statesThe averment of the prosecutor . . . . Hliall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to tlie contrary. In other words, a person who is called upon to furnish a return will have to prove that he sent in one, .and he is guilty proves himself innocent. That is contrary to the legal practices followed for prosecutions throughout the British Empire. Such a provision is found only on rare occasions. I do not know where the Minister found it. I can see what is going to happen. A return sent in by a person, is mislaid through the inefficiency or incompetency of the department, or some other cause. What will happen? He will receive a note asking him to explain the omission to comply with the act. He will be prosecuted, and will have to attend a court and give evidence and prove that he. sent in a return. The prosecution will not have to prove that the defendant did not send in a return. graph 6 of clause 26, how could you prove community. negligence ? mains in the bill everybody will have to take another person as a witness to the fact that he posted the document.

The bill is loaded against persons who have to furnish returns, and this provision shows, what a poor chance they would have if .they were prosecuted.

Under this clause the individual has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he sent in a return. until he prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence was committed. ter's interpretation. man have in a police court where the magistrate always believes the witnesses for the prosecution?

In consequence of the sympathetic treatment they are accorded by the Commonwealth Government, they are not being required to satisfy every provision of the law in regard to the language test. Consequently many of them are unable either to read or to write English in any effective way. Some of them will go to live in group settlements among their own countrymen who also may be quite ignorant of this law. It is unfair to subject such people to this hardship. The penalties are, of course, exceptionally severe. I again protest against the action of the Government in obliging young men, who have no stake in the country and no vote for the election of either Commonwealth or State Parliaments, to fill in forms under the provisions of this measure. I say again that all the Government desires is to be in a position to call upon these young fellows to offer their bodies as a sacrifice on the altar of war if war should occur. This is particularly unjust to those to whom this social order has refused either a decent standard of living or regular employment. Clause 23 requires males between the ages of 18 and 21 years to notify-changes of address in a prescribed manner. This means that every unemployed young man who decides to leave the parental roof so that he will no longer be a burden upon his parents, will be obliged to maintain a regular connection with"" the authorities or suffer severe penalties. travel by way of motor car rides as much as 100 miles a day at times in searching for work, and it seems that they may be arrested almost anywhere and called upon to prove that they have furnished certain information to the authoriplaced. I can only conclude that he has ties. They will be placed in an impossible position. How can they prove that they have posted either their original return or letters notifying change of address? a witness with them every time they post letters. this matter in a common-sense way, and it would be impossible for them to do as the honourable gentleman suggests. the intelligence of the court if they were .taken to court. they have if an individual like Judge Lukin were on the bench? The whole thing is definitely wrong. The averment of the prosecutor is declared to be sufficient evidence that certain things have been done or not done. That puts the accused person in a most unfair position. This provision, with some slight changes of verbiage, has been lifted from the Crimes Act. Obviously therefore the prosecutor simply has to charge a person with a certain act of omission or commission and it is as good as proved. The provision of clause 25 respecting the despatch of census matter through the post is unsatisfactory l>ecause, unless an article is registered, it is unlikely that any satisfactory evidence can be furnished that it has been posted. He has tp prove that he posted the letter. We all know how sometimes letters do not reach their destination. the Commonwealth Statistician would have to show that he had not received it. the Minister has excited the greatest astonishment of his King's Counsel colleague on his right. rect. every person charged with an offence is Some of these young men deemed to be innocent until he has been proved guilty. That principle will not apply under this bill. I have always regarded the Minister as a fair-minded man, and I should regret to think that my confidence in him had been misbeen misled in some way, and does not understand what the clause means. Only to-day I was called to interview the postal officials in the post office in this building to make inquiries about a legal document which I had posted to the Probate Office in the Supreme Court. In formation had been received that it had not been delivered. No one suggests that I am to blame for that, yet under this proposed law, a young man who may have posted his return in good faith would be adjudged guilty simply because, the return had not reached the Statistician.
