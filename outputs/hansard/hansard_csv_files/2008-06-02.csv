At that point, I was speaking about the benefits of the different funding to seniorswhether it be through the internet or through the bonus payment-and the government’s commitment of $50 million to introduce a national seniors transport concession scheme for seniors card holders by 1 January 2009. On this note, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate someone in my electorate, Mr Kevin Hamilton, the former member for Albert Park, who has been campaigning on this particular issue from the days when he was a state member-from the eighties right through to the early nineties. One of the first people to see me when I was elected was Kevin Hamilton, who came to lobby me on this issue. I am very pleased that the Rudd Labor government has delivered, after many years of many governments discussing this issue. We have committed $50 million to introduce the national seniors transport concession scheme for seniors card holders by 1 January 2009. It is very important for seniors who are travelling interstate to visit families, friends or grandchildren. Previously, their discounts were not acknowledged, and sometimes you would think we needed a visa to cross a border in this country. It is about time we conform things across all states. I am a very big believer of that. We are also committed to reintroducing the Commonwealth dental scheme to aid those who are young-teenagers-and those who are older to access affordable dental care. There are hundreds of elderly residents within my electorate who are currently languishing on dental waiting lists, and have been for many years, who are in need of care. I have supported and will continue to adamantly support the reintroduction of this scheme. We are going to end the blame game. The government has also reached an agreement with the states to provide $150 million to help 25,000 patients get the elective surgery they need. Too many people are currently waiting too long to get that surgery. This $150 million commitment will help slash the number of people waiting longer than clinically recommended for elective surgery, and $13.6 million of that will go to South Australia to deliver an additional 2,262 procedures.

This government is aware that we need to address the needs of everyone-including the aged and those on fixed incomes, such as the disability support pensioners and carers-within our society. We have a commitment to assist those in need to help them make ends meet. I have listened to and will continue to listen to the concerns and questions of all residents of Hindmarsh and I commend the appropriation bills to this House. course encompass the first budget of this new Labor government, I have to say that, maybe having been spoilt by the previous budgets presented by the honourable member for Higgins, Peter Costello, this budget came across as a very big disappointment. It was a very pedestrian performance. I think it really did show that it is classic Labor and we are back to the old style. There was a lot of talk and hype beforehand about this being a tough budget but, when we look at the so-called savings and new spending, we find that it is two for one: the spending has gone up $2 for every $1 that was saved. As I say, this is a classic Labor budget. In fact, we have seen an increase in spending and an increase in taxes. In actual dollar terms, it is the biggest spending and biggest taxing budget Australia has ever seen. Really, there were two messages that came out of this budget. It was a squandered opportunity. The first budget in a new parliament is the time when a government can really do some important things to set the scene, but very little has happened. We are very much seeing a return to many of the old Labor values. As the Australian of 17 May put it: ‘We are going to see a sharp rise in central state planning.’ In other words, rather than a fresh face, we are very much seeing a return to the old Labor values. When we look at some of the aspects of the budget, we have to remember a bit of the background of the people who have been directly involved. If we look at both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, we see that they were trained in Queensland, where they learned the art of parochialism and the art of ultrapopulism, and I think that is really showing through in their whole approach to this budget. But the thing that really does concern me, as someone who represents a regional seat in this parliament, is that we have seen a real push back to city values and a city focus. This should not come as a surprise if you look at the make-up of the Rudd cabinet. There are 20 members of the cabinet and, if you do a quick analysis, you find the answer to what I have said: eight of the cabinet ministers come from Melbourne, six come from Sydney, three come from Brisbane, one comes from Perth, one comes from Adelaide and one-the token regional representative-comes from Newcastle. That is seriously scary, and I think it shows in the thinking of these people, who are very much city oriented. This is going to be the shape of decision making for this current government. It will be very much a city based thinking government. I remind honourable members that, when we look at the make-up of the House of Representatives, we see that, of the 150 members, a third of them come from regional Australia-and yet there is one token regional member in the cabinet. That is a bit scary. For people who do not live in the major cities, it is a very big worry. This government inherited an economy that is the envy of most of the world. If ever a government was given a golden chance to really do something, it was this government. It inherMAIN COMMITTEE",153,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008
241,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (4.09 Pm),"In speaking to the appropriation bills, which ofited this economy and yet already we are seeing a budget that has almost got shades of the Whitlam era. And the events of last week will add to a major decline in public confidence in the ability of this government when it comes to addressing the real challenges that we are facing in the world today-and let us not underestimate it: there are some very big challenges. When you look at the specifics of this budget, you see that there is a $40 billion infrastructure fund but there are no details; there is no convincing explanation of how it is going to be spent. There is a very real fear about how funds will be spent. I think we have already seen some indications in the by-election in the seat of Gippsland that this money is being saved up to be used not for the most important challenges of infrastructure in the country-whether it be for new roads, transport links or other infrastructure-but to try and buy some votes in the lead-up to the next federal election. the pronouncements made in relation to this infrastructure fund, it was pretty obvious that a lot of it could be used to paper over the mess that some of the state governments are making. When I say ‘paper over’, I mean that there is no indication that there will be proper accountability. Having been involved in trying to get some accountability into the way the states spend money, I assure honourable members on the other side that, despite all the rhetoric, the states are very good at covering up what they are really doing. I do not believe that this government will find it any different. Looking further at the approach of this government: it has been suggested that there are already more than 100 task forces, reviews and white papers which have been announced. In other words, it is going to be government by review. No real decisions are going to be taken in so many areas; already they have all been deferred. In some cases, these deferrals are for more than three years, so the government does not want to make a decision in the whole term of this parliament. I think that is a huge disappointment for the Australian people: to think that they elected a government and that this is its approach. While these reviews may be very interesting, the only thing they will do in the short term is create a lot of highly paid jobs for some of the mates of the government, as we have seen in so many of the states. It is very much an indication of what we see in the states’ approach to governing. Having limited time, I will quickly run through some of the more specific things in the budget. As I mentioned, it is disappointing. There is a lot of indecision and there is a lot of work on this thing called ‘spin’, which is going to be the hallmark of this government. It has been well-reported recently-not earlier but recently-that so much is being tailored for the 24-hour news cycle, and the budget reflects that in so many ways. We have seen some increases in taxes, but you could not exactly call them taxes which are in the main area. We have seen the ready-to-drink alcohol tax-and I will come back to that, because if ever there was something dreamt up a week before budget date to fill a gap then that must be it. There has been a 10 per cent increase in stamps announced. We have seen an increase in the condensate tax on gas fields. You could call none of this deflationary, despite all the rhetoric about inflation. Today the Prime Minister wound the rhetoric up a few more notches and talked about the ‘inflation monster’. Yet, when we look at the budget, we see that there are increased taxes in some areas that will really have a major impact on inflation.

243,Mr Hawker,"As my colleague points out, a slush fund. When we listened to some ofAnother announcement was the changes to private health cover. There is no doubt that not only will the changes that have been mooted put up the price of private health cover but they will put more pressure on public hospitals. I think people are going to lose on that both ways. Other prices will also go up-things such as the so-called luxury car tax. As I have mentioned, the spending is going to go up, so all the talk about inflation really does not match the detail of the budget. I look at a couple of other areas. The government made a lot of noise about climate change, but what have they done? They have cut the solar panel industry to pieces. People who make solar panels are virtually facing the prospect of going out of business. That is a local industry that has been cut to pieces. The government’s proposed emissions trading is nowhere in the budget or the forward estimates. Yet if, for example, there were a $25 a tonne carbon tax then that would add $10 billion to the tax on Australians. fuel. Then we come back to the whole question of the tax on the ready-to-drink market. I think this is a clear case of utter hypocrisy. It was put forward as a health measure, and yet when we look at it we see that it was all about raising more money. We have seen the reports in the papers and they show quite clearly that, as was predicted and as was reported last week, alcopop drinkers are ‘turning to spirits’. The report says that, while sales of the so-called ‘alcopops plummeted by almost 40 per cent in the fortnight after last month’s lightning tax hike on the drinks, any health gains have been offset by a 20 per cent jump in stronger, straight spirit sales’. Anyone could have told you that that was going to happen, and yet the government was desperate to find the money and then try and clothe it in the guise of a health measure. I cannot see how encouraging people to take stronger alcohol-and maybe or maybe not dilute it to the same amount of alcohol as ready-to-drinks-is in any way contributing to health. I do not deny that there may be a problem, but that is not the way you address it. So that is an issue with health. I want to turn quickly to two specific things. I mentioned the 5c increase in stamps. Some would argue that basic postage stamps have been 50c for quite a long time, but it just so happens-if you look closely in the budget papers-that Australia Post will pay a special dividend of $150 million to the government in 2008-09, as the Senate estimates were told last week. This, of course, is on top of the $300 million Australia Post already provides to the Commonwealth annually. But how much is the extra 5c going to raise for Australia Post? Guess what. tax collector for this government. So, again, the poor old consumer is being hit with this underhand approach-a tax grab-to try and make sure that the Treasurer can say, ‘That’s not a tax that I actually authorised.’ Well, what is it if it is not? we heard a couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister said in relation to this: We have done as much as we physically can … MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008

249,Mr Hawker,"A tax is a tax. I would like to come back to the whole question of fuel. AsWell, that did not work too well. Let me just remind honourable members that, since this government was elected-and up until a week ago-the price of petrol has gone up over 13c on average, and in the last few days it has gone up even more. That is an increase of 10 per cent. While I think that most of the public realise the underlying reasons for this, the public are also well aware that the Prime Minister went to great lengths to try and deceive them during the election by saying that with petrol prices it was the previous government that was not worried about the increase in costs and that if the Rudd Labor government was elected it would do something about petrol. Well, it has sure done something: it has announced Fuelwatch to watch the price keep going up. terjecting. It is not actually helping anybody. also make the point that there is a little windfall going on on the side with the increase in fuel prices, a windfall which people want to keep very quiet. Of course, the GST keeps going up, and so the states have got a little windfall. I notice that the government is very reluctant to talk to its Labor mates about the fact that they are getting a little windfall and that maybe they could think about how they might help motorists. It is a clear case of a government not being able to manage properly. I think that what honourable members ought to be well aware of is that it is having a massive impact out in voter land, but particularly out in the country. People must remember that, for most in the country, there is very little opportunity to use public transport and generally the fuel prices are already higher than they are in the city. I called in to fill up at a local petrol station last week and I asked the person at the desk how the impact was being felt. To my horror, I was told: ‘Well, you ought to be aware of just how much it is hurting. We now have people coming in and buying $7 or $8 of petrol because that is all they have the money for.’ That is how it is being felt. All the Prime Minister can say is, ‘We have done as much as we physically can.’ At the same time, when I was looking at the board at that petrol station, I saw that the price of diesel was 28c a litre more than unleaded petrol. When you look at it, it is not just about the direct cost to consumers in the regions; it also affects freight because all goods both to and from the regions have to be transported and, with the rail system so limited these days, most of it goes by road. I think it is clear that the government really has misled the Australian population in the lead-up to the election and has now been hoist on its own petard. But what I find quite extraordinary is that the Prime Minister has now decided that he has to do something, or be seen to be doing something, so he has gone to great lengths to talk about this thing called Fuelwatch. Fuelwatch is rather a curious thing. My colleagues from Western Australia tell me it is questionable whether it has had any impact over there. When you start to look at the fine print, you see that not only have four federal departments questioned its value but also one cabinet minister is strongly opposed to the introduction of Fuelwatch. And we read some of the comments made by the Chairman of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, Mr Graeme Samuel. He is reported in Friday’s papers as saying that in certain rural areas Fuelwatch could lead to potential collusion and cause higher prices.

252,Mr Hawker,"I am quite happy about the interjections; they do not worry me. I couldSo here we see yet again what I was saying right at the beginning: the cabinet of this government is a city-centric cabinet willing to push policies of very questionable value for people in the city, but for people in the country it could actually make things worse. I think that really brings it home to us that we have a government that is not interested in looking after people in the country, is not prepared to govern for people in all the regions but is very much governing for those who it feels have supported it in being elected. I think by any measure that is a recipe for bad government. Not only is it a recipe for bad government but it is also a recipe for a bad future for people in many parts of Australia. I think that the Australian public are just starting to seriously question which way the government is going. Let us come back to looking at some of the aspects of this budget in relation to the environment. I have mentioned the fact that we have seen the local solar panel industry devastated by a decision which they clearly had no warning of, which has already led to the loss of jobs and certainly has put these businesses under extreme strain. But look at some of the other environmental bodies, such as the catchment management bodies. I have two very good ones in my region and they have had cuts of effectively 40 per cent. These bodies are doing some excellent work in environmental management. The Community Water Grants, which provided up to $50,000 to local community groups to help them save water, have been axed, except for a small amount if you belong to a surf-lifesaving club. I do not know who is the friend there. Then we have seen what has happened in regional development with the on-again off-again treatment of local area consultative committees. I think history will judge this budget very harshly and it will judge the government very harshly because an opportunity has been squandered here. The government inherited financial advantages of the like that no government in my memory has ever inherited. Frankly, I think that history will show that in their first attempt they have seriously botched it-and Australians and Australia are going to be the poorer for it. 2008-2009 and related bills. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge a significant milestone for a company that has become an institution in my electorate of Bendigo. On the evening of 9 July 1858, what the Bendigo Advertiser called a ‘very numerously attended meeting’ was held at Abbott’s Hotel to discuss the formation of the first local building society. James Sullivan, who chaired the meeting, told the meeting that the object of the society was to encourage people to settle permanently in the locality. ‘Surely, every man of right feeling would rather see men living in comfortable houses than tents,’ he said. Of course, a building society would benefit not only borrowers but also savers, and Sullivan was worried about large sums of capital leaving the town in the form of deposits with other societies. Local accountant James Burnside moved: That it is considered expedient to establish a society to be called the Bendigo Land and Building Society for the purpose of enabling shareholders of such a society to become possessed of freehold and leasehold property or other benefits. One hundred and fifty years later, we know this institution as the Bendigo Bank. The bank has grown fourfold in the 13 years since its conversion from a building society: its customer numbers have reached 1.3 million, the number of employees has quadrupled to 4,000 and it has more than 400 branches. The bank’s founders believed that its prosperity would come MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008
253,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (4.29 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)from contributing to the economic and social well-being of the community in which they had chosen to live and work. That philosophy is still followed by the bank today, and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in its community banks. In the 1990s, when our major banks were almost daily closing country bank branches across the country, Bendigo Bank demonstrated its faith in regional communities. Community banks are owned by their local community and operate on a franchise from Bendigo Bank. By the end of 2007 there were more than 200 community banks across Australia, with over 615,000 accounts and $10.7 billion in banking business. They not only offer banking services to the community but through grants and dividend payments also retain capital locally for the community’s benefit. They have returned almost $17 million to their communities through donations and grants for local projects and paid more than $12 million in dividends to local shareholders. A further $36 million in operating costs is being spent with local businesses. Bendigo Bank today is truly one of the country’s most innovative and successful institutions. On behalf of all central Victorians, I would like to congratulate its staff, both past and present, its management-and, in particular, CEO Rob Hunt, who has been a major force in the outstanding success of the organisation-its directors past and current, and its shareholders on the superb contribution they have made and continue to make to so many communities across Australia. The Rudd government’s first budget sought to honour its commitment to wage war on inflation. With underlying inflation reaching 4.2 per cent in the March quarter, well above the Reserve Bank’s inflation target, the government delivered a budget surplus of 1.8 per cent of GDP-well above the one per cent target established under the previous government. Growth in real spending will be 1.1 per cent in 2008-09, the lowest rate for nine years. Over four years, the budget makes savings of $33.3 billion. Economic growth is forecast to slow in 2008-09 to 2¾ per cent. Treasurer Swan identified four key principles of his first budget: honouring election commitments, delivering for working families, investing in the future and beginning a new era of responsible economic management to sustain growth in challenging times. Key initiatives to deliver these principles included the $55 billion Working Families Support Package, an initiative including cutting income tax, reducing the cost of educating and looking after children, making housing more affordable, providing the Teen Dental Plan and making sure that grocery and petrol prices are competitive; $2.4 billion in additional support for older Australians and carers; $5.9 billion over five years for the government’s education revolution, with initiatives in the areas of early childhood education, schools, vocational training and higher education; $2.3 billion over five years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the unavoidable challenge of climate change; and $3.2 billion for a national health and hospitals reform plan to work with the states and ensure spending on health reflects the needs of the broader Australian community. To ease bottlenecks and allow infrastructure to support future economic growth, the Rudd government is providing significant funding for national infrastructure projects through its Infrastructure Australia program. Three new nation-building funds have been established-the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund-that will provide around $40 billion for future capital investments in infrastructure, MAIN COMMITTEE higher and vocational education and health to modernise and reinvigorate the Australian economy. This classic Labor budget delivers for central Victoria. It is the first federal Labor budget for almost 12 years and it certainly does not disappoint. It is a responsible nation-building budget that also delivers for working Australians in the finest Labor tradition. The budget was aimed at building a strong economy through responsible economic management and reining in the irresponsible spending of the former Howard government that had contributed to the current inflationary pressures. Central Victorians especially will benefit from several of the measures announced on budget night by federal Treasurer Wayne Swan. The government’s $55 billion Working Families Support Package will help people cope with day-to-day living pressures by cutting income tax, reducing the cost of educating and looking after children, making housing more affordable, providing a teen dental plan and making sure that grocery and petrol prices are competitive. That would be very much appreciated in my electorate of Bendigo and indeed throughout central Victoria. An average household earning $770 a week will have its tax bill cut by $20 a week from this July and by as much as $35 a week by 2010-11. Funding of $1.9 million for Bendigo’s Chinese precinct continues the Rudd Labor government’s record of delivering on its election promises to the people of Bendigo. Funding for other Bendigo-specific election commitments include the virtual critical care unit development, the redevelopment of Bendigo Health’s primary care centre and the business case for the Australian Military Mobility Centre, and central Victoria’s Solar Cities initiative had already been allocated out of the Commonwealth’s 2007-08 budget. The federal budget will help working Australians deal with rising cost of living pressures. This classic Labor budget is targeted at those Australians who have been working hard to build a future for themselves and their families but are now finding it harder and harder to balance the family budget. After years of neglect by the Howard government, Labor understands this and is taking action with its $55 billion Working Families Support Package. These tax cuts, which were promised during last year’s federal election campaign, have been targeted squarely at those who deserve them most: working Australians. Labor’s tax cuts provide substantial support to the many central Victorians who are in the lowand middle-income brackets. The effective tax-free threshold for low-income earners will go up to $14,000 next year and increase to $16,000 by 2010-11. Families earning the median income in the Bendigo electorate-that is, the median household income-of $40,000 will have up to $1,800 a year more disposable income from next July as a result of Labor’s tax cuts. In addition to the tax cuts, the Working Families Support Package delivers on other Labor election commitments by introducing an education tax refund to help parents with the costs of educating their kids, at a cost of $4.4 billion; increasing the childcare tax rebate from 30 to 50 per cent and paying it quarterly, at a cost of $1.6 billion; acting on the housing affordability crisis with a $2.2 billion package covering First Home Saver Accounts, the National Rental Affordability Scheme and the new Housing Affordability Fund; providing a teen dental plan at a cost of $491 million; a fairer Medicare levy surcharge threshold for individuals and families; and implementing the first ever national Fuelwatch scheme. MAIN COMMITTEE The Howard government just stood by while working Australians were hit with rising living costs. It has been left to a Labor government to take action to help them cope with the pressures of day-to-day living in these challenging times. The Rudd Labor government’s first budget also delivers on its election commitments to improve the education and skills of working Australians. Investing in our people is the best way to secure prosperity, spread opportunity and increase living standards into the future. This budget delivers on Labor’s commitment to an education revolution and includes $2.5 billion over 10 years for the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program; $1.9 billion over five years for 630,000 additional training places to boost the skill level of the workforce; and up to $1 million for computers and communication technologies in each secondary school for all students in Years9 to 12. A federal Labor election commitment for Maryborough was delivered recently with the announcement of a $500,000 grant towards a new complex care unit. The funding will be provided this financial year to allow Maryborough District Health Service to get started on delivering this much needed facility. There is also potential for additional money in 2008-09 as part of the health funding initiatives announced in this federal budget. This is a major investment for the Maryborough community. It will deliver a resource centre for integrated case management; a centre for the referral of clients requiring more intensive case management; a range of walk-in, walk-out specialist services not currently available locally; teleconferencetelemedicine facilities where diagnostic assessments can be obtained from the most appropriate specialists; a resource centre to help patients with self-management; and a centre for clinical placements of medical students from universities to help attract and retain medical professionals in the regional community. This funding is a clear example of the Rudd government’s commitment to rural and regional health services. All in all, I think Bendigo has done very well in the first six months of the Rudd Labor government. able to remain in the same chamber. I take this opportunity, in the great tradition of Animal Farm, where up is down and down is up and where eagles apparently have to climb trees, to point out to a Labor government so enraptured with their own budget that it is an old fashioned, lightweight, high-taxing, high-spending, standard-fare Labor budget. It is unremarkable in every extreme, except for the $15 billion in spending cuts announced to coalition programs and $30 billion in additional spending by the government-a net increase in spending of $15 billion. However you want to slice and dice the spin, this is an incredibly highspending budget. That, along with $19 billion of new taxes over the forward estimates, simply asserts what we know: old Labor is back, unreformed and clearly unrepentant. But what makes this budget worse is a range of irregular and highly undesirable accounting tricks. The CPI is used as a deflator rather than the non-farm GDP, as has been the case traditionally to try and keep the increases in spending down. Labor has used an unprecedented accounting move to artificially inflate the size of the budget surplus by a staggering $2.9 billion, by using second-round effects-adding in the expected income from an increase in skilled migration, something the previous government never dreamed of doing let alone actually put into practice. The evidence of this can be seen by comparing Labor’s costings for the migration program increases with the previous, Howard government’s costings. Under the MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008
254,Mr Robert (Fadden) (4.40 Pm),"Madam Deputy Speaker, what a distinct pleasure to beHoward government, budget decisions to increase migration were accompanied by a costing of all the resulting expenditure on health care, welfare, education and other migrant based services. The Howard government budget measures never claimed a matching increase in income tax revenue-never claimed it. In technical terms, such a costing would be called a second-round effect. It was not claimed in the past because of the fundamental difficulties in trying to make accurate costing assumptions. It is just not possible. So First World nations across the globe, provided with good advice from their treasuries, do not add in second-round effects, except for-you guessed itthis Animal Farm government. Just in case the members opposite cannot quite pull it together, I will quote Treasury’s own costing guidelines issued for the 2007 election which stated: As with existing arrangements individual costings may take account of direct behavioural responses, but will generally not incorporate second round effects. The costing will focus on first round effects and the direct budgetary consequences of policies. Now, I am not too sure where the Labor government were when Treasury issued that advice. I can only assume they were in the same position they are in now with ‘foolwatch’, or should I say Fuelwatch, when the four major departments all issued advice that was ignored. I guess Treasury’s advice was ignored with respect to second-round effects, as advice with respect to ‘foolwatch’ has been ignored. The Labor government decision to increase the migration program by 37½ thousand places involves a gross cost of $2.4 billion. In a Howard government budget, it would have appeared as an expenditure item of $2.4 billion. However, by including income tax receipts of $2.9 billion-that is, the second-round effects-Labor’s budget has turned a $2.4 billion expenditure into a supposed saving of half a billion dollars. That is an amazing sleight of hand, in the best of language-a $2.4 billion expenditure has been turned into a $500 million saving by adding in a $2.9 billion second-round effect. I can only imagine that Labor will try to argue that it is entirely appropriate to include the income tax of migrants in the migration measure. But then they must answer: if Treasury did not claim this revenue source in the Howard government budgets-if they made it patently clear, pre-election, that this was not the way business was done-why the sudden change of rules for a Rudd government unless, by sleight of hand, they are trying to increase the value of the surpluses and, again by sleight of hand, trying decrease the percentage increases in expenditure in the forward estimates? I suspect this is just one of many budget tricks that Labor have used to hide the fact that their supposedly tough, inflation-fighting budget is absolutely and utterly a fallacy. But it does not stop there. In changing the deflator from non-farm GDP to CPI and adding in second-round effects you have nothing in the forward estimates with respect to the emissions trading scheme. This trading scheme will have an enormous impact on our economy. It will increase the prices of literally everything. Even if the carbon price were simply $25 a tonne, which some believe may be at the low end, it would generate at least $10 billion in additional federal government revenue-an enormous new federal government tax. Yet it is nowhere to be seen in the forward estimates. And the tax increases do not stop there. On they go with new taxes on condensate. Condensate is a form of light crude associated with gas accumulations. It is used for making plastics and cosmetics, although mainly for making petrol, and it is exported 100 per cent. Condensate MAIN COMMITTEE produced in a state or territory or inside the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia and marketed separately from a crude oil stream was free of excise in 1977. This was to encourage exploration and production from onshore and predominantly offshore gas fields that did not have the same profitability as the main crude oil produced in Bass Strait. Thus it was aimed at the development of petroleum resources in the mainly gas-producing areas of the Cooper Basin and the North West Shelf. It was designed to allow high-risk projects that companies would not normally put exploration dollars and cents into, allow them to recoup profits over time and amortise risks and early losses. It was an incentive for exploration-and suddenly an arbitrary tax with no warning and no consultation is thrown on it. The move has changed the investment environment. In his second reading speech on 15 May the Assistant Treasurer stated: As the development of petroleum fields in this region is now reaching maturity, and the world prices for non-renewable energy resources are high, there is no need to retain this generous concession. Given the similarity between condensate and crude oil, the two commodities should be taxed in a similar manner. The PM stated in response to a question from the shadow deputy leader on 27 May: On the condensate arrangement, it was actually instituted back then in order to provide encouragement for the industry ... That is the first point. Secondly, that is quite a long time ago, and since that time the industry has not only become profitable and been established; if you look at the return to the industry concerned, its actual profits in recent years have been not just in the hundreds of millions of dollars but in the billions of dollars. What this seeks to do is to actually close a tax loophole which has existed for a long, long time and, furthermore, to use those taxation measures to underpin the robustness and the financial integrity of this budget ... This is not a tax loophole; this is not a generous concession. If it was, the previous Labor government, which racked up $96 billion of debt-that Labor government-would have closed the tax loophole. The previous Labor government had from 1983 to 1996 to close all the tax loopholes they could possibly find, but they did not. If the Hawke-Keating government did not close a supposed tax loophole, those opposite should not roll out the Animal Farm view that this is a loophole and, ‘We, Labor, the saviours of the universe, have now closed it to help poor struggling, battling families.’ What Labor have done has fundamentally changed the exploration investment architecture. Companies that would generally not consider putting dollars and cents into exploration projects of some risk may now walk away because, as far as they are concerned, this Labor government will change the rules without consultation, at a whim. The PM went further; he did not just stop there. He said: So condensate and all the other measures in the budget represent an exercise in financial integrity. Clearly, the Treasurer and I-or the Prime Minister and I-went to different MBA schools when it comes to financial integrity. This has got nothing to do with financial integrity. They are raising a tax-an excise designed for light crude oil-that punishes exploration. The fact is that the most easily explored compressed LNG-liquid natural gas-fields are those that have condensate. Those that are most easily able to generate a profit to offset large risks and costs are those with condensate. Yet the Minister for Resources and Energy and MAIN COMMITTEE Minister for Tourism, when speaking on 13 May, on the third reading of the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008, stated: The amendments in this bill are required to ensure that the regulatory regime continues to support the development of our vital oil and gas reserves. As we all appreciate, this issue is of critical importance to our nation. Whilst Australia is very well endowed with gas, with more than 110 years of gas reserves at current production rates, we only have about eight per cent of known oil reserves remaining at today’s consumption rates. Consequently, Australia is looking down the barrel of a $27 billion trade deficit in oil and condensate by 2015. Therefore, it is very important that we work to open up more frontiers. On 13 May, the Minister for Resources and Energy said, ‘It’s important we work to open up more frontiers,’ and yet this budget clamps down on the very frontiers we want to open up by saying: ‘Here is a new tax; let us discourage you from opening up frontiers.’ It is fundamental-the ignorance of the Animal Farm budget that is before us! This has got nothing to do with financial integrity. One minister is saying, ‘We want to open up more frontiers and encourage it,’ and, at the same time, the PM wants to punish those who open those same frontiers. It is an absolute and utter farce. It is a tax grab-nothing more, nothing less; call it what it is. It is the same with the ready-to-drinks-the alcopops. It is simply a tax grab. Treasury’s own figures indicate that the drinking patterns will not reduce. All of the anecdotal evidence coming forward shows quite clearly that young people are now getting heavy liquor and heavy spirits and mixing their own and, indeed, it may be making binge drinking worse. The rise in the luxury car tax, from 25 to 33 per cent, is simply aimed at grabbing revenue, because apparently anyone paying more than $57,000 for a car is rich, and this Labor government does not like rich people, apparently. Increased passenger charges are apparently good for tourism, as are increased visa charges. The hide of some of the changes in this budget! In one move, the government gave $20.7 million to veterans through a range of minor changes and, at the same time, in the budget, it took away $110 million from veterans. The cabinet, in which no-one has ever worn a uniform or served a day in uniform in their lives, thought they would take away, with the stroke of a pen, $110 million from veterans by increasing the partner pension age from 50 to 58.5 and then stopped partner pensions 12 months after separations. But it continues. The level at which the Medicare surcharge is paid was increased from $50,000 to $100,000. Treasury’s own estimates show that something like half a million people will leave private health insurance. I can only conclude that the Labor government does not like private health insurance. Here are some facts. Private hospitals treat four out of every 10 admitted patients in Australia, representing nearly one-third of all days in hospitals. Private hospitals perform the majority of surgery-56 per cent. In my electorate of Fadden, the fastest-growing electorate in the nation, there are 49,724 people with private health insurance. With predictions that almost 10 per cent of insured people will drop out of the system, that is almost 5,000 people dropping out who will then be required to go into the public system. Let us have a look at the public system, shall we? Let us look at Queensland Health-that incredible organisation of efficiency and effectiveness-and their quarterly public hospital performance report for the March quarter of 2008. The Gold Coast Hospital is the only public hospital that services the sixth-largest city in the nation. With at least 5,000 people in my electorate and a similar number in the two electorates of Moncrieff and MacPherson, 15,000 more MAIN COMMITTEE people will draw on the requirements and services of the Gold Coast Hospital. It has the thirdhighest number of people admitted to hospital: 17,344. It services the most people in Queensland in an emergency department: 24,613-that is, 30 per cent more than the next highest hospital, which is Royal Brisbane Hospital. The Gold Coast Hospital performed 2,650 elective surgeries, and came third after Royal Brisbane and Princess Alexandra hospitals. Whilst the move on the Medicare surcharge will throw at least 15,000 people-and as many as half a million across the nation-into the public system, let us look at the elective surgery numbers. According to Queensland Health’s report, right now there are 36,030 people on waiting lists and a further 159,000 people waiting to get on the waiting list-and this government thinks it is economically prudent to raise the Medicare surcharge and push more people into public hospitals. Right now Queensland Health is failing the people of Queensland. Right now there are 36,000 people on a waiting list for elective surgery and 159,000 people waiting to get on the waiting list, and this government wants to push half a million people into the public hospital system. If this is not a new chapter of Animal Farm, I do not know what is. The Regional Partnerships program has been axed and yet, in an embarrassing backflip, Minister Albanese was forced, because of Channel 7, to fund almost 100 of the 116 projects that had been funded but contracts not yet signed, because of the genuine community need for them. Hundreds more projects were pending-projects for which people had spent time, money and effort over many months and years to put a submission forward. What about those that are pending? What about those that have not yet been approved? What is the minister going to do about them-including $1½ million for the Coomera and Oxenford youth centre in my electorate of Fadden? It is the fastest-growing electorate in the nation, yet there is only one youth centre servicing the whole northern growth corridor. It is the fastest-growing area in the nation, and what does the minister say about a simple grant to extend the youth centre? He says sorry. Yet, in the same Animal Farm chapter, he funds $14.5 million for sound insulation of a school in his own electorate. Fort Street High School has long campaigned for noise insulation, but the school is outside the agreed excessive noise area and it has been ineligible. In what can only be described as something out of the ordinary, Minister Albanese has approved funding for a project in his own electorate that does not meet his government’s own guidelines. No departmental review. Likewise Labor’s Tree of Knowledge-no departmental scrutiny. With one breath, Labor takes money away from the Royal Flying Doctors, from disabled playgrounds in Bundaberg and from youth centres in my electorate, but he is happy to fund noise insulation in the minister’s own electorate because it is politically expedientunbelievable! And the politics of envy does not stop. The solar panel rebates have been lost. If you earn over $100,000 the rebate is gone, and the solar industry across the nation is now collapsing. Family tax benefit B is lost for families earning over $150,000. The childcare benefit is lost if you earn over $110,000, yet the top tax bracket is $180,000. I ask the government: what is rich? Is it $57,000? Is it $100,000, $110,000 or $150,000? Is there any competent narrative to this budget, or is it simply a grab for tax-simply amending the various rules using secondround effects to inflate the budget? This is just more spin and more hype and it is appalling. Yet what is truly horrifying is banking $40 billion of Australian savings, which exist thanks to the work of the member for Higgins, in a fund that can be invested at the Treasurer’s discretion, without any definition of what the investments might be expected to return and withMAIN COMMITTEE out any parameters as to financial returns. There are no guidelines; there are no rules. When there are no rules, no guidelines, no investment returns and no prudential regulatory things around it, it is one thing and one thing only-it is a slush fund. That is what it is; that is what it should be called. In the world I live in and do business in, you would not raise a brass razoo if you went to the market with something like the fund that $40 billion is being put into. This is not a nation-building budget. This is a farce. This is a joke. This is the last chapter of Animal Farm. (Time expired) support of the appropriation bills today. In deference to the number of members wishing to speak in this debate, I will keep my contribution brief. It is a particular pleasure to stand in this chamber during Queensland Week to make some comments on a budget that has been delivered by a Treasurer from Queensland. The reality of the 2008 budget is that it is a good budget. It is an economically responsible budget through fiscal conservatism. It delivers immediate benefits for all Australians, it delivers on Labor’s election commitments and it provides for the future. This budget has been framed in the context of world economic conditions. It has been framed in the context of the global credit crisis and a US economy in decline-the principal economy in the western world. It has been framed in the context of rising fuel and food prices domestically. It has been framed in the context of a rising Australian dollar, with the implications that that has for manufacturing and tourism, amongst others. The budget has also been framed in the context of the former government’s legacy: eight consecutive interest rate rises, the highest inflation in 16 years and the lowest productivity growth in 17 years. Notwithstanding those, it is fair for us to acknowledge that, as a consequence of the mining boom, this budget has also been framed in the context of an Australian economy best placed in the world to avoid tumbling into the abyss that appears likely to swallow up other Western economies. Avoiding that pitfall requires a budget just like the one presented by Wayne Swan-a responsible budget. I want to turn very briefly to the specifics of this budget as they relate to my electorate of Longman. This budget has delivered some valuable and long-overdue assistance to some sporting bodies in my electorate. The Burpengary Jets junior rugby league club, at Burpengary, will receive $130,000 to install lights on its fields. The Jets are a large and very successful junior sporting club and a tribute to the voluntary efforts of those who have guided them over the years, and I am very pleased that we have been able to provide them with this assistance. All members would understand the value of lighting playing fields and the difficulty that volunteer groups have in raising the funds to do so. The Caboolture Rugby League Club-the senior rugby league club-is to receive $110,000 for additional lighting and for facility upgrading. The club is known as the Snakes, which reflects the meaning of the place name of Caboolture; in the language of the traditional owners, Caboolture translates as ‘place of the carpet snakes’. We are not terribly venomous but we can frighten you! The Snakes compete with distinction in the Sunshine Coast Rugby League, which has night-time fixtures as part of that competition. This money will assist them to make sure that their facility is of the standard that is required for that competition. The Caboolture Sports Softball Association will receive $200,000 for the installation of batting cages, for the lighting of an additional playing diamond and for canteen and toilet faMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008
255,Mr Sullivan (Longman) (5.00 Pm),"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak incility upgrading that is required by the local council. In the interests of transparency, I indicate that softball is a sport in which I am heavily involved, although not with the Caboolture association. The new batting cages, in particular, will be welcome among participants, as there are presently no facilities on the north side of Brisbane and from our area have come two players who will shortly represent Australia at the Olympics. This budget also delivers a valuable addition to community facilities in the electorate of Longman, where $250,000 will be spent installing solar panels to provide water heating for the Deception Bay Aquatic and Fitness Centre and to extend the useability of the facility through what are thankfully, in Queensland, short winter months. These panels will be installed on the roof of the adjoining PCYC and common sense would dictate that the panels will also provide hot water for both the aquatic centre change rooms and those of the PCYC. This budget also provides for valuable new health facilities in my electorate of Longman to service the north side of Brisbane-and I speak of $7 million for a 12-chair renal unit to be included in the North Lakes health precinct and currently being constructed by the Queensland government. The dialysis needs of patients on the north side of Brisbane, the Moreton Bay region generally and the electorate of Longman particularly will be much better met through this initiative. I know from discussions with a number of people who require these services that they are very appreciative of this new initiative. Valuable new road infrastructure funding-not new funding but new directions-will see overpasses completed at Boundary Road, Bribie Island Road and Pumicestone Road as they cross the Bruce Highway through my electorate, each of them subject to heavy traffic these days. There is also valuable assistance for local small business. The Caboolture Business Enterprise Centre is to receive recurrent funding of $300,000, or $1.2 million over four years, to provide business advice and services to microbusinesses and small businesses in our region. The enterprise centre has been operating since 1994, offering a range of services to the local business community. This funding will allow those services to be extended. Again, for the sake of disclosure, I announce that I spent a considerable period of time, seven or eight years, as chairman of that group, the enterprise centre having been an election commitment and funded as a consequence of the 1992 Queensland state election, when I became the local state member. Just to wind up, the budget has not been without disappointments, and I am sorry the previous speaker, the member for Fadden, is not here to hear me say this. It is in many respects a disappointment that the Regional Partnerships program has been discontinued. Not all of the projects were bad or rorts; in fact, the majority were no doubt valuable to their communities. This makes the rorts even more regrettable, because, as a consequence of the program misuse, some really good local initiatives are on hold-and I think that you will find that you have the support of most members of the Labor government in that regard. There were good projects delivered under this program; however, the rortsmade the continuation of this program untenable. For the benefit of the member opposite, I note that I am part of the committee that the minister has sought to review the Regional Partnerships program; he has given us a very short space of time in which to do it. I think he is serious.

257,Mr Sullivan,"We have mentioned it to the minister, I promise you. The rorts haveguernsey as a consequence of the discontinuation was a lift for the Deception Bay Sports Club, in the electorate of Longman, which would have allowed people with mobility disabilities to access the club. It is regrettable that this could not go forward, and I can say today to the people of Deception Bay that I will be working hard to make sure that that project gets up when the program’s replacement is implemented. Also-and I say this with a little more of a smile-I regret that, despite the former Prime Minister’s sneak visit to Bribie Island to promise $1 million for the local hospice association and $1.1 million for respite care on Bribie Island, that was not carried through in our budget. Clearly, these were election commitments of the side that did not win the election and, just as Labor’s election commitments in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004 did not get up in Costello budgets, these had little chance. However, both of these projects are worthy of consideration in the context of the Bribie Island community, and I will be seeking to progress these. In conclusion, there are a couple of national initiatives in the budget that have ramifications for what I consider to be my program locally. The first of these is the health and hospital fund, which is relevant to my concern that we start now to plan for a new hospital in our area so that it can come online when the existing hospitals are no longer able to cater for the growth that is occurring there quite rapidly. The second is the Education Investment Fund, which has relevance given that I am concerned to see that we develop within that part of south-east Queensland a comprehensive university to serve the young people. Finally, this budget delivers on Labor’s election commitments, and it also points towards the future-a better future for all Australians and particularly for those dependent on the government for their income. Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party made a lot of promises to Australian families. Particularly, they promised to bring down petrol prices, to bring down grocery prices and to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Six months later, after the new government brought down its first budget, the Australian people have their answer to what the achievements of this government or its methods of operation are. We can see that Labor has failed on all counts. All of the issues it has raised it has failed to take any action on. The government’s first budget has now been delivered under the most fortuitous circumstances of any new government in the history of this country. This country has a pretty impressive history-108 years. No government has inherited such a strong fiscal position as the new, incoming Rudd government. I will quote the Australian commentator Janet Albrechtsen because I like this quote. She says: If ... giving money and power to government is like giving whisky and car keys to a teenager, then the Rudd Government has just been handed the finest whisky money can buy and the keys to a Maserati. Labor are drunk behind the wheel on this one. Instead of us having a luxury sports car, they are driving the economy into a wall. We have silly cost-cutting measures that do not do anything apart from feign that these guys are strong economic conservatives. This is the budget that was dressed up as being tough and rugged-and no-one was more hairy-chested than the Treasurer-but what we ultimately got was a high-taxing, highspending budget. We have no really clear direction on taxation policy from this government.

260,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (5.11 Pm),"In March last year there was a change of government.Apparently the largest taxation reform in my lifetime was the tax reform brought in under the Hawke-Keating years, when we moved to a sales tax as opposed to a myriad of smaller taxes-an extraordinarily complex and difficult system for people to navigate. Apparently that government now stands condemned by the new government for not doing enough about tax reform. I find that extraordinary. Since coming into government, the government has established more than 100 reviews, summits, agencies and offices. Of course what it has not done is save Australians one cent on the price of fuel at the bowser or one cent on their weekly grocery bill. What it has done instead is raise new taxes on alcohol, raise new taxes on motorcars and increase the cost of private health insurance and energy. When you increase the prices of things, that increases inflationary pressures. In his Adelaide surrender, which I think was really extraordinary for a man who has been in office for all of six months, the Prime Minister said: ... we have done as much as we physically can to provide additional help to the family budget ... He said that on 22 May this year. Extraordinarily, before the election the Prime Minister was running around talking about petrol prices, grocery prices and the high cost of living, and then he said, ‘The buck will stop with me.’ Now apparently there is nothing further he can do, which is really quite an extraordinary surrender. If the government had actually tried to do something then the Australian people might be a bit more understanding but, considering they have not, I suspect that the government will be judged very harshly. Australian families deserve a government that can make the tough decisions that are necessary to protect the Australian economy. This budget does not do that. It is a high-taxing, highspending, old-fashioned Labor budget. It does not fight inflation, because you do not fight inflation when you are pushing prices up, and it will not do one thing to help families battling with high fuel prices and high grocery prices. Really, the only positive measure in this budget, the real core of important things that were delivered in this budget, is the tax cuts that were of course proposed by the then Treasurer Peter Costello and photocopied by Kevin Rudd. When he did that, he exposed the fact that he did not have a tax policy during the election campaign last year. The Treasurer would have had us all believe that this budget was going to cut spending in order to put downwards pressure on inflation. You have to wonder, Madam Deputy Speaker, if the Treasurer actually knew what was in this budget, because it did not do anything of the sort. Spending has gone up by $3 billion in the current financial year and by $14.9 billion over the forward estimates. Labor have cut $15.2 billion off coalition spending programs, but then they have spent more than $30.1 billion on new Labor spending programs. Some of the former coalition programs that were scrapped brought many millions of dollars into my electorate of Stirling. I note that the previous speaker-I cannot recall his seat, sadly-talked about how the Regional Partnerships program was actually, it turns out, a very good program after all. Even though the government have trashed it and scrapped it, apparently he now wants that money for his electorate, which I find rather extraordinary. The money that was spent in my electorate was through programs such as the Investing in Our Schools Program, which supported local schools in Stirling and supported new and innovative research projects. It helped fight crime, something that my constituents are particularly concerned about, and it helped schools and community organisations in Stirling save hundreds of millions of dollars of local water-something, of course, that is on everybody’s mind but is MAIN COMMITTEE particularly so in Western Australia, where it has been extraordinarily dry. Many of these grant recipients relied on these grants coming from the federal government, because of the complete failure and incompetence of the Western Australian state Labor government, who do not seem to have any idea about what to do about rising crime levels or what to do about the decaying state of local schools in Stirling. So the scrapping of these federal programs that made up for state government incompetence dealt a heavy blow to my local community. I would like to talk a little bit about that later. All up, Labor’s high-taxing policies have added $19.5 billion in increased revenue over the forward estimates. The preliminary economic modelling that we announced on budget night estimates that Labor’s new taxes and charges could add up to 0.4 percentage points to the CPI. The Treasurer has long been saying that ‘it is a hard day at the office’ to achieve a surplus of 1½ per cent of GDP, but what was revealed in the budget is that this year the surplus will be $16.8 billion, which is 1.5 per cent of GDP, but it would have been 1.7 per cent of GDP without Mr Swan’s intervention. So he could sit on his hands and get 1.7 per cent, but really his actions have meant that it is only 1.5 per cent. Next year, in 2008-09, the surplus is estimated to be 1.8 per cent of GDP. Again, this is a legacy of the strong economic management of the Howard-Costello years. On climate change, Labor talk about the need for an emissions trading scheme; however, the budget papers make no provision whatsoever for the revenues that may flow from such a scheme. I would just remind the House that this scheme is supposed to start in 2010. What we do know is that it will be terribly expensive. It is going to cost taxpayers. It is going to be a new tax, and the government will have a windfall from this new tax, but they do not seem to have any idea about how to spend it-and, if they do, they are not prepared to share that information with the Australian people. I want to turn to the infrastructure fund, this incredible slush fund that has been announced in this new budget. We have $40 billion in the slush fund, although we have no idea what sort of economic return it is supposed to deliver to the Australian people. We have been given no details about how this money might actually be spent. That is an extraordinary indictment of this budget-$40 billion and they do not know what they are going to do with it. They have tried to pretend that it is like the Future Fund when of course it is not, because you can spend the capital as opposed to the interest. That was the whole point of the funds that were set up in the Howard-Costello years: they spent interest rather than capital. But the infrastructure funds can be spent completely-and, apparently, without too much regard for due process. Prior to the election we heard a lot from this government about core business and the sorts of pressures that were on working families, as the Prime Minister likes to talk about. These included the rising cost of living, petrol prices and the rising cost of owning a home-all of which are serious issues. But Australian families need their government not only to have the ability to raise issues-because anybody can do that; it is easy to walk into the House or walk into a press conference and raise an issue of concern-but also to actually do something. There is a big difference between raising an issue and addressing an issue. Sadly, the government has already surrendered. It has raised the issues and, in some instances, has made some gesture-which does not work-and has then moved on to the next thing, and the Prime Minister says, ‘Oh, well, there’s nothing more I can do.’ MAIN COMMITTEE I will look at one specific instance-because it occupied a lot of time in the House last week and I suspect it will throughout the course of this week-and that is petrol prices. What we have seen from this government is really quite ludicrous. The government raised the issue of petrol prices but it had no idea about how to actually address it. It needed to come up with something so that it could say to the Australian people, ‘We’ve tried to do something about it.’ So the government came up with this ludicrous Fuelwatch scheme, which in some cases may actually lead to consumers paying more for petrol. This is the sort of thing that we see from Kevin Rudd and his government. Fuelwatch has been brutally unmasked by the resources and energy minister, who actually said to his colleagues that it will leave battlers out of pocket. He said it is anticompetitive and a waste of money and it will fail Australian families. As a Western Australian I know a little bit about this scheme because it has been in operation in Western Australia since 2001. I have spoken to local petrol retailers about it-in particular, one independent retailer who has his station just around the corner from my office. I asked him what he thought about FuelWatch and he gave me an example. I have raised it in the House before but it is such an absurd example I think it is worth repeating. He tried to lower his prices to compete with one of his large competitors. This guy is an independent, a sole trader, who pumps fuel just to keep people moving through into his workshop. So his margins on fuel are tiny. He tried to bring his price down in relation to one of his competitors, who is from a major chain, and he was told by the administrators of the scheme that he would be fined if he tried to do that. I think that is really quite extraordinary: an independent retailer being fined for offering cheaper petrol to consumers. And this is the scheme that the Prime Minister and the Assistant Treasurer want to take from Western Australia and make nationwide. I will now turn to grocery prices, because I think we are going to be hearing a lot more about this issue, as we see that there is now going to be some sort of grocery watch mechanism. Money has been allocated in the budget to create that. Again, bringing down grocery prices was apparently core business for the Rudd government. In fact, in the Australian this year the Prime Minister was quoted as saying: The buck stops with me. How quickly things change! Mr Rudd was further quoted as saying: We’ll all be expecting to see positive programs, positive measures that will have the effect of bringing grocery prices down. That is what he actually said at the start of this year, and the Treasurer of course said very similar things. But already we have the Prime Minister, within the space of less than four months, surrendering on this. It really is extraordinary that these large promises were made and the government had no idea about how to deal with them. I just might turn to local issues in the minutes I have remaining because the electorate of Stirling has been severely hit by measures contained within this budget, these ill thought out measures. Firstly, this budget fails to deliver on promises that were made to my constituents prior to the last election. Two that are very close to my heart are the overpasses where Reid Highway intersects with Mirrabooka Avenue and where Reid Highway intersects with Alexander Drive. Sadly last week there was another fatality at the Mirrabooka Avenue intersection. Because of the high incidence of fatalities occurring at that intersection, I campaigned very MAIN COMMITTEE strongly within the previous government to allocate some money towards that overpass, funding which was subsequently provided. Labor matched these promises during the election campaign. They said that they would build these overpasses. In fact, with the Alexander Drive overpass, I think they said something along the lines that ‘this overpass can start tomorrow’. Yet in this budget they have failed to deliver any money towards building this overpass. They have turned their backs on my local community essentially because they did not win the seat. The unsuccessful Labor candidate, on behalf of an elected Rudd government, promised unconditional funding through AusLink2 for the building of an overpass at the Alexander Drive intersection and promised consideration of the Mirrabooka Avenue and Reid Highway overpass. Hundreds of local families signed my petition to see these overpasses built, and during last year’s campaign I secured $20 million towards the Mirrabooka Avenue and Alexander Drive overpasses over the Reid Highway. I think the local community will be very disappointed with the Labor government, which pledged to fund this project but within a few months have already turned their backs on that promise. But I will continue to fight for these important local projects. I have mentioned in this House in the past the Commercial Ready program. Its cancellation will affect some extraordinarily good small businesses within my electorate who are doing world leading research. In particular, I would like to mention Structural Monitoring Systems. This is a small engineering firm based in Osmond Park that has the interest of all the major players in the aerospace industry around the world-it has the interest of Airbus and Boeing-because it has developed a system to monitor the structural integrity of aircraft, a system that is far more lightweight and far more simple than existing systems. So there it is: a little company doing world-beating research and it has had the rug pulled out from under it by this government. ThatI think is a most extraordinarily short-sighted measure. Structural Monitoring Systems will keep punching on because it is an extraordinarily aggressive little company, and I do not doubt for a second that it will succeed in commercialising its world-beating technology. But what a ridiculous and short-sighted thing for this government to do. The Commercial Ready program is an extraordinarily successful program and, if this government and the minister had any sense, they would be actively campaigning to have that program reinstated. I want to turn to Investing in Our Schools. The scrapping of that program will also cause a son, around one of my local schools, St Andrews Grammar in Dianella. St Andrews Grammar has almost completed construction of an amphitheatre with benches and seating, security lighting and covered walkways, as well as an upgrade of their car park. The school’s principal, Craig D’cruz, is very proud of the construction of a music and drama room and the refurbishment of a classroom into a canteen and uniform shop. All of these projects were funded under the former coalition government’s Investing in Our Schools program. Extraordinarily, this program has been scrapped by the Rudd Labor government. This was a program that went into my local schools and did something constructive, in conjunction with the local P&Cs and the local school communities. It funded things like an upgrade to sporting facilities and new IT equipment. It did the sorts of things that you would expect a state Labor government to do-but which they seem completely incapable of doing.

262,Mr Forrest,"Refurbishing toilets.program has done within my electorate, let alone in other electorates such as that of the member for Mallee and other members. Government members of course will know how successful this program has been, yet I have not heard a peep out of any of them when talking to the appropriations bills about the damage that cutting this program is doing. Another very successful program that has done a lot of good within my electorate is the Community Water Grants program. Money was allocated under this program to Our Lady of Lourdes School, Deanmore Primary School, St Kieran Catholic School and Glendale Primary School. They received grants to fund measures to save water within their own local communities and they have done it very successfully. I commend them for what they have done. Extraordinarily, no other local schools or community organisations will be able to do the same thing, because this program has been summarily scrapped. Finally, there is the National Community Crime Prevention program-a program which is very dear to my heart. This program funded things such as CCTV at a local shopping centre in my electorate that is, quite frankly, suffering a plague of crime. The small businesses at the Nollamara shopping centre can no longer get insurance because their businesses are so readily graffitied and vandalised. So we came in, the Howard government, and said, ‘This is a problem. We’ll address this problem by putting CCTV at the shopping centre.’ That CCTV has been erected by the local council. Scrapping this program is just another example of the short sighted measures that are taken in this ill-considered and diabolically bad budget. (Time expired) tions debate allows wide-ranging discussions, because it relates to budget bills. TonightI want to utilise that convention of a wide-ranging debate, and I rely on the appropriations in relation to the Attorney-General’s portfolio for the matters which I propose to raise. For the first time in 18 years, I rise to criticise my state colleagues in the New South Wales government, in particular the Attorney-General’s department, for what I have said publicly is a mean-spirited and counterproductive response in relation to the transfer of a prisoner from Hong Kong under the International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997. Rachel Diaz, who is in custody in Hong Kong, and her parents are constituents of mine. Rachel was convicted in relation to drug matters and is currently serving a sentence in a Hong Kong jail. Her date of birth is 28 December 1987. She is a classic example of a person who comes within the provisions of the International Transfer of Prisoners Act for repatriation back to Australia and to a New South Wales prison to serve the remainder of her sentence. The matter has received some publicity and there is some information on a particular website on the internet. An article about the case appeared in the Australian on Monday, 19 May 2008. I wrote to the New South Wales Attorney-General in relation to this case on Monday, 21 April 2008. As of today’s date, Monday, 2 June 2008, I have not received a reply. My submissions to the New South Wales Attorney-General were strongly in favour of the New South Wales government exercising its discretion and agreeing to the repatriation of Ms Diaz back to Australia to serve the remainder of her sentence. The basis upon which the New South Wales government is prevaricating is that they are seeking $10,043 in costs for sending two people to Hong Kong to bring her back. That is the condition of their consent. The article quotes a spokeswoman for the New South Wales Attorney-General, saying: MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008

264,Mr Melham (Banks) (5.31 Pm),"As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, the appropria‘These matters are considered on a case-by-case basis, but generally the state Government does not think it is reasonable for NSW taxpayers to have to pay to transport Australians who have been convicted of crimes overseas back to prisons in NSW.’ I put it to the New South Wales Attorney-General that there were three grounds for the waiver of this payment. One was the cooperation that Rachel Ann Diaz gave the authorities. I have to say this: she gave cooperation way beyond what was required. There were two statements from a particular police officer attached to my submission. The first was from Detective Senior Constable John Bamford, as he then was, dated 27 July 2006, and on 26 October 2007 he made a statement when he was a detective sergeant. What he pointed out was that Diaz provided a frank and accurate account of her involvement in the attempted importation of heroin into Australia. Diaz also spoke of the role played by the accused persons, Kim and Zhang, in the offence. Diaz listened to a number of intercepted telephone calls involving her and she identified the voices of other persons involved in the offence. Diaz was also able to provide an insight into the exact context of those calls. She was fearful of possible reprisals, should she speak to the police or give evidence, but she chose to do so regardless. She was brought back to Australia to give that evidence. We are told in the statement that, on 27 June 2006, Kim and Zhang changed their pleas to guilty. ‘In my opinion, the evidence of Diaz was a contributing factor to this change of plea’-that is what the detective said. What he is in effect saying, if one reads between the lines, is that it was the credible evidence given by Ms Diaz that led to Kim and Zhang pleading guilty. Why do I raise this? For this reason, Madam Deputy Speaker Vale: as you well know, given your background, if you run a drug trial in New South Wales with two accused, it can be a very expensive exercise. I estimate that this young woman saved the state of New South Wales more than $1 million by providing credible evidence which led to a plea of guilty instead of a fully-fledged trial, and the New South Wales state government repays her by trying to extract just over $10,000 for her return to Australia. She is a woman without means and her family is without means. Her family is $60,000 in debt as a result of assistance they gave her during her legal process in Hong Kong, particularly with her mother spending time over there. The medical evidence in relation to her shows that she was sexually assaulted as a 12year-old and that that has had a profound effect on her behaviour. So she is a vulnerable individual. Within the last two weeks, someone in an adjoining cell committed suicide, so Ms Diaz has had to be transferred within the system because of the impact of that incident on her. In relation to the hardship of the family and their inability to pay, the New South Wales government is relying on this family either borrowing money-the father has offered to make payments over time and that has been rejected-or someone coughing up the $10,000 to bring her back here. I will come to that in a short moment. Having read the International Transfer of Prisoners Act, I am a little bit angry in relation to the cost recovery, considering my interpretation of how the New South Wales government could get cost recovery, as against trying to impose this further burden on the Diaz family. The whole input behind this act is not cost recovery. No other state or territory in the Commonwealth requires cost recovery or consideration of it-only the New South Wales government. Ms Diaz’s mother, as a result of these trials and tribulations, and other trials and tribulations, has real problems in relation to her medical condition, to do with depression amongst other things. IfI am wrong about the International Transfer of Prisoners Act on this, then I will put my hand up and say I am wrong, but I MAIN COMMITTEE do not think I am. Having been a former Legal Aid solicitor and a public defender in New South Wales, I do know how to read an act of parliament and interpret it. Section 27(4) of the International Transfer of Prisoners Act says: Each minister concerned is to advise the Attorney-General in writing as to whether the Minister consents to the transfer on the terms proposed as soon as possible after receiving the notification. The cost recovery section is section 51 of the act and is headed ‘Recovery of costs and expenses of transfers’. Section 51(1) says: The terms agreed under this Act for transfer of a prisoner or Tribunal prisoner may, if the Attorney General considers it appropriate, include terms relating to the recovery of the costs and expenses reasonably incurred in transferring the prisoner or Tribunal prisoner. It sounds reasonable, which is what New South Wales says they are relying on, I believe. It is section 51(2) that is the clincher: If any costs or expenses in respect of money recovered in accordance with such terms were incurred by a State or Territory, the Commonwealth is to reimburse the State or Territory concerned. That is section 51(2). I will read it again: If any costs or expenses in respect of money recovered in accordance with such terms were incurred by a State or Territory, the Commonwealth is to reimburse the State or Territory concerned. WhatI am suggesting is that, if New South Wales are mean enough to want to get their $10,000, they should go to the Commonwealth and get the recovery from the Commonwealth-because it is a federal prisoner, in relation to the definitional section, that is coming back to Australia-and not go the family. That is something that I discovered just in preparation for saying something here in parliament this evening. I am appalled that, if I am right, it means that Ms Diaz has continued to be incarcerated on a false fact in terms of cost recovery-that New South Wales could have got it off the Commonwealth instead of putting the weights on her family. One of the things I also said in my letter was that this goes to her rehabilitation in relation to the balance of sentence-the ability of the family to continue to visit her and help her before she comes out of prison in New South Wales when she is repatriated. I call on the New South Wales government and the New South Wales Attorney-General to reconsider their position. I think it is unacceptable and poor public policy to put pressure on the family to come up with this money-or, if not the family, some anonymous donor. If they want their money, come to the Commonwealth. If not, cease and desist because, in the particular circumstances of this case, the cooperation of this prisoner has resulted in the New South Wales government saving over a million dollars in not having to go through a trial for the ringleaders of this event. Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the parliament and those present in the chamber for your indulgence in allowing me to give what is a wide-ranging speech during the appropriations debate. It is the first time. I have done it in this form against my colleagues. The New South Wales Attorney-General is a good and decent man. It is just that in this matter I believe he has a blind spot and I strongly disagree with him. Ms LEY (Farrer) (5.43 pm)-It was most interesting to hear the concluding remarks of the member for Banks. He did not mention the budget, but I fear and feel that what he talked MAIN COMMITTEE about was possibly even more important and I would also at some stage appreciate the opportunity to talk about such matters. I appear here today on behalf of my constituents. In opposition it is very easy to point the finger of blame, to complain and whinge, after a budget. I have sat on the government side of the Main Committee and listened to opposition members talk about budgets that we brought down, and a certain level of tedium entered the room very early on in the piece. I really do not want to do that, but I do want to point out what I feel the effect of the budget will be on the constituents I represent. There are 94,157 voters in the electorate of Farrer, and 47 per cent of them have private health insurance. To me, the fact that so many in an area that is not wealthy have decided to take out private health insurance and do whatever they can to protect themselves and their families from the touch-and-go nature of some of our public hospital systems is a credit to them. The one thing that I am most concerned about with this budget is the effect that the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge threshold will have on those people, because out of the total number of voters who have private health insurance there are almost as many singles as families. I know that not all those singles will be young and healthy-some of them will be older and less healthy-but a fair proportion of them will be young and healthy, and I was quite surprised when I saw the statistics showing that so many were singles. What we are predicting, and what the modelling is predicting, is that when this measure comes into play a lot of young people-and often, of course, healthy people-will decide to chuck in their private health insurance because they are going to go on the public system. That means automatically that those who are left in the private system have to meet the costs for everyone. They are to some extent, of course, socialised across the system. The reason that the previous government made such an effort to bring people in early by effectively giving them benefits and encouragement to do that was in order that everyone could realise, if they could, a lifetime in private health insurance: you do not need it as much when you are younger and your contributions are relatively modest but, of course, as you get older, you do need it and you are more of a drain-and I do not like to use that word, because older people have a right to use our health systems, but you use up more of the resources that are available-so those two times of your life balance out. What we are going to see is that older people are going to struggle to meet increasing premiums at a time when they will not be able to afford them and that younger people are going to say, ‘HereI am in the casualty system of my local hospital, and I demand to be treated because I have a right to public health just the same as everybody else.’ I do not know whether state health ministers are happy with this decision by the federal government. All of the intelligence tells us that they are not-that they are most unhappyand I am not surprised, because the thing that state governments come under fire for the most is health, and anything that goes wrong with the public health system is automatically a serious problem, as it should be, for state health ministers. We only have to look at the high jinks in New South Wales going from bad to worse to realise what, if we dumped what may be another 200,000 people into the public hospital system, that would do to its efficiency and effectiveness. I am sorry for those who will have to bear the brunt of such a failed policy. MAIN COMMITTEE I will move from health insurance to talk about the nature of funding in the electorate generally. As members would know, I have a very rural electorate, as does my colleague the member for Mallee, who neighbours me on the Victorian side of the river. Mallee and I constantly talk about water in this House. I made some remarks the other night that I am sure he would have endorsed had he been here. We will look at western New South Wales, and I will use a statistic to illustrate the point. This area is not all my electorate-some of it is in that of the member for Calare. Forty-two per cent of the state of New South Wales is west of, probably, Balranald, in the Western Division, and it contains only five per cent of the population. That becomes progressively less of an extreme distribution as you move closer to the sea, but it does illustrate the effect of the city-country divide, because in that 42 per cent of New South Wales that has five per cent of the population we have very poor roads, for obvious reasons. We just do not have the population that uses them, so we are constantly battling to get decent roads to drive our cars on. The measure that the government has brought in about luxury cars has been, frankly, quite insulting to the people whom I represent, because to consider a four-wheel drive, and the necessary additions that you would have to make to such a vehicle in order to safely traverse these roads, a luxury is absolutely crazy. As the Leader of the Opposition, Brendan Nelson, put it, if you are in your 10-year-old Mitsubishi queuing up at the petrol station, being told by the Rudd government that the reduction in excise of 5c a litre that we suggest is meaningless and does not matter to you, and you are trying to balance the family budget, you would be insulted too. There are two things: the luxury car tax and the fact that the government thinks that the cost of fuel is not something that matters a great deal to these people on relatively low incomes. In fact, the government believes that these people would not really appreciate a drop of any description. That is absolutely crazy. I have to be honest: it is a subject that absolutely consumes people everywhere you go. IfI say to them, ‘What about a 5.5c a litre drop?’ they say, ‘Of course we’d like more, but anything will help.’ I think sometimes governments lose touch with the small amounts that matter in a family’s fortnightly budget. Small amounts do matter in my electorate because we have been struggling with the drought for a long time now. In some areas we have had 10 years of lower than average rainfall. Particularly in the southern Murray-Darling Basin we are battling over the scarce resources that the Murray-Darling system offers us. There is no doubt at all that we really cannot achieve very much until it rains. The storages in the Snowy Mountains are woefully low and woefully inadequate. The arguments that governments are having with irrigators in rural communities are particularly sad and distressing for those on the receiving end, because they know that, although the government is ‘offering’, to put it in its politest possible terms, to buy their water by coming into the market with a $3 billion chequebook, all they are buying is air space in a dam or empty buckets of water. Perhaps in the government’s mind-but certainly not my mind-it is to help them out. Until we actually know what an allocation will be in any year, the government does not know what it has bought. What it has done is remove control of an irrigation licence from a rural town or a rural community.

266,Ms Ley,"I represent a large piece of western New South Wales, and both the member forThere is an analogy here with the end of the wool floor price. There was a lot of discussion then that we should burn the stockpile of wool because then we would have it out of the system and out of the way. I am not saying I supported it one way or the other, although I was a wool farmer at the time. The stockpile sat there and it sort of trickled onto the market in stages. Every now and then a bit more wool would come out and everybody would say, ‘What has happened here?’ and the market would rock from this entry of wool that everyone had forgotten about. This is exactly what is going to happen with this water. The water will be owned by an environmental water manager who is part of the Australian government. Like all responsible government departments, their job will be to maximise the income they make from these water licences. We know that environmental allocations do not work the same every year. If you are looking at your wetlands you might say, ‘I want to water that one this year but not the next year,’ or ‘I want to top up a flood here,’ or ‘There’s no rain still so I’ll hang onto this water in this part of the catchment.’ It is a delicate balancing act, as it should be. If that water is not needed for that wetland or that environmental flow in a particular year, the government are not just going to sit on it; the government is going to put it back on the market and offer it for sale. Inevitably that is what will happen. Mr Forrest interjectingmaximising their price they are going to maximise the pain that anyone who buys that water will undergo. Irrigators are going to be completely at the mercy of the biggest water holder in the Murray-Darling Basin by far-the Australian government, which will supposedly be acting in the interests of all taxpayers but will be acting in their own fiscal interests. I am not overstating the case to say that people are very angry and frightened. They are angry with me. They are saying, ‘You need to do more.’ I am feeling extremely frustrated because I cannot get through to the water minister. She does not answer my letters and she does not really want to see my constituents. She does not want to come down to the electorate of Farrer. She made a drop-in, drop-out visit lately. She probably thinks she has bigger fish to fry. It is enormously worrying for us because we can see ghost towns appearing along the Murray River where once there were traditional, proud, flourishing settlements. I thought it was a bit ironic that one of the ministers of the government had leave today. It was not the agriculture minister-or maybe it will be at a later time this week-to attend a food meeting in Europe where the subject matter would be feeding a hungry world and, presumably, the interaction between growing grain for ethanol fuel and growing grain for food. I thought it was interesting that this is a government that is ripping out the water that grows our food in the southern Murray-Darling Basin but does not seem to realise the consequences. We contribute enormously; there is no question about it. I think that the previous government had the balance right between the environment and production, because we cannot afford to ignore either. That continues to be something that I worry about year after year and I certainly will not stop until we get that good drenching rain. In the recent budget about a billion dollars was taken out of rural Australia, and that was enormously disappointing to my constituents. It is interesting that prior to the election Mr Rudd talked up the clever country image quite a lot. He talked about innovation and doing things smarter.

The cuts to research and development have effectively pulled the rug out from under those who would have used their ability, knowledge, innovation and networks, which were all set up and operating, to make us more and more at the competitive edge. That is something we so desperately need in the face of the other disadvantages of not having subsidies and tariffs, which, as an individual, can secure your income. Regional Partnerships has been much talked about. I particularly want to mention Broken Hill, which came into my electorate at the last election, and say how disappointed I was that money for the regional events centre, money for the hearing centre-come on, this is helping senior Australians with their hearing-and money for an aquatic centre was withdrawn. Broken Hill is a long way from anywhere and it has one small 25-metre pool. The aim of the Regional Partnerships program was to upgrade it to something much better for the local kids. Three projects have been wiped off the table by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. What was amazing was the very ad hoc nature that became apparent as he moved through the administration of that program. Nothing at all happened for six months, except that we sacked the small business officer who was associated with the program, and that was very sad. The next thing that happened was that every program was off except for the ones that the Labor Party had guaranteed as being doable, which were their own election commitments during their election campaign. Ironically, they criticised us for making ad hoc decisions but then said they would fund everything they had committed to during the election campaign-none of which had been through the rigorous selection, review and recommendation program that our projects had been through and which, having passed that very important first hurdle that says, ‘Yes, it is in the interests of the community, it is a good thing to do and it is a good use of taxpayers’ money,’ were waiting to see if funding was available. Those projects that were waiting there were axed and, instead, the new Labor government came in with their various election commitments, which have not undergone that rigorous process. I challenge the minister and anyone in the government to tell me why projects other than those that have been cancelled in my electorate-and I particularly focus on the three in Broken Hill: the events centre, the aquatic centre and the hearing centre-are more deserving and why Minister Albanese, in an amazing backflip, reinstated some projects but left others out in the cold. That appeared to be entirely under pressure from Sunrise and the media-‘I didn’t realise there were such good community things happening here.’ I have to tell the minister: they are all good community things. I have seen sporting facilities, halls, libraries and community function centres all receive dollars under the Regional Partnerships program. The Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund is another example. They are real live examples of what a MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008
268,Ms Ley,"In the member for Mallee’s electorate, in MilduraI think, we have to closesmall amount of money can do and the difference it can make to the heart and soul of a very little country town. It was very disappointing to see us lose those projects. The Investing in Our Schools Program has been axed. I was at the Booligal Public School, which is a little school in the middle of the Hay Plains, where we were opening new facilities. All over my electorate, the Investing in Our Schools Program has provided covered outdoor learning areas, new play equipment, electronic whiteboards and computers. The great thing about the program was that whatever the school needed, whatever it wanted, it was allowed to apply for. We now have a completely top-down approach, in keeping with Labor’s approach to people generally-which is that they know better than the community does. They have said that students in years 9 and 10 will have laptops. That is where the money that was going to Investing in Our Schools appears to have been directed. I just want to relay one anecdote. I was at a conference of single mums in Adelaide recently, and one of the attendees, one of the mums, broke down in tears. She said: ‘Everyone else in the class is getting their education rebate for their computer for their child, but I don’t pay tax. I’m doing my 15 hours work a week and I’m on a pension, but I don’t pay tax, and my child is coming home completely disadvantaged, because others are getting the education tax rebate and my child is not.’ AndI thought Labor was the party that looked after those people. I think, if we have a program like that, there is a responsibility to not disadvantage the kids of single mothers who have to turn up in the classroom without a computer. It is hard enough raising children on your own without having that sort of distress to deal with and with having to feel so left out by the government, which is exactly how this woman described it. She said, ‘This government has just left me out.’ So we have lost Regional Partnerships, drought assistance, the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund and the Investing in Our Schools Program. Much has been said about petrol, and I have made some remarks about that elsewhere. I simply appeal to the minister for agriculture that, in reviewing exceptional circumstances declarations as they come due in the second half of this year, he remember the advice of the Rural Financial Counselling Service: basically, if you stop the exceptional circumstances payments, some people feel that as many as 50 per cent of those receiving them will simply go to the wall. I say to the minister: you cannot do that. I am a little bit worried and suspicious because I see a $14 million transition fund in the budget, a transitional welfare fund, which suggests to me that it is for when people finish a program and they need some transitional help. If the government is considering finishing the EC assistance, would it please reconsider, because I could not cope with seeing half the farmers in my electorate who receive exceptional circumstances go bankrupt, and I do not think it would do much for the fabric of the society in those country towns. I invite the minister to come and have a look and have a chat. He does not need to take me, but he does need to come and talk to the Rural Financial Counselling Service and see exactly what they do, because they actually have all of the knowledge about this. There is no need to listen to anyone else except the counsellors, who deal on a day-to-day basis with farmers who are in crisis-and we all know that, when it rains, you still need a bit of help, and it has not really rained sufficiently yet. In conclusion, I think the budget lets rural Australian families down. It is a typical Labor budget. It increases taxes and spending, it plays on the politics of envy and it does not really MAIN COMMITTEE do much for the running of the economy either. I appreciate the opportunity to make the points that I have this afternoon. terest, and, whilst I certainly do not intend to respond to all of her comments in detail, I do want to pick up one of the points she made, and that was in respect of Australia’s water supplies and the shortage of water that we are experiencing throughout Australia. It is a fact, and it is a point that I think is well understood by people right across Australia and by governments right across Australia. But the cold, hard reality is that our serious situation with water did not occur overnight or since the Rudd government came to power; it occurred as a result of neglect by governments for decades and, in particular, neglect on the part of the previous Howard government. In the last 10 years in particular there were some very real warnings put to the government about the water crisis that this country was facing and we saw very, very little response from the previous government. I have spoken on another occasion about water and the need for Australia to have a better water plan. The point I also want to make is that, in this budget, there is in fact $12.9 billion set aside by the Rudd government to respond to the serious water shortages that this country is facing. MightI say of the minister, Senator the Hon. Penny Wong, that she is doing a very good job in that new portfolio, given the seriousness and the size of the problem that she has inherited. I believe that the commitments she has made and the decisions that she has made to date certainly show that she is someone who is committed to finding real, long-term solutions to the water needs of this country. In his budget address to parliament on 13 May, the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, began his remarks with the following: This Budget is designed to meet the big challenges of the future. It is a Budget that strengthens Australia’s economic foundations, and delivers for working families under pressure. It is the responsible Budget our nation needs at this time of international turbulence, and high inflation at home. A Budget carefully designed to fight inflation, and ensure we meet the uncertainties of the future from a position of strength. The first Rudd government budget is indeed a budget which responds to the complex social, economic and environmental issues facing Australia-complex issues made even more difficult because of the previous government’s failure to address the future needs of our nation. This is the first Labor government budget in 12 years, and Australia today is a vastly different country to the one it was 12 years ago-as indeed is the world. In my first speech in this place I said that those countries which invest in education, manage their environment well and minimise global influences on their economies will prosper most into the future. I also said that governments need to win back the trust and faith of the people they serve. In the time. I have today, I will speak about how the first Rudd government budget responds to some of these issues, and I begin with the question of trust. Governments will win back the trust of people they serve only if they deliver on the commitments they make. The first Rudd budget does exactly that. Funding commitments made in the election campaign by the Rudd government have all been delivered in this budget. This is unlike the record of the Howard government when, after elections, promises became core and non-core promises. In my own MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008
269,Mr Zappia (Makin) (6.03 Pm),"I listened to the member for Farrer’s comments with inelectorate of Makin in particular, every single funding commitment made by the Rudd government or by me has been delivered in this budget. Those projects include a new GP superclinic, $750,000 for the Tea Tree Gully Business Enterprise Centre, $500,000 to improve television reception along the Para Escarpment, $150,000 to the cities of Salisbury and Tea Tree Gully for Safer Communities funding, and $2.675 million for improvements to a range of community facilities. I also welcome the announcement by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, that 86 community organisations around Australia who were promised funding by the previous Howard governmentbut to whom the funding was never delivered because the Howard government did not sign off on the necessary government contracts with these clubs-now have until 31 July to finalise their funding agreement with the federal government. Two of these clubs are in my electorate of Makin. I refer to the Golden Grove Football Club, whose facilities at Harpers Field are totally inadequate, and the sporting clubs at Tilley Reserve, Golden Grove, which include a junior soccer club, a Little Athletics club, a tennis club and a table tennis club. These clubs have collectively outgrown their facilities at Tilley Reserve and they have been waiting for years for improvements to their facilities. I have visited these two facilities and met on numerous occasions with both club officials and parents of the children who use the facilities, and I have seen for myself how inadequate the facilities are. The families and the children of these communities should not be victims of a Regional Partnerships funding mess created by the Howard government, criticised by the Auditor General and inherited by the Rudd government. I discussed the importance of the funding required by the Golden Grove Football Club and Tilley Reserve sports clubs with both the minister, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, and Parliamentary Secretary Gary Gray on several occasions. I thank both of them for their sympathetic response to the needs of the many families in Makin. I hope to speak at length on another occasion about the wonderful role of the sporting clubs throughout our communities-not just in Makin but right across Australia. Let me now turn to education. Education means knowledge, and knowledge empowers people to make sound decisions about their own future and sound judgements about the policies of the governments that they elect. Education is also the most effective way of overcoming social disadvantage. From the outset, the Prime Minister made education a priority for a Rudd government. In the first Rudd government budget, the government has delivered on its commitment to education with a combination of sensible policies and $19.3 billion of funding. I was particularly pleased to see that these policies recognise the importance of early childhood education and the foundation that it builds for the rest of the lives of these young people. Again, I was particularly pleased to hear the Deputy Prime Minister in question time today speak about the $535 million over five years for early childhood education. The wasteful, politically motivated expenditure by the Howard government in detaining refugees offshore, estimated to have cost Australian taxpayers over $1 billion, would have been much better spent on our schools, our TAFEs and our universities. If it had been, today we might not be facing critical skills shortages in our trades and in our professions, shortages which are in turn causing serious workforce shortages, and the number of full-time or partMAIN COMMITTEE time students continuing from year 10 to year 12 would not be down to the 1999 level of 79.2 per cent. These statistics are a sad indictment of the last Liberal government. Shortly before I stepped down as Mayor of Salisbury, we established the Northern Economic Leaders Group to work with government in overcoming the barriers to productivity growth in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. The Northern Economic Leaders Group is made up of CEOs of significant national industries from a broad cross-section of employment sectors, including BAE Systems, Inghams Enterprises and RM Williams. The single dominant, common concern raised by all of those CEOs was the workforce shortages and their difficulty in recruiting suitably trained staff. Their dilemma, which I am sure applies equally to industries across Australia, will not be resolved overnight, but the education commitments made in the first Rudd government’s budget, and the immigration changes announced by Senator Chris Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, are an important step in the right direction. The allocation in this budget of $19.3 billion for education, skills and training, with $11 billion of it in the form of a new education investment fund, demonstrates a real commitment by the Rudd government to addressing the future education, skilling and training needs of Australia. Let me now turn to the environment for a moment. The failure of the Howard government to properly address the national impacts of climate change has already cost our country dearly and will continue to do so on a compounding scale for many years to come. In my first speech in this place I referred to the Murray River as an example and highlighted the social, economic and environmental costs to Australia as a result of both the mismanagement of the Murray-Darling system and the failure to factor in climate change to our water supplies and water flows into the Murray itself. TodayI want to refer to another example-that is, the price of petrol, LPG and diesel. The simple reality is that world demand for fuel is driving up fuel prices and will continue to do so. At the same time it is well known that the use of fossil fuels have, for a long time, been a major cause of greenhouse gas pollution. Had Australia begun addressing petrol as an environmental issue a decade ago, we might have been better prepared and less dependent on petrol today and therefore not so much impacted by rising petrol prices. It is not only the price of petrol that needs to come down; it is as much our reliance on it. Oil is a finite resource and many experts believe we have reached our peak oil supplies-another warning that the Howard government seemed oblivious to. It is imperative that Australia invest more in public transport systems. Increased use of public transport will reduce household reliance on motor vehicles, thereby reducing living costs and environmental damage. With respect to this point, I want to read a letter that was published in the Adelaide Advertiser last Friday from a person by the name of Anne McMenamin. I am going to read the letter almost exactly as it appeared in the paper: The real issue is that the price of oil is going to continue to rise. Many mainstream commentators predict $150 a barrel by the end of 2008, and some up to $200. It’s already 30 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year, and six times what it was 10 years ago. The situation has been predicted for many years. Earth does not have an infinite supply of oil. What we need from our governments-state and federal-is leadership, including a preparedness to take steps which will not be universally popular. MAIN COMMITTEE These have to involve huge expenditure on public transport, major intervention in and regulation of urban consolidation, and overhaul of food production systems heavily dependent on the input of both oil and petrochemical products. Inevitably, money will still need to be spent on present systems, so there will be a period of overlapping financial demands. This will require some national pulling together and readjustment of priorities, in which governments need to protect and support the more vulnerable sectors of the community. Changes to excise and/or the GST may be useful in this, but they are not fixes for the central problems. One comforting thought in all this: changes made to accommodate the demands of peak oil will all help in the battle against global warming. The two are not unrelated. I could not have put it better myself if I tried. I think that letter sums up the situation perfectly. On an associated matter, Australia’s continued high dependence on petrol raises a secondary cause for concern. Our diminishing petrol reserves mean an increasing dependency on imported petrol. That in turn means a worsening position with respect to our balance of trade. In fact, if the present trends continue, within the next five to 10 years our net foreign debtwhich, as at 31 December 2007, was $610 billion or 60 per cent of Australia’s $1 trillion economy-will most likely exceed Australia’s GDP; that is, our net foreign debt, if we continue on the trend we are following right now, will exceed our total national GDP. That is certainly a cause for concern, and that will be the case if both petrol consumption and petrol imports continue to increase. For the sake of both our environment and our economy, we have to reduce our reliance on petrol. MightI say that LPG and compressed natural gas may not be the best long-term fuel solutions but in the short term both are far better options than petrol, given the abundant supplies of LPG and compressed natural gas in Australia and their lower greenhouse gas emissions. In this respect, I endorse the comments made by the member for Wills on this subject about a week ago. Neither the pretentious concern about fuel prices by the opposition nor their excise rebate proposal will bring much joy to motorists. Investment in transport infrastructure and public transport systems will go much further in reducing petrol costs for motorists than a 5c petrol excise cut. That is why I support and welcome the $20 billion commitment in this budget to the Building Australia Fund, which represents the first major infrastructure investment plan in Australia for decades. It is these long-term solutions to spiralling petrol costs that Australia needs, and that is what differentiates the Rudd government from the opposition. I was going to speak further about climate change but, given the time available to me, I will simply make this point: the government’s $2.3 billion for tackling climate change shows a real commitment to addressing the issues that we as a nation and as a globe face in the years ahead. How those funds will be spent is broken down in the budget documents. I endorse and support the government’s initiatives in that respect. I will finish by saying that, of course, there is so much more to do. This budget does not by any means do all of the things that we as a government would like to do. In my own electorate of MakinI frequently speak to pensioners and people with family members who have a disability. MightI at this point talk about the $1.9 billion that was only last Friday agreed between the federal and state governments to respond to some of those people’s needs. I speak to carers, people with mental health problems, Indigenous people, single parents, people sufMAIN COMMITTEE fering from work related injuries, war veterans and so on. I understand their needs and I understand that there are things that governments at all levels could do to assist them. I also understand that in many cases these people are severely disadvantaged and suffering real hardship. This budget, however, begins the process of building an Australia in which all members of our society can share in the nation’s prosperity and those who are struggling the most are not simply given short-term, once-only handouts but a real opportunity to have a better quality of life. It is a nation-building budget, and I commend and support the appropriation bills put to this parliament by the Treasurer. cruel joke being played on the working families that the Rudd government promised to fight for. The working families in my electorate of Greenway are feeling the effects of incompetence as they experience higher prices at the checkout and the bowsers. Unfortunately, the Rudd government does not understand that this is no joke. The first budget of the Rudd government is one of arrogance. The members opposite are so smug that they are under the pretence that they do not have a responsibility to working families-the very same working families that elected them. This budget does not deliver on petrol, health, welfare, education or the environment. Put simply: working families have been let down by the Labor Party. This government does not understand the plight of working families in Western Sydney, the Hawkesbury, Penrith, Blacktown, Mount Druitt or Seven Hills-and the list continues. After getting himself elected by promising the world on petrol prices, the Prime Minister has failed to have any effect on the skyrocketing price of operating a family car. Since being elected and delivering this first budget, the Prime Minister has had zero impact on the price of petrol. He has forgotten what really matters to the electorate. Through inexperience he has been unable to offer anything to the working families in Western Sydney who struggle to get the children to school and drive to work. Unfortunately, the incompetence of Labor extends beyond this chamber. Toll charges are inequitably disadvantaging working families in Western Sydney because, just like the Rudd government, the Iemma government takes Western Sydney for granted. For a family in Western Sydney to survive the current economic mismanagement of this government, it is not uncommon for both parents to work hard in order to earn enough to pay for increasingly expensive petrol, groceries and health care. Inadequate public transport often necessitates that two parents drive into the city and home again every day. A family is burdened with the cost of petrol and tolls five days a week, costing on average a whopping $270. The average takehome pay of $907 a week does not cut it when the average family spends $270, or 23 per cent of their net income, on getting to and from work. Mr Rudd simply misses the mark with Fuelwatch. This new spin by the Labor Party will not decrease prices. It merely disadvantages small fuel retailers, who will be the only businesses that are pressured to lower prices. Fuelwatch will undermine competition and ultimately lead to higher fuel prices, something working families cannot afford. While the Labor Party is busy ‘spinning’ for the media, the coalition has come up with an economically responsible and simple measure to reduce fuel prices in a way that will benefit working families the second it is introduced. Cutting the fuel excise will ease the pressure on MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Appropriation Bill No 2 2008 2009 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2008 2009 Appropriation Bill No 5 2007 2008 Appropriation Bill No 6 2007 2008
270,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (6.19 Pm),"Labor’s high-taxing, high-spending budget is aworking families. It simply makes fuel cheaper without the spin, the committees, the observation and the documentation. This Labor budget increased taxation for the first time in recent memory. As working families struggle, Mr Rudd needs to reduce the tax on petrol, not watch prices. The budget brought forward by this government is one of hidden spending cuts to vital services in order to contribute to Labor’s ambiguous nation-building slush funds. The budget cuts $67.5 million from the already under resourced immigration department. This funding has been taken away from the critical border security and immigration processing functions, which means longer waiting times for visa processing and less secure borders for Australians. If these cuts were not bad enough, there are immigration officers from key roles in Australia and on overseas postings that will no longer have jobs. This, disguised as efficiency, effectively shows that the speed and accuracy of visa processing are simply not a priority to the Rudd government. A further total of $43.6 million is being cut from areas such as border security, family migration, economic migration, student and temporary visas and even humanitarian programs. The member for Lilley has underestimated the people of Australia, who can see straight through the Treasurer’s short-term plan to ease the burden by changing the condition of the Medicare levy-the burden that he himself has created for Australian battlers. An increase in the earnings threshold for the Medicare levy is a short-term policy from this cabinet of selfproclaimed ‘nation builders’. The Sydney Morning Herald’s Mark Metherell identified in one sentence the straightforward concept that our Treasurer could not understand: ‘The loss of many young, low-risk members is likely to push up premiums and add to public hospital pressures.’ Private health care will no be longer an option for working families in Western Sydney as premiums for private health care will be pushed out of reach of the average household budget. Any examination of the New South Wales health and hospital system would show the Treasurer why many families are not confident in government health care for their children. These are mums and dads in my electorate of Greenway who previously had the choice to do what was best for their families, mums and dads who will now be forced to rely on the waiting-list prone New South Wales health system administered by the Rudd government’s mates-New South Wales Labor. This is the very same government that requires additional federal funding just to fix their desperate hospitals and other strained medical facilities. The Rudd government’s $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund has been earmarked to fund the development of health infrastructure and medical equipment, but is rendered useless by the lack of funding for additional healthcare professionals and training, thus highlighting the ineptitude of the Treasurer. We can have all the shiny new buildings and the latest tech gadgets we want, but, as New South Wales Rural Doctors Association President Dr Ken Mackey rightly points out, there is no point in funding this infrastructure in a budget that makes cuts to training programs for enrolled nurses in regional Australia. There is no point in having brand new buildings in regional Australia with waiting lists of up to six months for basic services. The working families of Greenway urge me to call upon the government to listen to them and to fix the problems they are already facing, such as sixto 12-month waiting lists for a dental check-ups for their children, hours of waiting time in the emergency department when their children need to be seen by a doctor and struggling to find a nurse with time to concentrate on their child’s needs when in a public hospital. The people of Western Sydney simply MAIN COMMITTEE will not accept this kind of irrelevant government. This high-taxing, high-spending budget delivers successive blows to young families trying to establish a future in an uncertain economic climate. The Treasurer’s plans to exclude some families from receiving family tax benefit B by placing a means test on the family tax benefit demonstrates the government’s ignorance as to the very reason for its existence. The family tax benefit is recognition not only of the communal social value of families to this nation but also that significant expense is incurred on the part of those providing for the social good. The Treasurer does not understand the pressure of a family budget. Mortgages now take up to one-third of most families incomes in repayments, then add to that groceries and petrol costs-they hit harder than ever as mums and dads endeavour to provide opportunities for their children. The family tax benefit is a response to these difficulties that face families and is society’s way of contributing something to the production of social value. A further slap in the face to working families is the restrictions to the childcare benefits. The Rudd government is once again all spin and no substance as it publicises the increased childcare rebate but fails to mention the new restrictions in place. Working families only have access to the childcare rebate if they are both working. To be eligible for the rebate, parents must be either single working parents or working a combined total of more than 1.5 times a full-time workload. For example, the childcare rebate is only available to caretaker parents working 25 hours or more. This is a discriminatory practice against stay-at-home mums. The primary caregiver parent is given the options of working 25 hours-more than three days a week-or going without a rebate. This is no choice at all. The next step in this government’s grudge on families is the new payment arrangement and means test for the baby bonus. The payment of the baby bonus was introduced by the Howard government to coincide with the expenses incurred by expecting parents. The initial capital required for a new pram, a larger car, changing tables and many other large baby requirements is too much for working Australian families, covering bills for two to three months that the second income would have covered. The average family does not have a spare $5,000 to finance their expenses while they wait for the baby bonus to be drip-fed to them over a sixmonth period. I completely support the Democrats’ Senate private member’s bill to extend the baby bonus to adopted children over the age of two. This bill takes action to stop the discrimination against those who wish to adopt from overseas. Adoption is a benefit to the child and a benefit to society and as such adoptive parents deserve the same recognition as others. It is necessary to remember that the baby bonus exists to reimburse the parents for the investment that they make in society. To not extend the reimbursement is to deny that an adopted child has the same potential and ability to contribute to society as a child that is born in Australia. The Rudd Labor government have not delivered for the residents of Greenway on the Prime Minister’s promises for the education revolution. Importantly, as a growth area in Western Sydney, Greenway has many working families with young children, and parents are legitimately concerned about their children’s future. The Rudd government promised an education revolution, but the parents of Greenway are experiencing nothing but the same old, same old. Labor have not delivered an education revolution. They have failed to deliver anything to primary schools at all-another let-down. MAIN COMMITTEE There is no education revolution. All that has happened is that there will be extra computers for high schools that lack the infrastructure to make use of them. Local primary school age children again missed out because funding for local community sporting infrastructure grants, introduced by the coalition government, has been terminated, and the upgrade of sporting fields in Greenway has been left to already underfunded local governments. The residents of Greenway are still waiting on the education revolution that this budget does not deliver. The Hawkesbury River has not been allocated the funding agreed to under the previous government-$132.5 million. The Rudd government are clearly not committed to environmental management or sustainability. The river is in desperate need of the funding package promised by the Howard government, which included amounts for recycling and maintaining the health and sustainability of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River catchment system. This funding has not been allocated by the Rudd government. They are convinced they can ignore Western Sydney. The newly elected member for Lindsay has not spoken of the river since his maiden speech. Has the member for Lindsay forgotten the existence of the river, is he ignorant of its poor health and its significance or does he lack the courage to stand up to his government’s neglect? The member for Parramatta is a part of the same government that snuck through reforms to the Solar Cities program. The Minister for Climate Change and Water introduced a means test to the solar panels program, which effectively renders the Solar Cities program useless. The means test has had an instant effect, with many companies reporting an 80 per cent reduction in contracts. Experts predict further decreases in the number of people using the scheme. On 16 May Hamish Wall, the General Manager of Business Development with Nicholls Solar, a company that installs solar panels, said on The World Today: ... we had one household which consisted of a nurse and a teacher and obviously under the Federal Government’s policy, they’re rich and therefore they are no longer eligible for the rebate. The minister admitted that the decision to means test the solar rebate was based on the opinion that the program had been too successful, with too many people taking it up. This skindeep level of commitment to tackling climate change does not sit well with the people who chose the party championing the environment or with the people who chose the party of selfdecreed economic conservatism, people who now watch the solar industry crumble and hear the minister’s lack of concern as she describes the loss of livelihoods as merely ‘disappointing’. Despite being economic trainees, the government are expert at disguising cuts to environment spending by renaming, moving and rebundling old schemes. Areas like the Riverstone storm corridor, the Windsor-Richmond lowlands, Wollemi National Park and Windsor Downs Nature Reserve were all to benefit from funding for the Bureau of Meteorology, but staff cuts will affect how these areas are managed. However, there was no consultation with me or my Western Sydney coalition colleagues, who could have told the minister of the risks. We have no guarantee of the safety of the people and property in Western Sydney, and we have heard of no justification for the cuts. This is just another example of a Labor government sneaking through spending cuts to vital services in order to fund their ambiguous nation-building slush funds. The members for Parramatta and Lindsay are not committed to the environment at all. In this budget, they confirmed what the environment minister pre-empted-he just got in and MAIN COMMITTEE changed it all. Working families in Western Sydney are struggling, and I regrettably have to inform the families in my electorate that the Rudd government seem not to care. They are economic novices who have hurt families and seem determined to merely watch petrol prices instead of act on them. 2008-2009 and associated bills before the House. From the outset, especially for those opposite, I wish to congratulate the Treasurer for his first budget. As a proud Queenslander I am particularly proud of what he has delivered for Australia and for Queensland. It is a budget that will deliver economic security for our families and for all Australians in these uncertain economic times. We are facing a lot of pressures from around the world and domestically. One of the best ways we can support working Australians struggling to cope with rising costs is to put downward pressure on interest rates. With a forecast surplus of $21.7 billion-that is, 1.8 per cent of the GDP; I repeat that: 1.8 per cent of the GDP-this budget forms a strong defence against the curve balls that may come our way from the global economy and other outside pressures. I also welcome the budget initiatives that stimulate productivity, overcome infrastructure bottlenecks and drive world-class education and training. I will just unpack some of thosestarting with productivity. When Treasurer Wayne Swan was handed a budget, when he was handed the reins to the economy, productivity was at zero. Surely that is one of the best indicia as to the state of the economy. Unfortunately, former Treasurer Costello handed over productivity rates of zero. Infrastructure bottlenecks were something that we heard much about in the preceding years, as part of the blame game played by the former government. They would take photographs of ships and say, ‘This is the fault of the state governments,’ without doing anything constructive. It is yet again an example of the blame game being played by the former federal government. Obviously, we have heard on numerous occasions about how the former government neglected education and training-shameful results in terms of university funding. Every other OECD country had increases and if you compare them to Australia we actually went backwards-a shameful approach. No plan for the future. Those three things-productivity, infrastructure bottlenecks and the neglect of education and training-should be hung around the neck of the former government like a dead albatross, so that they are held accountable for that, the so-called economic managers who did absolutely nothing in terms of having a vision for the future. Instead, they just took the benefits of the Hawke-Keating economic reforms that can be listed off. If we do make a list of all of the current member for Higgins’s economic reforms, it will not take very long at all, because there were none-apart from the GST. In terms of major economic reforms, there are none. As I said, that neglect should be hung around their neck like an albatross, as in Coleridge’s Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner. Treasurer Swan’s budget delivers the $55 billion Working Families Support Package, delivering tax cuts directed to lowand middle-income families and support for childcare and education costs. These tax cuts and other incentives provide some relief to those Australians who need it most. We know that the price of petrol has gone up significantly. It has gone up over 400 per cent since the Iraq war started. We know that the drought has had long-term impacts on groceries. We also know that rents and mortgages are significant pressures as well, especially in places like Brisbane and in the growing cities.

271,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (6.34 Pm),"I rise to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)investment in Australia’s future rather than just in the next election-not handouts based on a political whim. There is no regional rorts in this budget; it is measured and delivers for Australian families and seniors. It provides measured and targeted investments in our future to address infrastructure, skills and climate change. They might be three terms that those opposite have not heard before: infrastructure, skills and climate change. Among the dubious economic claims of those opposite is that the Howard-Costello government successfully cancelled government debt, but obviously this is only half the story. They might have paid off government debt, but what they do not tell us is that they increasingly shifted debt back onto Australian families and squandered their good fortune by failing to invest in infrastructure for the future. As I said, the Hawke-Keating government made tough decisions that impacted on battlers where they were able to get the union movement to make significant reforms by investing in superannuation and forgoing wage rises for the good of the economy. That was the way of the Hawke-Keating government. As I said, if we look at the reforms of the Howard-Costello government, we see that they did nothing in terms of infrastructure and significant economic reform. This shameful underspend by the previous federal government has forced state governments to take on more debt to deliver vital infrastructure. This is not reckless economic management but a sound investment in productivity by our state governments. No more blame game; this is actually about working together to deliver something for the benefit of all Australia. We simply cannot afford to have workers trapped in traffic gridlocks or goods stranded at rail and port bottlenecks. Coming from Queensland, and having worked in the mining industry, I have seendance with standing order 192. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the date will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed on a future date. Age Pension Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (6.40 pm)-Pensioners who are on the single age pension are being discouraged from working if they earn more than $3,400. When their income exceeds $17,600, they are penalised 40c for every extra dollar they earn. In effect, these people who only want to do some productive work and improve their meagre financial means are being ‘taxed’ at a very high rate. Many pensioners in my electorate who work part-time as school crossing guards have given the game away. In my electorate there are now quite a few unguarded crossings. Times have changed. With near full employment, we need to enable willing people on the age pension to work if they want to. I encourage the government to lift the amount that an age pensioner can earn above the single person pension from $3,400 to $10,600 before seeking to tax their earnings. This would be consistent with the senior Australians tax offset of $24,800. The provision I suggest should apply only to pensioners who work-not those who have other sources of income-so that there would be no extra cost to taxpayers from currently meanstested pensioners getting an increase in their pension.

We had over 167 participants at the morning tea, which included fine entertainment from the Dazman, a singalong and a dance. The entire event was organised with the assistance of my wonderful staff as well as the seniors, many of whom are very busy volunteers in their community. To have 167 seniors turn up was quite a treat. We had raffles, cake displays and all sorts of money-raising events. That small group of seniors raised over $1,000 for the Cancer Council, and I truly thank them for the hard work and efforts that they made not only on behalf of the Cancer Council in Western Australia but also in providing such an enjoyable morning for themselves and many seniors. I look forward to future Biggest Morning Teas in Forrestfield and hope that we continue to raise money for the Cancer Council. Mr Tom Dillon Ms MARINO (Forrest) (6.43 pm)-I rise to acknowledge Tom Dillon, who has announced his retirement from the Bunbury City Council at the age of 65. Tom is truly a colourful character, larger than life, full of energy but with genuine commitment to his community. He served the city council for more than 10 years over the past 30 years. He was first elected in 1978 and saw Bunbury become a city during his first term. He was the deputy mayor and spearheaded the Graham Bricknell Music Shell project, raising $300,000 in external contributions for a project to honour a former deputy mayor who died in tragic circumstances. There have been many significant progressive projects completed during Tom’s time on council. He is a major mover and shaker, capable of organising very successful and wellplanned events and functions. Tom has never been afraid to tackle controversial issues. The community was always very aware of exactly where Tom stood on any given issue. He has been a vigorous, strong advocate and a master with the media. Tom himself has said, ‘While I might not have always been popular, I have always given it my absolute best shot.’ This epitomises the man who is Tom Dillon and it is why he is a well-respected and highly valued community member. He has been and continues to be vitally interested in issues and projects affecting Bunbury, including the Bunbury speedway. He is also keenly interested in boxing and he is a personal friend of Danny Green. He loves his Aussie Rules football and is a oneeyed South Bunbury Football Club supporter. Above all, Tom is not only passionate about and committed to his community but also prepared to do the hard work to make things happen. I thank him for his efforts.

Yesterday I spent several hours doorknocking for the local Salvation Army, helping them to raise much-needed funds for the many purposes that they put them to. Over the years, I have had occasion to work with many of the people from within the Salvation Army, both within and outside of the electorate of Makin. I have to say it is one organisation that not only has an incredible amount of credibility with people but also does so much good for so many people. I say that, because as I was doorknocking yesterday it was interesting to see the reaction and reception I received as I got to MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Statements By Members
273,Mr Zappia (Makin) (6.44 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Salvation Army and, in the doors of different householders. Almost without exception, everyone that was home was willing to put something in as part of the fundraising efforts. I rise to compliment on one hand the Salvation Army for the work that they do and on the other hand the generosity of the people out there who, where they believe that a charity is raising funds for a good cause and have confidence and faith that the funds raised will be used for a good cause, are willing to donate. The other interesting observation I make is this: quite often, the households which, as soon as you opened the door, you might have thought were in need of the support and benefit of the Salvation Army were some of the most generous. (Time expired) Parkes Electorate: Early Childhood Education childhood education in my electorate of Parkes. I was pleased to recently learn of the government’s desire to provide all four-year-olds with early childhood education. However, I have some concerns over how this may be implemented, particularly when some centres in my electorate do not have an existing preschool or childcare facility. It is my belief that the best way to provide this level of education for children living in rural and remote areas is through mobile preschools and community based organisations. Many successful mobile preschools operate in my electorate, including the Gwydir Mobile Preschool in Moree and the Tharawanga Preschool, which operates from North Star. These organisations have dedicated staff who travel several hundred kilometres a week on rough roads to ensure that kids living on properties and in smaller towns are able to access preschool education. Without these services, many children would simply miss out. In addition to mobile preschools, there are also many playgroups run by parents. A few weeks ago I dropped in on the local playgroup in the small village of Carinda. This group is run by local parents. It was good to see the children learning and interacting. Early childhood education is vital, and I believe the children living in my electorate should be given the same opportunity as their city cousins. Mobile preschools and community based groups need to be properly resourced and adequately funded so that country kids get the best possible start in life. I urge the government to take this into consideration when implementing their early childhood education policies. Moreton Electorate: Kyabra Community Association based in the electorate of Moreton-the Kyabra Community Association. It is an organisation I was proud to be on the board of before the federal election campaign commenced. Unfortunately I then had to resign so the organisation was not politicised. The Kyabra Community Association does a fantastic job in a number of different areas. One of the things they do that I am most proud of is addressing homelessness issues in the electorate of Moreton and the southern areas of Brisbane. They also do what they can in terms of providing housing for people in need. In fact, one of their great initiatives is in consultation with the Brisbane City Council and the Liberal Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. They have worked with the Brisbane City Council to move homes that have to be relocated because of the north-south bypass tunnel onto land that the Kyabra Community Association has purchased. They are using those houses to provide housing for people who are struggling at the MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Statements By Members

(Time expired) Overwatch Battle Group gether with the Australian Army’s training team in Iraq, ceased operations at their base at Talil in Dhi Qar province yesterday, and I rise to honour their service. Overwatch Battle Group West2 carried out more than 300 patrols across the 72,000 square kilometre area of operations. These patrols included providing security for reconstruction projects, meeting local leaders and providing convoy escorts, as well as the training and mentoring of the Iraqi security forces in Dhi Qar and the neighbouring Al Muthanna province. I join the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Rawlings, in praising the efforts of all members of the battle group. About 300 Australian combat personnel will remain in Iraq, serving with the ADF’s task force headquarters in Baghdad and with the security detachment guarding the Australian embassy in the green zone. Another 600-odd personnel will also remain deployed in the region at coalition and support headquarters and with our Navy elements that have been deployed in the gulf since the first Gulf War. The Australian Army, especially the Overwatch Battle Group West 2, have operated in the great traditions of the ANZACs and of our forefathers. They have fought well and hard. They have not been found wanting, and I join all those in parliament who stand today to support the great work they have done. Shortland Electorate: Redhead Public School Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.51 pm)-TonightI rise to pay tribute to Redhead Public School, which is celebrating its centenary this year. On Saturday night I attended a ball with a long-term resident of Redhead, and I must say that it was a very successful night. One of the highlights of the evening was a donation by the Miners Trust of $100,000 to the school for a hall. This year is a pretty special year for Redhead because it also marks the centenary of their surf club, and the members of the community in Redhead are all joining together to celebrate these two very special occasions. Redhead is a unique little place within the Shortland electorate. It is one of those places that has been able to maintain their identity and village atmosphere. Initially, a settlement was set up at Redhead as a banana plantation but it soon established itself as a very strong mining area. It is only appropriate that the miners have got behind Redhead Public School and supported it in the year of its centenary. I need to put on record the fine contribution to public education that has been made by Redhead Public School over the last 100 years.

Even more disgraceful was that Fernlea House got only six weeks to ask their clients to leave-people who are in the most desperate stages of their life. This was a really disgusting decision, one I just could not believe. There has been a reprieve, and I thank Minister Justine Elliot for giving Fernlea House another 12 months. But that is still not good enough. We need to back Fernlea House; it is a fantastic cause. It is helping people in their dying days and making sure they have quality of life. This new Rudd government has really let down the people of Emerald and the entire area of La Trobe with this palliative care issue. I call on the Rudd government to fund Fernlea House full time.

Blood Donation Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Hayes: That the House: (1) recognises and celebrates the significant contribution which Australia’s voluntary donors make to the Australian community as we approach World Blood Donor Day in June 2008; (2) recognises that whilst one in three people will at some stage require blood, presently only one in thirty people actually donate blood; (3) supports the efforts of the selfless individuals who give their blood to help save the lives and improve the health of people whom they may never meet; (4) congratulates the Australian Red Cross Blood Service for drawing attention to the need for more Australians to donate blood and celebrating the many generous and voluntary, unpaid blood donors who give blood each week to help those in need; (5) supports the efforts of the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing to increase the rate of blood donations in Australia; and (6) encourages members to actively encourage blood donation in their electorates. the world. It is going to focus on special activities, to pay tribute to the millions of people who selflessly donate that lifesaving gift of blood. This year’s theme will be Many Happy Returns. Governments and national blood transfusion services are joining hands with the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, voluntary blood donor organisations, community organisations, schools and colleges to mark longer-term campaigns to increase the number of voluntary blood donors who donate blood on a regular basis.

280,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (6.55 Pm),"World Blood Day is being held on 14 June throughoutWorld Blood Donor Day has also served as a platform for broader activities in many countries, including the restructuring of national blood transfusion services, the development of legislation on voluntary blood donation and the launch of national guidelines on blood transfusion. Just recently I gave up politics for an afternoon to donate blood, as I do on a reasonably regular basis. Afterwards, I opened the new blood donor centre at Liverpool, which is in my electorate. The new Liverpool blood donor centre replaces the old centre which first opened its doors in 1998 with a total of four beds, four nursing staff and was open for three days a week. As awareness for the need to donate blood grew in the community, the opening hours eventually increased to five days. Today the support and commitment of Liverpool and southwestern Sydney generally is such that they have now moved to larger premises-a state-of the-art blood donating facility. Across the country, the need for blood and blood products is continuing to grow each year. At present Australians need 21,000 donations per week to ensure that adequate supplies are there for those who need them. As I understand it, in the next 10 years, this figure is expected to double. Presently, one Australian in three will need blood products at some stage during their lifetime, but only one in 30 donate. Blood and blood products provide the gift of life to an estimated 100,000 Australians every year. Donated blood and blood products are used to treat a wide range of people, including accident victims, patients undergoing surgery, children suffering from leukaemia, recipients of organ and blood and marrow transplants, people with blood disorders such as haemophilia, and premature babies. In fact, 30 per cent of blood donated goes towards helping people with cancer; 15 per cent helps people with heart disease; 15 per cent goes to people with stomach and bowel disease; 12 per cent goes towards saving the lives of victims of road accidents et cetera; six per cent goes to people with liver and kidney disease; five per cent goes to people with haemophilia to ensure that they have an ongoing quality of life; and a further five per cent, Madam Deputy Speaker, you will be happy to know, goes to expectant mums and their babies so that they can have a happier life together. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service provides an essential service through the collection of blood from generous donors within our community and around the nation. The work of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service ensures that members of our community with lifethreatening illnesses who need urgent blood supplies are able to get that product. The centre in my electorate, like many across the nation, helps to improve and save the lives of thousands of Australians each week. The Rudd government supports the action to improve the rate of donation. This government, in particular the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, and the parliamentary secretary, Senator Jan McLucas, are involved in activities to increase the rate of blood and blood-related donations. I congratulate them for being aware of the need to improve the system and to encourage more people to donate. By donating blood, people can give back to their community and know that what they are doing really does help their fellow Australians in a very, very practical way. Giving blood is a relatively simple but rewarding experience, and I would encourage the wider community to also give blood. I recognise that many people would not be here today if it were not for the generosity of the numbers of volunteer, unpaid blood donors who give blood simply to help others. The generosity of these donors enables the Red Cross Blood Service to provide a MAIN COMMITTEE world-leading, safe and sufficient blood supply for all Australians. I congratulate Joanna Huggett and her staff at the Liverpool donor centre-(Time expired) celebrates the significant contribution which Australia’s volunteer blood donors make to the Australian community. I commend the member for Werriwa for bringing forward this motion this evening. A month rarely passes in this House without the words of Winston Churchill being recited for one purpose or another. I would like to share a quote of his which I believe is very much relevant to this motion. Winston Churchill said: We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. Giving blood is the epitome of giving, of protecting a life through that gift. The person who gives blood and the patients who receive it are linked by a special bond of concern and need. For the donor, giving blood is a unique way of caring about another human being. For the patient who needs blood to recover, a donation can literally mean the gift of life. I believe giving blood is an example of taking personal responsibility for the community in which we live. It is an example of the responsibility we all have if we are to enjoy the freedom to live our own lives, a freedom which comes with the responsibility to be concerned about one’s fellow man. Giving blood is a simple and costless means of supporting others in our community. The average adult’s body contains six to eight litres of blood. Twenty years ago, donated blood was used only to replace losses due to surgeries or accidents. Today, it has many, many uses. As medical technology progresses, more and more uses for blood will be developed. As a result, the need for blood continues to increase. The ageing of Australia’s population will also have a significant impact on the need for blood donations. In 1967, for example, life expectancy at birth for men and women was approximately 67 years and 74 years respectively. In 2007, these figures were 79 years and 84 years respectively. By 2047, they are projected to be 86 years and 90 years respectively. We are living longer-much longer. Technology and medicine are driving much of that increased longevity. For example, in the United States, a global leader in medical innovation, the past decade has seen an increase of 80 per cent in patents for breakthrough medical technology in an industry worth upwards of $100 billion annually. This, and the successful role of medical intervention, has led to one in three Australians needing blood at some stage in their lifetime. But here is the crunch: only one in 30 Australians actually give blood. We need 21,000 blood donations per week to ensure an adequate supply. We are falling short of that. In the space of, I think, 10 or 15 years, we will need twice that, over 40,000 donations a week-that is, two million donations a year will be required to meet the need. On 14 June we celebrate World Blood Donor Day to highlight the lifesaving gift of volunteer, unpaid blood donors who donate blood for altruistic reasons, including the over 500,000 registered blood donors in Australia. The theme this year is Many Happy Returns, to specifically celebrate those donors who give blood on a regular basis-two, three or more times each year. On average, though, registered donors give blood less than two times a year. I would like to personally thank the nearly six per cent of people living in my electorate who are currently blood donors. This is nearly double the average of blood donors nationally, but I know we can MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Private Members Business

If we could replicate nationally the thoughtful and generous actions of Goldstein residents in Australia, we would be well over the target of achieving the needs of our community. I also thank and recognise the hard working nurses and volunteers who support the Australian Red Cross Blood Service and the many blood donor centres across Australia. They make an emphatic contribution to the realisation of human dignity for so many men and women. I urge all of those Australians who are able to to donate blood and I hope for ‘many happy returns’. motion and to support World Blood Donor Day and the donation of blood nationwide. As I said, I support the private member’s motion and what I feel is a great cause. I sometimes take time out to give blood because I believe that it is something that is very worthwhile. Every time. I leave a blood donation centre I feel a rush of happiness and accomplishment because I know that my blood is going to help save someone’s life, and that is a very important thing. And it is a good feeling. Giving blood has been a part of my life for decades. My family has been giving blood regularly to help those in need as well. My wife has been giving blood for well over 25 years. We all lead busy lives; there is little time to take time out of our busy schedule and do the things that we enjoy. However, if we all took one hour out of our day every six months to donate blood, we would all be saving another person’s life or making their chances of survival greater. There are thousands of individuals across Australia every year who need blood transfusions to save their lives. Every donation given helps to save up to three lives. There are 100 collection sites across Australia, with more that 80 permanent donor centres in city centre locations and many mobile units that service Australia’s rural areas. In fact, there was a mobile unit that serviced Parliament House about 18 months ago and I recall many of the members here in this House donating blood, including myself. Donating blood has never been easier or more convenient. The Australian Red Cross are always under pressure to find more blood. And they are correct when they say that we all expect there to be blood available when we need it. However, there is only a very small proportion, one in 30, of people who take themselves to the blood clinic and donate blood. Thirty per cent of blood collected goes to patients battling cancer, 15 per cent helps people with heart disease, another 15 per cent goes to people with stomach and bowel disease, 12 per cent assists trauma and accident victims and five per cent helps babies and pregnant women. Australia needs approximately 20,000 donations each week to meet demand. We do not ever think that it is going to be us or our loved ones who will need blood, whether it is due to a prolonged illness, a sudden accident or during routine surgery. It is, however, always someone’s loved one-someone’s mother, someone’s father, someone’s child-who is in need of a blood transfusion. The government encourages Australians to make a difference in the lives of thousands of Australians by donating blood. I would like to turn now to the great work that the Australian Red Cross Blood Service do at blood banks and in drawing attention to the need for more Australians to donate blood. The Australian Red Cross was founded in 1914 as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is the world’s largest voluntary organisation. Much of the work of the Red Cross is carried out in Australia and overseas by volunteers.

Without the work of those wonderful volunteers in the Australian Red Cross, thousands of Australians would not receive the blood they need. Working long hours in high-stress conditions to save lives, these volunteers and workers are truly inspirational! I would like to say thank you to all of the workers at the Red Cross centres across the nation for the wonderful work that they do in blood donation. Without their work, thousands of Australians would not be here today. Let me just say that all of us in this House-those of us who are able to-should be giving blood on a regular basis and we should be setting an example. It is a very important part of our lives to donate blood. I support this motion. motion and, indeed, to support the comments of the last speaker when he called for all parliamentarians to take the plunge and give blood. Many people today would not be alive if it were not for Australia’s generous, voluntary, unpaid blood donors who give blood each week to help those in need. It is one of those things that we used to expect to be there for us, but only a very small proportion-indeed, one in 30 people-actually gives blood; yet, sooner or later, one in three of us will need it. People who give blood are united by their generosity and the desire to give something constructive back to the community. One in three of us will need blood or a blood product. That is a sobering thought. More than 21,000 donations are needed every week in this country to make sure there is enough blood and product for those one in three Australians who will need it. Blood is needed for surgery and trauma patients, but two-thirds of it is actually needed for people with cancer, blood disorders, heart and kidney disease, and for pregnant women and babies. Currently three per cent of the Australian population are blood donors and they donate, on average, twice a year. In my electorate of Fadden, the fastest-growing electorate in the nation, 5½ per cent of men and women are blood donors, which is above the national average. I salute them and thank them all. The frequency of giving by the blood donors in Fadden is not quite twice per year, so I encourage all those hard working men and women in Fadden to ensure that they give blood at a minimum of twice a year. The Gold Coast donor centre of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service aims to collect 114 donations each week. Last week, although it collected slightly under target for plasma, the centre was above target for whole blood. So, well done, Annie and the team, at the Gold Coast collection centre-that was a great result. However, the centre has started to see a dip in appointment levels, coinciding with the start of winter-and, yes, we do get winter on the Gold Coast-and, of course, the recent spate of slightly inclement weather. The donor centre is working hard, though, to get the donation message out to its current donors and potential donors and is shortly moving operations to a new donor centre in Robina, which will increase the number of donor beds from eight to 13. This will also double the amount of plasma that it is able to collect. Due to medical advances in the treatment of diseases and illnesses, the need for plasma is set to double in the next decade, and therefore Australia desperately needs more donors and for donors to donate more regularly. On average, Australians donate twice per year, but they can donate every 12 weeks. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service are a national blood service, as we know, and if blood collection in one area is low they are able to distribute interMAIN COMMITTEE",197,Private Members Business
283,Mr Robert (Fadden) (7.10 Pm),"I rise to support the intent of the private member’sstate to help meet the needs of hospitals and patients wherever they are in this great country of ours. We need 21,000 donations each week. This winter, to cover the number of donors who will be unable to donate due to colds and flus, 40,000 new donors are needed now. All blood types are needed, but O-negative donations are crucial. O negative is a universal blood that can be given to anyone in an emergency, yet only a small percentage of the population are O negative, including me, so I can assure myself that I am in demand to give my blood as often as possible. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can see that you are encouraged by that and I look forward to lying beside you on a bed when we give blood togetherhelp people who suffer traumatic incidences, such as accidents, burns or surgery, but in fact the vast majority of donated blood goes to people with major medical conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, stomach disease, bowel disease, liver disease, kidney disease or haemophilia, or to newborn babies and pregnant women. There are many possible different uses for blood donations. Blood donations may be made into lifesaving or life-improving medication for people with cancer, heart disease or kidney dialysis, or for people with haemophilia who need it regularly or for premature babies. It could be used in an emergency. By separating the blood into its components, it is possible to use a single donation to help save up to three lives. The previous government named 2009 the Year of the Blood Donor in a bid to encourage more Australians to give blood. I encourage them all. I especially encourage our parliamentarians to lead by example. to this important debate. I inform members that 14 June is World Blood Donor Day. Being upfront, I personally cannot donate, having been in England between the years of 1980 and 1996. As a precautionary measure to prevent the potential transmission of vCJD, I am ineligible, as much I would like to, having given blood in Mackay when I first arrived in 1993. I do, however, want to help raise awareness for the need for blood donations and encourage the wider community to consider donation today. I want to congratulate members of the community who give blood, because blood is truly the gift of life. With every donation, a donor can save up to three lives or contribute to 15 different forms of lifesaving or life-improving blood products. It is a fact that many brave Australians who suffer terrible illnesses have benefited because of the generosity of Australian blood donors. Blood donors are lifesavers. Many people in my electorate of Dawson have heeded the call from the Red Cross and regularly give blood. However, more donations are needed. People need to make giving blood a regular part of their lives. An estimated 80 per cent of the population will require blood or blood products at some time in their lives. I am sure all members know someone who has benefited from a blood donation. I am advised that 30 per cent of all blood donated helps cancer patients, 15 per cent helps people with heart disease, another 15 per cent goes to people with stomach and bowel disease, and 12 per cent of all blood donated goes to trauma and accident victims. People requiring chemotherapy are particularly at risk unless donors come forward urgently. With 30 per cent of all blood donations going to people with cancer, many people with common blood types MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Private Members Business

286,Mr Bidgood (Dawson) (7.15 Pm),"I thank honourable members who have contributedwrongly assume that their blood is not needed. In fact, the majority of patients in hospital are likely to have a common blood type, making these blood types high in demand. Blood donation is one of the simplest ways to give something back to the community. Almost anyone in the community aged between 16 and 70 years who weighs more than 45 kilograms and is in reasonable good health is a potential blood donor. Blood donation begins simply by making an appointment with the Red Cross to give blood. They can do this by calling 131495. Donating blood only takes around 10 minutes, but it is advisable to allow at least an hour for the whole process, which includes a personal interview and refreshments. You can donate 470 millilitres of whole blood every 12 weeks. However, you can donate blood plasma every two weeks. It is a fact that more blood is needed. Open-heart surgery for an adult will require two to six units; a leukaemia patient will require two to six units; and a bone marrow transplant will require one or two units, given every other day for four weeks. I could give many more statistics, but just those statistics confirm the constant need for blood supplies. There are benefits for the donor as well. Each time you donate, your blood pressure and haemoglobin levels are checked. All donated blood is screened for the presence of blood-borne diseases such as HIV1 and 2, hepatitis B and C, HTLV1 and 2-which is human T-cell lymphotropic virus-and syphilis. Since 2005-06, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service has been fully funded jointly by the governments of Australia, with the Australian government contributing 63 per cent of funding and the remaining eight state and territory governments contributing the remaining 37 per cent on a proportional basis. Young people can and do donate too. Red Cross has a Young Bloods program that encourages students to get a group of friends together and give blood. High schools in my electorate regularly have blood donation drives, with teachers and staff getting involved too. Schools can really make a difference. I commend the schools in my electorate who hold blood donation drives, and I encourage more schools to get involved. we eat and the water we drink. That is how blood was explained to me by my brother, who happens to be one of Queensland’s-and, indeed, this country’s-finest young neurosurgeons. As well, my sister recently graduated in medicine. SoI have a brother and a sister who are right at the heart of the medical world, and they say to me that in this country of ours much more can and should be done to encourage our fellow Australians to donate blood. World Blood Donor Day is 14 June, and I want to take the opportunity in the federal parliament, as the member for Ryan, to first of all thank all those constituents of mine who have so very generously given of their time and their blood in the past. I want to also encourage those who might not have considered this in the past to contemplate the profound significance of making a donation of the very valuable gift of life-that is, the blood that they have to sustain their own life. Much has been said on both sides of the parliament about the significance of donating blood to those in our society who are in desperate need of it. The donation of blood is a voluntary gesture. It is unpaid. Donors are only recognised by the profound generosity of their deed. The selflessness of Australians in providing a reliable and sufficient supply of blood really does deserve the full respect and applause of the rest of us. The theme for this year’s World Blood Donor Day is Many Happy Returns. It highlights the importance of giving blood on a regular basis. The healthy lifestyle that regular donors lead makes the blood supply the MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Private Members Business
287,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (7.20 Pm),"Blood is as vital to life as the air we breathe, the foodsafest possible, which is the key reason that Australia has one of the most effective blood supply systems in the world. As many of my colleagues have said previously-and I echo their comments-in Australia some 21,000 donations are required every week. Blood, as we would all know, cannot be manufactured. It is the gift of life. It is precious and sourced from within us, and we are able to donate to those in need of it. More regular donors are needed to build and maintain a sustainable blood supply system in our country. That will play a crucial role in meeting the increased demands for blood products and blood transfusion services. We have in this country one of the finest organisations going-that is, the Australian Red Cross-which manages and encourages Australians to donate blood. The giving of blood, as I said, is a selfless act that helps not only those who have suffered from traumatic incidents, such as accidents or burns, but also those Australians who suffer from medical conditions such as cancer, heart disease, stomach and bowel disease and liver and kidney diseases and also people with haemophilia, newborn babies and pregnant women. In fact, some 30 per cent of donated blood goes to cancer patients, including those who are suffering from leukaemia. Another 30 per cent goes to those suffering from heart, stomach and bowel disease, and another 40 per cent goes to burns and accident victims and kidney and liver disease patients. The giving of blood is a significant deed. One of my political heroes is Winston Churchill, and one of his famous sayings is, ‘We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.’ I also want to take the opportunity in the parliament to thank the volunteers of the Australian Red Cross, who-like so many volunteers across so many wonderful charities and not-for-profit organisations in this country-tirelessly give of their time, their skill and their services to encourage their fellow Australians to donate blood. Unfortunately, blood components have a shelf life of up to five days for platelets, 42 days for red cells and up to one year for plasma. So it is easy to understand why the need for blood is constant. As the federal member for Ryan, I take this opportunity to encourage not only my fellow Australians to donate blood, like my colleagues have done, but also specifically those in my electorate. Those people living in the Ryan electorate all know that the big Red Cross buses are at the Indooroopilly shopping centre-(Time expired) Ms HALL (Shortland) (7.25 pm)-I would like to congratulate the member for Werriwa for bringing this very important motion to the House. I stand here not only as a person who has benefited from a blood transfusion but also as somebody who is now a regular blood donor. It is very appropriate that this motion is before the House at this particular time, with World Blood Donor Day being on 14 June. Unfortunately, it is held on a Saturday and I am not too sure how many people will be able to give blood on that day. I will be donating blood on Tuesday, 10 June, the closest date to 14 June that I could arrange. I would encourage members of this House to do the same as I am doing, particularly around World Blood Donor Day. Importantly, all donations are made by volunteers in Australia. The safety of those donations is assured because of the vigilant way the Red Cross test the blood. In fact, not everybody can give blood. At this point, I would like to congratulate the Red Cross for the fine work that they do. I emphasise that volunteers give blood in Australia. People receive no payment for giving their blood and that is one factor that assures the safety of the blood that people receive. MAIN COMMITTEE As I mentioned, not everybody can donate blood. We heard from the member for Dawson, who is unable to donate blood because he was in the UK between 1980 and 1996. If you have had a tattoo, if you have had cancer or if you have an infection, it will impact on the quality of your blood. If you take certain medications, you can perhaps give blood but those medications can actually impact on the quality of your blood and your platelets can be affected. Something as simple as Nurofen can have an impact on the quality of your blood. The taking of certain other medications means that you cannot give blood. If you have had multiple sexual partners or unprotected sex, both these things prohibit donating blood. But all these things prohibiting the donation of blood ensure the safety of the blood that people in Australia receive. The member for Dawson, I think, also mentioned that a blood donor is basically having a health check every time they go along to give blood. People with certain medical conditions are unable to give blood-people with heart conditions and pregnant women. My daughter is a regular blood donor. She is currently pregnant and she said to me that she is missing being able to go along and give blood. I have a very close friend who, for many years, donated blood. He was just short of his 100th donation and his haemoglobin count fell. He was around age 75 when he stopped giving blood. I was speaking to him tonight and he said to me, ‘I’d still be giving it, if it wasn’t for that.’ All the staff in my office went en masse to give blood. When we went along, unfortunately, a number of the staff were unable to give blood. One person had recently had a tattoo and another had an infection. Out of the staff, only two of us could give blood. It has already been stated by other members what the blood is used for, so I will not go over that. But only one in 30 people actually donate blood. The body replaces the blood within 24 to 48 hours and replenishes red blood cells over a 10to 12-week period. There are 21,000 donations required each week, so I would like to call on all members in this House to give their blood and to do what I am going to do-go out there, as close as they can to World Blood Donor Day, and give that gift of life. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Botany Bay and the Kurnell Peninsula Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Morrison: That the House: (1) recognises that: (a) the Kurnell Peninsula of southern Sydney is the traditional land of the Gweagal people of the Dharawal nation; (b) the landing site of Lieutenant James Cook on April 29, 1770 at Kurnell is the modern birthplace of our nation and is recognised on the National Heritage List; (c) the village of Kurnell is a strong local community comprising approximately 700 homes; (d) Botany Bay is a valuable marine environment providing sanctuary for migratory birdlife and habitat for territorial marine creatures; and (e) construction of the desalination pipeline has commenced across Botany Bay from the Kurnell Peninsula, under approval as critical infrastructure by the New South Wales State Government; MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Private Members Business
288,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),"Order! The time allotted for this debate(2) expresses concern that: (a) Part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 in New South Wales exempts critical infrastructure projects from all planning instruments and codes that might otherwise apply, precludes third party rights of appeal and limits powers and penalties in relation to enforcement of breaches of conditions; (b) due to the use of Part 3A of the Act, the impacts of the construction of this pipeline on the marine environment and cultural heritage of Botany Bay and the Kurnell Peninsula are unknown; and (c) since construction has commenced, there have been a series of breaches in relation to the failure of silt nets to contain land fill on Silver Beach at Kurnell; sheet pilling testing has exceeded nominated noise vibration benchmarks, posing a threat to resident property; and there is concern in the community about the ongoing impacts and failures of this project; and (3) calls on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts to protect the physical environment and cultural heritage of Botany Bay and the Kurnell Peninsula by requesting the New South Wales State Government to: (a) prepare a comprehensive environmental remediation plan to address the impact of developing the desalination plant, including the pipeline across Botany Bay; (b) conduct such environmental studies as are required to determine the impact of the development of the desalination plant and associated pipeline on the environment, and to make such studies available to the public; (c) ensure that the development of environmental remediation plans is a requirement for any future referred approvals for critical infrastructure projects to the Commonwealth by the New South Wales Government that are subject to Part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979; (d) prepare a heritage and community remediation plan that addresses the impact and disruption caused to residents and the area by the construction of the desalination plant and associated pipeline; and (e) ensure the New South Wales State Government and its agents monitor and report on the ongoing impacts of the project and commit to informing residents in advance of any issues that may impact on residents or their local environment. motion, which goes to a significant concern of the residents of the Sutherland Shire and particularly in my own electorate of Cook. Kurnell and Botany Bay are places of profound national significance to all Australians, whether you live near Botany Bay or across the country. It is the landing site of Lieutenant James Cook on 29 April 1770 and was named Botany Bay for the biodiversity of plant and marine life that was discovered there at that time by Banks and Solander and which was much celebrated when they returned to the United Kingdom after their historic voyage. It was the place of first serious exchange between Europeans and Indigenous Australians and, I might also note, Polynesian people-as Tupia was also on the Endeavour. The Indigenous Australians on that occasion were the Gweagal people of the Dharawal nation. I was there on Saturday again for a reconciliation service. There was much talk about the significance of that site and the relationship between Indigenous Australians, European Australians and all other Australians. It is on the National Heritage List. It is home to the Towra Point wetlands, a Ramsar listed wetland that includes approximately half the remaining mangrove communities in Sydney, MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Private Members Business
289,Mr Morrison (Cook) (7.30 Pm),"I thank the House for the opportunity to present thishabitat to over 30 species of migratory birds listed under the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement and several others species listed under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act. It is home to the weedy sea dragon, sting rays, starfish, nudibranchs, feather stars, sea urchins, sea dragons and other invertebrate groups. Most of these are territorial, and they cannot survive once their homes are destroyed. In fact, I am sure all members would be surprised at this. When we think of Botany Bay we often think of industry, ports, large ships, petrol refineries and so on. But those who have had the opportunity to explore the unique marine environment of Botany Bay, particularly the areas of the Towra Point wetlands in my electorate of Cook and Botany Bay National Park, will know it is a rich environmental area. It is also home to more than 700 people and families living in the close community of Kurnell Village. It is a bay where for 70 years hundreds of chemical and industrial plants have poured their wastes, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cyanide, lead, mercury and zinc. All of this has been poured into this bay over a long period of time, particularly through the Georges River and the Cooks River, and these wastes have now settled. They have been undisturbed and are lying dormant on the floor of the bay. This motion is about addressing the serious threat to this very sensitive and very special place posed by Labor’s desalination plant and the associated pipeline at Kurnell. The pipeline is of the same height and width as the Lane Cove tunnel in Sydney but more than three times its length. Its construction will require removal of over one million tonnes of seabed material. This is an ill-considered and ill-conceived project. I would argue on behalf of the residents of my electorate that it is not needed. Of the 1,200-plus average millimetres of rainfall in Sydney each year, 97 per cent goes out to sea. We have a catchment problem in Sydney, not a rainfall problem. Also, it will become a stranded asset. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 September 2007, a former New South Wales government water adviser, Stuart White, was quoted as saying: ... if the plant’s need was based on dam levels it would ‘never have been used in the last century’. ‘The plant is likely to be needed very infrequently. This makes it a ‘stranded asset’-economic language for ‘white elephant’ ... This is the wrong place for it. If you do have to proceed with it, it should be built not at Kurnell but at Malabar. There you can plug into the water network, and the water will be used in the eastern suburbs and the inner western suburbs of Sydney. Then there would be no need for a pipeline across Botany Bay, which is a very shallow bay of no more than five metres on average in depth. It is a breach of the state Labor government’s commitment to only proceed with this project if dam levels hit 30 per cent-and this is probably the most telling blow of all for the residents of the shire, particularly Kurnell. There was a commitment that we would only go ahead if we were in a crisis where dam levels hit 30 per cent. Dam levels hit 33 per cent and Morris Iemma, the Premier of New South Wales, hit the panic button and he proceeded with the project against the advice of experts, who also said it should only proceed if dam levels hit 30 per cent-dam levels are now over 65 per cent. It is overpriced. While they talk about a price of $2 billion, that does not include the $2 billion that will be needed to develop the wind farm to power the desalination plant so the government can meet its commitment to green energy. That $2 billion spent on green energy should be spent on green energy to displace other forms of energy use across New South Wales. But instead it is going for a white elephant at MAIN COMMITTEE Kurnell-not to mention the up to $1 billion that will probably be needed in other pipeline associated works to connect the desalination plant to the infrastructure of the city’s water distribution network. So that is $5 billion. It has been made possible by an ill-considered law at a state level, the state significant infrastructure provisions under the EPandA act. This bypasses environmental protection laws, including assessment of impact and public consultation. It removes third-party rights of appeal. It prevents stop work and interim protection orders. It prevents notices regarding cultural heritage, threatened species and pollution. And it ignored also the advice of numerous departments at a state level, including the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, the New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change and the New South Wales Department of Health-not to mention the Sutherland Shire Council, who were just completely ridden over the top of. The intent of raising this matter in today’s debate is really to draw attention to the need to undertake some remedial action. In going forward with this matter, I wrote to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I raised this matter with him because this government has said it wants to put an end to the blame game. SoI wrote to the minister not only because he is the minister but also because he is the member for Kingsford Smith and Botany Bay is covered by his electorate. Instead of actually joining me in trying to put some pressure on the state government to ensure that, once they build this thing, they clean up their mess, his response was nothing to do with ending blame games. It says in his letter to me: I have the power to make decisions in relation to matters of national environmental significance. I am unable to intervene in decisions of state and local government that do not impact on these matters. This is an opportunity for the federal government in this post blame game era to actually get involved with a project which is causing serious environmental damage to the Botany Bay area and the Kurnell Peninsula, and the minister has remained stonily silent on this issue, despite the fact that Botany Bay sits within his own electorate. The intent here is to put forward some sensible solutions as to what can be done now. The Kurnell community and those who live in the shire are not saying, ‘Stop the desalination plant.’ They understand that it has been rammed over the top of them using the state significant infrastructure legislation. But they are asking for a number of things. Firstly, they are saying develop a remediation plan for this project. If you are going to insist on proceeding, then clean up your mess and compensate the communities and the environment for the unregulated impact of this project. Secondly, do the work to understand the damage that is being done to Kurnell and the bay. At present, because of the way these laws of environmental assessment were bypassed at a state level, we simply do not know the full impact of this project on the environment of Botany Bay, not to mention the cultural and heritage significance of the area. Thirdly, ensure the cop is on the beat. We hear about cops on beats on other issues, but we need a cop on the beat on this project because currently it is residents who are standing and looking over the fence of the construction project and blowing the whistle when they are violating site conditions, when they are violating benchmarks for shudder vibrations from sheet piling. When silt nets are breaking and silt is spilling into the bay, it is the residents who are the ones who are actually blowing the whistle. As this pipeline comes across Botany Bay and goes into Kyeemagh and starts working its way through the outer southern suburbs of Sydney, residents on that side should heed the warning of what is happening in Kurnell-that this is an unregulated project which will cause MAIN COMMITTEE major disruption. Furthermore, we need to plan for the future and safeguard the environment from future environmental vandalism under the New South Wales state significant infrastructure legislation. Where parallel approvals are required from the Commonwealth, these remediation plans and the supporting documentation must be a requirement. If Labor wants to lower the bar on environmental protection at a state level, then let us not let the Commonwealth government follow suit. Let us ensure that we insist with state significant infrastructure legislation or promise coming to the Commonwealth on that basis that we apply the tests. The New South Wales Labor government is not listening. It was my hope that the federal minister would listen, if not for the sake of Botany Bay and Kurnell, and in his capacity as minister for the environment, then in his capacity as member for Kingsford Smith with responsibility for his own bay. tirely fanciful attack on the proposal for the desalination plant at Kurnell. The motion that the member for Cook was speaking to has three parts. The first part states obvious known values about Botany Bay such as that it is the landing site of Lieutenant James Cook on 29 April 1770, that the village of Kurnell is a strong local community and that Botany Bay is a valuable marine environment. All of that is stating the obvious-and that is pretty much all that was said by the member for Cook in his speech. But there is a false implication that these values are threatened by the pipeline of the desalination plant-when there is no evidence of any such threat. The second part of the motion makes several misleading statements about the system of environmental regulation in New South Wales, and I will say a few things about that in a moment. The third part of the motion ignores the history of this project, ignores in particular the role of the former Liberal government-about which the member for Cook has said nothing-and asks the federal environment minister to do something which he has no power to do. We just had a bizarre statement by the member for Cook which went like this: ‘I wrote to the minister because this government wants to put an end to the blame game.’ The member for Cook then told us that the minister wrote back saying, entirely correctly-as had two previous Liberal environment ministers-that there was no power for the federal government to intervene. Yet the member for Cook said in the next sentence that this was an opportunity for the federal government to act and that the minister has remained ‘stonily silent’. How it can be said that the minister for the environment has remained stonily silent when he courteously and promptly wrote back to the letter from the member for Cook is a mystery perhaps the member for Cook can explain later. It is simply not true, as was suggested by the member for Cook in his motion, that due to the use of the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 the risks from this project remain unknown. The member for Cook used a similar phrase in his speech when he said, ‘We simply do not know what the impact is’-that also is not true. Sydney Water published a 455-page environmental assessment in April 2007, which contained a very detailed examination and assessment of likely impacts. Before that-and this is the significant thing-Sydney Water had referred the project to the federal minister under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of the Commonwealth with a very lengthy submission setting out the likely impacts of this project, which were regarded as negligible. In that referral to the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage on 26 September 2005, it was explained that the desalination plant was intended to assist the New South Wales MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Private Members Business
290,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (7.40 Pm),"We have just heard from the member for Cook an engovernment’s strategy of drought-proofing Sydney’s water supply over the next 25 years. At the time there were suggestions made that the proposal should be a controlled action because of potential significant impacts on the Kurnell Peninsula national heritage place, the Towra Point Ramsar site and listed threatened and migratory species. There were 1,470 submissions in respect of this referral and, as the referral document made clear, the two relevant listed threatened species present on the site were not thought to be at risk from this project becauseway? federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Campbell, found that there was no reason for the proposed development to be treated as a controlled action, under the federal legislation, and that it did not require further assessment or approval under the act. In other words, this project was found not to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance. On8 November 2005, having extended the time for consideration, Senator Campbell formally said, ‘This is not a matter that is governed by the federal legislation.’ There were two more years of Liberal government until the change of government on 24 November last year-including a new environment minister, the present shadow Treasurer. We did not hear the present member for Cook, nor did we hear the former member for Cook, Mr Baird, demanding action from those two former Liberal ministers-Senator Campbell or the member for Wentworth. There is very possibly one strong and good reason the member for Cook was not making that call, because in September 2007 we learned from the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, that he was strongly supporting the desalination plant. This is what he said in September 2007: We have a situation where our capital cities are running out of water, and I think we should have a desalination plant for every capital city in Australia. Another good reason we see nothing attacking former Liberal ministers for the environment from the present member for Cook, or indeed from his predecessor, is that the Liberal Party is only ever interested in scoring cheap political points. It is not the substance of the issue which interests the member for Cook; it is simply the question of how to boost his own visibility, perhaps, or how to use the issue to attack the Labor state government. Indeed, that is what he is seeking to do. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has made it clear that, if there is any change to the project that results in potentially significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance, a new referral to the federal minister will be required, and that might lead to a new assessment process. You might wonder why it is that the member for Cook is wasting the time of this parliament calling on the federal environment minister to do something which he has no power to do and which previous Liberal environment ministers have said they had no power to do.

The next step in this process was that the thenfirst reason might be that the member for Cook is single-handedly, and somewhat ridiculously, trying to paint the Liberal Party as a party which actually cares about the environment. threatened species is not the weedy sea dragon-which I think was one of the species referred to by the member for Cook-nor the grey-headed flying fox, but anyone in the New South Wales Liberal Party who is more progressive than Genghis Khan. Notably, one of the threatened species in the New South Wales Liberal Party is the present member for Cook, who earlier this year-extraordinarily-was not allowed to join a branch of his own party in his own electorate. I do not have to search for my own description of the significance of this, because some prominent Liberals have done it for me. The New South Wales state President of the Liberal Party, Geoff Selig, said, ‘It is ridiculous and makes us a laughing stock.’ being permitted to join a branch of his own party in his own electorate, the state opposition leader said that ‘there is a state of civil war’ in the Liberal Party. And the former member for Cook, Mr Baird, described it as ‘factional nonsense which highlights the problems that we face’. To recapitulate, the Rudd Labor government understands its environmental responsibilities. The minister for the environment understands his environmental responsibilities. If there is a proper and lawful basis for federal intervention in any major project anywhere in Australia which threatens matters of national environmental significance, the federal minister will act. But we will not be dictated to by the member for Cook or other members of his party who are intent on attacking state Labor governments, prepared to wholly ignore proper processes and pretend to have discovered very recently a concern for the environment which was not previously visible. from the member for Cook. The reason I do so is very simple. Both he and I in our respective maiden speeches set out a very clear principle: our task, our responsibility, in our own electorates was to protect our coasts and work towards clean coasts. In each of our situations, there is a threat which is fundamental, and each has been brought about by, in his case, the action and inaction of the New South Wales government and, in the case of the Mornington Peninsula and the Gunnamatta outfall, the inaction of the Victorian government. Turning specifically to this motion, we want to address it in two parts. My learned colleague the member for Cook set out the physical risks associated with the desalination plant. I want to deal with the second element: the opportunity cost of pursuing a $2 billion project which soaks up that capital, which would otherwise be available and should otherwise be applied to the process of cleaning up our coasts. The problem that we face here is that, on the edge of Botany Bay, 166 billion litres of high-rate primary sewage is discharged every year. It is discharged from Malabar Headland. I would note that the site of Malabar Headland is within the electorate of the current minister for the environment. So let me repeat that, to the MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Private Members Business

Why is this a problem? It is a problem for two reasons. Firstly: it is a fouling of our ocean. It is high-rate primary sewage which, as the member for Wentworth has famously said, simply represents the removal of sandshoes from our waste products. We are using the ocean as a dumping ground. Secondly: this waste of water, as well as pollution of our ocean, is likely to be in place for another generation. This motion goes to the heart of that problem. By taking $2 billion which could be used to clean up most of the almost 400 billion litres of waste water which comes from the Malabar Headland, from the Bondi ocean outfall and from the North Sydney ocean outfall, we are seeing a grand opportunity cost. The member for Banks represents a Sydney seat and I cannot believe that he would condone the dumping of 166 billion litres of waste water-primary treated, barely treated, effluent-off the coast of Malabar Headland. And then, when you take on board Bondi and North Head near Manly, that is 350 billion litres of primary treated waste water. The rest of the country treats their water to a secondary or tertiary standard. This is water which, at a time of national need, should be recycled for industry and agriculture. Yet at this moment, at the very time we should be adopting a 21st-century approach to cleaning up these 19th-century avenues for dumping our sewage off our coasts, the New South Wales government has come along and embedded this practice for another generation. This capital resource can and should be used, as the rest of the country has done, for cleaning up our coasts. I know that honourable members on the opposite side believe this. They cannot sit there and condone the dumping of primary sewage on a monumental basis every year off our coast. But that is what this decision will do-it will use $2 billion of scarce capital resource on a desalination plant. Desalination may have a role, but our view in the Liberal Party is that it is the last resort, not the first resort. Our task is very simple: clean up our coasts by recycling our waste water for industry and agriculture. It is what the rest of the world does; it is what the rest of Australia is going to do; it is what Sydney Water must do. And the priority must be recycling rather than desalination, because that is the way of the 21st century. Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (7.55 pm)-I rise also to speak on the private member’s motion put by the member for Cook. I acknowledge what the honourable member has said about the national environmental and heritage significance of the Kurnell Peninsula and Botany Bay. However, the federal environment minister’s powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 relate only to projects which are likely to impact on matters of national environmental significance. In respect of the New South Wales government’s proposed desalination project, this did mean the Kurnell Peninsula national heritage place, the Towra Point Ramsar wetlands site and the listed threatened and migratory species. The New South Wales government referred the proposed desalination plant to the federal government for consideration under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in September 2005. The referral was made available for public comment and almost 1,500 submissions were received. The question for consideration at that time was whether the proposal should be a controlled action, as defined under the act, because of the potential impacts on the Kurnell Peninsula national heritage place, the Towra Point Ramsar wetlands site and listed threatened and migratory species. MAIN COMMITTEE The then Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Senator Ian Campbell, determined on 8 November 2005 that the proposed action was not a controlled action and therefore did not require further assessment or approval under the terms of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. He and his department were required to consider each component of the proposed project, the proposed action and the proposed mitigation measures. After examining the assessment material presented by New South Wales, the former minister for the environment, Minister Campbell-one of your own party-decided that this was not a matter within the federal jurisdiction. I can sympathise with the member for Cook where there is perhaps some community concern about the project, but I have to tell him that Senator Ian Campbell had form. In my own electorate of Hasluck in Perth, Senator Ian Campbell was intimately involved in the decision to approve a brickworks development on Perth airport land. That is Commonwealth land, and under the Airports Act the jurisdiction of developments on the site is exclusively in the hands of the federal government. Indeed, part of the problem with the project proposal was that there was no ability for state or local government authorities, let alone ordinary members of the community, to have any impact or any influence on the decision that Senator Ian Campbell had the power to recommend and be involved in. Of course, as history transpires, in August 2006 the then Howard government’s ministers, including Senator Ian Campbell, approved the development of a brickworks on Perth airport land, right in the centre of a residential area with clear environmental and health consequences for residents within the electorate of Hasluck. Many conjecture that it may well have been one of the decisions that did not assist the former member for Hasluck in his campaign to hold his seat at the 2007 federal election. If there have been changes in the proposed project by the New South Wales government that result in potentially significant impacts on those matters of national environmental significance, a new referral to the federal department will be required and could possibly lead to a new assessment process. If existing works, despite assurances from New South Wales to the contrary, do impact on matters of national environmental significance then the department of the environment’s compliance and enforcement branch will investigate. I am absolutely certain that the minister for the environment will not hesitate to rigorously apply the law. As I say, some opposition to this project may not be based on environmental grounds but rather on the question of desalination. I can speak from Western Australia’s own experience on the success of the Kwinana desalination plant-so much so that we are now building a second oneand that plant has received significant approval and provides 17 per cent of Perth’s water supply. We are, of course, the only capital city in Australia that has not been required to go to water restrictions on sprinklers and the like. It is about planning for the future. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Recycling Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the House: (1) calls on the Federal Government to commit to ban by the year 2012 the inclusion of all plastic and glass bottles in landfill; MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Private Members Business
303,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),"Order! The time allotted for this debate(2) notes the ban would be supported by implementation of a national program providing a cash refund for all plastic and glass bottles; (3) calls on the Federal Government to reimburse grocery and convenience stores that provide collection sites for the empty bottles and provide cash refunds for each bottle, with larger bottles attracting a larger cash refund; and (4) calls on the Federal Government to cooperate with local government bodies to ensure that smaller towns in rural, regional and remote Australia receive financial support to establish a collection centre and to transport bottles to the nearest recycling centre. They are keen to reduce our carbon footprint as best they can and they are keen to make sure we become an environmentally friendly nation. The new government campaigned on being climate friendly and, as such, I believe they now need to set specific, achievable goals that not only are about reducing our carbon footprint but also cover other important environmental issues, such as recycling. But is important that the goals we set are attainable and reasonable and are not cost-prohibitive. It is widely accepted that any measure to improve our treatment of the environment will cost money, but the proper legislation, procedure and planning will ensure that the environmental benefits far outweigh the costs. I call on the federal government to commit to a ban of all plastic and glass bottles included in landfill by 2012. To support this ban, I am calling on the government to introduce a nationwide container deposit scheme so that an incentive is provided to all Australians to reduce the amount of landfill from plastic and glass bottles. For just over 30 years now, South Australia, the only state with a container deposit scheme, has provided people with a 5c refund for each recycled drink container. The recycling rate in South Australia is now 85 per cent, compared to just 35 per cent in other states. In February, the South Australian state government announced it will increase the 5c deposit to 10c later this year, a move which will no doubt increase the already high recycling rate. This successful scheme should be embraced by other states. However, we can go one step further in providing even further incentive by introducing across the nation reverse vending machines, which are very popular in Scandinavian countries such as Finland. Reverse vending machines are small, automated machines which have been installed in supermarkets, local shops, service stations and kiosks across Finland. The machines take up very little shop space and their installation is in cooperation with retailers. Consumers take their empty glass and plastic bottles to their local supermarket or 7-Eleven equivalent and deposit their empty bottles. After they have deposited their bottles one by one into the automated chute, the machine prints out a bar-coded docket which tells the consumer how much money they will be reimbursed. The consumer then takes it to the checkout and is reimbursed the money. Larger plastic bottles attract a larger refund than smaller ones. Finland has a return rate of some 98 per cent-the highest in Europe. On average, a glass bottle is refilled 33 times and a plastic bottle is refilled 18 times. The empty plastic bottle caps are also recycled. It is estimated that this highly successful scheme prevents around 380,000 tonnes of waste annually. The scheme has also had an impact on the trucking industry: trucks deliver the full bottles and return the empty bottles to the manufacturer or soft drink plant, thereby reducing the number of empty trucks on the road and increasing transport productivity. MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Private Members Business
304,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (8.01 Pm),"Australians are keen to help the environment.The Finnish system, which began in the 1970s, around the same time as South Australia’s deposit scheme, shows that monetary reimbursement and easy access to return points can increase the incentive to recycle. Indeed, recycling rates in Australia have increased and, in some aspects, this can be attributed to increased access to kerbside recycling. The Australian government’s 2006 Productivity Commission report on waste management suggested that recycling participation in many households may simply be a response to having a convenient and easy-to-use recycling service provided for them. As part of a national container deposit scheme, federal and state governments should work in cooperation with supermarkets and service stations to install reverse vending machines. Woolworths, Coles, 7-Elevens, NightOwls, IGAs and service stations would be provided with a financial incentive from the federal government to install the machines. Further incentive would be provided by consumers continually returning to the store and spending their reimbursement on products within the shop. In fact, some reverse vending machines allow for a retailer’s logo and message to be printed on the docket, providing retailers with an opportunity to promote current deals or savings. Consumers, despite paying an increase of 10c, 15c or 20c on their drink initially, will be able to have this money returned to them through easy, local access to the machines. In rural and remote parts of Australia, where market competition is limited, it is highly unlikely these machines could be installed in locally owned service stations or small grocery stores. I therefore call on the federal government, when implementing a national container deposit scheme, to work with local governments to provide a return point for regional and remote Australians. Many smaller, remote area councils do not provide kerbside recycling services and instead provide drop-off points for rubbish. These collection points can easily serve as a return point for empty glass and plastic bottles. For example, a local government employee at the drop-off point could calculate the number of bottles returned by a person and then write out a docket which could then be taken to local council offices for reimbursement. Federal government financial assistance would allow the local councils to then transport the bottles to a recycling centre or bulk collection point. It is currently cheaper to dump glass into landfill than to recycle it. With only around a third of bottles being recycled, it is high time the federal government moved to implement a scheme similar to that in South Australia. I understand that the current parliamentary inquiry into waste management will hand down its report in August, and I look forward to seeing what measures it proposes to increase bottle recycling. In the meantime, I call on the government to look further into the implementation of reverse vending machines across Australia. A national container deposit scheme, using reverse vending machines where possible, is a win-win situation. Australians are willing to put in a little bit more effort to help the environment if the financial incentive is present and the inconvenience is minimal. Recycling rate targets would be easier to meet and the federal government would be meeting some of their commitments to reduce energy use, waste and environmental harm. Perhaps most importantly, however, is the community benefit derived from such a scheme. Putting a monetary value on the return of bottles will help to reduce litter. According to Clean Up Australia, glass pieces were the second most common item of rubbish collected on Clean Up Australia Day in March last year. Glass alcohol bottles were in fourth place, and plastic bottle caps and lids came in fifth. Polyethylene terephthalate-PET-plastic beverage MAIN COMMITTEE containers came in ninth. Last year, six of the 10 most common items collected on Clean Up Australia Day were recyclable. The Finnish example shows us that if people had an incentive to keep their bottles, instead of throwing them away once finished, the number of glass and plastic bottles littering our environment would reduce. The 2006 Productivity Commission report into waste management found that the people most likely to litter are aged below 25 years, unemployed and/or are part of large groups-the same people who would benefit most from personally collecting bottles and returning them for some much needed cash. Indeed, in Finland and Denmark, young Scandinavians can often be seen in the early mornings-after a party, for instancelugging bags and cartons of empty bottles back to the supermarket to receive some welcome cash. A container deposit scheme would provide a vital fundraising opportunity for community groups. In fact, last year in South Australia the scouting organisation made more than $7 million from bottle recycling. Schools, P&Cs, sporting clubs and community organisations would be able to introduce collection programs and use the money raised to fund a range of programs and improvements to their own organisations. This Labor government campaigned on its climate-friendliness and its commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and environmental harm. I therefore call on this government to work in cooperation with businesses and local governments to introduce a national container deposit scheme. I further call on this government to make moves to ban the inclusion of glass and plastic bottles in landfill by 2012. If this government is serious about being more climate friendly, then it should, as soon as possible, take steps to join its South Australian counterparts in helping Australians help the environment by implementing a national scheme. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (8.10 pm)-I commend the member for Maranoa for placing this important issue on the parliamentary business paper. I think we all share his concern about the issue of waste management. It is a very important issue for our community generally. I want to assure the member for Maranoa that the Rudd Labor government is keen to explore ways to strengthen Australia’s recycling performance and to reduce the amount of litter in our environment. It is the case that households and businesses continue to generate more than 30 million tonnes of solid waste each year and, despite considerable efforts and advances, around half of all that still ends up in landfill. It is estimated that Australia is producing almost 750 kilograms of waste per person annually, and of course this leads to a situation where landfills are choking and creating a costly headache for authorities, particularly local government authorities, struggling to store the rubbish and to keep opening never-ending landfill sites. In the words of the Adelaide based CRC for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment-and I think this probably generally sums up our views on the issue: Disposing of waste safely, permanently and economically is a challenge and a cost for every major production industry. … whatever can be done to turn these wastes into safe, economically valuable products and to prevent them from posing an environmental or health risk in the future is highly desirable. MAIN COMMITTEE Of course, the key long-term aim in this debate, when we are dealing with waste management, is to have industries design products which minimise elements that cannot be reused, repaired or recycled and to educate communities to eschew overconsumption and excess packaging. However, in recent times it has become a debate about not just reducing litter and reducing the flow of material to landfill but also, in essence, improving management of the waste stream, which is increasingly becoming part of the complex suite of solutions needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I note in more recent times that the waste industry has increased its efforts to tackle the release of methane inside landfills. Increasingly, the industry is looking to burn off the gas and, where possible, generate electricity from that process. It is good also to see that household kerbside collection and drop-off centres for recycling have become part of daily life in many of our cities and regional areas. It is not just a matter of saving landfill space, as important as that is, but increasingly one of looking at energy use as well. As we know, there are new challenges to be met, one of the most important being the toxic e-waste stream. I read a recent report that suggested that two million old TV sets will end up in landfill this year-let alone the problem we all face with superseded computers and mobile phones. In that regard, it is interesting to note Australia’s current love affair with bottled water is leaving environmentalists very worried about the increasing toll on the planet. Not only do these bottled water suppliers suck up valuable fuels to make them but they are also adding, as we know, to the mountains of rubbish, particularly in public places. Unfortunately, while many Australians are enthusiastic recyclers at home, we do not actually provide many facilities to collect waste in public places. The motion that comes before us from the member for Maranoa specifically raises the strategy of container deposit legislation. It is true to say that container deposit legislation is considered by many to be a potential way to increase recycling, particularly of beverage containers. As the member pointed out, consumers would pay a deposit on certain beverage containers and that deposit would be partially refunded when the empty containers were returned to a collection point, thus giving individuals an economic incentive to return used beverage containers for disposal. However, perhaps the member may not be aware that the federal environment minister, Mr Garrett, has recently discussed options for improving recycling, including CDL-container deposit legislation-with his counterpart state and territory environment ministers as recently as April this year. That body, the EPHC-the Environment Protection and Heritage Council-agreed to investigate the merits of potential national options for improving the level of recycling of packaging wastes, such as beverage containers, and decreasing the amount of packaging litter. They believe this work will assess the environmental, economic and social costs and benefits of various options, including the option raised in the motion by the member for Maranoa. This review will obviously take into account the experiences of South Australia, which is, I think, currently the only state in Australia with CDL legislation. But the review will also look at the investigations of CDL by other states, because there are differing opinions, and it will consider the mid-term review of the National Packaging Covenant. So it will be a broader examination than just the specific focus that the member for Maranoa draws our attention to in his motion. The National Packaging Covenant is an important issue in this debate. That covenant was a voluntary agreement established in 1999. The mid-term review, which will shortly be upon us, MAIN COMMITTEE will assess this scheme under which the packaging industry aims to increase recycling rates of all packaging to 65 per cent by 2010. The mid-term review of that covenant will also assess its effectiveness and allow us to see whether more needs to be done to manage packaging waste in Australia. I would say to the member for Maranoa that the issue of container deposit legislation, in our view, should be seen in much broader terms, and it is an issue that is under active investigation by the Rudd Labor government in cooperation with the states and territories. We believe it is important to understand the full costs and benefits to the community of all waste management options, including CDL. That is why the body of federal, state and territory ministers is in fact undertaking this investigation. As I understand it, the new working group will make its final report in November this year. Environment ministers have also decided to develop a national plan of action on litter reduction, given broader concerns about the impacts of litter in Australia. Given that different studies over time have presented different views of how CDL would work in jurisdictions around Australia, it would be, in our view, pre-emptive to commit to a national program for container deposits as proposed in this motion before the necessary costbenefit analysis is undertaken. However, I do sincerely commend the member for Maranoa for bringing this important matter to our attention and I think he can rest assured that the Rudd Labor government is taking this issue seriously. It is progressing an examination of a costbenefit analysis and will certainly take into account the experience in South Australia and obviously the experiences that the member for Maranoa has pointed to in some overseas countries. We will make final decisions based on a very thorough examination of the issues raised in this motion. league the honourable member for Maranoa in this motion. I think this motion is timely, I think it is very important and I think it is one that recognises a real issue that has to be dealt with. While I welcome the comments of the member for Throsby with what I would call inprinciple support, I feel that we could probably go further and we could start to push this particular issue without having to wait for some of the other points which she raised, which I am sure are very valid. This issue is a clear-cut one that can be dealt with fairly quickly. Getting back to the motion: it talks about the importance of committing, by 2012, to ban the use of plastic and glass bottles in landfill; about providing a cash refund for glass and plastic bottles; about reimbursement to grocery and convenience stores that provide collection sites for empty bottles, which is the Finnish example, as the member for Maranoa pointed out; and about how the federal government can cooperate with local government bodies to ensure that people in the country can participate. I know from personal experience that it is easy to have a centralised depot when you have a high volume of these things, but often regional areas, particularly some of the less populated areas, present certain challenges in this regard. Clearly, the recycling situation in South Australia has worked. It is timely that South Australia has moved-as the member for Barker, who is sitting in the chair at the moment, knows only too well-from a 5c deposit to a 10c deposit. In my family’s experience in days gone by, when our boys were younger and we were holidaying in the electorate of Barker, one of the great ways to get the children out and earning some pocket money was for them to collect bottles and take them down to the recycling depot. It worked but, more importantly, it engenMAIN COMMITTEE",211,Private Members Business
305,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (8.19 Pm),"I am delighted to support my good friend and coldered an experience to think about as they go through life: the importance of recycling. South Australia has been nation-leading and I think it is something that should continue. My colleague here the member for Grey tells me that a friend of his bought a bottle of Perrier water in St Petersburg and on the label was ‘5c deposit if in South Australia’. South Australia has had a lot of influence. I think we can start to move much faster nationally than by waiting for some sort of a review. Not so long ago I had the pleasure of opening VicWest Recyclers, a new facility in Stawell. The work that this group are doing in recycling is quite remarkable. To see this in action, to see the way that the local community have supported it and the awareness it has led to in terms of the importance of recycling, is quite remarkable. Since VicWest Recyclers set up in Stawell, over 80 per cent of the community are involved in recycling. It shows that you can engender an attitude change. That is why this motion is so important. The member for Maranoa talked about the situation in Finland; they have a bottle return rate of 98 per cent. We really have a long way to go. I think that is why this motion is so important. It is timely and it needs to be acted upon, and I would certainly commend it to all honourable members. I would hope that the honourable member for Throsby would, following discussion of the motion brought up by the member for Maranoa, impress upon her colleagues on the front bench the need to move a bit faster. We really should move more quickly. I have great pleasure in supporting the motion. spoken in front of you, Mr Deputy Speaker Secker, so I will congratulate you on your appointment. I have some real practical examples relating to the waste management issue. In another working life I was previously the chairperson of the Central Highlands waste management group, which was a consortium of local governments partially within the federal seat of Corangamite. I certainly worked in a very diligent fashion on that body to educate the community about the importance of recycling. We saw a remarkable take-up in recycling through that period of the late nineties and the turn of this century. I was listening most intently to the contribution made by my neighbour the member for Wannon. I certainly do accept the concept that many regional and rural communities have many more challenges to meet in recycling, simply because of tyranny of distance and fewer volumes. I would like to congratulate the mover of this motion, the member for Maranoa. In broad terms, I certainly share his sentiment and concern for the environment. In fact, I would like a dollar for every plastic bag or plastic container that went unnecessarily to landfill. I suspect that I would probably be as wealthy as Bill Gates if I had that revenue. I think we all support recycling and I certainly acknowledge the member for Maranoa and his motion. In broad terms there is a lot of work to be done. The councils within the federal seat of Corangamite, and more broadly across Victoria, are working in a very diligent fashion to improve the systems that are used to recycle. Certainly I have had the pleasure of going to many modern recycling plants and very much value the contribution that they do make. Container deposit laws, CDLs, are viewed by some as a potential mechanism to increase recycling. Personally, I believe that they do have a role to play. I am most grateful that our minister, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, has already initiated some discussions with his state colleagues to investigate the possibilities that CD laws do provide in MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Private Members Business
306,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (8.24 Pm),"This may be the first time. I have actuallymeeting what I think is a very substantial challenge for all of us in becoming much more sustainable communities. A whole lot of work is required. For more than a decade people have been raising with me the approach that the South Australian government has taken. I had a very similar experience, when I was much younger, to that of the federal member for Wannon, where I collected containers and cashed them in and was able to buy packets of lollies and those sorts of things, and it was a very important source of revenue for me. I still have all of my teeth, so obviously I was not particularly successful at collecting containers to the extent that some of my friends and colleagues might have been. But I think we have some very significant challenges that we need to respond to. I think federal Labor is responding to those challenges. I have heard the suggestion from the other side-and of course I will endeavour to work within the circles of government to ensure that we do get the right mix of policy so that we can, as I say, become much more sustainable as communities. This is just one of those options. So, without further ado, I, too, congratulate the member for Maranoa and look forward to further dialogue perhaps in this place or the other place on how we might improve. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Hume Electorate: Wingecarribee Community Services Centre Inc. Regional Partnerships number of issues that affect my constituency. I particularly wish to highlight the concerns of a community group in my electorate that has been needlessly caught up in this government’s determination to play politics with rural and regional funding. The Wingecarribee Community Services Centre Inc. applied for and received approval under the Regional Partnerships program to build a much needed community centre. The contracts were let and the work began. During the earthworks stage, one very large tree had to be removed. Underneath this tree an old well was discovered. It was brick lined and had been used as a rubbish dump by persons unknown. The well was not mentioned on any of the papers held by council or on the 149 certificate, nor was it discovered during extensive geotechnical drilling and surveys. The presence of this old well led to some unexpected remedial work on the site: site decontamination, significant redesign of the footings and slab, additional concrete, further geotechnical advice and additional structural engineering work. All of this resulted in an additional cost of $171,062.41. Unfortunately, this situation became apparent at about the same time as the recent federal election was held. In fact, the Regional Partnerships variation form was submitted on 30 November 2007, six days after the election. The community groups approached their local government representatives, and the Wingecarribee Shire Council has made an additional contribution to this project of $93,500. Several representations have been made to Regional Partnerships to fund the shortfall of $86,062. However, three letters from MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Private Members Business

308,Mr Schultz (Hume) (8.29 Pm),"I rise to talk in the grievance debate tonight on athe relevant parliamentary secretary have ruled this out, no doubt in line with the Prime Minister’s declaration that the program was simply pork-barrelling, was of no use in regional communities and had been cut. This building was to house Meals on Wheels, adult day care, the Dementia and Alzheimer’s Advisory Centre, CareAssist, Schizophrenia Fellowship New South Wales and Volunteering Wingecarribee. I am sure that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and all of my parliamentary colleagues would agree that this is hardly an example of pork-barrelling but instead an amazing achievement on behalf of a community of only 42,500 people. Over several years, the local services and community have raised $676,647 towards this project. That is how much this community services centre means to them. The tenancies have been signed, and the community services were due to open the new facility today, 2 June. Yet the building stands silent and incomplete, and the Wingecarribee community continues to fundraise. But this small community has little if any hope of raising over $86,000 any time soon. The front page of the local paper today reads: Aged care support centre sends out SOS. $85,000 in 30 days. The reason that they have to raise that money in 30 days is that the contractor will have finished his work and the building will be completed but, because this group of volunteers is unable to pay the contractor the additional half of the $170,000 cost blow-out due to this unforeseen problem, the contractor cannot hand the keys over. We have a wonderful community services centre complete and ready to go and people ready to move in, but we cannot get it underway because we cannot find, in the trillion-dollar business of this country, $86,000 to assist this community. I think it is disgraceful. In the meantime, construction costs rise and security of the site will become a very serious issue. This is a good project. It will provide a hub for community services and allow people to more efficiently manage their funds through effective sharing of fixed costs, thereby freeing funds for caring for various target populations in the community. The works are not outside the scope of the application. The unexpected complication of the site was not discovered even with very careful and conservative planning and pre-construction research. For the want of $86,062, this project stands still, and the six community services that were due to open offices in the new centre today have nowhere to go. Recently, some projects were recognised as deserving a second chance, and those projects that had been approved but had not yet completed contract negotiations have been notified of their success. The announcement on 28 May said: ‘The Rudd government’s common sense approach will give not-for-profit groups the opportunity to complete their contracts.’ But the Wingecarribee Community Services Centre was not included in the list. This situation has arisen through unforseen circumstances and has been identified and dealt with in a prompt and professional manner. The proposed variation is to cope with additional costs for works with existing approval and not for works outside the intent of the contract. More than half of the cost of the additional expense has been raised through local government. No funding at all is available through the New South Wales state government. TodayI wrote to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs asking her to intervene. The six community services have been given notice on their previous accommodation. Yet, for the sake of political ideology and point-scoring, these six community agencies will no longer be able to deliver their services to some of the most vulnerable people in the commuMAIN COMMITTEE nity. I ask the minister and, indeed, the Prime Minister, to intervene in this situation and provide additional funds to this worthwhile project so that the Wingecarribee Services Centre can open and the six vital services can recommence operation. I mentioned earlier that the Labor government succumbed to significant pressure from rural and regional communities through their representatives and the media and allowed some additional projects to be funded under Regional Partnerships. In my own electorate of Hume, I have heard through the grapevine that it was decided that construction at Gunning Preschool was not pork-barrelling and that the funding will be available soon. I have not been notified officially, even though our new Prime Minister said he would treat all Australians fairly and would be professional and transparent in his governance. If what I heard from excited local constituents is true, then that is good. But why haven’t I heard anything? Will this be another one of those events where a community group works hard with its local member to convince a government that a project is worthwhile and will effectively deliver maximum value for money and then another government, through an unknown politician, tries to claim success? I had just that experience last Saturday in Crookwell at the official opening of Viewhaven Lodge. The former coalition government contributed $3.467 million towards this significant project which combines Banfield House and Harley Nursing Home into a single residential aged-care service. This is a good project but was just one of many applications from across Australia for funding, and it took significant lobbying to ensure it received well-deserved recognition. I might add that this lobbying was undertaken with the Hon. Julie Bishop when she was Minister for Ageing-well before she was Minister for Education-so that will give you a clue as to how long this whole project has taken. In the true spirit of the new Prime Minister’s much-lauded professional, fair and transparent governance, the organising committee was aware that I had not been invited to open the new facility. But, to their credit, they invited my wife and I to be part of their special day of celebration. Labor sent one of its unknown senators as its representative, to take the credit on behalf of the minister. I was not even informed of the opening of this new building by the ‘transparent’ government. People in rural and regional areas are not stupid; they understand effort and they have long memories. The sooner the Rudd government understand this and stop trying to take credit for work not done by them, the sooner they will gain respect in the area I represent. (Time expired) Drugs: Bali Bernadette, and me to a Queensland couple, Lee and Christine Rush. My friend is Colin McDonald. He is the lawyer representing their son, Scott, who is currently in the death tower at Kerobokan Prison in Bali. Tomorrow morning Colin will be talking to Scott, trying to reassure him that he has not been forgotten. Spending time with the Rushes, I have to say, was a profound experience. On the one hand they are just a normal couple raising a family, with all the struggles of normal life. They are deeply religious and have a tremendous love for their children. On the other hand, you could see the strains of emotion in having a son condemned to death in a foreign country under circumstances and within a legal system that are difficult for ordinary Australians to understand. MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Grievance Debate
309,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (8.40 Pm),"Two weeks ago, a friend of mine introduced my wife,It was clear that their love for their son is very deep. As parents they cared about his future. As parents they tried to do something about preventing drugs and crime from becoming his future. You see, Scott is no angel. His mum and dad never claimed he was. Like other loving parents they were prepared to get actively involved, to do something to intervene in his life, in order to help him with his future. It was with that intention in mind that they approached the police, advising them of what they knew about Scott, his friends, his connections and the fact that they strongly suspected he was about to participate in a drug importation exercise from Indonesia. They could even advise the police of the approximate dates that Scott was arriving in and departing from Bali. As Lee and Christine told me, they thought the police could intervene to prevent the crime which they knew their son was becoming involved with. As I understand it, the Australian law enforcement agency decided to monitor the alleged drug operation. Consistent with international procedures, the AFP notified their counterparts, the Indonesian National Police. As a result, Scott was arrested in Denpasar on 17 April 2005, under a breach of article 82 of the Indonesian narcotics law-a serious offence and one which potentially carries the death penalty. Agency-to-agency cooperation in law enforcement is essential to combat the internationalisation of wide-ranging aspects of criminal activity, particularly in relation to drug related crime. Having represented the police in every Australian jurisdiction, and through my involvement with the Australian Crime Commission, I know that interagency sharing of criminal intelligence is essential in order to complement community policing strategies. However, under Australian law, Australian law enforcement agencies, unless specifically authorised, are not to lend assistance in relation to prosecutions that, after the point of charge, if proven, could carry the death penalty. In relation to the Bali Nine, at the time of the communication with the Indonesian police, there were no charges. Under Indonesian law, unlike our legal provisions, a person is not required to be charged until formally indicted at trial. A person can be arrested under narcotic laws, as in this case, and formally charged after all the evidence has been assembled. As this investigation was an Australian police operation, the AFP continued to cooperate with the Indonesian authorities well beyond the period that Scott and the other members of the Bali Nine were detained in Denpasar. With respect to Indonesian criminal law, which has quite different origins from our common-law structure, separate panels of the same court can arrive at vastly different sentences for persons tried under similar circumstances and convicted of the same offence. For six of the Bali Nine, their appeals to the Supreme Court resulted in their sentences going before two such panels. Three of the so-called drug mules, including Scott, appealed their life sentences and had their sentences increased to death, without any reference to the mules sentenced by the second panel. The second panel handed down life sentences. In fact, the judgement in the appeal proceedings did not refer at all to the sentences of the other three drug mules arrested in identical circumstances to Scott. Martin Stephens and Michael Czugaj both received 20year sentences in proceedings of the High Court. Their sentences were increased to life, on appeal to the Supreme Court. Like Scott, they were mules. As I understand it, the Indonesian criminal law system is vastly different to ours. However, one would ordinarily expect the application of consistent and comparative sentencing decisions from any court, particularly one that has the capacity to apply capital punishment. Further, it is concerning from an Australian perspective that the increase in sentences occurred MAIN COMMITTEE without any request from the Indonesian prosecutors. I have met both Lee and Christine Rush and sympathised with their position as loving parents, only to find their boy on death row, particularly when they took the very serious step of notifying the police in the first place. Bernadette and I came away from that discussion thinking, ‘What could we possibly do to assist this family and, for that matter, other Australian families who find themselves in a similar predicament?’ Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, think back to Friday, 2 February 2005, which is a date I know you are very familiar with: the day that Nguyen Tuong Van was executed in Changi Prison. As that date neared, I recall the speeches, the pleas for mercy, the prayers that were offered and, in fact, the intervention of the Pope-not to mention all the diplomatic effort. We are either prepared to make the same desperate pleas for compassion on each and every occasion or, alternatively, as an Australian community we can actually take certain steps to communicate to the world our position of being firmly opposed to capital punishment. To quote the South African judge Ismail Mahomed, who is now Chief Judge of the South African Constitutional Court: The death penalty sanctions the deliberate annihilation of life. As I have previously said, it is the ultimate and the most incomparably extreme form of punishment ... It is the last, the most devastating and the most irreversible recourse of the criminal law, involving as it necessarily does, the planned and calculated termination of life itself; the destruction of the greatest and most precious gift which is bestowed on all humankind. … … … It is not necessarily only the dignity of the person to be executed which is invaded. Very arguably the dignity of all of us, in a caring civilization, must be compromised ... In order to avoid as much as possible the exposure of Australian citizens to the death penalty, Australia should act consistently and in a determined way to, in my opinion, legislate to give effect to the second operational protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This would have the effect of preventing any Australian jurisdiction from making laws permitting the use of capital punishment, but, more importantly, it would communicate our position very clearly and unequivocally to the world at large. Given the circumstances in which the Bali Nine came to the attention of the Australian police-namely, on the advice of Scott’s father-and the fact that this was an Australian police investigation, I would also assert that the minister should consider giving directions to the AFP that members should not intentionally or predictably expose Australian citizens to the death penalty in AFP operations. Further, all members of this parliament should very clearly and consistently speak out against the use of capital punishment; otherwise, we would be liable to be held up on charges of hypocrisy every time it came to defending Australian subjects with respect to death sentences overseas. Tomorrow morning, Colin McDonald, my friend from Darwin, will be visiting Kerobokan Prison again. He will be talking to Scott Rush, the Australian kid in the death tower who does not know from one day to the next when his final hours will be. Whilst his Australian and Indonesian lawyers will do everything humanly possible to have these sentences commuted and all those of a religious persuasion continue with their prayers, I believe that as a nation with some standing in this region we could adopt the three modest measures I have just outlined to show all those we have international relations with our principled and fundamental objection MAIN COMMITTEE to the application of the death penalty. To Lee and Christine Rush, to Scott and to other Australians in the same predicament, we as a nation can show that we care. (Time expired) Maranoa Electorate: Roads former speaker, because the Rush family are from Mitchell, in my electorate, in Queensland. I know many of the family. In fact, I grew up with the parents. I have not had direct contact with them for many, many years, but I certainly feel for them and I would like to be associated with the member for Werriwa’s comments. I grieve tonight, in this grievance debate, about an issue to do with the Warrego Highway, in my electorate. Prior to the last federal election, the coalition committed some $128 million to the upgrade of the Warrego Highway from about Dalby right through to Mitchell, west of my home town of Roma. I know the current government committed some $55 million for the same section of road. The money that the coalition committed was to be spent from 1 July this year, and we would love to know when the government intends to start to roll out its commitment of $55 million. It is a particular area of the road that I am very concerned about. There is an area east of Chinchilla, between Chinchilla and Dalby, where there have been some tragic deaths on the road-on a highway that is in desperate need of upgrading. The tragic accidents could have been avoided had there been some money spent on that road. So it is an urgent need and it will save lives if we can only get some of this money committed sooner rather than later. But I want to return to the road between Roma and Mitchell. Last Friday night, a truck operator in my home town of Roma went out to Mitchell. He has a reasonable fleet of trucks in general haulage and also livestock transport. He got to Mitchell at 11 o’clock on Friday night-hardly the start of a working week. He drove into town and found road trains with cattle on board and he found empty trailers there. West of the town he found that there were some 64 trailers on what they call the ‘pad’, where they decouple these trucks to go the last 90 kilometres into Roma. The situation is this: these road trains are allowed to progress as far east as Mitchell-with three trailers, whether they are configured with general freight from NQX coming back from Darwin or livestock. The situation is now desperate. We have to get this money to flow as quickly as possible. CanI just outline the situation? Many people in an urban situation might find this hard to comprehend. Just west of Mitchell is where the truck operators normally come to. They decouple the last trailer, the third trailer, and they take the two trailers 90 kilometres into Roma. Someone has to come back in a prime mover and pick up the third trailer and take it 90 kilometres into Roma. Why Roma in this case? Roma is the largest cattle-selling centre in Australia and that is where these cattle-thousands upon thousands of them-are destined for market each week. This truck operator got to the pad, where there were 64 trailers. Just to outline the significance of the number of trailers: it might have been 64 at this point but 10 kilometres west of that point there were another five triples-that is 15 trailers-plus another three empty ones. Why couldn’t they come further east? Because they could not get off the road further east to decouple. Obviously, the safety of motorists and other operators at night is of paramount imMAIN COMMITTEE",219,Grievance Debate
310,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (8.50 Pm),"I associate myself with the comments of theportance to these truck operators. Further west, there were another five of them beside the road waiting to move further east. But, worse than that, 90 kilometres west of Mitchell is the town of Morven. In Morven there were five triples full of cattle-that is, five prime movers with three trailers each behind them-and there were three empty ones. They were waiting to get an opportunity to travel to Mitchell so that they could decouple their last trailer, go on into Roma and then get someone to come and pick up the third trailer. They could not move from Morven, the last 90 kilometres, because there was no room on the place where they have normally decoupled these trailers for a number of years. I will paint a picture about where these livestock come from. Most come out of paddocks five to seven days earlier. At the moment, a lot of these cattle come from the Barkly Tablelands in the Northern Territory. They would have probably been on the road for about four days. They would have travelled for the first day and a half to Mount Isa or maybe to Cloncurry, where they are unloaded. They would have a spell for a couple of days and then be put on a truck for another 12 to 14 hours to get to Mitchell. They then have 90 kilometres to go to get to their destination. The point I am raising is that here we had about 128 trailers sitting from Mitchell to Morven waiting to do the last 90 kilometres. They could not get onto the pad and they could not move east. If they did move, only the truck drivers could look after the other freight trailers that might have been there. Of course, that is not to mention that, with regulations coming in shortly, truck drivers are only going to be able to do a 14-hour shift. After that they have to have a 10-hour rest. Trucks that are caught at Morven do not have an extra driver and have to wait 10 hours before they can move the next 90 kilometres. These cattle might have been in transit for five, six or seven days, coming from up near Darwin, the Barkly Tablelands or up in the gulf. That is the situation that the beef industry is confronting-as well as the truck operators. To enable these trucks to come further east into Roma, we have to make sure that this road is upgraded so that the type 2 road trains-that is, a prime mover with three trailers-can travel the last 90 kilometres and be safe and not be a hazard to other traffic on the highway. In the interim, until this road is upgraded, we also have to look at whether these trucks could travel east under a permit now. Roma is the largest cattle-selling centre in Australia with 8,000 to 9,000 head of cattle a week sold there. At least half of them travel for five to seven days by road train, and they then confront this situation-90 kilometres from the destination where they could be unloaded and fed for three or four days before the sale. It is a major economic issue for the beef industry. Given that the beef industry is Queensland’s second-largest export earner by value, the minister for transport and the minister responsible for that road funding should immediately start to roll out this funding, rather than wait another 12 months, 18 months or two years to start to roll the money out. I will just repeat that we are talking about something like 128 trailers. Queensland Rail operate under NQX. They are a freight company that travels from Brisbane to Darwin. They were waiting for four hours to find a spot on the pad so that they could hook their third trailer on and head west to Darwin. That is the situation. You might say that it is as bad as some of our coal ports, where ships wait for days-in fact, in some cases, for months-to get into port to load. Livestock, freight forwarders and freight operators are confronted with a situation MAIN COMMITTEE where they are so near to their destination, yet they are not even able to get on the pad to decouple the last trailer to take the two trailers on into Roma. In some cases, they have to wait 90 kilometres west of where the pad is before they can bring their rigs into Mitchell to do that decoupling. The other aspect of this is that, even when there are not as many in this situation as we saw last Friday night in that pad, these trailers can be left while the trucks go on into Roma. There is no security there and quite often tarpaulins get lost-stolen. Tyres, which are obviously of enormous value on trailers of that capacity, can be stolen. No-one is there necessarily to look after the livestock. Sometimes they have to try and bring someone out-this is about 10 kilometres west of the small town of Mitchell-to at least keep an eye on the livestock. It is a huge issue for the beef industry, as well as the general freight operators, to be confronted with. It is just not acceptable. We as a coalition committed some $128 million to start upgrading this road as of 1 July this year. I am calling on this minister: if he really believes in the welfare of animals, the productivity of the trucking and freight industry and the value of exports from our beef industry, he will start to roll that money out as of 1 July this year. Death Penalty Australian Constitution before I do, I want to add my voice to that of the member for Werriwa in relation to capital punishment. I have a very sharp memory of attending a vigil in Melbourne with hundreds of others at the time of the hanging of Van Tuong Nguyen, an Australian in Singapore’s Changi Prison, on 2 December 2005. He was hanged despite calls from the former Prime Minister, from my party-then in opposition-from this parliament, from every state parliament and from tens of thousands of Australians. The very first thing we need to do is to pursue through diplomatic efforts the banishing of the mandatory death penalty. It is the first step in getting rid of the death penalty everywhere. Courts everywhere must have the discretion to impose appropriate penalties, which means that judges must have the choice of leniency. Labor has traditionally had a very long standing commitment to changing the Constitution. By that I mean not simply reforming the administration of the Commonwealth but actually changing the words of the Constitution by formal amendment. There are very many reforms to government which can only occur by actually changing the words of the Constitution. These include large reforms like the republic, or more procedural reforms like a move to fixed four-year terms, or structural reforms to federal-state relations. All of these would require formal amendment of the Constitution. Constitutional change has been a persistent theme in public debate and calls for change were a feature of the recent 2020 Summit held on 19 and 20 April this year. The Prime Minister has just released the report of the proceedings of the 2020 Summit, and the reports from several of the streams-not just the governance stream-show that many ideas for constitutional change were raised at the summit. In the governance stream there was a very clear call for Australia to become a republic, which is of course a major constitutional change and was the subject of the last unsuccessful attempt at constitutional change. Other top ideas from the governance stream included the amendment of the Constitution to include a preamble; a call to formally recognise the traditional custodians of our land and waters, our Indigenous people; MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Grievance Debate
311,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (9.00 Pm),"I want to speak tonight on constitutional change, but,and a call for the Constitution to be amended to remove any language that is racially discriminatory. The report of the 2020 Summit records other constitutional ideas discussed in the governance stream, including calls for an entirely new Constitution, a call for rewriting the Constitution to make it intelligible and accessible and an aspiration to increase public involvement generally in constitutional and governance processes. As I have mentioned, the Constitution was raised in other streams of the summit, particularly in the context of federal-state relations, with many suggestions that the Constitution simply does not reflect the current state of federal-state relations in this country. These are not new ideas. They have been raised repeatedly for decades. They have been raised not only in academic circles; they have been raised at constitutional conventions. They have been raised repeatedly in this House. They have been raised in reports of committees of this House and of the Senate, and all political parties have called in recent decades-I do not say just in recent years-for some quite substantial changes to the Constitution. There is a recognition that a document which was drafted in the 1890s and adopted at the start of the last century is very unlikely to be appropriate in all respects to Australian society in the 21st century. That recognition is not new either. I quote from something Sir Paul Hasluck, the former member for Curtin, said when speaking as Governor General in 1973, opening the Australian Constitutional Convention then. He said that that convention was called to consider ‘whether the Constitution which was framed in the 1890s is wholly acceptable to us over 70 years later in a changed Australia in a vastly different world’. I would be lot more direct: the Constitution is undoubtedly in need of reform. It is also not new to say that there is dissatisfaction about the division of federal and state functions. Sir Rupert Hamer, former Liberal Premier of Victoria, had this to say at the 1973 Constitutional Convention: People in a federation should know clearly which government is responsible for which function and who is to answer to them for the manner of its administration. It is equally fundamental that each government should have the full means and ability to carry out each of the functions for which it is so answerable. That is not the condition of government in Australia today. The ideas about the language of the Constitution raised at the recent 2020 Summit are not new either. The writer Donald Horne, in typically pithy fashion, said this in 1977: In all the liberal-democratic countries, there isn’t a less democratically expressed constitution than Australia’s. All of those problems that were identified in the seventies continued to be identified in the eighties and through the nineties and remain with us 30 years later. Those who drafted the Constitution envisaged that it would change. They did not see the document which they participated in writing as being written in tablets of stone and they provided in section 128 a means of amendment, which of course is passage of a bill through this parliament, followed by approval in a referendum by a majority of the people in a majority of the states and an overall nationwide majority. There has of course been a dismal record of achieving constitutional change. The figures are well known: there have been 44 attempts, of which only eight, or 18 per cent, have been passed by the people. It is what led Geoffrey MAIN COMMITTEE Sawyer, the noted constitutional lawyer, to describe Australia back in 1967 as ‘constitutionally speaking, the frozen continent’. The rate of change has slowed even more in recent decades. The last successful referendum was in 1977, and the period since, 1977 to 2008, is the longest period in Australia’s history without constitutional change. We have not had even an unsuccessful attempt since 1999 and, quite possibly, unless there is a very quick move-that is, a referendum held next year-this will be the first decade since Federation without even one referendum proposal. What is to be done to break through this seeming national writer’s block in terms of our Constitution? Certainly, I would urge Australians interested in government to keep talking about change, and all political parties need to keep working for changes which will attract consensus and bipartisan support. As part of that work, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs held a roundtable discussion on 1 May this year involving 14 Australians with constitutional and legal expertise. The committee hopes to report to the House later this year on the very useful discussion at the roundtable. It included changing the way we change the Constitution-in other words, amending section 128 itself-but, given the dismal recent history of amendment of the Constitution, this may not be the catalyst for change which is now needed. There was also useful discussion about the machinery of referenda. The yes/no booklets which we use now are a format which was prescribed in 1912 and quite probably simply do not work any longer as a means of informing the public. Certainly, we need to look at different means of informing the public about constitutional change-means which recognise the different ways in which people now participate in political debate. There was general agreement at the roundtable that referendum proposals are much more likely to succeed with bipartisan support and to get to that point there needs to be very widespread public support. In particular, some of the participants at the roundtable commented on the long lead time which led to the success of the 1967 referendum recognising Aboriginal people. In order to achieve the change to the Constitution which is recognised as needed, we will need to take care with the process which is followed and indeed the proposal which is first put forward to try to break the deadlock which seems to have arisen. I would suggest that the proposal for fixed four-year terms may be such a proposal. It is an idea whose time has come. All Australian states and territories except Queensland have now moved to four-year terms. Siblings Australia to grieve for an issue which is becoming something of a trend under the new Labor government: the seemingly irrational defunding or non-funding of excellent associations that had been doing terrific work over the last few years-and in some cases 10, 11 or 12 years. The new Labor government have decided that these associations do not fit into their world view or that they do not provide the kinds of services that the Labor Party want to provide to the Australian people. I am quite sure that in the months or years ahead new Labor ministers will ask their bureaucrats: ‘What on earth happened to this particular organisation or association? It was doing good work.’ The answer will be: ‘When the government changed, Minister, we defunded that organisation and started a new organisation or funded a different group or started our own MAIN COMMITTEE",224,Grievance Debate
312,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (9.10 Pm),"It is a great pleasure to rise in the Main Committee tonightgovernment program.’ The minister will say, ‘Why did we do that when such-and-such an organisation was making a great contribution?’ I hope that it is not because any of these organisations were promoted or supported or lobbied on behalf of by Liberal members of parliament. But I guess that is something that the ministers who are currently in control of the government will have to ask themselves in the months and years ahead. One such organisation that has been doing a great job over the last few years is Siblings Australia. Siblings Australia is an organisation that takes care of the families of people who have a disability. Siblings of people with special needs, including people with a disability, a chronic illness or mental health issues, are likely to be in the life of the person with special needs for longer than any parent or other carer. Siblings Australia is the only organisation in Australia that specifically addresses the unique needs and concerns of brothers and sisters of people with special needs. In an act totally devoid of compassion for the plight of these siblings, no federal funding has been allocated to Siblings Australia since the election. This lack of funding means that Siblings Australia will close and will only be able to provide limited advice through their website. There are over 200,000 young people with a severe disability or chronic illness and there are even more who have a mental illness. Most of these young people will have at least one sibling. While significant resources are spent caring for young people with special needs, illness, disability and mental health issues, they affect the lives of all family members. To cut the funding to and effectively wind up the only organisation that provides support for these siblings is both cruel and short-sighted. Siblings Australia’s mission statement says it all: Siblings can often be overlooked, which can lead to feelings of isolation. If this continues, children can become vulnerable to a range of emotional and mental health problems. However, if siblings are acknowledged, and connected to sources of support, they are likely to become more resilientand able to provide invaluable support to their brother or sister. Not only do siblings feel that they are being overlooked; they struggle with the guilt of these feelings. To feel that you always have to be the good child is an immense burden on a sibling, but the guilt of having this kind of feeling towards a brother or a sister who you love and care for is equally as crushing. One such sibling who has benefited from the workshops run by Siblings Australia is a young girl who no-one would play with at school because the other kids said that she had ‘disability germs’ from her sister, who had a disability. Just imagine what kind of impact that would have had on a small child. Siblings Australia has for nine years provided numerous products and services, not to mention support, to brothers and sisters of young people with special needs and has helped parents and professionals improve their understanding of the concerns and needs of siblings and to network with other providers who are delivering or planning to deliver sibling support programs. The government is fooling itself if it thinks that cutting funding to Siblings Australia will cut down on government expenditure. According to Dr Jon Jureidini, who is a child psychiatrist and Head of the Department of Psychological Medicine at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide: Preventing just a handful of episodes of depression or anxiety disorders in siblings of people with special needs more than covers the cost of running Siblings Australia. Without the support of Siblings Australia, siblings are at risk of developing long-term physical, emotional and psychological problems. MAIN COMMITTEE Siblings Australia received a 12-month grant from the Department of Health and Ageing in alignment with the national plan on mental health for 2006-11. The DoHA funding, amongst other things, allowed Siblings Australia to identify areas in which programs still need to be developed and to start to research the best ways to present the research that they have undertaken. Siblings Australia applied for new funding during the caretaker mode of the previous government. Once the new government was installed, Siblings Australia was informed that no more funding would be available from DoHA and that it should try to get funding from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs or from the Mental Health Council of Australia. It makes no sense. I happened to be the minister responsible for mental health when the National Mental Health Plan was initiated. I know the person who wrote the letter to Kate Strohm, Colleen Krestensen. She is now the Assistant Secretary, Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Programs Branch, in the department. She is an excellent bureaucrat and an excellent public servant, and she gave me terrific service. In her letter to one of the parents who had used Siblings Australia for their own children, she said that the grant that I referred to: ... had come at a very good time for the mental health needs of siblings of children with special needs to be recognised and highlighted, and the department was satisfied that the work over 2007 had ensured that existing key child and adolescent mental health programs managed by the department were now better able to understand and address the special mental health needs of siblings of children with disabilities or chronic illnesses. So the program was not defunded because of a failure to achieve success. It is a mystery to me why the program was defunded at all. Ms Kate Strohm, who is the Executive Director and founder of Siblings Australia, has had meetings with the Minister for Youth; the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; and the director of the children and youth mental health programs section and has written to the Prime Minister. Yet no funding has been forthcoming and all the minister and parliamentary secretary can tell Ms Strohm is that FaHCSIA are looking into it. Those people who have written to the Minister for Health and Ageing raising their concerns about the winding up of Siblings Australia, including the clients of Siblings Australia, have been advised that the work undertaken by Siblings Australia in 2007 has ensured that the programs managed by DoHA are now better off and that basically the department has no further use for Siblings Australia. But the need is still there. The need to support the siblings of people with disabilities and chronic illnesses, including mental illness, has not disappeared because of one year’s funding of Siblings Australia. To further highlight the lack of understanding shown by the current government, those expressing concern about the lack of services for siblings have been informed that the government has excellent Commonwealth respite and Carelink centres. These centres are a fabulous service for older and disabled Australians and their carers, but they are not much use for a child who is excluded in the playground because she has so-called disabled germs from her sister. The cost of providing funding for Siblings Australia is a minuscule amount in the health budget-or the FaHCSIA budget for that matter. Yet this government has shown that it will throw compassion and proper service delivery out the window just so it can save a few dollars on budget night. MAIN COMMITTEE Siblings Australia is not some minor special interest group. Siblings Australia is the only organisation providing the necessary resources to help siblings of people with disabilities, chronic illness and mental health issues. I call on the government to recognise the invaluable work of this organisation and to continue funding it into the foreseeable future. Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, you have a long standing history in this place, unlike the other three Labor members present, who are new members-which is of course no fault of their own. You are in the government and I hope that, having heard what I have said about Siblings Australia, you take some interest and try to address this. We are talking about $150,000 that kept Siblings Australia alive to do the good work that it is doing. I would hope that the Labor Party would be able to reach within its heart and come up with support for an organisation that is helping people who are the brothers and sisters of people with mental illness, chronic disability and chronic illness. I seek leave to table the various articles that have appeared in the Bulletin, the Australian, the Advertiser and the Sydney Morning Herald about the good work that Siblings Australia has done. Leave granted. Fuel Prices debate over the past parliamentary fortnight, but this is not a new debate. Indeed, it is something that reaches back to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Combined with the rising cost of housing, the price pressures emerging from fuel are eroding the financial security of families, pensioners and businesses in my electorate. Government has a responsibility to look beyond the short term. It is our obligation as elected representatives to confront the difficult challenges of the future. We must transcend the shopper docket debate witnessed by this House since the announcement of the opposition’s so-called plan to cut 5c a litre off the excise on fuel. This is not a solution but a desperate con being peddled by the snake oil salesmen who now comprise the opposition’s leadership team. The time has come for us to have a serious discussion about how our nation makes the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our dependence on fossil fuels like petrol carries with it a cost that will inevitably continue to trend upwards. To ignore the magnitude of the energy challenge that confronts the world economy by adopting such flawed proposals is to deny ourselves the most precious commodity in this debate: time-the time to map out alternative policies and change our behaviours to better align with the inevitability of rising carbon fuel costs. Past planning policies have ordained that new housing developments be approved in the outer suburbs of our major cities without the timely provision of the infrastructure or jobs that these new communities require. People have settled on the outskirts of major cities in places like Western Sydney in search of space, safety and the security of an affordable home. The further from the centre of our major cities we travel, the greater is our reliance on private motor vehicle transport. The greatest threat to the economic security of the residents of Western Sydney is the continued failure of governments to invest in regular, reliable and affordable public transport. Recent studies have shown that residents of Western Sydney commuting to and from work each day-not only to the Sydney CBD but also to other parts of the region-are driving beMAIN COMMITTEE",226,Grievance Debate

314,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (9.20 Pm),"The rising price of petrol has been at the centre oftween 21,000 and 42,000 kilometres each year, up to six times more than residents of the eastern suburbs. With petrol prices fast approaching averages of $1.60 a litre, it is now costing upwards of $100 to fill the fuel tank of a family sedan. Casting back to 1998, crude oil was fetching just over US$10 a barrel. Now, in 2008, that same crude oil is more than 10 times the price, at more than US$130 a barrel. With inflation that has been left to run unchecked, and the accompanying rises in interest rates, the impact on the average household of the rise and rise of world oil prices is enormous. The median gross wage in my electorate is $57,000 a year. In 2002, with interest rates at 6.75 per cent and petrol at 82c a litre, residents of my electorate were spending, on average, about $2,100 a month on their housing and car expenses. In 2008, with interest rates at 9.47 per cent and petrol at close to $1.60 a litre, those same residents are now spending almost $3,000 a month. This represents a cost increase of more than $10,000 a year. Car dependency is a greater problem for people living in my electorate than for those closer to the centre of Sydney. By way of illustration, I remember starting university in the city and being stunned by the revelation that a number of my 18-year-old colleagues who lived in the eastern suburbs did not have licences, nor did they have any need to obtain them. This proposition is virtually anathema to those of us who have grown up in Western Sydney. We in Western Sydney are well known for our car culture. Much is made of this car culture by those from outside the area. The reality is that as a community we are heavily dependent upon the car because it is one of the most basic and indispensable tools in negotiating our daily lives in a region almost completely bereft of genuine public transport options. It is the responsibility of our national government to be honest about the impacts of rising fuel prices on the economy and on motorists and to be honest about the extent to which we can influence those prices. We will not give irresponsible guarantees that petrol prices will go down, when all the indicators point to a continued rise in the global price of oil. We face demand from China and India, and that is not abating, and a US economy that even in stagnation consumes a quarter of the world’s oil. We are coming out of a period where the previous administration was intent on perpetrating the comforting delusion that petrol price hikes were anomalous and would some day normalise. For 12 years, the previous government could not bring itself to have the bracing conversation it needed to have with the people of Australia. It studiously avoided any frank reference to the fact that world oil prices will continue to climb upwards and that our reliance on petroleum is unsustainable. It wasted the opportunity to invest in renewable energies and alternative fuels. We now look back at the Howard government’s time in office and see a lost decade. Our carbon economies must make way for the future of renewable energy. When we talk about securing our energy, we must talk about how to wean ourselves off our petrol dependence. When we talk about easing the fuel price pressures on families, we must talk about how we can improve access to public transport networks. What governments can do at the margins of petrol pricing policy is make sure that we increase competition in the market and empower consumers. This includes our proposal and actions in appointing a Petrol Commissioner and the introduction of a national Fuelwatch scheme. But we cannot stay focused on the margins. We need a sensible long-term approach to reducing our dependence on petrol, at the centre of which must be public investment in improving our mass-people movement networks. In Western Sydney, we have public transport lines MAIN COMMITTEE that feed into the Sydney CBD but very few quality services that meet the demand for interregional commuting between its major centres. While 60 per cent of local residents in my community travel outside the Penrith city each day for work, approximately 80 per cent of those leaving the area still work in Western Sydney. Western Sydney needs better interregional public transport options. Public transport in Western Sydney needs to be more affordable, particularly bus services. In my community, for example, the weekly cost of the bus trip from Glenmore Park to Penrith station, a journey of seven kilometres, costs $30 a week, whereas the cost of a train ticket from Penrith to Sydney, a journey of 55 kilometres, costs under $50 a week. Our commuter car parks are overflowing because the private bus services do not provide cheap, reliable services to get people from their homes to major transport nodes. As the employment zone booms along the M7 corridor, including the new employment hub at Erskine Park, there is even greater demand for transport networks to deliver people to jobs within the region. It is time for the Commonwealth government to play a leadership role in delivering genuine public transport options for the residents of Western Sydney. To the great detriment of the people of Western Sydney, this is one area where the previous government dared not go. We need publicly subsidised, regionally focused and regionally managed people movement systems, similar to the government bus systems that operate in Sydney. If we are to create incentives for people to leave their cars at home, we need to take bold steps to get them to and from work on services that are reliable, regular and low cost. I am encouraged by the work of the government in establishing a Major Cities Unit to do what the previous government chose not to do for 11½ years. I also look forward to seeing how Infrastructure Australia will be directing the investments emerging from the Building Australia Fund into transport networks. Only government led investment can drive a mode shift in the culture of petrol reliance by providing targeted incentives predominantly to outer suburban regions, like Western Sydney, to move towards greater use of public transport. For too long we have had governments obsessed with short-term fixes and unwilling to be honest about the future energy challenges we face. It is time for us to move past the shopper docket debate and invest our energies in a genuine exchange of ideas about how we secure Australia’s energy and transport future. The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 192B. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

315,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"The time allotted for this debate has expired.Tertiary Entrance Rank (Question No. 37) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Education, in writing, on 12 March 2008: In respect of the Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) for selecting students for university degrees: (a) is she aware of a report of a Queensland student receiving a higher TER for a university in Queensland than for a university in New South Wales; (b) for the 2007 calendar year, how many external students in Queensland have been given a TER that is not recognised by universities in other States and Territories; (c) what action is the Government taking to ensure that each TER is equally recognised between all States and Territories; and (d) will the Government guarantee that the TER of each high school student graduating in Queensland in 2008 will be equally recognised between all States and Territories; if not, why not. Ms Gillard-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) No. If the Honourable Member will supply me with the details of the case I will ask the universities concerned to look into it and provide a response to him. (b) The Department does not collect this data. (c) and (d) Universities are responsible for determining the entrance scores and admission criteria for their courses. The Australian Conference of Tertiary Admission Centres has established guidelines for the conversion of different TER scales to facilitate interstate transfer of students and individual admissions centres use these as a guide. 2007 Interstate Conversion Table Position ACT* and NSW*: UAI VIC*: QLD* WA*: TER Position 99.95 1 99.50 1 99.00 1 98.50 2 98.00 2 97.50 2 97.00 3 96.50 3 96.00 3 95.50 4 95.00 4 94.00 4 93.00 5 92.00 5 91.00 6 90.00 6 89.00 7 88.00 7 87.00 8 ACT* and NSW*: UAI VIC*: QLD* WA*: TER Position 86.00 8 85.00 8 84.00 9 83.00 9 82.00 10 81.00 10 80.00 10 75.00 12 70.00 14 65.00 16 60.00 18 55.00 19 50.00 21 45.00 23 40.00 24 35.00 25 30.00 25 Source: Universities Admissions Centre National Rental Affordability Scheme (Question No. 85) Mr Haase asked the Minister for Housing and the Minister for the Status of Women, in writing, on 13 May 2008: In respect of her letter dated 28 February 2008 to the Manager of the Bloodwood Tree Association Inc. in South Hedland WA: (a) what percentage of the 50,000 new rental properties for low and middle income earners at 20 per cent below market rates will be allocated to the Pilbara region; and (b) what percentage of the $150 million to build 600 new houses and units for homeless people will be allocated to the Pilbara region. Ms Plibersek-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) The National Rental Affordability Scheme will create 50,000 affordable rental dwellings across Australia between July 2008 and June 2012. It will not be possible to advise the percentage of these dwelling which will be in the Pilbara region until incentives under the Scheme have been allocated through a competitive process. (b) The percentage allocation to the Pilbara region will be a matter for the Western Australian Government. Western Australia is expected to submit a proposal for approval about how they will match the Commonwealth’s funding of $17.080 million for 68 houses over five years.",231,Grievance Debate
