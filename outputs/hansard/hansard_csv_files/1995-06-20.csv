Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995, I foreshadowed that the approach that the opposition intended to take was to identify the three areas of possible contention and to flag our desire to have a review of matters in relation to those three areas, preferably in the Senate by the Senate committee on community affairs. I identified those areas as the amendments that clarify the qualification requirements for the disability support pension and disability wage supplement, the provision that native title rights and interests are not to be taken into account when applying the assets test in the act, and the amendment in relation to split compensation payments and the application of provisions to claimants and assessment of periodic and lump sum compensation provisions. We will not be seeking to divide on these issues in committee. It may well be, after the examination of one or other of these proposed amendments, that we will not oppose them. I will not foreshadow that we can be convinced in relation to all of the matters that have been raised, but it may well be that we are open to persuasion in relation to one of them or perhaps two. The third matter that I wanted to advert to in particular is related to the question of split settlements. In 1993 the government sought unsuccessfully to make amendments to the compensation provisions in the act. It was the subject of a good deal of discussion which involved myself and the Minister for Social Security as we sought to work around what we see as a difficulty for the government in relation to the way in which compensation matters are dealt with. I also flagged very clearly a view I have, which my colleagues share, that, where people receive compensation payments which are clearly related to non-income earning aspects of damage they may have suffered, there ought not to be a preclusion period which takes into account compensation received for what might have been pain and suffering, out-ofpocket expenses or other expenses of a like character. We do not deny that there have been some situations in which the lump sum preclusion period can operate, particularly in settlements where the matters are largely in people's own hands and are not the subject of independent review, where people have sought to put the compensation arrangements in a form which will exclude the operation of the preclusion period. That is fairly obvious and that is why the government wants to address the issue. But it was inadequate to simply move to address this issue, as the government proposed before, by a 50 per cent rule which no longer required payments to have an economic component in order for the rule to apply and therefore half of any lump sum would be treated as an income related payment. The government has not come back with an amendment to achieve that purpose, which was the approach that was taken before. The government now proposes that, if a person receives",99,Adjournment To Force An Into A Satisfactory Clean Up Of The

188,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (12.45 P.m.),"Last night, in relation to the Social SecurityMC 1884 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 20 June 1995 more than one payment arising out of the same event and at least one of the payments is for lost earnings or a lost earnings capacity, the person will be taken to receive one lump sum, to which the 50 per cent rule will apply. The government claims that the amendment is necessary, due to the current trend in the management of compensation payments, as I have mentioned, when one settlement for a low amount is made in respect of a loss of earnings and earnings capacity and a larger amount is expressed in respect of non-economic loss, for pain and suffering. The larger amount is not covered by the compensation recovery positions, as it does not fall within the definition of compensation. The government has told us about a case before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in which the tribunal recommended that legislation be amended to close this loophole. Although this amendment is not the same as the amendment proposed in 1993, it does, in our view, similarly seek to undermine the integrity of the non-economic component of a compensation payment. The Welfare Rights Movement, the South Australian body that advises on social security issues, and the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia have criticised this amendment on the basis that it undermines legal settlements made between parties and undermines the purpose of pain and suffering settlement by treating money received for. non-economic losses the same as money to compensate for loss of earnings. That matter can be the subject of further deliberation, but it seems to me that in all of these questions there needs to be a way in which the genuine cases where people have been compensated only for pain and suffering, and where there is no element of economic loss or a minimal element of economic loss, can be dealt with. These circumstances can arise in relation to people involved in accidents who have next to no income, who may be unemployed, who may be totally reliant upon social security payments. The argument that there may be only limited numbers of people affected by a measure of this sort does not, in my judgment, justify it. SoI would encourage the advisers to the government, who seem to be keen to bring this matter back time and time again, to display a little lateral thinking, to find a mechanism that addresses the problem that has clearly been identified and about which we have indicated a certain resolution of view in ensuring that it is dealt with in a way which is demonstrably fair to all parties. We do not want to see the revenue ripped off by people who are fabricating circumstances which are not the case, but we do want to see a situation in which those who are entitled to compensation for pain and suffering have it treated as compensation for that purpose. As I mentioned, so far as the handling of this matter is concerned, we will obviously seek to have the first matters that I addressed-the issues relating to the disability support pension and the disability wage, the provisions to clarify the meaning of work and the 20 per cent impairment issue-referred to the Senate committee. We have flagged that we are open to persuasion from either side on those issues. Some very powerful arguments have been advanced, particularly by the welfare rights movement. They ought to be heard. The department has given me written advice-and I do not think it is before the parliament at this stage-as to how it believes these matters will be addressed. It may well be important that in its deliberations the Senate is aware that the department has a view about the way in which these matters will be addressed. I will just quote what I believe to be the relevant sections. The department had this to say: Tuesday, 20 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1885 Finally, it should be noted that the Social Security Act is 'beneficial' legislation. Where there is an ambiguity in .the Act and there is no contrary intention in the Second Reading speech or the explanatory memorandum, that ambiguity will generally be interpreted in favour of the client. Accordingly, cases not specifically excluded under the proposed amendments may be settled in favour of a client. As stated above, the amendment will not prevent lack of motivation being taken into account under these amendments. What is required, however, is that the lack of motivation is part of another illness that is assigned a rating under the Impairment Tables, for example, clinical depression. That issue is one through which I believe it may be possible by further elucidation to address some of the concerns that have been raised by the groups. I think it is important that this question be addressed. I think all of us understand that, particularly where people have suffered a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment, there can be an addition to that impairment of an attitudinal problem-lack of motivation-which needs to be taken into account. At times, the issue of distinguishing sufficiently, in clinical terms, a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment which is a necessary pre-condition may be a fairly daunting task. In the context of some of the clinical difficulties and the need to ensure that people who clearly have lack of motivation to seek employment might be able to continue to access a disability support pension, the arguments that have been advanced in relation to that are quite persuasive. With the assurances that have been given by the department perhaps spelt out sufficiently clearly so that those who do have to consider these issues will have some further information beyond that which is presently contained within the explanatory memorandum and that which is specifically authorised, the arguments can be addressed in the Senate. We can give some more cogent advice which may be sufficient to satisfy the parties which have taken an interest in this matter. I do not intend to detain the chamber further on this matter save to address one final issue of the amendments that the government intends to move in relation to this bill. I mentioned in the House last night that I had not been given copies of the amendments. In a fuller explanation, I want to advise that I was told when I received a briefing from the department that there may be further amendments of a technical nature and so there was at least that flagging. As with all of these things, I think it is very necessary that, if the opposition is to be able to give timely consideration to further amendments, we need to be given copies of them well before the debate in parliament commences. As I said last night, that did not occur. I have now had an opportunity to review those further amendments; I think they are of a technical nature and, when they are pressed by the government, we will not be opposing them. are many in number; some of them are quite complex and others are quite technical. The main provisions relate to: improved access for students to health cards; clarification of the rules relating to the disability support pension and wage supplement; improved arrangements for people transferring benefits between Austudy and the jobsearch or newstart allowances; and an incremental increase in the qualifying age for a seniors health card to 65 years in the year 2014. This of course is making the legislation consistent with the government's changes to age pension arrangements to increase eligibility to 65 years for women by the year 2014. The general objective of the bill is to recognise the significance of education and labour market training in skilling and res killing people presently in the -social security system and provide them with their best opportunity for re-entering the work force.

In that regard, I think it is useful in this debate to make reference to 'the minister's discussion paper entitled 'Beyond the safety net', which is an attempt to respond to the challenges and pressures now facing the welfare state, not just in Australia but throughout the Western world. The issue raised in this legislation of the linkage between education and labour market training, to try to provide a seamless social security system where people can move easily from labour market programs to benefits to education to employment, is very important. I think it is an outstanding advance that the minister is pursuing. In many ways, this legislation is underpinned by the philosophical and broader approach the minister is taking through that discussion document, 'Beyond the safety net: the future of social security'. Many people in the government eagerly await the reply by the opposition, and its shadow minister, to outline the way in which the opposition would respond to these changes in the welfare state. It is a very interesting debate and it bears relevance to this legislation. The welfare state is under pressure in advanced economies. The fiscal crisis faced by many governments has created tension between aspirations for universality of benefit provision and the need to target and the need to ration public resources to those most in need. It has also been underscored by a political struggle. Politicians, I think, on both sides of this chamber, both sides of politics, search for various mechanisms to establish forms of equality in our society. Those on the right focus their attention on the equality of legal rights whereas those on the left traditionally have focused on an equality of income, wealth and )llaterial outcomes. This debate needs to be revised and revisited in our reconsideration of where the welfare state should be headed. and those who are irrational. If there are those who want to be irrational and pursue irrational policies, that is their problem. However, this is not really a debate set within those frameworks; it is more about political philosophy and ideology. There are some very interesting things happening around the world that are not necessarily related to economic policy. In the United States, for instance, there is Newt Gingrich. I note that the member for Sturt( Mr Pyne) is the next speaker on the opposition side. He has a very strong interest in these matters. Gingrich has promoted an argument to say that social choice and social freedom are inconsistent with various forms of social organisation, and of course that is part of the philosophical approach to drive down the size and role of government. The shadow minister interjected and asked about my views on this. Basically, they correspond with the minister's views, as set out in his discussion paper 'Beyond the safety net.' What he is trying to do in that document is respond to changes in social circumstances and the way in which we need to reform the welfare state. For instance, unemployment benefits were established after World War II. They were seen as a form of entitlement to allow a short-term transfer between jobs: people would not be unemployed for long periods and the unemployment benefit would see them through from one form of employment to another.",103,Representatives Main Committee

195,Mr Latham,"It is not necessarily a debate between those who are economically rationalTuesday, 20 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1887 Of course, through economic restructuring, we now have the incidence of long-term unemployment in Australia that, in tum, has changed the basic assumption on unemployment benefits. Public housing estates after World War II emerged as an attempt to house the bluecollar work force close to manufacturing plants in outer suburbs. Now, through economic restructuring, they have become much closer to welfare housing types because blue-collar jobs are no longer as prevalent in the outer suburbs as they were in the 1950s and 1960s. It was assumed that all citizens would enjoy access and benefit from universal service provision in health, education and housing. The emergence of intergenerational unemployment in Australia has challenged that assumption because some communities, some social sectors, are not enjoying the social and economic skills that would be needed to take advantage of the universal services provided by government. Beyond that, the welfare state, partly reflected in this legislation, has had a focus on income support as a basic entitlement, rather than examining means by which capability, skill development, and reskilling of communities in a social and economic sense could proceed. The minister has argued in his discussion paper that we need to refocus our attention from measures of income support to a definition of poverty and disadvantage closely related to capability in our society-the capacity and the capability of citizens to pursue social and economic activities, and to enjoy them with a sense of equality and benefit. For instance, on page 36 of the discussion paper, the minister writes: Living standards are not just a function of the availability of cash and resources but of having the wherewithal to effectively utilise those resources. Those with the least resources often also have the least capacity to make the most of them. The minister draws on the work of the United States political economist Amartya Sen. He writes: Sen introduces the term 'capability' to refer to the ability to achieve a particular functioning. A person's capability set is the set of functionings that he or she can attain. In effect, the capability set defines the boundaries of what is possible for each person their freedom to achieve. The point of all this is that it provides an underpinning to an approach to poverty, equality and justice that is relevant to countries like ours where starvation and other manifestations of extreme material deprivation are rare. In such societies poverty should be seen essentially as capability failure or loss of substantive freedom, rather than simply the lack or resources. The minister further says: Sen's analysis also has a major bearing on the situation of the unemployed. He refers to a major survey of unemployed people in Belgium which showed that for them the worse thing about unemployment was the loss of freedom to achieve and to make choices to control their own lives rather than reduced income per se. This finding from Belgium is a perception that I have picked up in my own electorate when speaking to unemployed people, that their disadvantage in society is not so much a lack of income support, although they often argue the case for better income support; rather their attention is on the loss of capability, the loss of social skills derived from working and the loss of economic and training skills from continually upgrading their position in the work force. This is the middle way. This is the way in which legislation and government thinking, and I believe opposition thinking, should proceed to redefine our systems of social support from a focus on income to a focus on questions of capability. All of this, and it is reflected in the legislation, closely relates to the challenges we face continually in this country with economic MC 1888 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 20 June 1995 restructuring. The advent of information based work, the pace of capital movements around the world, the growth and integration of the international trading system, with the decline of tariff protection and the emergence of very complex economic systems have led to a higher level of skills being required in the post-industrial economy than would have been seen at any time since the Industrial Revolution. Rewards, and the value of skill, are now being defined very much by the contribution that a worker makes to the international production process. The old division we had in this country was primarily between blueand white-collar work and the assumption that blue-collar work was relatively low skilled, whereas white-collar work required a high level of skills in the labour force. Now, with the exposure of the economy to international trading circumstances, the proper division is between those workers who engage themselves in internationally competitive areas, as part of the international production process, as opposed to workers in non-traded sectors-be they in agriculture, mining, manufacturing or services. There are some instances I always relate to in and around my electorate where, when visiting manufacturing plants these days, one is more likely to see white lab coats on the factory floor than blue overalls. This is a nice reflection of the way in which skills are being rewarded in a different fashion from what was experienced in Australia throughout most of the postwar period. There has also been the growth in services employment, with household outsourcing for security, food, laundry, gardening, et cetera. All of this is a very important part of the economic restructuring process. The minister is aware of the agenda and I took it from the interruption from the shadow minister that he is also aware of these philosophical points. I noticed with interest, in listening through various question times in the House, the references both sides of parliament have made to the speech by the US Labor Secretary Robert Reich at the OECD in Paris recently. It is interesting to reflect on his remarks, not so much on the matters that were highlighted at question time but, rather, on some of the substance of his argument about economic restructuring and the role of the welfare state. He said to the OECD: The philosopher John Rawls had taught us that what we understand to be a fair organisation of society depends to a significant degree on the rules we would choose if we were unaware of our own unique odds of succeeding under them. But today, the Rawlsian veil of ignorance has been lifted. Those who are likely to win already know who they are; they already have, or can easily get, the education, the connections and other resources needed to take full advantage of rapidly changing technologies and global markets. The likely losers, too, know who they are. They lack all these things and, as a practical matter, even if the winners wished to do so-which is hardly the case-they could not simply redistribute a portion of their gains to the losers and make any progress in solving the core problem. The pattern is emerging even in the United States which has the thinnest of safety nets and arguably the most unregulated labor and capital markets of any modem economy. As the economic transformation has accelerated over the last 15 years, the gains of growth have gone almost entirely to the top fifth of earners. They tend to have university degrees and easy entry into the transnational corporations, investment banks, media enterprises, research laboratories and other institutions of the new economy. Reich notes further in his speech: In a democracy, citizens will vote for economic dynamism only when they feel that they have a fair chance of benefiting from it. We have now been joined by the member for Sturt( Mr Pyne) and I think this is a point that he tried to make recently, in some quite well-informed articles debating the ideological questions off the US agenda. They are not always well-received by other parts of his party, Tuesday, 20 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1889 but it is always interesting, on our side, to know that there is a debate. Some of the time you would have to ring the bell to try to get a debate going across the parliamentary floor. It is an interesting point that citizens will only support economic restructuring and an international trading environment if they feel they have a fair chance of benefiting from it. That is a common sense statement. But as a logical conclusion from that, they will only have a fair chance if governments have an active role in our society, if governments skill up the community for social and economic capability. This is the point made by the minister and by members such as the member for Sturt. It is in direct contrast to the New Right agenda advanced in the United States by Newt Gingrich and others, which forms an equation where social choice and social freedom are deemed to be incompatible with any form of social organisation, most of all, large and active government. In conclusion, I would recommend that, in responding to the minister's agenda and discussion paper and to the things he is trying to achieve out of this legislation, both sides of parliament acknowledge the need for five steps. The first is a shift from income support emphasis, picking up the work of Sen and moving towards a definition of poverty, equality and opportunity based more around capability. The second measure is to move away from a compartmentalised approach to government, and to use a whole-of-government approach so that we can case manage the needs of citizens in housing, family support, health, training, employment, and social security benefits, as the need may arise. The third step is to move from passive to active programs-to not rely solely on passive programs such as income support, but to take an active role, such as that the government is pioneering with the case management of the needs of the long-term unemployed. The fourth step is to move away from the approach which was very well expressed in a recent speech to a CEDA conference in Melbourne by Dr Meredith Edwards, a deputy secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. She said that the public sector has always fallen for the trap of a 'one size fits all' approach to benefits and opportunities, and has assumed that all social security benefits will fit the needs of all citizens. As the minister has pointed out-and it is reflected in the legislation-we need to customise government support to acknowledge that one size does not always fit all citizens. We need to pick up the particular needs of citizens. Case management is the administrative mechanism which government can use to meet that objective. The fifth step is to establish a sense of reciprocal responsibilities. The welfare state cannot be just a one-way street, where the government is providing the support but citizens do not accept responsibility for reciprocal efforts and a reciprocal demonstration of cooperation and goodwill with government authorities. That sense of reciprocal responsibilities was well reflected in Working Nation's job compact, where it was acknowledged that, if long-term unemployed people refused a subsidised job or knocked back a training opportunity, they could not expect the government to continue automatically with long-term income support arrangements. All these things are up for grabs. Bills like this that are technical and complex-although perhaps not as wide ranging as other pieces of legislation-at least provide members with a chance to roam across the philosophical and ideological agenda and to debate these things through. It is an unfortunate aspect of our parliament that, when a minister such the Minister for Social Security takes the time and effort to produce a quite visionary discussion paperMC 1890 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 20 June 1995 well researched and well argued-about the future of the social security system, as parliamentarians we do not always have the opportunity to respond. Reports such as this often sit around the halls of academia or in libraries and, whilst there is nothing wrong with that, parliamentarians should have forums in which to make known their views, not just about things happening in Australia in 1995, but also about things which impact into the medium and longer term. I congratulate the minister on this legislation but, more thoroughly, I congratulate him on the effort he has taken to produce a discussion paper about the future of social security and to prompt members into thinking in the longer term. for Werriwa( Mr Latham). While it was a well-considered speech on the general philosophical issues facing social security policy, it did not actually touch on the specifics of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. While he congratulates the Minister for Social Security( Mr Baldwin) for the legislation, I do not think he realises that a lot of the legislation strikes at the very heart of the system of support for the people in our community that he was congratulating the minister for helping. Whilst some of the measures in this bill are particularly necessary, normal and efficient, a number of them will change social security for people and will affect them in a very damaging way. That is what I want to concentrate on in my speech. The Social Security Amendment Bill implements a number of non-budget administrative measures. In doing so, it seeks to alter the legal process, to neuter the arrangements made in settling compensation cases. It sweeps aside the long standing apportionment of compensation, and seeks to have it treated holus bolus as payment for economic loss. The government hopes to use schedule 16(b) of this bill to significantly alter the social security treatment of split settlement payments. The coalition is rightly inclined to oppose this move. While the coalition is not opposing most of the legislation, that matter is of particular concern to me. This is not the first time that the government has sought to make changes in this area. The 1993 Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill also attempted to make changes to the compensation provisions of the Social Security Act. Under the 1993 proposals the government wished to institute a lump sum preclusion period after payment of compensation during which recipients of lump sums eligible for pensions or allowances would not be able to claim entitlements. This period was calculated by dividing the compensation part of their lump sum-50 per cent of a payment containing an economic component-by average weekly earnings of all male employees. The government sought to remove the qualification of the compensation payments to which the 50 per cent rule applied by no longer. requiring them to have an economic component before the rule became applicable. Under its proposals one half of any lump sum compensation would be treated as an income related payment. This measure was strongly opposed at the time for undermining the integrity of the non-economic component of compensation payments. After much debate and failed negotiations over the amendment it was withdrawn. The new proposals that we are debating here today fail for just the same reason but, to date, they have not been withdrawn. Under the legislation, if a person receives more than one payment arising out of the same event and part of at least one of these payments is for lost earnings or for lost earning capacity, then the person will be deemed to have received one lump sum to which the 50 per cent rule will apply and it is there that the government and the coalition part company. It is being",104,Representatives Main Committee
196,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (1.18 P.m. ),"1 listened carefully to the speech of the honourable memberTuesday, 20 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1891 justified by the Labor Party as a result of a trend to manage compensation payments to avoid compensation recovery provisions of the Social Security Act. The practice is alleged to occur where one settlement for a low amount is made for the loss of earnings and earning capacity and a larger amount, not falling within the definition of compensation and therefore exempt from recovery provisions, is made for non-economic losses such as pain and suffering. What is clear is that these new amendments, while I acknowledge that they are significantly different from the 1993 proposals, will still have a significant impact and great power to reduce the non-economic components of compensation payments. More importantly, they disregard the proper legal process by which such decisions have been arrived at. Sure, there may be oneoff poor examples that the government can point to where the allegations are sometimes true. But why should the legal process be circumvented by a government bureaucracy in the vast number of cases where compensation for non-economic loss is quite legitimate? There is no good reason. Where a compensation payment contains a component for pain and suffering, then it is entirely inappropriate and, indeed, unjust for the government to adopt a formula that disregards this and treats it as a payment for economic loss. Welfare and disabled groups have already commented on how the government's proposals undermine legal settlements. Most importantly, they have pointed out the simple fact that this amendment will make a mockery of the very purpose of settlements for pain and suffering by treating money awarded for non-economic reasons as compensation for loss of income or earnings potential. I do not understand how the government can believe that this measure is in any way compatible with the pieties it sometimes mouths about social justice. Its proposals in this area-to treat non-economic compensation as economic compensation-sound like Lewis Carroll politics. They are entirely contradictory and deserve to be opposed. I am surprised that the member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, would have allowed this to get through the Labor Party caucus knowing the effect that this might have on vast numbers of people. This is the government of a man who sees himself as a visionary. Yet when it comes to people who cannot defend themselves, who are not part of an organised lobby group, the vision of the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) is cruelly clouded. To Labor, these people are merely statistics that cost too much money. This measure makes a mockery of the ALP's claims to the social justice high ground. The bill also applies compensation provisions to claimants as well as recipients. At the moment people are first assessed as to whether they qualify for a compensation affected payment and then compensation recovery provisions are considered. This can lead to individuals being put through a lengthy qualification process, although it is obvious that they will be precluded for payment under the compensation recovery provision. Under today's bill, compensation recovery provisions may be applied first. Then, after people have effectively exhausted their compensation, an assessment will be made as to whether or not they qualify. This has led to some concern that, if compensation recovery provisions are incorrectly applied, there will be a delay in payment, as qualification has not been established, and that that could lengthen significantly during the appeal process. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995 also makes amendments to the qualifications for the disability support pension and for the disability wage supplement, MC 1892 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 20 June 1995 schedule 4. Currently, to qualify for the disability support pension people must be able to show that they suffer from an impairment significant enough to prevent them from doing the work they are qualified or skilled for as opposed to work in general. The bill clarifies the meaning of work under the DSP regulations. Under this legislation, it is proposed to change the regulations so that people are unable to claim the DSP if they are fit for any suitable kind of work that they could undertake without training. This amendment has been subject to some criticism, as, in a number of cases, people able to do mundane unskilled work will no longer be eligible for their benefit. The changes the bill makes to the 20 per cent impairment regulations may be of greater concern. Under the new provisions, a person will have to have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 per cent or more on the impairment table and a continuing inability to work so as to qualify for the disability support pension. Welfare rights bodies have warned that this amendment does not adequately consider the situation of people suffering lack of energy or motivation as a result of long-term illness or chronic pain. Welfare rights bodies are concerned that these individuals will be incorrectly excluded from receiving payments. The coalition is also concerned about the effect which this change will have on those who are genuinely unable to work because of the cumulative effect of a disability coupled with a lack of motivation because of long-term illness and chronic pain. In response, the Department of Social Security has stated that it intends to place low motivation as a direct consequence of illness or impairment on the impairment table as an assessable medical problem, and the coalition supports the action of the department. This is all very well, but the department is not yet willing-as in all such cases-to respond to a request to formally confirm that any ambiguity in the interpretation of the amendment will be resolved in favour of the recipient. If the legislation is passed, the department could say, 'We didn't put it in Writing.' Therefore, there is nothing to rely on if you are a person who will be without the DSP. For this reason, we propose that the changes outlined in schedule 4 be referred to a Senate committee for closer investigation of the effects of the changes. Perhaps the department will then make a commitment. Other changes in the bill are more straightforward. The legislation amends the payment of the jobsearch and newstart allowances and the special benefit payable to people undertaking full-time study. At the moment, the JSA and the NSA payments continue for up to three weeks after a person starts an Austudy approved course of more than six months duration. Under the current proposals, payments will continue for a full three weeks and the requirements of the activity test will be waived during this period. Continuing payments will be extended to courses of less ""than six months and which are not approved under the terms of the activity test or agreement. Recipients of the special benefit will now receive payment for three weeks after commencing study. JSA, NSA and youth training allowance recipients who commence full-time training courses of less than six months duration will have a $200 education entry payment extended to them. Under the bill, JSA, NSA or partner allowance recipients who inform the Department of Social Security of changes in their circumstances which affect payment of benefits will have their payments varied, cancelled or suspended effective from the date the change occurs. The dates of changes to payments currently depend on whether the results are favourable or not. This means that changes to benefits that reduce payment amounts will occur earlier than at Tuesday, 20 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1893 present as payments will vary when the event occurs rather than once the Department of Social Security makes a decision. The Department of Social Security looks at a notional rate of percentage while taking the lone fringe benefit into consideration when it calculates the effect of parental income on under18-year-olds in working out family payment rates. Under today's legislation, the interest rate will be set automatically by reference to current market rates. The bill also deals with the disadvantaged persons health scheme. Under sections 1171 and 1167 of the Social Security Act, lump sum and periodic payments are not treated as income for the purpose of the Health Insurance Act while other compensation payments are included. This has led to an anomaly between different types of compensation when eligibility for the health care card is taken into consideration. This bill will remove that anomaly. These changes are welcomed by the coalition as being sensible alterations to the act that will ensure a smoother ride for the clients of the department who find themselves using the services offered. The bill also contains a number of amendments that resolve other anomalies and errors in the act. The bill makes amendments to the definition of income to ensure that students who have a loan under the student financial supplement scheme are not precluded from receiving a health care card because of the loan, a measure that should assist 1,800 students. While the measure assists few in number, those assisted will be grateful and the government should be applauded at least for this change. Mr Robert Brown-Hear, hear! change. I did not notice him responding to my disapproval of the government's changes earlier in my speech. MaybeI should repeat them to him privately and he might take them up with the minister. The bill makes amendments to the definition of long-term social security recipients to ensure that jobsearch and news tart recipients are not prevented from receiving bereavement payments because of periods on Austudy. It brings the qualification for the seniors health card in line with the current pension ages of 65 for men and 60 years and six months for women, once the women's eligibility age rises on 1 July. Finally, the bill makes amendments to the data matching program and improvements to the integrity and accuracy of the Social Security Act. Most of the provisions are supported and welcomed by the coalition. Schedule 16(b) of the bill, which alters the treatment of split settlement payments, will be referred to a Senate committee because it is unjust and ill considered. We propose that schedule 4 be referred to a Senate committee for closer investigation because its effects may be greater than the government anticipates. The circumstances in which people are affected by this bill are often ones in which they are left with little political voice. In that case the government must take extra care to ensure that those affected are dealt with fairly.

This concept of all for one and one for all has not really been accepted by the Labor Party in its many machinations. I refer not only to the Labor Party itself but also to the derivatives of that, including the ACTU and many of the so-called minority groups that the Labor Party has set up to speak on these sorts of issues. The social welfare issues are problems within our community and I think the community should be addressing them on a better basis than quickly putting ad hoc legislation through. On this particular legislation we are advised that there has not been much consultation, and in fact a number of groups have come to us with their concerns about the bill. Some of these include the Welfare Rights Centre in New South Wales, the Welfare Rights Centre in South Australia, the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia, the Launceston Community Legal Centre and the South Australian Council of Social Service. These groups are showing great concern about the haste of these particular amendments and they have been very quick to tell us so. That is a sad story about some of the legislation that the Labor Party puts through on these social issues, which are a vitally important aspect of the community today. I guess that social security legislation needs changing to keep up with the times and therefore it could need adjusting, but as a new member of parliament-and I have been a member now for more than two years-I am amazed by the number of times we have to alter social security and social services legislation and the number of times I have actually spoken on amendments in the last 12 months. These amendments really confirm the myth that the Labor Party and its fellow travellers try to perpetuate on an ongoing basis-that is, that they represent the only party, the true ruling party, and that they are the only ones who have a caring and sharing attitude towards the Australian people. I do not think that, at this time in the Australian community, that is quite acceptable, because there are a lot of people out there in the community who are hurting at the moment. I guess that, when the Labor Party was in opposition many years ago, it actually listened to the community and responded to what it needed. But now it seems that the Labor Party has its own idea of a social agenda and is not prepared to listen any more to the community. There is no consideration for the real issues and there is no consideration given to the people who are really aching to be heard out there in the community. The Australian Labor Party continually projects itself as the natural party of social issues but, as you no doubt realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, the reality is very different from the rhetoric and what the perceptions are. As the shadow minister pointed out, we have problems with some parts of this legislationthe amendments which have been the subject of great concern by those who actually work out in the field of social services. They are concerns the Labor government has failed to hear, . and that continues the trend of the arrogant nature of this particular government. It is virtually telling people in the Australian community what is good for them rather than listening to what they really need. This autocratic management style that the Labor Party projects is very much a sixties style of management. Mrs Crosio interjectingam getting used to it. But it is a bit of a paradox, because here is the Labor government ridiculing anyone who talks about community values and community customs of the sixties.",111,Representatives Main Committee
199,Mr Richard Evans,"You never behave when I speak, Parliamentary Secretary, so ITuesday, 20 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1895 People in the Labor government ridicule anyone who wants to maintain those values and those customs, but here they are using a sixties style of management in a very autocratic sense. Any manager at the moment would say that autocratic management is a thing of the past and that it is really a dinosaur attitude. But here they are showing again, with legislation they have brought forward, that they really have not listened to certain groups that are actually out in the field in the community. I guess the community will be a bit saddened and will probably make the decision at the next election in favour of those who will listen to what they have to say. One of the failures in leadership has been the process, as with these amendments, and it appears that the government again has not really listened. Let us see where we have some concern within this particular field. The bill seeks to amend the definition of the meaning of work in relation to the disability support pension. Currently, people must show that their impairment is sufficient to prevent them from doing work for which they are currently skilled rather than doing other work. The amendment provides that people may not qualify if they are fit for any work-that is, work that is skilled or unskilled that they could do without education or any training. On the surface, this sounds simple enough, but we have to look beyond that as to whether or not it will work. My guess is that the government's intent is that, because disabled people are recipients of a pension, unless they are able to complete any type of job they will be faced with entering the employment market. So if they are disabled at the moment and they can, in fact, do any other job, they will be forced-I do not like using the word 'forced'-or requested or will need to move into the employment market. This may be fine in theory but, as we parliamentarians know and realise, the community is full of unusual situations that fellow Australians find themselves in. What this amendment could mean is that people will move off the disability pension. They may be subjected to a mundane type of job which is not stimulating in terms of their mental skills-it could mean that. It could mean that, if they have to nominate themselves for work, they might fall back onto the unemployment figures. In looking at the long-term requirements regarding unemployment, they would have to move into an employment contract or some sort of compact or case management. Of course, the Labor policy at the moment is to drop people off these particular statistics. A possible scenario could involve someone with a disability-maybe the person has an arm missing. If it involves the right hand, even though the person has always favoured the right hand, he or she can in fact do other duties and could, I guess, be forced back into employment which is not stimulating. These people might have an MBA or some sort of other higher degree, but they could find themselves back in long-term unemployment where they are forced to go through some training programs. I have a letter from a training provider to one of my constituents that states: As you are no doubt aware, the offer of a position on a new work opportunities program is considered an offer of suitable employment. Failure to attend the start of the program will result in your unemployment benefits being withdrawn. This particular person was asked to go into a program which was called an aquatic care program, which meant six months out in the sun. He suffers with skin cancer, so it was being demanded that he go along to a training program which was not suitable for health reasons. It is an extreme scenario; but we can have these people, disabled through no fault of their own, being placed in a situation of unemployment and case management and being forced through that whole process. Can anyone in the government say without any doubt, with extreme MC 1896 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 20 June 1995 confidence, that these sorts of scenarios could not or would not happen? The point that I am putting is that they cannot definitely say that it will not happen; so I have a concern about that. I am also concerned about the amendment concerning the 20 per cent impairment requirement for physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment. The easy response for this amendment is, 'Yes, let's agree to it.' Certainly there are people in the community who are looking for this sort of amendment, to allow for people who may not be motivated or who may lack the energy for employment being excluded from getting any sort of disablement payment. The 20 per cent may cover a few people and force them back into the employment structure. Probably an easy answer is, 'Yes, we should do that.' But we should be considering those who really are not motivated, who do lack the energy, or who do have some sort of psychiatric problem. Let us face it: mental illness is a problem within the community. Perhaps this 20 per cent provision may be unreasonable; but then again, perhaps it is reasonable. The vital point here is that we should be listening to those in the field who deal with these sorts of scenarios. Perhaps we should be listening to them more than we have in developing this particular amendment. Perhaps putting it to a Senate committee will mean that those people who are in the community-in the field-will have the opportunity to put their case. Maybe their case is not strong enough, and maybe we should go forward with this 20 per cent impairment amendment; but the point is that they should be able to put their case forward. Why we have to go to a Senate committee is beyond me, but because of the autocratic nature of the government it has not been one to listen to people. But here we are, forcing government senators into a Senate committee to become good listeners. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is timely to remind the Committee of some of the facts about the government when it comes to social security. I am pleased to hear that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security( Mrs Crosio) is such a good listener. People in the government are a bit out of touch when it comes to a lot of the things that are happening in the community at the moment. The accusation of not listening is quite correct, in my view. Perhaps they would like to listen to some of the facts about some of the things that are happening in the community at the moment. I take this opportunity to remind the government that, after 12 years of Labor government, one in 10 families have both parents out of work. Almost 19 per cent of Australia's children under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner. One-quarter of Australian families has no working member; that is about 1.15 million families that have no working member. The number of traditional families falling into the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. The number of children who are members of families dependent on social security payments rose from approximately 620,000 in 1982 to approximately 1.6 million in 1992. One in eight families are falling below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every group except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line, which equates to 13 per cent of households: a rise of over 14 per cent since 1983. Of all Australians living in poverty, just one-half come from traditional nuclear families, while 44 per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. Taking inflation into account, the top 10 per cent of earners have seen their incomes rise by approximately seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same period, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent have fallen by five per Tuesday, 20 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1897 cent. The top 20 per cent of income earners get 42.1 per cent of the total earnings; the bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent of the total earnings. Mrs Crosio---They're your figures. is entirely correct. They are our figures and they are, in fact, based upon good research which the shadow minister, who is well regarded in his field, has provided. I mention these facts because too often we are fed a myth about the Labor Party. These amendments are another example of the government bringing forward a bill without proper consultation with the community or with those who work in the field. It is another bill that it has tried to put through without the consequences being adequately considered; another bill that requires further consideration with the Senate; another bill that tries to extend the myth of the Labor Party being the sharing and caring party when in fact we dispute that; another bill that exposes the weaknesses of Labor management when it comes to this place. At the moment, there are 80-odd bills in the Senate waiting to be debated. The government cannot get its act together in the other place. The Australian community wants more than the rhetoric of the Labor Party and its fellow travellers. It wants more than the Labor policy of throwing money at a problem. It is always throwing money at a problem rather than getting into the basic core of what is causing the problem. People in the Australian community want sound management of issues that are important to them. The Labor Party is not really addressing issues of management nor is it able to address them in the current parliament. At the moment, the Labor Party is trying to play the big picture. It has got all these other big things happening. In an autocratic style, it is telling the community exactly what it should be having and which way it should be going. The Labor Party is playing those big picture things, but it is exposing the weaknesses of its own management and the detail of its legislation is beginning to fall apart like a jigsaw when it is tossed off the coffee table. The Australian community will seek a change. It will be wanting better management of legislation. It will be wanting better management of the issues that it is really concerned about and it will be doing that at the next election. p.m.)-in reply-I commend those people who have made a contribution to the debate today. I understand, from information that has just been supplied to me, that the opposition will be supporting the amendments that the government has already circulated in total. I will not exphiin those amendments in detail. They have been acknowledged by the opposition and they are technical in nature. Certainly, these can only assist the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995 in the implementation of the principles. I want to make one comment, and I am sorry the honourable member for Cowan( Mr Richard Evans) has left the debate. To all of us, social agenda really means the people's agenda. In regard to social security, this government is concerned to make sure that, through its platform and policies, it delivers what people want. The honourable member spoke about the objections of the welfare rights group to some of the principles we outlined in the bill before the House.
