Is it not always those honourable members who sit on the Corner benches who. keep the Government, in. office? On them the fate of the Ministry depends; without their support the Government could not remain, in office for two minutes; though a little less so than the direct directed at the Corner party?directed at the Government, and at every honourable member who votes to keep the Government in office,whether a Minis^ terialist or a Corner party member; On Saturday last the> peopleof Ballaratj in an win.

The War Precautions Act is still' in opera1 tion. Although the war; toall intents' and people will be placed in a position to oust purposes,finishedlong ago, regulations are still being issued under the War Precautions Act, and the country is being governed by them without a word or not of protest on the part of those who sit on the Corner benches. What' have they done to put an end .to this pernicious system of governing by regulation? much of the public time as many other honourable members do. much time over the honourable member, or any of those who sit on the Corner benches, because the people of the country can see through their humbug. I wish now to say a' word or two about the attitude of the Prime Minister. the Corner party ? so, there will not be much left of you. Prime Minister, I should like to know why it was that the Labour party selected choice in the Ballarat. election.? electoral system, we are compelled to ca3t preference votes;, and being forced to make a choice, we, like sensible, people, choose the lesser of two evils. Politically speaking; the Corner' party candidates> and Corner party members, are to us an evil, Ministerial supporters and Ministerial candidates: The great Australian Labour movement: is always in the lead, and we know that the second preferences' of our candidates are never counted"". The electoral system adopted is therefore immar terial to us, because our candidates will regarded as the writing on the wall. It presents a forecast, of what is in store for 1 honourable members opposite when they go to the people at the nest general elecmember is praying will not take place for the next two years'and six months. WhatI am praying for is-that, by a double dissolution of this Parliament at the earliest possible opportunity, the the present Government from their position; I wish to make one or two references to the attempt which the Prime Minister made yesterday to reply to the charges of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor). His remarks did not constitute any reply to the charges levelled at the Government. They represented merely the usual vulgar attempt to. side-track the real question before the House and the country to-day. The Leader of' the Opposition, on behalf of the party on this side, charges the Government, first of all, with their general incapacity. thing! charge the Prime Minister does not reply to it but says, "" Gentlemen, cast your eyes on this bogy I have set up for you."" He has thrown a scarlet cloak around the bogy he has set up, and the moment the Government are charged with any offence the Prime Minister points to his bogy and says, ""Hush, here is the bogy",19,Censu Re Motion

23,Mr Mahony,"When we make thatman."" through these low-down tactics, and tlieir adoption will not avail the Government. I believe that the majority of the rank and file of the party behind the Prime Minister to-day is heartily ashamed of the tactics he adopted yesterday in dragging into our discussions in this Chamber matters of conscience between the individual and his Creator, which should be held sacred, and which no public man has the right to introduce into a debate of this kind. I repeat that I believe the majority of honourable members opposite are heartily ashamed of the attempt made yesterday afternoon by the Prime Minister to side-track the real issue before the country. The Leader of the Opposition points out -that profiteering is going on throughout Australia, that the people are being robbed by the profiteers, and called upon to pay vastly increased prices for the commodities they use. What is the reply of the Prime Minister to the charge that he and his Government have permitted this to go on? It is ""Hush, the bogy man."" terday by the Prime Minister to the charge levelled against the Government in this connection amounted to nothing but that. He put up his bogy, and did not attempt to defend himself or his Government against the attack of the Leader of the Opposition. ""Here is ithe bogy, beware. Do not charge this Government with anything, because here is the bogy man."" The right honourable gentleman should not forget that the people of Australia are not children, and are not frightened by bogy men any longer. Minister never said anything about bogy men. set up his bogy man. charge him with not carrying out his promises to returned soldiers, and with permitting harpies from one end of Australia to the other to make profits by trading in the war gratuity bonds of returned soldiers, his reply again is, ""Hush, the bogy man."" The people' of Australia will give honourable members opposite all the bogy The people of Australia see men they are looking for when they get the opportunity at the next election. There is another important matter upon which the people will demand some explanation of their attitude from honourable members who sit in the Corner. The Government have done away with trial by jury in this country. The people of Australia will demand from them and from honourable members who sit in the Corner an explanation of their attitude in connection with the abolition in this country of open fair and British trial by jury. honourable members in the Corner why they approved of the action of the Government in throwing into the waste paper basket the great charter of liberty which something over 600 years ago was wrung from the trembling King John at Runnymede. That great charter of liberty gave to every British subject the right to a free and open trial by his peers. The Government during the last three or four years have thrown trial by jury into the waste-paper basket, and they are doing the same thing to-day. There is no open trial, no charges are formulated, an accused person is given no opportunity to face his accuser. People are grabbed in the night and taken away from their families and loved ones. They are hustled from one State to another to evade the ordinary operation of the Law His reply was merely, Courts of the country. In these circumstances I ask honourable members to say where the great charter of British liberty is to-day. How can the Government continue in office conducting the affairs of the country if honourable members who sit in, the Corner are not prepared to agree to this kind of thing? I ask those honourable members to say whether they stand for it or not. So far as I am personally concerned, I care not whether the crime with which a person is accused When we be great or small he has a right under our great charter of liberty to demand an open trial, and that he should be. faced with his accuser. He has the right to demand an opportunity to defend himself in open Court. Do the Government give people of this country that right?

29,Mr Mahony.r,"The people will askproduction of the evidence taken at thatinquiry the Government refused to produce it. We have a statement publicly made by a gentleman of some standing in this country, that at a certain inquiry held in Sydney recently not one word of evidence was given against the person whom the Government held in custody. The whole of the evidence given at that iuquiry was iu favour of the accused person. Do honourable members opposite stand for that? I say that it does not matter what crime a man is charged with he has the right to an open and fair trial by his countrymen. I shall be no party to depriving any man of a fair trial. In my opinion the vilest criminal in the land has a right to an open and fair trial. In this case, because it suits the political game that the Prime Minister desires to play, certain men are hustled away, and no public statement in regard to the matter is made by the Government. Not a word is said as to the charge against them; no opportunity is given them to defend themselves, and they are deliberately denied the privilege of having counsel to appear for them. This is a negation of one of the basic principles of British liberty. In Australia to-day, even a man charged with the vilest murder is not only given a fair trial in open Court, but if he is without means counsel for his defence is provided by the Crown. In these cases, however, no specific charge is made against the men. given them to state their case, and they are not allowed to retain counsel to conduct their defence. It is about time that a stop was put to this sort of thing in Australia. offence for which he should be gaoled or deported, let, the charge be proved against him, and let him take his punishment. I do not stand here to protect any person from the consequences of his own acts, but I do stand for the principle of giving every man in a British community the right of an open trial and an opportunity to clear himself, if he can, of the charge or charges made against him. The Government are building up for themselves a day of reckoning, and when that day comes there will be little left of them. They will be overwhelmed by a great avalanche of indignation, which will have had its birth in the action of the Government in depriving men of the great rights which hundreds of years ago were wrung from King John at Runnymede. I recognise that it is futile to appeal to the Government and their supporters, but to the Corner party we surely can appeal. We are merely asking for the recognition of traditional rights. ber is after our support, he is adopting a very clumsy way of obtaining it. support. member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) holds so loosely to his principles that some chance remark of mine induces him to depart from them, then he does not understand what principle means. When I believe in a certain principle, it is immaterial to me what may be said; I stand to it in any circumstances, and am prepared to take the consequences. This attempt on the part of the honourable member to hide behind so paltry an excuse will protect neither him nor his party. His excuse is too thin. The Prime Minister yesterday raised the bogy-man which was so effectively knocked down at Ballarat last Saturday, and he raised it against, not only us, but the Country party. The Prime Minister, whom they are supporting with their votes in this House to-day, raised this very same bogy against their candidate for No opportunity is the Ballarat by-election. Such are the tactics of the Prime Minister. The history of the public life of Australia is studded with instances of men who, entering upon the dying days of their poliI f any man commits an tical career, have trotted up this old bogy. The history of the failures in the public life of Australia shows that in every case they raised the bogy-man with the scarlet cloak. I wonder what honourable members of the Country party thought of the action of the Prime Minister in raising this bogy-man against their candidate at Ballarat. I hope they enjoyed it. The right honourable gentleman was pleased yesterday to attack this party on the ground that it comprised only twenty-five members. After the return of the writ for the Ballarat by-election we shall be twenty-six strong; but because of the relative smallness of our numbers he attacked us and sneered at us.

As a matter of fact, he has never led the Australian Labour party to victory. When he assumed the leadership of the party, he led it to destruction. H a r d l y had he taken control than the party became divided and broken. party was built up under the leadership of such men as J. C. Watson and Andrew Eisher. Those are the men, and not men Buch as the present Prime Minister, who led the party to victory. The right honourable gentleman talked of the great victory achieved by Labouri n 1914, when our party overwhelmed all its opponents. I wonder what most of his followers who are sitting behind h i m to-day thought of that statement. TheP r i m e Minister and the country know that the very men who were defeated by us in .those days are tiie men w i th whom the right honourable gentleman sits to-day cheek-byjowl. As the Prime Minister spoke, the face of the Acting Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) was a study. He could not but recall immediately his experiences of 19.14, when from one end of this country to the other the Prime Minister flogged and scarified h i m and the party which he led. The Prime Minister then crumpled into political dust the present Acting Treasurer and many of the men who sit behind h i m to-day. effrontery to h u rl at this party the taunt that it consists of only twenty-five members. pense of principle are paid for too dearly, and the Labour movement w ill neveT buy victory by sacrificing its principles for the sake of place and pay. If we had chosen to sacrifice our principles, to hurl them overboard, and to go over to the traditional enemies of Labour, the exploiter and the profiteer, we could have been, as tlie Prime Minister rightly says, sitting on the Treasury bench to-day. We preferred not to do so. To us such a victory would be a barren one. A victory without principle is of no use to the Labour movement. trust deep down in the hearts of the people of this country, the great -working masses, the toilers of Australia. Those are the people to whom we look, and with whom we stand. sneers of the Prime Mr Mahony. him naught We stand to principle, regardless of the cost and irrespective of whether we may gain viqtory or not. When I heard the Prime Minister taunting us with the fact that we were only twenty-five strong in the House today, and when I saw the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Joseph Cook) The Australian Labour sitting alongside him, my m in d w e n t, back to some of the early days in New South Wales, particularly in Balmain. In those days I saw the Prime Minister1 in a very lowly and humble position in the suburb where I was reared. I was m close contact with him for many years before he entered public life. I saw him there in his days of poverty, and I know how the workers stuck to h i m . .1 know what they did in Balmain for him, 'and he knows it , too. NowI find the same man hurling taunts at the party which stood by him, and I .find sitting .alongside him the man whom he fought, and against whom 'he wrote scarifying articles. ""The Prime Minister ventured into the realms of journalism in those early days. He and Mr Holman, with great struggles and great trials., used to publish a paper called The New Order, and the most powerful articles in it were those from the pen of W . M . Hughes. He was the man who preached real rank red-raw Socialism to us inthose days. He was the man who pointed out to the workers the way to go. The articles that the Government He has now the object to to-day -are only a '.circumstance compared with those written by W . M . Hughes and printed in The New Order. One .article in particular came to my Victories gained at the exmind yesterday afternoon, when I looked at the Prime Minister sitting cheek .by jowl with the honourable member for.Parramatta. That was an article written by the Prime Minister and entitled, "" Joephisto Cook."" The Prime Minister might tell honourable members what that meant. The sub-heading was, "" The Scoot of tlie Rats."" In that article the Prime .'Minister scarified his present boon-companion ( Sir Joseph Cook) for having ratted on the Labour party. Yet to-day 'he has the impudence and effrontery to jeer at and taunt us. As the same time, he is We have our sitting cheek by jowl with the man whom he scarified and condemned for doing just what he is doing to-day-condemn ing the party that gave him his political birth.

My appeal is for a man of big ideals and big principles to lead this Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite may well ask, concerning the members of their own party, "" Where is he?"" and echo will answer, '.'Where?"" there are. men in this House capable of taking a big stand, upon, big Australian matters.. I believe there are many men here capable of properly upholding the position of Prime Minister; It is degrading not only to Parliament but to the 1 people of this great Commonwealth that its first citizen, the Prime Minister, -should indulge in this sort of vulgar abuse. The man who descends to such tactics is unfitted for the position of Prime Minister of Australia. It is up to the honourable members sitting in the Ministerial Corner to see if they cannot find somebody more fitted and able to fill with honour the positionof Prime Minister. The members of the Australian Labour movement cannot govern without a majority, because the Labour movement never goes back on principle, and we, as a Government, if we could not put our principles into practice, would not remain in office two minutes. We should decline, if we had to govern by jettisoning our principles. Let a majority of the Housedecide that we shall have somebody in that position who is worthy to -govern Australia, and capable of rising to the responsibilities placed upon the shoulders of any man who occupies it . This mere twittering, humbugging, sneering, and trying, by a trick of mental agility, to make an opponent look cheap or small, is unworthy of any person who' holds the high position of Prime Minister of Australia. The House should endeavour to rise a little above that sort of thing. The House has in this motion an opportunity of deciding upon a Prime Minister who can worthily uphold the best traditions of Australia and of its Parliament. cannot think of anybody else. to the exalted idea which the honourable member for Grampians holds about, himself. No doubt the honourable member has been preeninghimself, and imagining that he himself is the man. It is quite an open Surely there are big problems to secret that he has been expecting appointment as ""Leader of the Country party. For myself, I am merely a humble follower of the Leader of the Labour party. My only desire is to help along tVe party and the movement with which I -am associated, for the betterment of the conditions of the men and women who toil to build up the fortunes of the profiteers. The Prime Minister, I repeat, But I believe that attempted to belittle the Labour party. I look at the spectacle of another honourable member sitting cheek-by-jowl with him. I wonder where the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) will be when the division takes place. A newspaper stated the other afternoon that the Prime Minister had been seen with his arm about the neck of the honourable member, and big mouth at his ear. No doubt he was telling the honourable member a sweet little tale. Do we not all remember the Prime Minister taunting the honourable member in this Chamber with having "" a mind like a toad in a cesspit ?"" To-day he is the boon companion of the Prime Minister, and his will be the vote that will continue the Government in office. The honourable member for Capricornia was returned to this House as a direct opponent of the present Government. The people of Capricornia sent him here to oust the Government from office, and he has no moral right to keep the Government in"" power. He was returned to Parliament as a direct supporter of the Leader of the Opposition, and as a member of the Australian Labour party. What happened subsequently is immaterial so far as the principle at stake is concerned. The honourable member may claim, that certain officials of the Labour movement did something that they should not do, but that does not give him any right Lo go back upon his principles, and upon the people who elected him. If the honourable member desires to keep the Government in power by his voice and vote, the only honourable thing for him to do is to resign and go before his electors again. Let him say to them, "" I cannot now represent you in the capacity in which you returned me, but I ask you to re-elect me as a direct supporter of the Government.""

On this question I am using the mildest language at my command. chooses to adopt a course different from that I have indicated, he must be the arbiter of his own conduct; but to my mind principles are of far greater importance than the retention of a seat in this House. sooner go down and out ten thousand times than accept any position in or out of Parliament at the expense of any principle I hold dear.

Nobody knows better than the honourable member the kindly feelings entertained towards him by the. members of this party. But having been returned to the House by the men and women of Capricornia to shift the present Government from office, he is now' about to vote to keep them in power. principle at stake; the actions and attitude of honourable members on this side are beside the. question. of fact, we took no action, and the honourable member knows it. But, whether we did or not does not affect the principle. ber of the Opposition has expressed a word of public regret at the action of the Brisbane Executive, although professing this friendship for me. and lasting, in my heart when I witnessed the spectacle of the honourable member for Capricornia voting with his life-long political opponents; voting to keep in power a Government which he was sent here to turn out. He, like the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), has dabbled in journalism in his early days. DoI not remember the inspiring articles which the honourable member wrote many years ago? Do we not recall with a thrill that great slogan which emanated from the honourable member for Capricornia and was blazed from one end of the country to the other"" Bread or blood""? To-day, I wonder what the If the honourable member honourable member has to say. his daily bread. put the honourable member for CapriI would cornia into this House, when they ask of him bread receive only a stone. I wish to refer now to the assumption of the Prime Minister that he controls a great majority in this House. Such an 'assumption can only be based on his belief in the statements which he made yesterday; and we can only assume that, if the Prime Minister truly believes he has something to go on, there must be some secret understanding between the Government and the members of the Country party. Minister referred to the members of both Houses of this Legislature. no arrangement with the Country party, as a party, how do we know that there may not be some working agreement among certain of the individual members That is the in the Corner? If such be not the case, however, how can the Prime Minister assume and assert that he controls As a matter the great majority in this House? The fact is that he does not hold a majority. The Prime Minister has indicated that he is of opinion that he has the Country party "" in a bag."" Last week he was speaking of the numbers on both sides of this House, and his attention was drawn to the members of the Country party, sitting in the Corner. What did he say? How did he indicate his feelings towards them? He referred to them in the language of a sheep, probably thinking that they would understand that.

"" Probably tbe Prime Minister looks upon them as so many sheep, and has them well coralled in the home paddock, ready to be shorn when the time comes to take the pending vote. Here is the actual position of parties and inof all those who stood as direct Nationalist dividuals in this House, and the members of the Corner party must accept full responsibility for the situation as it stands. It is just as well to be candid. I do not run about from corner to corner, afraid to speak. So far as the members of the Government and its direct supporters are concerned, we know where they stand. I honour any man who is a straight-out opponent, and am prepared to give him credit for his opinions. I will always meet him as man to man, on fair ground. But as for those who desire to sail beneath a stolen flag, it is about time their craft was sunk and its crew forced to step aboard' some ship which is flying their true flag and indiof the Country party. The Government cating their real identity. As a matter of fact, the people of -this country do not want -the gentlemen to whom I refer' to sail on any ship, but would prefer to see them walk the plank. And they will have t% do so when it comes to the acceptance of responsibility for their votes. These country representatives go out into the country and condemn the actions of the Government in the matter of handling Australia's wool. Yet, at the same time, every vote they cast here is a vote to retain the Government in office. Such conduct will very soon be seen through, and the people will know what to do. The Labour party in this House has twenty-six direct followers. The Corner party, we understand, has eleven direct followers. The straight-out anti-Labour party, whose members masquerade as Nationalists, numbers thirty-six in the House of Representatives. Then there is the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs). I do not know where he stands. Surely, however, he will consult his conscience to-day and decide to be somewhere else when the vote is taken. Then there is also Mr Speaker. another independent member, namely, the honourable member for Henty( Mr eyes of the people are upon members of Francis). Where is he? tion is that the followers of the Prime Minister total no more than thirty-six. conceding the Prime Minister the support candidates at the last elections, it is obvious that he can command only thirtysix actual followers in this Chamber. Against him and his followers, elected by the people of Australia, elected directly in opposition to candidates of the Government party, there are thirty-eight members of this Chamber. Where is the great majority behind the Prime Minister? Never a truer word was spoken than that uttered by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor), when he said the Prime Minister and the Government were hanging on by the skin of their teeth. The skin of their teeth consists of the votes of the members would not be permitted to stay in office for another two minutes unless that party were prepared to keep it there. And, for such a state of affairs the Corner party must take full responsibility. What is more, it will not be allowed to shirk its responsibility. our policy is, ""Shift this anti-Labour Government""; and the second plank is "" Make the members of the Corner party come out in their true colours."" They should not declare themselves to be against the Government, which has thrown the principle of trial by jury overboard and has been governing the country under the War Precautions Act, and at the same time, by their votes in this Chamber, keep the Government in power. Members of the Corner party have an opportunity now of putting themselves right with the people by accepting their responsibility. Are they big enough to shoulder this responsibility? Have they an adequate conception of the future? Can they rise to the occasion? Or, on the other hand, are they going to be "" namby pamby "" followers of the Prime Minister?

Are they prepared to stand up for the interests of the people whom they say they represent? A charge has been made against members of the party which I have the honour to lead, that yesterday they were afraid to speak. May I say now that they paid ine the compliment, in my unavoidable absence, of waiting till I was present. There can be no doubt that we have to face the situation as it is presented to us, and so far as I am concerned I intend to do so. I have been in this House now for over seventeen years, and no man has yet been in a position to say that I have ever been afraid to take the consequences of any vote I have given. AndI challenge any member of this House to say that I ever voted against what I thought to be right, even upon a question submitted by the Government of which I was a supporter. cannot understand the tone of some of the speeches that were delivered yesterday by members of the Opposition. So far as I can gather, they constitute a direct attack upon the Country party. them one back now. actly where we stand. A member of my party said to me one day"" Make no mistake about this. Outside the door of this party room the Country party has no friends on either side."" And we have not. So far as concerns the interests which w i are here to represent, we have nothing to thank either side for. Mr J. H . CATTS -Did not the same vote return you to this Parliament as to the previous Parliament? thing as the secrecy of the ballot box. If it is any consolation to the honourable member, I can tell him that some of the men. who supported me strongly at former elections opposed me last time. Mr J. H . CATTS -Very few. opposed the operations of rings, trusts, and combines, and at the last election I had to fight the full strength of this influence in Hobart and in my own division. But on a censure motion I realize that there is no half way house. A man must either vote for, or against, a Government; he must express either his. confidence or his want of confidence in the Government. When we realize that the interests which we stand, for have not the representation in this. House that they are entitled to by their numbers outside or their importance, we must regret the tone of the debate. The speech made by the honourable member who preceded me was. a direct attack upon my party, and everything for which my party stands. I am compelled, therefore, to ask myself if the honourable member who tabled the motion really desired the Country party to vote for it or not. If honourable members opposite desire the support of the Country party, then all I can say is that they have a most extraordinary manner of dissembling their love;, because the speeches give one the impression that their object is to compel members of the Country party to vote against the motion. I candidly confess I said a word against the Country party. that has been said will make me swerve in the faintest degree from the course I have marked out for myself. It matters not to me if every member on this side and every member on the other side, makes a direct attack on those' interests which we are chiefly here to. represent, along with all other interests in Australia. motion on its merits. thing a great deal more to be considered than the motion on its merits. I am prepared to accept the responsibility attaching to the vote which I shall give, as must every man who votes on the motion. We have to accept the full and complete responsibility forattempting either to put the Government out of office, or for expressing our confidence in the Government. There are times when a man can take a middle course, but when it comes to a direct issue, and the fate of a Government is concerned, no member can salve his conscience, but must take, as I say, f u l l and complete responsibility for either removing the Government from office or keeping it in office, thus accepting the policy",26,Censu Re Motion

57,Mr Mcwilliams,"There is somethat it has followed -up to the present. That is the position as I recognise it, and that is the attitude which I intend to take. May I say here ""that the party of which I have the honour to be leader, do not approach these matters upon cast-iron principles. Every member of this party is absolutely free to vote on this or any other motion exactly as his conscience dictates, and the same liberty which I allow to every follower, every follower. allows to every other member of the party. -The policy which some of our friends opposite have enunciated is diametrically opposed to every' principle which the Country party upholds. .The policy enunciated, especially by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Catts), is that there must be a regulation of prices of primary .production .so far ,as the consumer is affected. Overseas, producers may jget as much as they can for their produce, but here the prices must be regulated to suit ihe -.consumer.' Mr J. H . CATTS -Based on a fair ; deal to the producer. the fair deal? Mr J. H . CATTS -We can devise machinery. gone by when -every worker in the cities and suburbs is to be permitted to have the f u l l and fair -results of bis labour, while the producer in the country is to be sweated-sweate d in order to give cheapness -to men to whom cheapness is a curse in every other direction. I have no sympathy with a man who demands 'the highest price he can get for his labour, and, at the same time, is prepared to sweat the producer in the case of everything he has to sell. I 'warn honourable members on both sides that the man on -the land is at last beginning to realize that an eight-hours system in the city is no good to him if he himself has to work ten or twelve .hours and have his products sweated to the cheapest possible price. Cheapness has been a god so far as primary production is concerned, but anathema to people engaged in every other industry. The day for that, however, is gone. The primary producers, in the matters to which I am referring, have in the past had nothing to thank my honourable friends opposite for, and, perhaps, have had quite as little to thank honourable members on this side for. We acceot the position in which we find' ourselves, and are prepared to plough our own furrow. So far as I am concerned, I shall vote for any motionI care not where it comes from-so long as I believe in it. As honourable members know, I have-per haps to my own personal disadvantagetaken that attitude on more than one occasion in this House. I have never been able to accept, and certainly I have never preached, that a motion is right if it comes from one man, and wrong if it comes from another; a principle is either right or it is wrong. While I am entirely opposed to the attitude and speeches of honourable members opposite, I recognise that the Government have absolutely failed in dealing with the finances of the country. I am reiterating what I have said over and over again in this House for years past when I say that we are indulging in a carnival of financial folly-'indulgin g in a ""boom, borrow, and burst"" policy. Never in the history of Australia 'have the finances of the country been in the same deplorable condition. I am not going to exaggerate, because at a time like this one has 'to be exceedingly cautious in what one says; but it is -everywhere known that representatives of the Victorian Government went Home and failed to borrow; that the representative of the Queensland Government is Home to-day and failing to borrow; and that the representative of the Federal Government went Home, and certainly did not -succeed. As to the"" merits of the case in which the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Watt) is involved, I am not going to say one word. The attitude I took at the time of that gentleman's resignation is, I think, the right one -We have heard one side of the case, and before I pass a verdict I intend to hear the case of the man who is absent. I am not prepared to debate that question at all. When the ex-Treasurer comes 'home, and makes his statement, will3 the 'time for ,_ me, at-any rate, to give ""my verdict. We can 'say, however, that the representatives of the Government who have been Home during the last month or two endeavouring to borrow, have all failed. It is not too much to say that the finances of the Commonwealth to-day are in a decidedly unsatisfactory condition, and that there' is not the slightest attempt to curtail expenditure.",27,Censu Re Motion

If anybody had said ten years ago that the Government could borrow £150,000,000 in Australia at the current rate of interest, the statement, would have been ridiculed. Nevertheless that has been done. We know, too, that the investment of the moneys which have been loaned to the Government had a very serious effect in preventing expenditure where it was urgently needed, espemembers may hold as to the desirableness cially in the direction of establishing newof encouraging local industries industries and in opening up the country in the way that it ought to be opened up. ter of universal application. minions, Australia alone made no effort during the war period to secure a reduction in her ordinary expenditure. During the war we were willing to overlook expenditure which at any other time would have been subjected to searching criticism, because we recognised that we were sailing on an uncharted sea. Instead, therefore, of our' ordinary expenditure being curtailed', year by year it has been steadily increased. But we have now reached a time when, no matter who may be charged with the government of the Commonwealth, there must be either a substantial increase in our revenue or a decided reduction in our expenditure or both. May I point out some of the directions in which our revenue is being increased to the serious detriment of industries in the various States? Only the day before yesterday I received from the Treasurer of Tasmania( Sir Elliott Lewis) figures which show that, between the 25th March last and the date I have mentioned, the sum of £5,500 has been paid in duty upon machinery that has been imported into that State by the Hydro-Electric Companya State enterprise-althoug h that machinery could not be obtained in Australia. But the most serious aspect of the matter is that, during the next twelve or eighteen months, the duty payable upon materials to be imported will able members to seriously consider the position. Here is a State which, at very considerable expenditure and risk, has undertaken the generation of electric power, which is being availed of by all parts of Australia. Refractory ores from Broken Hill are being treated by this State enterprise in Tasmania. The works which have been established there will permit of the treatment of millions of tons of low-grade refractory ores which it was quite ' impossible to treat previously. Yet, that State will be called upon to pay to the Commonwealth, by way of duty alone, the sum of £140,000 or £150,000. Further, this money will have to be borrowed by the State of Tasmania. I care not what views honourable chinery is being installed at the works in Tasmania? Every effort has been made to secure in Australia every pound's worth of machinery that can be obtained here. When, therefore, Tasmania is asked to pay £150,000 by way of duty in two years upon a State enterprise which will enable thousands of men to be employed in the reduction of refractory ores, it is time that the matter was considered seriously. Wales Government have exactly the same complaint in regard to that machinery. £900,000 from the. Commonwealth? of giving that State £90,000 a year, if we take £100,000 a year out of its exchequer? Surelyi t is not the function of the Commonwealth to bleed a State enterprise in this way. I do not intend to occupy the time of the House any longer. I have endeavoured to make my position absolutely clear. I am not asked to say whether I support the proposals which have been brought forward, or whether I endorse, or disapprove of, the speeches which may be made from either side of the chamber. The vote which I shall cast when the division upon this motion is taken will be one in regard to which. I shall have to accept the responsibility either of endorsing the policy of the Government, and of continuing them in",28,Censu Re Motion

67,Mr Mcwilliams,"What is the useoffice, or of displacing them. pared to face that position, and to accept my f u l l and complete responsibility. I did not intend to address myself to this motion. A f t e r the terms of the censure proposal had been committed to paper, I hardly thought it was necessary to in sist too much upon the obvious, namely, that the Government are unworthy of the confidence of this House. The terms of the motion are, I think, sufficiently wide to enable me to refer to a public scandal which has arisen, and to an agitation which has 'been fomented and promoted by the Government in connection with the proposed deportation of the Reverend Father Jerger. the honourable member not to deal with that matter, which is already sub judice. Reference to it has previously been ruled out of order. the Court this morning. member's pardon. I -was not aware of that. posed of for the time being this morning, and I take this, the earliest opportunity, of referring to the position in which Father Jerger stands in regard to his defence. Some time ago the Government determined to send that reverend jgentleman out of this country, in which he has lived an honourable, and even a distinguished life, for more than forty years. When that determination became known it was not unnatural that great public indignation should be aroused', and that a request, which had been made more than once, should be repeateda request that he should receive at least the bare measure of justice that is involved in a public trial. That request was refused. Indig nation naturally became more inflamed, and the demand was made that f u r ther inquiry should be made into this case. The Government, feeling the pressure of public opinion, and having the knowledge of the approach of a general election, were graciously pleased to send one of their own officers for the purpose of holding an inquiry in camera. No charge was then made against Father Jerger, but there appeared before Sir Robert Garran, who was detailed for this duty, learned counsel in the person of [112]I am prethe present member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) , who was refused a hearing, although he was graciously permitted to remain in the room while the inquiry was conducted. I am informed, and I know for a fact, that no evidence was adduced before this gentleman reflecting upon the character or the loyalty of the person in question. On the contrary, the whole of the evidence that was adduced went to show that he was a man of high character and unimpeachable loyalty. Notwithstanding that fact, this representative of the Government, standing in the shoes of the Government, and having the responsibility of pleasing and satisfying them, was not able; to recommend that anv . departure should be made from the expressed' determination of . the Government to send this reverend gentleman out of the country without a trial. So the Government threw out its chest and informed the general public that an' inquiry had I beg the honourable taken place, and it was not proposed to alter the decision arrived at. A movement was immediately made to invoke The matter was disthe aid of the Courts of this country,, and then began a series of probably the most discreditable acts that have ever been perpetrated by a Government in a responsible community. This reverend gentleman, who was in Sydney, and who had the right that every Britisher is assumed to have of instructing his advisers as to his defence, was denied access ""to his advisers. He was not permitted to have communication of any kind whatever with them, and when this Government knew that application was being made to the Courts, they immediately and unceremoniously packed this gentleman off and "" shanghaied "" him out of New South Wales into Victoria, for the purpose of avoiding the position which gave the Courts of New South Wales jurisdiction to deal with the case. That in itself was a most discreditable act; it was most indecent, and every man who sits behind the Government is a party to that action. Let me inform some honourable members supporting the Government that they shou'd find it exceedingly hard to satisfy their own consciences, much less their constituents, in regard to the action of their leaders in this matter.

72,Mr Brennan,"His friends knew that he had arrived here. ' They knew he was taken in a closed conveyance to the Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, and they immediately went there to see him. They were informed, if you please, by the officer in charge, that he had again been taken away in a closed vehicle to some unknown destination. I, as his solicitor, placed myself in communication with the State Commandant shuffled and sought delay, and to do him justice, seemed to be ashamed of the posiand dismissed that application. It is not tion in which he was placed. I am prepared to give the State Commandant credit for that. On the following morning we ascertained that Father Jerger had been taken to Queenscliff so hurriedly that provision had not been made for his detention there. thought that they could hide the body. We made application to a Judge of the High Court, and embarrassed the Government, who in their ignorance, were not aware that we could invoke the aid of the High Court to deal with the matter. When this matter came before the High Court, Mr Justice Starke said the matter was of grave importance, and that the person concerned, like every me. other citizen-and I ask no more for him than I would for the meanest citizen of this country-had the aid of the Court up to the last minute, as long as he was a resident in the country. What happened ? An order nisi was granted calling upon the Government to show cause the following day why a writ of capias should not be issued, and reasons given for his detention. A representative of the Government appeared, and when Mr Justice Starke suggested that this matter might go to the Full. Court, if there was not some grave public reason for its immediate determination, counsel for the Government rose and objected on the grounds, as he alleged, that there was public danger in postponing the matter any longer. It was a deliberate lie put into the mouth of learned counsel by the Government, and the Judge was deceived. What is the present position? The case was postponed again until this morning to enable the Government to state their position. The Government took the responsibility of saying that they were afraid of grave public disturbances and Mr Brennan. outbreaks if this reverend gentleman was not immediately deported. There has been no outbreak or disturbance of any kind, except that arising from the fact that the Government have flouted the laws of the country and outraged the spirit and traditions of justice that should, but which does not, exist.

However, in a quarter riot at all friendly to Labour, we seem to be very strongly supported in the view that the Government are deserving of censure. I find that practically the terms of the censure motion are contained' in an article published in an organ which nearly always, and particularly at election time, stands solid behind the National party. I quote the following from the issue of the Sun for 12th July, which, by the way, is a very significant date: To a morning paper we are indebted for a touching picture of fraternal affection between politicians. "" On .Friday, in the House of Bepresentatives, Mr Hughes and Mr Higgs were seated side by side on one of the benches, Mr Hughes having his arm round Mr Higgs' neck and whispering into his ear."" We read on, softened by this little idyll, and party who seriously believe that there are find at the bottom of the column""McGrath (Labour) Kerby (Nationalist) Mr Hughes was wooing his majority. This is what I wish especially to direct the attention of honourable members toa majority of 3,000 votes over Mr Kerby (Nationalist) ? It is not because Mr Kerby helped himself to £400 a year. Tbe salary grab played a small part in the election, for the anti-salary^ grab candidate, Mr Troup, with the aid of'the farmers' vote, polled negligibly. It is not that the woes of Ireland played any great .part, for the inhabitants of Ballarat are three-fourths Protestant, and Mr Hughes' raising of the sectarian bogy certainly did not have much effect either wayexcept that the .insincerity of this move probably disgusted a few of his own supporters in Ballarat. The reason is that the people of Ballarat, and of Victoria and of Australia, are getting very tired of the dictatorship of Mr ness to support them on this occaHughes, of his "" dominating personality,"" and his War Precautions Act, and his clumsy handling of the Watt episode, and his unpublished wool reports. There is a powerful feeling growing in Australia that it is high time the country got back to parliamentary government. Bailarat is the ""Mene Tekel"" upon the walls of the banquet hall of Bclshazzar Hughes and his Nationalist courtiers. The party has still a chance of survival; but it will not survive if it is going to constitute the applauding court of Babylon. It must bring Belshazzar to reason, and the trouble appears to be that not one man of the Cabinet has the necessary force, now that Mr Watt has been driven out. The article continuesHolmanism, which was also modelled upon tbe Belshazzar idea of personal government, rests had to be reconciled, and consewrecked the hopes of the National party in quently the Prime Minister lost no time dominated the Cabinet of this State, and drove out those who objected to his methods, so Mr Hughes is handling the Federal Ministry. No Minister can retain the confidence of the people in such a condition of subservience. It was not that the average man considered Mr Holman's team any less capable than Mr Storey's, or Mr Storey's team any more capable than Mr Holman's, or that it hopes much more from Mr MoGrath than from Mr Kerby; but it was simply that he grew tired of Mr Holman's personal touch, as he is growing tired of Mr Hughes. With the signing of peace, the need for autocracy has departed, and those Nationalist politicians who do not recognise it, or show themselves satisfied with it, are destroying their party. There may be still time to save the party. A determined attempt at economy, and at returning to a democratic ideal, in which the War Precautions Act has no place, will do more for it than the public embraces of Mr Hughes and Mr Higgs. I make this quotation merely to show that there are others besides the Labour .. 13,326 grave reasons for this censure motion. .. 10,317 "" The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) returned last night to his referendum joke, and taunted the Leader of our party with having repeated former statements made by him on the subject. I propose very briefly to refer to the principles of the referendum taken at the last general election. The Prime Minister distinctly stated that the proposed amendments of the Constitution then put before the electors were practically the same as those which the Labour party had on prior occasions submitted. The curious fact is that every force and influence that opposed those proposals when they were submitted by the Labour Government professed a readi-r sion. It is very necessary in the circumstances to ask the reason for the change of front. Honourable members opposite will admit that, when the Prime Minister first submitted to his party his proposed amendments of the Constitution, they met with a very luke-warm reception. The daily newspapers published articles which were anything but vigorous in their support of them, and the big vested interests of the country quickly began to show that they would oppose them. Something had to be done, and done quickly, to secure unity on the part of the Nationalist party. Conflicting inte-",34,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor

146,New South Wales. Just As Mr Holman,"in announcing that certain reservations were to be made. He began by addressing a meeting of the inner circle of the profiteers in this city-the who, if the referendum proposals were carried, were to be dealt with. meeting was held behind closed doors, the star-chamber tactics adopted being much like those associated with many other undertakings on the part of this Government. I dare say that soldiers in uniform were posted outside the meeting room to take care that no listening ear was at the keyhole. No sooner had the meeting been held than the Chamber of Commerce publicly announced that, having heard the Prime Minister, it had decided to support the referendum proposals of his Government, since thoy recognised that they would be circumscribed and altogether of a very restricted character. Even that, however, was not sufficient to secure unity among the Natonalists. More remained to be done, and so other reservations were made. Finally, we had the reservation, which destroyed the proposals completely, so far as we were concerned, that, even if the projected amendments of the Constitution were accepted by the people, they would lapse unless a Convention to make recommendations in regard to the Constitution as a whole was called before the end of the present year. That Convention could make recommendations which would have stultified the decision of the people, and the Prime Minister announced that, unless . it was called before the end of ,1920, the proposed amendments, even if carried by the people, would become null and void. Having regard to our experience of the Prime Minister's knowing, as we did, that he was prepared to jump from one party to another; that he would make definite statements to-day and qualify them, or almost deny them, to-morrow-we rightly said that we could not associate our3elve3 with any proposal of the kind, and that we would not support the referendum. Having regard to the desperate methods to which the Prime Minister had resorted-to the reservations and restrictions which he proposed with the object of placating members of his own party and his capitalistic supporters outside-we Mr Lazzarini. . that the people should be advised to reject the Government's proposals. very people the honourable member's party in this House, with two exceptions, voted for the The proposed amendments of the Constitution which were submitted to the people? they voted for them. That, however, has nothing to do with the question. think it has no bearing upon.the question ? very often the argument of an empty head. The reservations of which I have complained had not been made when this House was asked to vote on the Bill to amend the Constitution. Bills as passed by the Parliament were put before the people. -the reservations of which I complain had not been made, and the Prime Minister had not been touring the country for two or three weeks making conflicting statements on the subject. I propose now to deal with the questions of industrial unrest and the high cost of living. I group these two subjects, under the one heading since they must go hand in hand. While the cost of living continues to increase, and the position of the wage-earner becomes worse and worse -whil e the burdens to be borne by him become heavier and heavier every day-iu dustrial unrest must increase in volume. That cannot be denied. It is the experience of the world to-day. Prior to the phenomenal increase in the cost of living the worker was more contented, and industrial conditions were far better than they are at present. The great mass of the people, political tacticswhether they are employed in offices, in factories or in country fields, depend for their living upon the wages they earn. I care not what Mr Knibbs or any other authority may say; my own practical experience is such that it is useless to tell me that the cost of living has increased by only 60 per cent., and that wages at the same time have increased to the extent of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent. If wages have increased to the extent of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent-and we can measure the exact increase in wages-the cost of living has gone up by nearly 200 per cent.

While that state of affairs prevails, and the Government do nothing to alter it , we must expect to have industrial unrest. In such circumstances the industrial upheaval w ill go on and on u n t i l finally it bursts forth into the inevitable revolution. As I have said before in this House, even a worm on the ground, when hungry, will fight. W ill a man do less ? The Government may go on until Doomsday creating Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. I have nothing to say against such tribunals, but while the Government allow them to determine the rates of wages to be paid, and at the same time permit the capitalistic class and the profiteers to go on raising the cost of living', such lop-sided economics must necessarily result in unrest and discontent, and I am afraid that they w ill result eventually in revolution in this and every other country. I am not going to enter into a controversy to-day regarding the power of the Commonwealth Government to deal with profiteering. I have given much study to the problem, and followed the controversy relating to it long before I entered this House. I am not a lawyer, and am not going to give a legal opinion "" off my own bat,"" but I have heard many opinions on the subject. The Prime -Minister says, in effect, "" It is useless to talk about this matter. we have no power to deal with profiteering. I have spoken, and that is an end to the question."" On any question of law, I would sooner have one opinion from the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) than 5,000 from the Prime Minister. West Sydney claims that the Parliament can deal with profiteering, and unti l his opinion is proved to be wrong I shall accept it . Having regard to their respective records as lawyers, I prefer the opinion of the honourable member to that of the Prime Minister. This Government has failed, and failed miserably,, to deal with the problems of industrial unrest and the high cost of living. If they fail to deal with one they fai l to deal with both, since the two must go hand in hand. If the Government make no attempt to discover the bed-rock causes-if they are content to deal only with effects and to go on talking about Arbitration Courtsthe whole matter w ill ultimately betaken [15.

Government how to deal with profiteering. If they will only bring down the cost of living and leave wages where they are we shall have the workers as contented as they were before the war. The honourable member for West Sydney has a reputation as a constitutional lawyer, and I accept his opinion as to the powers of the Government in preference to that of the Prime Minister, whose only reputation as a lawyer is one of failure in respect of practically every legal opinion given by him. Another matter with which I propose to deal is the failure of tlie Government to carry out its pledge to our returned soldiers. I believe that, with the exception of a very few cases, the Government have failed dismally to f u l f i l their promises to the returned soldiers, and they have failed equally in their treatment of the repatriation problem from beginning to end. I shall give ope or two cases. My opinion is based upon them, and hundreds more like them that I could produce. The Repatriation Department extended the privilege to returned men of receiving, after they were discharged, a £ 1 0 allowance for tools of I tell you that trade, in order to enable them to make a start in their old avocations. Much of this sort of arrangement was done by regulation, and not much publicity was given to it . It was not like an Act of Parliament, such as the W a r Gratuity Act which was debated here for The honourable member for a week, the speeches being reported in the newspapers. These regulations, I understand, are part and parcel of the machinery of administration, and hence a large number of returned men never knew that the £ 1 0 allowance was available. I had a letter from two men yesterday, stating that when they found they were entitled to the allowance for tools, they applied for it ; but the Minister for Repatriation in formed them that he had made a regulation requiring them to apply within six months of their discharge, and that, as they had not applied within that time, they had forfeited their claim. To me, that sort pf thins; is an absolute scandal. When the regulation was made granting",37,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor
153,Mr Lazzarini,"We have told thethe £ 1 0 allowance, every man who went, away to fight for his country was entitled to that allowance, amongst other things: I care not whether he was discharged two months or two years before he applied for it. If he was entitled to it six months ago, he is entitled to it to-day. A number of returned men did not apply for it , simply through ignorance. of them came back, they were not in good health, even if they were not wounded, and they wanted a rest. stayed for varying periods with different relatives, and the six months slipped by before they actually went back to work. Surely they were entitled to six months' hoiiday after what they went through; but the Repatriation Department has deliberately turned down these cases, one after the other, while those who were "" in the know "" drew the £ 1 0 allowance. As regards war pensions, I have received a letter from Mrs. Pearce, of Yass-street, Young, who tells me that her son was reported missing ih August, 1915, and payment of her military ceased on the 5th Through ignorance of the pension provisions, and thinking that her son might still turn up, she did not apply for a pension until the 16th October, and it was granted from that date. was afterwards told that she ought to have received the pension from the day the military allowance stopped, and of course she would have done so had she applied for it at once. Still, members can imagine the mother hoping and praying that the son who was reported lost would turn up. apply for the pension until later, and she was then told by the Pensions that as an act of grace they would give her six months of the back pay, and she got no more. Fancy the mother of an Australian, grace, of should have been held to be entitled for at least eighteen months! patriation Department, authorities, ought to pay the full pension to woman, and to every other woman similarly situated. That is the way some of the war expenditure, obligations for past services, are being their own wheat? evaded. tion is being used to turn these cases Mr Lazzarini. down, in the hope, I suppose, that a little more money w ill be available for the manufacture of guns and military equipment' for some f u t u r e war, in which others may be maimed and knocked out, and afterwards treated as many people are being treated to-day. A similar policy, for which the Government aTe When some wholly and solely responsible, is being pursued with regard to the old-age and invalid pensions. These should be Many of them liberalized. I come now to the burning question with the Corner party-the position of the farmers. The honourable member for the farmers never received any consideration from this side of the House, and not much from the other side. I agree w i th him that they never got much from the Ministerial side, although they have supported that side for a very long time; but the farmers of Werriwa are quite satisfied that I represent them just as well and effectively as the honourable allowance member for Franklin or any other memJanuary, 1916. ber who sits in the Ministerial Corner, and that I understand their conditions and the disadvantages under which they labour just as well as any member of the 1919.

155,The Machinery Of Administra,"Mr LAZZARI 1 TL I do not knownot many small farmers who have any wheat, or any wheat scrip. The big farmers, and some of those wealthy men who sit with the Country party, may have hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of wheat scrip, for all I know; but the share fanner, and the small farmer, does not hold much of it, and is getting no benefit from any rise or profit that is being made out of it. The farmers of New South Wales, and, in fact, of the whole of Australia, are not opposed to an embargo on the export of wheat at the present moment, while the Government fail to make a statement to prove that we have sufficient wheat left here. I have touched previously on the position of the primary producer. We have had a very serious drought, and I believe there is a scheme in progress to-day which will prove a great blessing in conserving water; but in the last two months sufficient water has fallen in the Commonwealth to have justified vigorous efforts at conservation. What was wanted was a Government big and bold enough to take on big undertakings while the drought was on. It is of no use to start to dam the waters now that they have rolled away to the ocean. If the present Government had been bold enough to undertake big construction works for the benefit of the primary producers, I could understand the primary producers sticking to them when a motion of censure was being moved upon them. would not have opposed such a policy. done on the Murray. how long has it taken ? The Murray does not represent the whole of Australia. I want that work on the Murray to continue, but little weirs could be dotted throughout every State in the Commonwealth, at not too much expense, and water conserved everywhere, instead of in one particular area. the State Governments could do that? vernments may be able'to do something, but these are undertakings which in their nature are far better controlled by a vernment built the silos.

We know the conditions of the primary producers to-day. The position of the smaller men on the land, while they have to go on as they do to-day, is in many cases a greater gamble than that of a man who frequents the racecourse. The Government must spend whatever is necessary, and shoulder the responsibility of insuring the priI , for one, mary producers of this country against that speculative feature which is'always associated with their industry, before the land can be made attractive to the people.

Honourable members are well aware of the usual fate of the primary producer. In good seasons he produces in abundance. Although he gets for his produce the market rate, that rate is much lower than the prices which rule in times such as the period of drought through which we have just passed. have no objection to the surplus above local requirements being shipped abroad, but we should always retain in the country a supply sufficient for two years. That undertaking could be financed through the Commonwealth Bank. The farmer could be paid the market rate for his product, and if there were a succession of two or three good seasons the store-houses could be emptied by export, and refilled with the new season's produce. life itself. fell? very little difference. I am not urging that the Commonwealth should speculate or endeavour to make money out of this undertaking. vision of store-houses to conserve the primary produce; those store-houses could be filled in normal times at normal rates and then when the periodical droughts came-for we must regard Australia as a country subject to periodical droughts -the farmer might be able to get his supplies from the store-houses at the same price as he received for his produce instead of having to pay famine prices. If the Government would undertake such a scheme we would not then have the spectacle of a limited circle of financiers was qualified by the reverend srentleman. and capitalists making millions of pounds at the expense of the farmer while he was being crucified by the drought in the interior, as they did during the last and every other drought. In regard to the sectarian outburst in which the Prime Minister indulged yesterday, it seems to me that, as was said by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), the right honourable gentleman already feels the political death-rattle in his throat, and like every politician in a similar predicament he grabs at sectarianism in order to try to save himself and his Government from The wheat would not have been destruction. The right honourable gentleman said a lot about the Sinn Fein element and its association with the Labour party. Nobody but a stupid schoolboy would swallow the statements made about a certain gentleman being the . real leader of the Labour party. There, was a time when the Prime Minister held a different view of the Irish people, of whom he now speaks as Sinn Feiners, disruptionists, and fomenters of I rebellion. In a book containing the war speeches delivered in England by the Prime Minister, I find the following passage in a speech before the Pilgrims at the Savoy Hotel, London, on 17th March, 1916, Viscount Bryce presidingAnd here, on St. Patrick's Day, let us pay a tribute to the loyalty of the Irish people and the valour of the Irish troops. AndI , as an Australian, pay tribute to those thousands of ycung Irish-Australians in the Australian Forces, who have put the cause of liberty above It did not suit the Prime. Minister in those days to condemn the Irish people, and so he repeated sentiments which he had expressed in this country during the greater part of his political career. The right honourable gentleman travelled I merely urge the prothroughout this Commonwealth accusing. Dr. Mannix of disloyalty to this country. Those who know the right honourable gentleman well are aware that he does nothing without a motive. What is the reason for this sudden outburst? Is it to whip up some discordant elements in his own party or is it to save his skin from this vote of censure by appealing to some honourable members in the House to whom sectarianism appeals? He stated that Dr. Mannix had condemned the war. as a sordid trade war. That statement Buti f he were disloyal for having said such a thing, in what respect does he differ from the Prime Minister, who earlier stated in England that the war was being waged for the economic domination of the world? If a war for that purpose was not a trade war, I do not know what the word "" economic "" means. We were subjected to these same veiled attacks and innuendos and insinuations during the last election campaign. I believe that the flame of sectarianism is being deliberately fanned to conserve the interests of the capitalistic class, which the Government represent. It has",40,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor
171,Mr Austin Chapman,If the price,41,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor
172,Mr Lazzarini,"That would makeever been used for that purpose. Sectarianism is as old as the world. I read a story of the life of Napoleon, in which it was stated that in order to popularize the war against Napoleon, the people of England was told that he was in league with the Pope for the purpose of restoring Roman Catholicism in England, whilst at the same time the people of Ireland were told that Napoleon had entered the Vatican and dragged the Pope about by the hair. In following this path, the Prime Minister is treading upon dangerous ground, as his own knowledge of politics in this country ought to tell him. To me it is sad indeed that, at a time when we are suffering all the aftermath of the terrible world conflagration and when we are troubled in every department of our national life with problems arising out of the conflict, the man who is leading the Nationalist Government, and who' should be employing all his intelligence and ability in the great work of restoring this young nation to something like its pre-war strength, is engaged instead in appealing to the vilest passions of the mob'. He is using his high and proud position to inculcate in the hearts of the people passions that will only further disturb -and disrupt our national life. He is degrading his position, and the only consolation to be found in his action is that ho is sounding his own death knell. Other men who opened their public life with every promise of brilliant careers, and to whom the people looked confidently for leadership in big things, have failed because owing to mistaken judgment or in order to safeguard their public positions, they indulged in vile sectarianism; they even took the great God out of Heaven and dragged him through the gutters of political filth. In this way they degraded every fine instinct of our race. Any man, I care not whether he be a Roman Catholic or a Protestant, who appeals .to the religious passions and prejudices of the people in order to retain a political position, is not fit to continue in public life. I do not know how elections are usually won, but if the honourable member for ""Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) makes the charges in the country which he has made here this afternoon, I can quite understand how country districts sometimes get representation of a certain kind in the House. When the honourable member charges the Government with failure in their administration, because they have not erected weirs across rivers and undertaken wholesale water conservation, he either does not understand the Constitution or is deliberately making an unfair attack upon the Government. It has been said that a vote cast against the motion must be interpreted as an indication of absolute confidence-in the Government. I entirely dissent from that view; further, I think it would be exceedingly difficult for any honourable member who desires to promote and build up the primary industries to vote for honourable members opposite, after the speeches to which we listened last night. judge a party's programme by the statements of individuals. statements, but by the remarks of the leader of the party, in this case. The first item on which we are asked to express by our votes our opinion of the present Administration is in regard to its alleged failure to prevent the inordinate rise in the cost of living. If honourable members opposite had been in control of the Treasury benches, what action would they have taken? vented exports, up to a certain stage. gotten that a Labour Administration was f:over:iing this country for some two years after the war began. It had every opportunity to take whatever action it saw fit to prevent the rise in the cost of living, which was even then beginning to show itself alarmingly. Those Labour mem-' bers, and their Government, had their' opportunities when they were ih power. They should now explain what they did, or sought to do, and what efforts they have since made, by way of suggestion to the present Administration, to overcome the rapidly soaring cost of living. I have heard little from honourable members opposite in that respect, and I certainly saw and heard nothing while a Labour Administration controlled the Commonwealth Treasury.

There has been an enormous reduction in the area tilled; and, even at present prices, the circumstances of the farmer are far from happy. from an official source that the actual cost duce the price from 5s. 2d. to 4s. 9d. of wheat production in the United States last year totalled'no less than 8s. l i d . per bushel. acres sown in New South Wales last year produced absolutely nothing. that reminder. But when we find that honourable members opposite are prepared to place an embargo on the export of wheat until the people of the community have been supplied, according to the ideas of the Labour party, we are bound to hold grave suspicions of Labour's policy. only hold until the requirements of Australia. Had been provided for. ber, in the course of the present debate, stated that the increase in the cost, of sugar to the Australian consumer was due to the export of huge supplies of jam and canned fruit. If an embargo were to be placed upon ihe export of jams and canned fruits, what would happen to the Australian orchardist? I would have liked the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) to state last night, when referring to the increased price of bread, what action he would have taken had he been a member of the Government to-day? Just as the Administration to which he was attached in the early stages of the war acted in those days, so would a Labour Administration act again to-day. In the preamble of the measure which passed through the Victorian Parliament at the initiation of the -Wheat Pool it was set out that, with the approval of the Prime Minister and of the four Ministers of the wheat-produc-ing States concerned, the price to be paid for wheat in Australia would be equal to tbe London, parity. wharf lumpers went on strike, and refused to load ships with our wheat, when the London parity was 5s. 2d. What did tbe Labour Government do at that stage? It reduced the price to. the Australian farmer to 4s. 9d. per bushel, on account of the wharf lumpers' clamour. vernment in power at that time. take concerning which party was in power, and I know that the deputation I have learned which persuaded the Government to rewaited upon the then Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), who was Acting Prime Minister. member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) was Minister for Customs. although the honourable member had nothing to do with the point which I am now stressing. The honourable member for Yarra referred also last night to the price of butter; and in that regard, again, we find that when he was Minister he placed an embargo upon the export of that commodity. considerable reduction of production in Australia. Owing to the serious droughts experienced during the past few years, our dairy farmers have been obliged to buy fodder at almost famine prices I have in mind, in connection with an earlier drought, the case of a woman in the Mnrchison district of Victoria. She had a herd of from thirty-soven to forty cows, and had to pay £12 10s. per ton for fodder. Then when rain fell and grass came, she lost nearly one-half of her herd in a few weeks. These are some of the privations which our dairy farmers have had to put up with. We all know that the high cost of fodder at the present time makes it extremely difficult for many of them to carry on. And there is no eight hours' system on a dairy farm. In view of alT these difficulties, surely it is reasonable that our dairy farmers should get world's parity for their products.

209,Mr Gregory,"It is my policy atany embargo upon the marketing of the products of the people. The Leader of the Opposition dealt extensively with the high cost of meat. We all know that this is due to losses. In New South Wales during the past few months stock-owners have been obliged to pay heavy prices for fodder for starving stock, and ""then recently, as the result of very heavy rains, serious floods have caused tremendous losses. The Leader of the Opposition spoke also of the consumption of frozen meat. It is useless on his part to refer to the extent of our export trade. A few moments ago I looked up some figures in Knibbs, to see what our export of meat really amounted to. I found that in 1914-15 we exported meat to the value of £3,413,000; in 1915-16, to the value of £769,000; in 1916-17, £1,540,000; and in 1917-18, £452,000. In the Melbourne Age of to-day there appears a statement that in Victoria, from 3rd June up to the end of last week, 17,700 carcasses had. been taken out of cold storage for consumption in the city of Melbourne. I am not concerned with the price charged by the retailer. That is a matter for the State Government; but I remind honourable members that frozen mutton was supplied to butchers at 5&d. per lb. plus £d. for storage charges, or a total of about 5|d. ting 100 per cent, profit. matter for the State, and not the Commonwealth Government. Although prices are at a high level in Australia, we must not forget that elsewhere' in the world living conditions are not nearly so favorable. RecentlyI had a letter from a friend in the United States of America stating that prices there were extraordinarily high. Mutton was about 3s. 8d. per lb., ,beef 4s. per lb., and potatoes ever so much dearer than in Australia. Altogether, according to this letter, conditions in America were quite abnormal, the cost of living being more than double that in Australia. I am not giving the Commonwealth Government any credit for this. drought the cost of living ih Australia would have been very much less than it is to-day. But we have to realize the difficult conditions under which our pastoralists and fanners have been working in recent years. These are the causes of present high prices, though in comparison with people in any other country in the world we have no reason to complain. In connection with this motion I would like to know what members of the Opposition would have done had they been in power. pared to accept office if the Labour party stood behind you? whether the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) thinks I came into the House yesterday or the day before, and do not realize what the Constitution demands. How could the party of which I am a member form a Government? The suggestion is preposterous. What position would we, or the Opposition, occupy in another Chamber? solid support of the Opposition if we formed an Administration? first. member will tell us what he would do, it might make things a little bit easier. But, after all, our first duty is to try to build .up Australia. We are all proud of this country, and our natural desire must be to see it develop. This can only be achieved by giving every encouragement to our primary producers. Take the butter industry as an example. Those acquainted with the history of Victoria know how the valuable assistance rendered by the State Government enabled the agricultural areas to be prosperously settled. Australia is not, and never will be, a great wheat-growing country, but satisfactory progress may be expected by mixed farming; a combination of grazing, wheat-growing, butter production, and kindred industries. The value of our exports proves conclusively that our progressdepends upon our primary indusI believe that but for the tries. In 1861, our exports totalled in value £17,000,000; in 1881, £27,000,000; in 1891, £36,000,000; in 1901, £49,000,000.

When we are living in tragic times it behoves every member to be exceedingly careful, and to endeavour to protect the best interests of the country. We can always easily find trouble if we look for it ; it is dangerous to look round to see if we can find some way of causing friction between Australia and another Power. scheme for our returned soldiers has cost millions, and w ill cost many more, in view of the wonderfully generous proposals for homes and so for t h. As to the gratuity, I agree with the Prime Minister, that there would have been created something in the nature of a financial panic if it had been paid in. cash.

There has been gross extravagance in the past, starting in about 1910, and continuing ever since; and every effort must be made to stop it . This Government, this motion we are not expressing confihowever, only follows on the lines of the dence in the Government, but merely showprevious Government. guilty! extravagance at the present time, but our financial position is being greatly aggravated by the industrial unrest. For this I do not wholly blame either the workers or the Government; but, unfortunately, by this unrest the country has lost millions and millions of money. In New Zealand, Canada, and SouthA f r i c a , on the other hand, we find a fine financial position, and I am afraid that here we have missed wonderful opportunities. It is, of course, easy to be wise after the event, but I believe something might have been done by the Government to mitigate the conditions which have arisen. I cannot, as I say, wholly blame the workers for becoming dissatisfied, in view of the high cost of living and the troubles attendant on appeals to the Arbitration Court. But is there a single instance of a strike where members opposite have urged the men to go back to work and comply w it h the laws of the country ? want justice. we get if honourable members opposite were placed in power? Every member of the community must comply w it h the law. However, the land settlement We surely do not desire that laws should be observed by one section and not by another. As I said before, it is easy to be wise after the event, but I believe that much loss and trouble might have been saved if , when the cost of living was found to be increasing, the Government had appointed a Board composed of the Government Stawhy did the tistician and a couple of other experienced men.

That is a matter for considerat i o n ; but if some suggestion of the kind had been carried out, I believe that much industrial unrest would have, been prevented. On the other hand, I think we are quite justified in condemning honourable members opposite for not using their influence to prevent much of this unrest.

I have no desire to indulge in any uriniming, but merely to tell the Government straight out what my 'opinions are. refer the Acting Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to a book he published many years ago entitled An Or git of Extravagance, -showing the extravagant expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth Government; and certainly since 1910 there has been a continual drift.

If taxation goes above a certain level, people from the Ministry should have been perwith money are driven out of the country. be much better off in the way of taxation ? ber must admit that the taxation here is fairly well up to the limit, and now en large estates amounts to something like 15s. in the £ 1 , taking Commonwealth, State, and municipal taxation together; indeed, we are getting to that stage beyond which it would be exceedingly dangerous to go.

If , on the other hand, somebody is to be pitchforked into the position at the last moment, he will be able to give us only tbe information which the Treasury officials choose to give him, so that we shall then occupy much the same position as we have occupied hitherto. The sooner that the office of Treasurer is filled, the better it will be for all concerned, because we are justified in demanding-particularly in view of the speeches made by tie Acting Treasurer-the fullest information as to what our financial obligations really are, and how they are to be met.

271,Mr Gregory,"Of course, and I-which a compromise will have to be effected with the various States, Before the war. we should have been quite justified in proceeding with the work of unifying the railway gauges of the Commonwealth. But, to-day we are not. In view of the enormous sums which we have expended in connection with the war, and with the knowledge that we were unable to pay our soldiers a war gratuity in cash, and that the Government are 'not prepared to advance further moneys for soldier settlement in Australia, wa are not justified in proceeding with that particular work. I am given to understand that the Government have actually stopped making advances for the purchase of single blocks of land for repatriation purposes. cause a good deal of embarrassment to many of our returned soldiers. ""When we come to pay £3,500 for an isolated block of land, it is quite time that a halt was called. could impose a limit upon the amount of these advances. There, are returned soldiers who have gone through vocational training, and who have been waiting for .months-in some cases for more jthan a year-to get settled upon the land. These men. are now. told that the Commonwealth has stopped making advances for soldier settlement. orable member that we are not discontinuing the advances, but we are going to review the whole question. These blocks are costing too much. action is being taken under section 20 of the Act. cost of soldier settlement blocks runs into £2,500-as it does in some of the States -it is time to call a halt. settlement scheme was started, a very . grave mistake was made in failing to fix a maximum average price in the different States. A t the present time, the average cost is very high in some of the States, whilst in others it is very low; and yet both are placing on the land an equal number of soldiers. I trust that the Government will make every endeavour to redeem their obligations to our returned soldiers. Mr J. H .

A grievance I have against the Government is their failure to arrange for a uniform system of taxation which would effect an enormous saving in administration and to the public. Moreover, I want taxation of incomes on the basis of a five years average, which will be much more equitable than our present system. Another matter which ought to be dealt with by this Parliament is the Defence policy of the Government. Enormous sums are being expended at the present time for the housing of war material that is coming from the Old Country, and certain large works are being held, in abeyance. Upon page 91 of the report of the Economies Commission, it is pointed out that if we allow matters connected with naval, military, and air-craft work to remain in abeyance for the next three years, a saving of £5,250,000 can be",48,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor

284,Mr Gregory,"I do not give anyeffected. That is a very large item.' We ought, as speedily, as possible, to arrive at a determination as to what the future policy of the Commonwealth is going to 'be in regard to military matters. We should not incur any further expenditure until that policy has been actually determined. Recently, I drew attention to the proposed expenditure of £80,000 on Arsenal Research Department buildings at Maribyrnong, which, I understand, when completed, will involve an expenditure of approximately £700,000. If the project is commenced, additions will have to be made, and authority should not be given for the work to be undertaken until this House is in possession of the whole of the details. Honourable members have been waiting for some time to hear some pronouncement concerning our future Defence policy. Now the war is over and conditions are becoming normal, surely it is time to call a halt in the matter of Defence expenditure, particularly in view of the present international outlook and the apparent absence of immediate danger. After making certain necessary provision, I would be inclined to favour a go-slow policy in matters of Defence. I am not in possession of all the facts, and I do not know what scheme the Government intend placing before us; but I think it is their duty to submit their Defence policy before we are called upon to deal with the Estimates. I wish to refer, very briefly, to a matter which I know will be of considerable interest to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman). I do not think the time is opportune to seriously consider the expenditure of a large sum in connection with the establishment of a Federal Capital. orable member think that is a proper statement to be made by an impartial chairman of the Public Works Committee, to which body some suggest the question should be submitted? deal with that question in the same way as I am dealing with the breakof-gauge problem, and to admit that, although it may be essential for the Government to carry out the work at some future date, the present time is inopportune to incur such expenditure, particularly when we have such grave financial obligations to meet. In connection with Defence, a uniform gauge, and the building of the Federal Capital, it is time to go slow in an endeavour to meet our obligations. I do not want the time to come when we will be forced to consider repudiation and proclaim the country bankrupt. It is not my intention to delay the House any longer at this juncture, as I have already made my position clear in Tegard to this matter. In voting, as I intend to, against the motion, I am not necessarily expressing my confidence in the present Administration. I wish the Government to know that, if any further embargoes are placed upon the export of our primary products, they are not likely to have my support.' The only exception would be in the event of a shortage of wheat in Australia, in which case the Government would be justified in refusing to sanction exports until our own people were supplied. It would have to be understood, however, that in the event of such a contingency arising, the wheat-growers would receive the 'world's parity for their produce. Any action taken by the Government to prevent producers obtaining the world's parity for their produce will have my strongest opposition, irrespective of consequences. I desire also to emphasize the necessity for returning to constitutional government, instead of adhering to the practice whereby Ministers of the Crown have been able to dictate the policy of the country without consulting Parliament. . Recently we had the astounding suggestion that the Government should utilize £10,000,000 of the profits derived from the producers' wool. If money is required it should be raised in a constitutional manner, and if it is not forthcoming voluntarily compulsion should be adopted. It is not fair that any one section of the community should be made to subscribe a large Sum to our loans; everybody should contribute a fair proportion. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has not submitted a strong case in moving his motion, and on this occasion it is my intention to support the Government.

286,Mr Gregory,"I am .prepared tointend to vote for the motion, a statement which I think needs no explanation from me. For many years-eve r since the Watson Government was in powerI have fought the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). I have never trusted him since that time, and even if to vote against him would consign me to political oblivion, I could not see my way to keep him at the head of an Administration. I intend to address most of my remarks to-night to the subject of political economy. A t the outset I wish to say that I shall welcome the appointment of a new Treasurer. The other day in the street I was asked, concerning the telegrams between Mr Hughes and Mr tal of New South Wales. Watt, which were being published in the newspapers, "" W h o was the l i a r ? "" My reply was, "" Both are splendid prevaricators, true descendants of Ananias."" For deception I would back the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) against any man I ever met, read of, or thought of ; hut whatever he may do, not even his most in veterate enemy-and I have been that since the days of the Watson Government w ill deny that he possesses a quality that Mr .Watt never possessed, namely, courage. Could any man in this House imagine Mr Hughes deserting his country in her hour of need, as MrW a t t did, when far away on a mission -where no man could for the time being fill his place? I do not care what the quarrel might have been; MrW a t t when in England was like a soldier with a duty to perform, and he betrayed his country, and was u n f a it h f ul in the great mission he was sent to f u l f i l . I have memories of him crowing like a cock on a dunghill when he -beat Mr Prendergast at North Melbourne, and dergast beat him. So much for that gentleman, who, to use his own words, went "" in to the v o i d . "" That may be the entrance to Hades, for all I know. My leader has gone so f u l ly into figures, which no honest man, if he checked them, could contradict, that I shall not have much to say regarding the cost of living. A t least while the war was on, and they could use the War Precautions Act, this Ministry could have done anything they thought proper to prevent the cost of living from rising. owners of property should be prevented I from unjustly raising their rents, but I was always met wi.th camouflage or subterfuge. My charge against the Prime Minister and his Government is that they never raised a finger to help those unfortunates who were badly treated by the landlords. The Prime Minister could find £2,500,000 to spend on ships, without asking the permission of this Parliament, and could have found another £1,000,000 if he had needed it . We have had it from the lips of MrW a t t that the Cabinet was consulted, but honourable members know my opinion of his statements. I do not believe that one. Rents at the present time are an infamy, not only in this huge city, but also in the larger capiHonorable members, if they go into the slum districts, can see for themselves the conditions that obtain there. Herei n Melbourne, in a street 9 feet wide, there are houses which would be condemned if they belonged to private land-owners, but because they belong to the gilded aldermen or councillors of the citv of Melbourne, they are allowed to"" remain. There are four two-storied buildings with only one latrine for the whole of them. All the families in those houses have to use it . When the Board of Health does, move, and the council has a building pulled down, it does nothing for the 1 housing of the unfortunates who are dispossessed. I am out against landlords unless controlled. That is why I object to the inaction of this Government. My experience is that Governments do not sufficiently study the health and welfare of the human beings who elect members to Parliament. The prices of food have gone up and up. There are transfers from Mr MerchantA to Mr Merchant. B . and then to Mr Merchant C, each of whom wants his little b it ; and thus the public has to pay more and more. Why do not we follow the example set in older countries during the war, where they were forced to fix the prices of foods. The farmer should be allowed a fair price for his wheat delivered at the railway station, and a fair allowance should be made for the gristing of the flour at the mill. Tbe flour should be sold ""at a fixed price, and millers who would not sell to I repeatedly asked that the bakers at that price-and that occurred 1 in Melbourne-shoul d be sent 'to gaol.",50,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor

288,Weeping Like A Lost Child When Mr Pren,"Flour has been refused to honest bakers in Melbourne -who wished to sell bread over the counter at a fair price, and the law could not compel the millers, to sell to them. The incident makes one think of that mayor of Paris who said, "" Let the people eat grass,"" and was hanged from a lamp-post with grass stuck in his mouth. The price of bread' sold over the counter should also be fixed. In this connection, let me quote what was said by my beloved friend, the Leader of His Majesty's Opposition in the Victorian Parliament, in a speech delivered in the Legislative Assembly on the 12th November last. Bread was cheaper then than it is now. He saidThe remarkable thing is that, while the public are paying from 7d. to 8$&. per loaf for bread, the bakers can accept contracts for the delivery of bread to Government asylums and other institutions at 5£d. and 5Jd. per loaf, and , they make a profit at the latter prices. Lei the baker charge what he can get for the bread that he delivers, but let the Government fix the price of bread sold over the counter. Jonathan Hutchinson, one of the greatest surgeons that England ever had, and one of the greatest European surgeons that lived into this century, advocated in the late nineties the nationalization of bread in England, so that every individual could receive his or her quota. The best surgeon in his specialty in London was man enough to advance that theory. As for the price of clothing, was it not stated in the other House, and did not the information come out in a mitigated form in sworn evidence, that cloth manufactured in certain factories ""walked into the warehouses, turned right round and walked straight out again,"" to use the words of a song, its price being doubled and trebled in the process t Tweed made in Australia is sold as European tweed. Honourable members have heard of the warehouseman, Mr Williamson. He is a mostcharming gentleman to meet, and I should be very pleased to go a journey with him. StillI think I am not doing him any injustice when I say that he tried to trip me. From Allen's, or somewhere else, they came up with a letter from a country resident. Luckily they forgot themselves. There are such things as looking-glasses, and it is possible sometimes for a man to see what is happening behind him. That did not happen in my case, but I learned sufficient to know that something was afoot, and I did not accept an invitation to examine certain books. Then Mr Williamson and I had some correspondence. I stated that the Rev. Mr Cox, a relative of the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Watt), had made certain statements at Geelong. MT. Williamson said that Mr Cox had repudiated that, and asked me to withdraw. I am never afraid to withdraw any statement. I make if it is shown that it is not true. I asked Mr Williamson to let me know what Mr Cox really did say, because I had the excerpt from the papers before me. I said that if the statement made in his letter was in accord with my notes, I should be prepared to explain the matter at my next meeting. Mr Williamson sent me Mr Cox's letter, and to my astonishment that letter confirmed my statement. It contained no repudiation of that statement. Honourable memibeTS may have read of the wonderful challenge to contribute £50 to the hospital if I did soand-so. I think so much of hospitals that I am always willing, when I can, to secure such a donation as that for them. My answer was that Mr Williamson, the chairman of the warehousemen of Melbourne, had challenged me in a certain way. I have had some correspondence with the gentleman which was not satisfactory, and unless he made a statutory declaration that the statements in his letter were true I should take no further notice of him. I said it was an easy matter, to offer a challenge in connection with something which involved the inspection of accounts by a keen accountant. By that time evidence had been given before the State Fair Profits Commission, and Mr Williamson did not care to say that his statements were true, They were not true, and he knows it well. I charge him here to-night, as I have done on a publicplatform, to swear an affidavit, and then I shall know what to do. Flinders-lane has been an absolute curse to the ANZAC tweed industry. I am at present wearing a suit of tweed made by some of those brave boys who have been to the Front. They have never had a dog's show. The Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Eyrie), in his rough but good-tempered way, told some of those under him that they were never to "" sell him' a pup "" ; but I may in f o rm the honourable gentleman that be was given a "" pup "" that was absolutely bloated with rottenness when he was supplied w it h the report of the Committee that dealt with the subject. Three of these men have denied the statements of the Committee. Sergeant Sinclair, a man who fought in the South African war, and offered his services in the last great war, was elbowed out of tbe ANZAC tweed business because he stood up to a Minister and told Senator Millen that h'e was wrong. He refused to put any rubbish into the cloth, on the ground that if he did so, no man who had any of it made up into a suit would call for more. I exhibited the yarn here, and I showed it to Senator Millen, in the presence,, thank goodness, of another member of Parliament. should not be done. members want to know the end of it , let them ask Buckley and N u n n where it was sent. Sinclair is starting a private to-day, and I hope that honourable bers who have a little money to spare will take shares in it. He has done what this mighty Government said they could not do. They said they could not give more than 500 lbs of yarn per week to the returned soldiers. If the Government had given the returned from, the first, I do not hesitate to say there would to-day be a thousand men in Melbourne earning from £5 to £7 per week. are. earning in Glasgow and from £4 10s. to £6 10s. per week. Senator Millen, with a superior air, acquired, no doubt, in Flinders-lane, was not a future for hand-woven What is the answer to the senator ? It is that Burbury, the greatest maker of overcoats in the world, entered into a ten years' contract to take all the cloth they make. honourable members to go down and see these men' working. machines, a contract for twenty has been offered for £15 each. luck. I know that he is an honest man. He stood up against this Government, and against Senators Pearce and Millen when they used their vilest influence, and when in order to get him out of the business they had to resort to the contemptible Dr. Maloney. camouflage that no one must be employed in the ANZAC' tweed industry unless he was a returned soldier of the recent war. The man to whom I refer had actually created the industry. Senator Millen was foolish enough to write to the press that there were no injured men employed there. As a matter of fact, at one time every man employed in the industry was an injured man, and the Minister for Repatriation had only to visit the factory to be aware of that. I ask those who come from the other side of the Murray to see for themselves how the ANZACs are being treated in that splendid factory in Sydney, where they manufacture not only woollens, but the very best of worsteds. They are under the Red Cross authorities, and not under the vile Defence Department. They have been given fair play from the very first, He said it and are now employing about 35 men. Andi f honourable They haye contracts for all that they can produce for the next two years. That is another answer to the statement made by Senator Millen which I can hardly find words to condemn. Honourable members company can get the address of this factory from mema telephone book, and if they visit it they will see how happy these men look, and they can inspect the splendid material they are making. Their ""blueys"" might be sold as the very finest ever manufactured in the West of England. The warehousemen of Flinders-lane know what I men a chance mean by ""blueys."" The ""nigger browns"" and ""nigger blacks"" turned out at this factory are magnificent, and I emphasize the fact that it has had no assistance from Men engaged in similar business the present Federal Government. I wish Aberdeen the men engaged in the industry all success. They are assured of a plentiful supply of yarn from private companies. said that there Mr Sinclair has been able to get yarn tweed. from private companies, and has entered honourable into a contract, although the Government said they could not supply more than 500 has lbs. per week.

290,Dr. Mat.oney,"S o much for rents,made in connection with sales of bran. I desire to thank Sir James McCay, Mr Charles Gray4 and MrH u t chinson for the work they are doing. Thev are doing splendid work, but not all they might do if they were invested with more power. They have to report to the State Government, and State Governments, like this created thing we call a Parliament, once elected, can delay and continue to delay. The people who are our creators for one day in three years have, after our election, no more power over us. When an election comes on, as one did on last Saturday, there is some little turmoil and upheaval. I find that some £453 overcharged in connection with sales of bran has been refunded. If these charges were unjustly made, why are not those who made them' in gaol ? the best place for them. I quoted on a previous occasion a translation which will be found buried in Hansard somewhere, of a section of the criminal part of the Code Napoleon. That almost superman formulated his Codei n 1812, and he seems to' have foreseen the course which would be followed by the money spinners of the present time, because he provided in his Code that if any man or body of men conspired to secure the unjust raising of prices, the punishment should be 20,000 francs and six months' imprisonment. Not ""fine or imprisonment,"" but ""fine and imprisonment."" If the offence was the raising of the prices of food, such-as wheat, flour, wine, which in Prance is regarded as a food, and other articles of food, the punishment was doubled at 40,000 francs and twelve months' imprisonment. The imprisonment of one of these firms,would -be more effective than the imposition of any fine. It may interest honourable members to know the character of the fines that are imposed here. I have a list of some which I quote from a return to 30th December, 1918, in continuation of a previous return showing separately the fines imposed. I find that under the Dairy Supervision Act there were 94 offences, and the fines amounted to £ 7 0 . Under the HealthA c t there were 36 offences, and the fines amounted to £93. Under the Factories and ShopsA c t the offences numbered 395, arid the fines amounted to £ 5 2 1 . Under the Weights and Measures Act there were 24 offences and £ 3 7 10s. was levied in fines. Under the Bakers arid MillersA c t there were 36 offences and the fines imposed amounted to £ 1 1 7 . These figuresaccount for a total of 886 offences, and total fines amounting to £1,680. This gives an average fine of £ 2 for each offence. A penalty of one week's imprisonment for a second or third offence would have a far more deterrent effect than the imposition of a fine of £ 2 . Honourable members know of the dirty kitchens we have here. There are more in Sydney. In my early days in ParisI once saw a crowd gathered round a baker's shop window in which was exposed a placard setting out that the proprietor had been fined a certain sum for putting alum in his bread, or committing some other offence against the pure-food laws. Under the law he was required to allow That is that notice to remain in his window for two or three weeks. If we had such a law in operation here I am satisfied it would have a salutary effect. In this city many persons charged, with offences against the Health Act or the Pure. Foods Act pay the fines into Court with the object of escaping publicity. The press is the real guardian of the health of the people, since it does not hesitate to publish the names of offenders. I am told that in Berlini f a draper advertises goods under cost prices and a Government officer finds it false by an examination of his books, he is entitled to mark these goods at 10 per cent, below cost and to require them to remain in his shop windows until they are sold. The return from which I quoted a few moments ago contains the names of Harper, Angliss, and a number of other well known business people. It also includes the name of Lucas, who was fined for not keeping food in a rat-proof storeroom. I have also a return for the twelve months ending 30th September, 1919, which shows, that during that period there were fifty convictions in Victoria for offences against the Dairy Supervision Act , and that the fines imposed amounted to £ 4 5 . There were 297 cases under the Health Act, and the fines imposed' amounted to £900. Under the Factories and Shops Act there were 360 cases, and the fines inflicted amounted to £ 3 2 5. There were also 52 cases under the Weights and Measures Act, and the fines amounted to £114, while there were 28 prosecutions against bakers and millers, and the fines inflicted amounted tq £ 7 6 . For the twelve months there were 742 cases under these Acts, and the fines totalled £1,400. "" In other words, they did not average £ 2 per case. W it h all due respect to many honest men who hold the commission of the peace, I cannot help saying that a lot of them do not play the game, and are not even commonly honest when they impose trifling fines for offences -of this kind. When the people have the power, which I hope they will soon possess, we shall have a change. Coming to the question of immigration, I am sure that when the people here are happy-whe n we have plenty of employment offering and the opportunities for advancement are great-w e shall welcome immigrants. There is one form of immigration, however, that does not appeal to me. My friend, Mr Prendergast, Leader of His Majesty's Opposition in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, when speaking in that chamber on 12th November last, quoted the following circular: The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, Manufacturers' Buildings, 304-31B Flinders-street. Melbourne, 18th Sept., 1919. Dear Sir, You are doubtless aware that at the present time a delegation sent out to Australia by the British Government, viz., Mrs. Simm, Miss Pughe Jones, and Miss Chomley, is in Melbourne, making inquiries and collecting information respecting the opportunities of employ; ment offering in Australia for women, of whom there is a large number in England to be provided for as a result of the. war. Arrangements were made for the delegation to meet representatives of the sections of the Chamber in which female labour is employed, and this meeting took place on Tuesday iast. when the position in regard to the shortage of female labour in Victoria was thoroughly demonstrated. As a result, the Chamberhas undertaken to place in the hands of the delegation reliable inon the recruiting platform we did not formation as to the number of women that can be absorbed in tbe factories. I therefore inclose a form for you to supply me with the necessary information, and have to ask you to return it immediately, as the delegation will be leaving Melbourne at the end of this month. They have undertaken to forthwith forward the requirements of Victoria to London, with their recommendation, and have stated thai the Government will be most careful in its selection. Please give tbe fullest particulnrs as to the class of female workers you require, so that the representatives of the"" British Government may be in a position to know the exact requirements of the class of workers they are to send out -Yours faithfully, (Signed) If we are to have immigration, let us have for her boy, and has frequently to submit the sexes brought out ih equal numbers. to greater trials, than her more fortu Already Dr. Maloney. females than males. In Victoria we have 751,020 females and 716,168 males, am excess of 34,852 females. The population of Australia comprises 2,566,932 females and 2,513,023 males, an excess of 53,909 females. Every truly Australian woman hopes to meet her mate, and to rise to the God-given g if t of motherhood. If we are not to advocate polygamy it is therefore necessary for us to see that in connection, with any policy of immigration adopted by the Commonwealth care is taken that the number of males to females shall be fairly equal. I recognise the difficulty prevailing in England at the present time. In London alone there are 1,500,000 more females than males, and my heart goes out to them. Thank God they are now able to vote. They are not the disfranchised slaves that they were when, as a young man, I was in England. The franchise of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales before the war was the vilest in the *orld , not equal on paper to that of China, Japan, or Turkey, because no man had a vote because of his manhood, but was entitled to exercise the franchise only when he owns or rents property. Let me deal now w i th the treatment of our returned soldiers. Was there ever a greater piece of camouflage than that resorted to by the Government when they declared that those who did not apply for the gratuity w it h in six months would forfeit their right to it . I was a member of the Victorian State Recruiting Committee, and am the only one who remained a member of it from the beginning to the end. When we were tell our young men that upon their retur n from the Front they would lose their rights unless they made the requisite application w it h in six months of their return. We also told the boys that if they went to the Front the Government would see that their mothers were treated f a i r l y . We did not tell those who had been born out of wedlock that their mothers would not get a pension in the event of their death. I thank the Government for what they have done in the direction of mitigating that vile enactment. The lonely woman who has not the F. L. W. ASIIBY, Secretary. help of a husband has often greater love in Australia we have more nately situated sisters, and to say that such women should not be treated in the same way as the mothers who are legally married was a disgrace. Then, again, the war gratuity is described as an act of ""grace."" Wasi t necessary for the Government to use that glorious word, with all its scriptural associations, to describe faults. I cannot call to mind any other the war gratuity. I hope that our soldiers, who have been able to do more than I was permitted to do, will see that they and their dependants get fair play. When Major-General Bridges lost his life his widow received a 'special grant of £4,500. Although he was a general he could make no greater sacrifice than did the private who gave his life for the cause. I should not have cared had Lady Bridges received £20,000, but' since she was granted £4,500,, and her husband was receiving something like £30 per week and a field allowance of 25s. per day, why should we not have been able to make the same grant to every woman who lost her husband in the great. war ? "" A special Act was passed to enable this grant to be made to Lady Bridges. Surely she had a greater chance of saving money out of her husband's salary of £30 per week than had the widow of a private who received only 6s. per day. What is the cause of industrial unrest? Every right-thinking man-ever y mother of a family who knows the value of money and the cost of food and clothing -wil l say that when the price of food, shelter, and clothing goes up it is only reasonable that a man should ask for more wages. The men and women outside should follow the example that we recently set them. How can we blame a man for asking for a higher wage when the cost of living goes up ? If honourable members think that we shall always have industrial unrest, let us fix prices from time to time, and arrange that wages shall increase according to the increase of prices, instead of the workers having to go before tbe Arbitration Court as they have now. I voted for arbitration, and believe in it, but not as it is now carried out. Hughes) said, it is far too expensive, and there are too many delays in getting to the Court. In the Tramways case, I believe between £15,000 and £20,000 was expended before the Court could be reached; and then in a three-days' strike the men obtained more than they got through all that waste of time and money. The fault of the present Arbitration Court is that it is not up-to-date, but instead of amending and improving it, we try to work with our old-fashioned methods, with all their instance than that now occurring in Western Australia, where the public offices and the banks have been closed down, in any part of the British Dominions; but that has happened in Western Australia because the clerical slaves are getting tired of being slaves. same in the Commonwealth Bank. of the Commonwealth Bank to his face, in the presence of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), what I thought of his methods; and I am sure that if the honourable member lived for 1,000 years he would never forget that incident. In that Bank young men and women were brought back night after night, and not even allowed tea money. I belonged, in my earlier years,' to the staff of what was considered to be one of the smallest banks; but we were always paid Is -6d. tea money when we worked back at night. Doctors in Collins-street have sent young men to me to make complaints. I have been asked, "" I s it fair that these young men should be worked like this?"" If ' any of them had dared to take part in a political meeting, of course they have not been dismissed for that offence, but they have been sent away to some small place in the interior. I have made inquiries about the conditions in the Commonwealth Bank in New South Wales, Adelaide, and Perth. I went over to the opening of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney to ask the Manageri f he intended to give up sweating his bank clerks.

According to a paper issued by the Empire Parliamentary Association prior to the war, the salary of a member of tbe French Parliament was, at the rate of 25 francs to the £1, £600 a year. This was increased in February of this year to £1,080 a year. The French elections were held in November, and ours were held in December. The members of the French Parliament raised their salaries in the February following, and we raised ours to almost the same sum in the following May. If the referendum, initiative and members of Parliament, but over the Governor General. They might be asked to say if he was worth £10,000 a year, seeing that only £15,000 a year is paid to the President of the United States, who rules over 100,000,000 people. The people would be able also to fix the salaries of State Governors, Judges, stipendiary magistrates, heads of Departments, Commissioners of railways, and so on. The' people have to find the whole of the money. Why, then, should they not have a say in the spending of it?

In one instance, the increase in profits was 2,000,000 per cent. The then honourable member for Henty( Mr Boyd) questioned the accuracy of my figures when I quoted them, but he would not support his opinion to the extent of risking having to pay for a life-governorship in a hospital. Why should not the information prepared by Sir Alexander Peacock be supplemented and brought up to date. I ask the Government to inThe Wunderlich Company had a dicate in a similar return the profits of various firms and squatters from 1913 onThe Comward during the years of war. When I made that.request to a Minister on a previous occasion, he would not agree to supply the information.

It would be found that the vast majority of them had increased their incomes during the period of war.

""With my banking experience, and having made a study of the banking system, I can confidently invite honourable members to read the particulars of the Banking Commission of the United States, which inquired into the affairs of every bank in Europe. It is obvious that if all the war debt were to be requisitioned it would destroy credit. den actions and changes would not only destroy credit, but, in many cases, would cause loss of life. I am out to prevent that. There is the unearned increment. Why not let us say that we w ill have all property valued now, and that the increase for the next ten. years, or until the war debt shall have been wiped out, shall be drawn upon for such specific purpose? I have asked the keenest business men whether they would prefer to give one-fourth of their property forthwith in cash or be dispossessed of ten years of unearned increment. Honourable members know f u l l well what was their answer every time.

If we were to give to the people the power to initiate legislation I would look forward with confidence to glorious days for Australia. I would be prepared to seriously consider offering a post of great responsibility to that greatest organizer of machinery and labour the world has ever known. Henry' Eord, of America, who was told that ho could not employ a larger unit than 5,000 men, but who did so; who was told that he could not make an automobile for £ 4 0 , but who did so; and who, for the payment of one dollar a year, turned the whole of his machinery over to the welfare of his country, when the United States of America declared war. Money could have no value to a man who has made Ford's millions. When labour troubles occurred, his critics said he would not be able to carry on, that he would be beaten; but he was not beaten, and the unions did not object to his carrying on. He fixed the minimum wage of the sweeper-out of his factory at £ 1 a day. If Sud[ had the power, I would be inclined to invite Ford to come here and govern Australia. He would do it , perhaps, for the maximum salary of one dollar a year, for the honour and love of the task. And , so, he would set Australia going as a great, co-operative Commonwealth; for that is the only way in which to eliminate poverty from our midst. I commend to honourable members the last book published by that wonderful man, A l f r e d Russell Wallace. In his 93rd year he penned these words, "" The State should be the heir of all property."" There is the thought which, in the minds of men, will grow. The State has never yet sold its property, nor the right, of taxation. In the words of the elder Napoleon, in his Code, property is that which is movable and immovable. I can remove my watch from taxation, but I cannot remove my house and my land. We hear threats of the removal of capital. Property cannot be moved, and I ask the wealthy to consider seriously the advantage to them of : It is a call. The shadows are creeping. The"" first shadow in Australia is being thrown by the happenings in Western Australia at this moment. Let us have the referendum, the initiative and recall. That will enable this nation to bring about reform by gradual change. What an insult it is to the intelligence of the people that this Parliament should permit them to vote upon a referendum! We say it is the most glorious thing in the world to be the servants of the people. Why do we not embody in our Constitution provision for the people to have the right to initiate legislation? If we d i d , I allude to this "" fool "" game of Parliament, as carried on now, would cease to exist. that we are wasting considerable time. This is the second occasion in the l if e of the present Parliament on which a similar discussion has occurred. It is a waste of public time and money.",58,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor

I have ipatiently listened to the various speeches delivered since the launching of the motion, and I have closely examined the reasons set forth in its support. I have wondered how the so called Labour party was going to support, particularly paragraphs a and d of the motion, and at the same time be consistent. place, it is complained that the Government has failed to reduce the cost of living. It has been amply shown in this House that the cost of those commodities which were specifically referred to during this debate is lower in Australia than anywhere else; and those commodities are primary products. forth in paragraph d of the motion has to do with the alleged failure of the Government in regard to obtaining better prices for commodities sold overseas. It has also been shown in this Chamber that the commodities disposed of overseas, particularly our wheat, have been sold at conlian consumers at a cheaper rate than siderably greater advantage to the Australian producer than that portion which has been disposed of at home. If there were to be a further reduction in the cost of living, enforced by the methods proposed by the extreme Opposition in this Chamber, the effect would be to disadvantage the primary producer even more than to-day. In other words, if there were rib' consumption 'of wheat in Australia, our primary producers would be receiving double that which they are actually getting for the portion of their whea which is consumed within the ComL monwealth. If there could be a quid pro quo between the primary producer and the other sections of the community we should have somethinglike fair play. But since the primary producer gets no advantage in return the position is grossly unfair to him. And why is this so? Because he has not political strength enough to demand consideration. Honourable members of the extreme Opposition represent the interests of the consumer only, for they declare that after his needs are provided for, the primary producer is at liberty to get as much as he can from the other fellow. producer a consumer, too? pay a reasonable price, but honourable members opposite expect' him to buy in withdraw the exthe dearest ?narket and sell for home consumption at a price determined by them. In this way they talk about building up a two years' supply by a kind of confiscatory method at the expense of the producer. If those who advocate this theory would undertake to give the farmer cheaper labour, cheaper machinery, cheaper clothing, and generally cheaper In the first living costs, as a quid pro quo the consuming public, outside the producers, would be justified in expecting Australian products at a cheaper rate. But what is the position? We cannot employ black labour, nor do we want to do that, as we 'are in thorough agreement The complaint set with honourable members opposite in regard to the White Australia policy; but we complain that they are not with us in this principle, for they would have us work like blackfellows, and, moreover, they would, in effect, seize our property, by claiming that .we must sell to Austrato any one else. To-day the Australian consumer is getting food .at a cheaper, rate than that at which it can be produced elsewhere by black labour. Honourable members opposite must clearly understand that members of the Corner party are out to defend their interests, and as an impartial representativeI claim to be that I say that all we desire is sound government. When I spoke first in this HouseI declared that this little party of ours stood for sound government, irrespective of party, and I say that while members of the Government talk in a manner to indicate that",60,Joseph Cook Wil L The Honor Be Approximately £125 000 I Ask Honor

I have sympathy with those who have to pay high rents, but I cannot help thinking of the position of our farmers who are obliged to work long hours .and are expected to sell their produce for home consumption at about half the world's price; while the worker is asking for shorter hours in erecting cottages and other works.

Chanter) I remind tbe honourable member for South Sydney that on this motion an honourable member may refer -to anything. Sir thing. given this ruling, because I shall have a few nice things to say too. Apparently the ruling of the Chair is misunderstood. I wish to state that on this motion an honourable member may refer to anything within the Standing Orders and rules of this House. tinuesYou will therefore see that if the Tariff becomes operative as set out, the price of explosives imported will immediately increase in price, and as the miner has to purchase the explosives, it will affect him, and not the ligion, and those other matters outside coal-owners. Consequently, the miner is not disposed to bear the increase. Of course, he is not disposed to hear the increase. I have had another communication from the Collie coal miners in Western Australia. duties on coal-cutting machines and similar appliances; and, to my mind, that is only tinkering w i th the most i m portant industry we could have within our borders. It is claimed by the Miners Federation and by the Collie coal miners that these imposts increase the cost of this most important output; and yet, at the same time, the Prime Minister tells us tliat tlie only way out of our financial difficulties is to increase production, and thus create greater wealth. Isi t consistent, is it statesmanship, is it wise legisyou are talking about! lation to burden the people who are asked to produce this greater wealth? Would it not be wise to afford them every opportunity to develop the industry? These questions are, to my mind, of paramount importance. I am extremely sorry to have noticed that so much time is spent on sectarian questions in this House. here for a few months now, and have heard a great deal on sectarian matters from the extreme Opposition, and I have also heard the Prime Minister speaking on the same subject. I would like to sayin the most dispassionate way that it would be just as well for us to understand each pther here, on these great question?. It would be a good thing if members were to t r y to differentiate spiritual religion from subjects which trench on matters which come within the jurisdiction of this House.

323,Mr Prowse,"There has been toosectarian cry yourself now. said, but, as a matter of fact, I am speaking against sectarianism. SinceI have been a member of this House the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), according to the press, has actually stood by and applauded a priest who said he would cause as much trouble as he could in Ireland and Australia until he got what he desired. What has poor Australia done that she should have so much trouble over such matters? Are those who are the cause of this trouble not judged out of their own mouths? Why should there be Ehis cry from the honourable member? I am trying to remedy the present state of affairs if possible, and immediately I find the charge of sectarianism thrown at me. It reminds me of the days of my youth, when an elder brother frequently thought it advisable, during the course of our play, to hit me on the nose. On such occasions I would cry out very loudly in order to attract the attention of my mother, who had considerable strength; and, when I heard her footstep approaching my cries became inaudible, as I thought of the thrashing she would give my brother. However, when my brother saw the "" boot"" he immediately started yelling, and on my mother's arrival, he accused me of having hit him, and I got the ""walloping."" That seems to me to be a very fair representation of the position in regard to sectarianism. ' I refer to these matters because I realize how much better it would be for the peace of this House, and the peace of Australia, if these sectarian questions were not raised. I am speaking seriously, without any feeling of hatred; I have no spirit of malice towards any living soul in the country. Many people -of the Roman Catholic persuasion are my friends, and I hope to have them remain my friends. What' I desire is that the Churches of Australia shall keep to themselves, teaching as much Christianity as possible to the people, and leaving the politicians to do the other business. This would be of infinite advantage; and we have only to read the history of other countries to learn that such intrusion on matters political has not proved of any advantage to the Churches guilty of it or to the country. able member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) think of that? able member for Wannon would not. disagree with any reasonable attitude taken up with a view to the peace and harmony of the people of Australia. I hope that every section of the community, if they have no faith or much faith, will recognise that a change in this regard would be conducive to harmony amongst the people as a whole. I rise to support the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), because its object is to remove the present Government from office. I am not concerned with what the future consequences of their removal may be. I do not care what Government may follow, because no Government could be worse than the present; and I hope that this motion may lead to an appeal to our masters, the electors. ""hear, hears"" to that sentiment 1 Leader of the Opposition in his desire that, at the earliest moment, the Parliament of Australia should face the elec-' tors, and give them an opportunity of pronouncing judgment on the Government, and also an opportunity of saying, in the light of events up to the present moment, who shall occupy the Treasury bench. both Houses? orable member likes; but I see difficulty in having a dissolution of both Chambers under the Constitution as it is while the present Government is in power. I fail to apprehend under what circumstancesthere could be such a difference of opnion between the two Houses as would lead to a double dissolution, and until there is a Government in power with views quite different from those of the majority of members in another place, it seems to me impossible.

If he was doing so, I must ask him not to continue to do so. every respect for your suggestion, but T should like to impress upon you-and I am sure you will appreciate my motive in doing so-that it would be very unfortunate if , because some pure legal question is raised in a Court, for that reason the whole conduct of the Executive in connection with a matter which is not being litigated in any Court at all, and has nothing to do with the questions before the Court, should be prohibited from being discussed. I will give you, sir, an illustration of what I mean. must ask the honourable member to desist. It is quite clear that I cannot permit him to raise a matter which I ruled to be out of order when raised in another way by a different honourable member.

And yet honourable members opposite allow the business of the country to be carried on in this way? What is the effect of allowing to remain in office a Government that has over and over again made solemn pledges, and over and over again has broken them. After all that Australia has done in this war, the hundreds of millions of pounds she has Bpent in connection with it , the sacrifice of many noble lives-60,00 0 of the flower of her youth lie dead, on the fields of Gallipoli, Palestine, and France-afte r all these things, because of the record of this Government, when Mr Watt, as Treasurer, went Home, he was told: "" If you do not pay up £8,500,000, we will post yon as a defaulter in the House of Commons."" There is our return, because a wrong impression has been given in England of the people of this country by allowing to remain in power a Government that can make and break pledges from day to day Still they go cm, and they tell us nothing. The effect in this country is to increase our difficulties, to pile up taxation, and yet we still allow them to go on. The responsibility is individually upon each and all of us. Parties will be judged on how they vote as parties. This is a great question, whether the Government is to remain in power or not. I would suggest to my honourable friends in the Ministerial corner that it does not look well to have the Government saved time and again by a sufficient number of their party voting for the Government. it this time. they have or not, but the fact remains that. the Government is continuing in power by the support of some of my honourable friends sitting in the Ministerial corner. The responsibility is theirs. I hope that each member will do his duty, so that our masters, the people of Australia, will know, when the division bells ring and members take their places, where each of us stands, and will be able to pass judgment upon us when the time comes to do so. adjourned, and ordered to take precedence of all other business.
