Sir,-Requiring glass dishes of several sizes for Christmas, I approached my local shopkeeper. He said that they were dearer now. Local manufacturers having increased their prices by 10 per cent, to 12$ per cent, since December 1; that is, apparently since the increased tariff on imported glassware. I have verified that this is correct. Does the local manufacturer simply get these protective tariffs to exploit his own countrymen? In view of the assurance given to this House by the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the Assistant Minister for Prime Minister, that if as a result of the increased duties prices were raised, prompt action would be taken by the Government, what steps does the Government propose to take to prevent the exploitation disclosed by the letter I have quoted ? made by me on behalf of the Government stands. If the manufacturers take adthe Government will take action, but it cannot hold the manufacturers responsible for the actions of retailers.

An imperative demand is being made by residents of Albury, Wodonga and other places on the Murray, below the Hume Weir, calling on the authorities to clear the submerged area of timber and debris. Because of the pollution of the river, considerable uneasiness and doubt exist among householders using the water supply as to its wholesomeness. The water has a very distinct unpleasant odor and taste, and the people of Albury and Wodonga are boiling and filtering supplies, adding salts, lime and other palliatives, fearing an epidemic with the approach of summer. The fouling of the water supply is due to the foliage of trees, bark, rotting timber and decayed vegetation submerged recently, contaminating the flowing and still waters. Fish, unless caught above the weir, are unsaleable.",11,College

Whether the items stated by the Treasurer in answer to a question by the honourable member for Adelaide as to the sources from which the amount was procured for liquidation of the war debt, viz.:-From Stock Redemption Fund, £599,010; Loan Sinking Fund, £9,039,016; National Debt Sinking Fund, £24,479,439; direct redemption from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, £14,153,136, are not funds from which overseas debt should have been redeemed? 2. How much overseas loans have been redeemed during the same period the war debt was being liquidated? 3. What loans have been floated during the same period in {a) America? 4. Is the amount of direct redemptions from the Consolidated Revenue Fund mainly made up of the profits of the note issue and the Commonwealth' Bank? 5. If so, what is the amount from each? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Under the Funding Arrangements Act 1921, the Commonwealth is under an obligation to apply certain moneys annually in reduction of its indebtedness to the British Government. The amount applied to the 30th June last in accordance with that act was £9,089,767. This sum formed portion of the £14,153,130 shown as moneys directly applied from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the redemption of debt. Sinking Fund Act the Commonwealth is under an obligation to provide sinking funds for the redemption of the whole of the Commonwealth debt, but the question as to the amount of the sinking fund, which shall be applied in any year to the redemption of oversea debt, is one for decision by the National Debt Commission. Up to 30th June' last, the commission applied £1,888,738 of its funds to the refollow:demption of oversea debt. 2. The war debt of £292,817,746 includes £93,810,641 of oversea debt. As shown in the reply to question No. 1, the amount of oversea debt redeemed in the period from 1st July, 1915, to 30th June, 1929, was £11,578,414, consisting of £9,689,767 of indebtedness to the British Government, and £1,888,738 of loans raised for Commonwealth works purposes, &c. 3. (a) £60,014,060, (6) £17,632,790. 4. The profits of the note issue up to the time of transfer from the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank totalled £7,805,094. Of this sum £7,780,524 was used in 1920 for the redemption of Commonwealth securities issued for works purposes i u Australia. This amount is not included' in the direct redemptions from the Consolidated Revenue Fund referred to in question No. 1 as the amount of £14,153,136 therein mentioned represents redemptions of war debt. Since the transfer of the note issue to the Commonwealth Bank, £8,687,714 of note issue profits have been paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In the same period £14,153,130 of revenue was applied directly to the redemption of debt and £14,100,835 of revenue was paid to the National Debt Sinking Fund for the redemption of debt. The whole of the Loan Sinking Fond money and the Stock Redemption Fund money was paid to those funds from revenue. None of the profits of the Commonwealth Bank has been paid to revenue, but half of these profits has been paid to the National Debt Sinking Fund since 1923, the amount so paid up to 30th June last being £1,324^372. This sum is included in the amount of £24,479,439 shown as redemptions from the National Debt Sinking Fund, and is not included in the direct redemptions from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

The amount is being allocated as follows:New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania 50,000 £1,000,000 Although the funds are being provided by the Commonwealth, the actual disbursement of these moneys is a matter for the States and the proposals for road works must therefore emanate from the State authorities.

In the event of any proposals being brought under the notice of the Minister for Works by members of the Federal Parliament they will be referred to State authorities for consideration. In some States, though these additional moneys will be actually expended on road work, they may not wholly result in an increased programme beyond that already contemplated. The effect, however, will be to release the funds of the States to relieve unemployment in other directions, and the intention of the Commonwealth Government will thus be carried out.

73,Motion (By Mr Scullin),"by leavel "" days ago, in another place, a personal attack was made upon me by Senator Eeid, which involves so gross a charge that I take this early opportunity to reply to it. The subject was again referred to in another place yesterday, and a false impression has been conveyed to the general public who have read the newspaper accounts of the attack, which was an attempt to assail my own honour and the honour of the party Senator Eeid repliedto which I belong. I shall not refer to the newspaper accounts of what was said withdraw. in another place, but I am informed public platform during the election campaign that the incident has been given wide pubin Queensland, when Mr Theodore was campapers throughout Australia. Any perbeen son, not knowing the actual facts, who thou central executive of the Queensland reads those accounts must regard me as my personal honour. In order to clearly set out the nature Murphy, who was Mr Fiholly's father-in-law, of the attack I shall quote what was said and acted as a go-between for the licensed in another place yesterday. Daly, by leave of the Senate, saidHonorable senators w ill remember that, during tbe debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Eeply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech, Senator Eeid saidThe present Treasurer of the Commonwealth entered into a contract with the licensed victuallers not to interfere with licences for three years in return for the payment of so many thousands of pounds. I interjected ""What was the amount?"" Senator Eeid went on to sayAbout £10,000. Portion of that sum was used in connection with the Labour party's campaign, and I should like to ask Mr Theodore, through Senator Daly, what became of the remainder. I am not making that statement under cover of the Senate. I said it on the public platform of Queensland, and I am prepared to return to that State to repeat it to-morrow. Senator Eeid's remarks were given very wide publicity in all the States, and particularly in Queensland. Star head lines were given to it in the Daily Mail, a Brisbane journal, and as a result I wish to report that I am in possession of a communication addressed to Mr. Theodore by a gentleman who has been the President of the Licensed Victuallers Association of Queensland for sixteen years. This gentleman writesI was surprised to read the' statement made by Mr Eeid, as per enclosed cutting""Not Touch Licenses for Three Years. Contract with Liquor Trade Alleged"". MB. THEODOEE. and I have been president continuously for the past sixteen years. It is an absolutely false and malicious utterance. As a matter of fact, the amendment of the Liquor Act referred to by Mr Eeid was passed after you had left Queensland politics. If what is said by the chairman of the Licensed Victuallers Association of Queensland, a gentleman who evidently enjoys the esteem and regard of his colleagues since he has held his present office for tlie nast sixteen years, is true, Senator Beid should be prepared to make amends for what was, after all, one of the most slanderous statements that could possibly be made against one of His Majesty's Ministers of State. As I have already said, I have nothing to I made the same statement on tlie mack, Mr Eihelly and Mr Eyan, who had appointed as a sub-committee Of the Labour party, from which I had just resigned. dore, on behalf of the sub-committee, received the sum of money I mentioned, from Mr Peter Senator victuallers and the central executive. The matter was also raised at the Labour convendemanded ""a proper, balance-sheet."" All that I asked in the chamber last week was that the Leader of the Senate (Senator Daly) should ask Mr Theodore what had become of the balance of the money given by the Licensed Victuallers, which remained when tlie election was over. I still ask tliat question. I also when he threw tlie legitimate balance sheet on the table at the Eockhampton conference and demanded the production of ""a proper"" one. I have said all this on the public platform and I shall continue to say it until I get evidence to the contrary that I am in a position to use. Acting on the knowledge I have now, not one word have I to withdraw against the campaign director during that State election. 1 took every precaution to ascertain the truth .

I have not the authority .to use the names of persons to back up my statement, but I have taken every precaution to ascertain that what I have said here and on the public platform in Queensland is correct and, if necessary, I shall repeat the charge.

I was not campaign director on that occasion, although I acted with Mr Fihelly as joint secretary Ryan was on the execuitve of the party, were not members of the campaign committee. That was a strenuously fought election, but no gifts of money were made by the liquor interests to myself to the campaign committee or to the Labour party, either at that time or at any other election which took place during my association with the Queensland Labour party. The statement that some bargain was made with the liquor trade during that or subsequent elections is an utterly false assertion, for which there is not the slightest foundation. It is a slanderous statement frequently made against the Labour party that some association exists between that party and the liquor interests. but not usually in circumstances in which those responsible for it can be pinned down to facts. against me is apparently based on some whisper or rumour relating to the events of the 1915 election in Queensland, and I think thathonorable members here will agree that there was no justification whatever for making so belated a charge against me or against the Queensland Labour party. ever been any sort of justification for the charge, a thousand opportunities must have occurred during my residence in Queensland, and my occupancy of public positions there, to make it definitely and publicly.

The senator who makes this charge says that he has taken precautions to obtain the facts, and that he knows of his owu knowledge that his allegations are true.

It would probably not be right to ask the Commonwealth Parliament to go to. the expense of setting up an authoritative tribunal to probe every malicious charge that irresponsible persons may make against me.

My own recollection is that the senator ceased to have anything to do with the Queensland Labour party years before 1915, in circumstances with which I am not familiar. I know that even before I began my parliamentary career in Queensland, in 1909, Senator Reid had ceased to be prominent in the Labour councils of the State. He took no prominent part in the election of 1912, nor in that of 1915, nor was he, so far as I know, politically prominent in any way from the time he left the Labour party in 1908 or 1909 until he appeared as a .speaker for the Nationalists on the conscription issue in 1916. His suggestion that he left . the Labour party because he did not agree with the tactics of myself and others associated with me on the Labour executive is not true. I had no association with him whatever. I entered the Queensland Parliament in 1909. In 1915 I was joint secretary of the campaign committee during the election which we won in that year; Senator Reid did not figure in the Labour movement at all in that campaign, he had voluntarily left the party years before. There is not a tittle of evidence in support of these charges. The whole thing is a deliberately concocted lie, and is roads, because it is obtainable in Austraapparently part of a widespread campaign of calumny against myself. I feel that I am the victim in a particular degree of such a campaign. out for this kind of attack from various quarters, and it is a very sad commentary upon the public life of Australia that this sort of thing is allowed to .happen. Itfis sad to reflect that a public man can be singled out in this manner for constant and pernicious attacks upon his honesty, character and integrity. It has belittled public life in the eyes of the people. Of course, it is right that if a man does wrong he should be publicly denounced, but it is not right that political opponents should go around slandering one another through malice, and on deliberately concocted lies. That sort of thing is dragging public life down, and keeping honourable men out of politics. It is not the slandered who is responsible for thus lowering public life, but the slanderer. I shall not hesitate to defend myself; but I despise the action of a man who shelters himself in a coward's castle by launching his attacks under cover of parliamentary privilege. If Senator Reid is manly enough to repeat his charges outside Parliament, I shall give him and the public an opportunity to ascertain the truth. for Home Affairs) [11.57] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, viz.:-The construction of Concrete Roads, City Area, Canberra. There are in Canberra certain roads which, because they have to bear very heavy omnibus traffic, are becoming increasingly costly to keep in repair. The Pederal Capital Commission has been forced to the conclusion that they should be reconstructed in some permanent material. Ultimately it is hoped that all the more important roads within the city area will be so treated, and the proposed work represents the first section of the undertaking. It is thought that cement is the best material to use for paving the lia, and because it provides the most suitable surface. The concrete paving is to be 20 feet wide, with a 3 foot shoulder I have been singled of ordinary gravel material, making in all a 26 foot pavement. There will be 4.6 miles of road constructed at a cost of approximately £1,190 a mile. The total cost of the work will be £59,698. Some sections of this work are already under construction, but I deemed it advisable to allow the proposal to go to the Works Committee because this represents only the first section of the entire undertaking. I think that the Committee will be able to complete its investigation by the time the remaining sections are begun. I lay on the table plans, &c, in connection with the proposed work.

83,Mr Blakeley (Darling,"Ministe rSEAT OF GOVERNMENT (ADMINISTRATION) BILL . for Home Affairs) [13.0] I move That the bill be now read a second time. Honourable members are aware that when the present Government took office it decided that the Federal Capital Commission should be abolished; but because of the limited amount of time available, and the volume of very urgeut work that required to be completed in this short session, it was not possible to introduce a measure designed to effect that purpose. A second reason is that a considerable amount of organization is necessary in order that the various activities of the Commission may be grafted on to those departments that are best able to deal with them. An organizing committee is functioning at the present time. I have been in constant touch with the Commission, and can say that the organization for the transfer of the Departments of Health, Home Affairs', and Works, is well advanced. I shall not traverse any of the matters connected with the activities of the Federal Capital Commission; that can be done when the bill for the abolition of the Commission is introduced when the session is resumed early next year. But I wish honourable members to realize that we are not concerned at present with the abolition of the Commission but with an amendment of the act that will provide certain safeguards against the Commission becoming null and void during the transition period between the present date and that on which the Commission is abolished. When I was honoured by being entrusted with the administration of the Department of Home AffairsI had an interview with the Third Commissioner, Dr. Alcorn, who assured me that he would not embarrass, but rather assist, the Government. I accepted that assurance, and proceeded with the organization committee's work. Very little time elapsed before,, unfortunately, Dr. Alcorn wrote me a letter which purported to be his resignation as Third Commissioner. be brought down, next year. The GovernI could not accept it ; that can be done men considers that, in the meantime, it is only by the Governor General. MrM . CAMEEON -Has the Minister any idea what caused him to send it? was sent as a protest against certain action by the Federal Capital Commission in relation to matters upon which he held definite views. If the resignation had beeu properly couched and addressed to the Governor General it would have been necessary to hold another election for the appointment of a Third Commissioner or to establish another Commission. Neither of these alternatives appealed to me. Subsequently Dr. Alcorn called a meeting of the residents of Canberra and sought their advice as to what he should do. The meeting declared that he should continue to act as Third .Commissioner. I then received from him a letter in which he stated that he withdrew the previous letter which purported, to be his resignation. Unfortunately Dr. Alcorn's health has since become impaired, and in accordance with the provisions of the act, he has appointed a substitute to act as Third Commissioner for. one month, or longer if the circumstances should warrant it. In order that the Government may not be embarrassed, and that the functions of the Commission shall be carried on until the departments are ready to shoulder its responsibilities, I propose by this short amending bill to give the Chief Commissioner the power to call meetings when he so desires, the object being to prevent a declaration that the office of Third Commissioner -is vacant when that gentleman has absented himself from three meetings. The Chief Commissioner will not use that power unless, in his opinion, or in the opinion of the Minister, the calling of meetings every second week would give rise to that danger. Meetings will be called, as usual, every fortnight until it is found that the position is being endangered by the absence of the Third Commissioner. At the present time the act provides that the office shall be declared vacant when the Third Commissioner has absented himself from three meetings. It is now proposed to make the number six meetings.

85,Mr Blakieley,"He said that it is very difficult to understand the reason for the introduction of this measure, unless the Government considers that it is necessary to introduce some legislation dealing with Canberra. The bill attains nothing, nothing, and protects nothing. From every point of view, including those referred to by the Minister, it is quite unnecessary. The honourable gentleman has said that at a later date proposals will be brought down for the abolition of the Federal Capital Commission and the re-establishment of the. older system of control by Ministers and government de-. partments. The latter system is familiar to many honourable members, and I am sure that they will remember that, having regard to the amount of work that was going on at the time, the complaints under it were as insistent, as vigorous, and as frequent as they have been since the Commission has been in charge of Canberra's affairs. At all times there has been a great deal of criticism of Canberra and of the methods adopted in connection with construction work. It was because there was general dissatisfaction with the control of the city by a permanent government department that the commission system of control was introduced. I was astonished to read, shortly after the elections, an announcement by the Minister for Home Affairs that he had arranged to effect a saving in the salaries paid to members of the Commission, and that, the First Commissioner would receive £1,600 instead of £3,000 a year. Arrangements to effect that economy were definitely and clearly made before the late Government went out of office; and there were reasons for it. Because of the financial position it was impossible to proceed with the large programme of might have been undertaken, and accordingly it was unnecessary to have in charge of the work an engineer of the eminence of Sir John Butters. was recognized alike by Sir John Butters and the Government. change was made which resulted in the appointment of Mr Christie as First Commissioner; and that gentleman is being continued in the office by the present Government a' the salary which the last Government fixed. While it is natural for the Minister to claim credit for what he himself does, it is not in accordance with ordinary fair dealing for him to say that this particular economy was originated and' introduced by him, when he achieves nothing, secures merely"" accepted the very sound policy of the previous Government. accept the policy of retaining Sir John Butters, as was contemplated by our predecessors. last Government was confined to that which I have mentioned, and did not involve the retention of the services of Sir John Butters. There was a suggestion for the retention of his services in a limited consultative capacity only, but no conclusion was come to on that matter. It will be easier for a department to handle the affairs of Canberra in the future than it has been in the past. The extensive constructional period has ended, at any rate for tbe moment. When the Government brings down its proposal we shall be able to see whether there will be any tremendous improvement upon the conditions that have existed for the last five years. The object of the bill is to deal with the situation that has arisen consequent upon the attempted resignation of Dr. Alcorn. The last Government endeavoured to give the residents of Canberra a share in its government in relation to certain matters. . The two gentlemen, who have filled the position of elected Third Commissioner, were unable to recognize what was meant by a share in the government of Canberra. Apparently, it was their desire that the residents should have complete control. I say "" apparently"" advisedly, because it has been difficult to construction that otherwise ascertain what they really wanted.

88,Mr Latham,"The proposal of thedistinct from control of it, and if the matter is considered on its merits, without the intrusion of party political considerations, I shall wish it every success. The bill first provides that meetings of the Commission shall be convened by the Chief Commissioner, and shall be held at such times as he determines. At present the law is that meetings shall be held at intervals of not less than a fortnight ; provided that the Minister may, in any particular case, if he should think fit, in which notice of meeting shall be given, direct that meetings need not be held at such intervals. Accordingly, the Minister is able to dispense with that requirement of the law. Why can he not take that action without this legislation? orable gentleman Avould say he was acting wrongly, and attack him for having done so. similar to that of the honourable member. It is within the power of the Minister under the existing law to bring about the result that he says this amendment is designedto effect. The honourable member for Herbert, with that political sagacity which characterizes him, has suggested 'that the object of the amendment is to enable the Minister to evade responsibility by placing it on the Chief Commissioner. I do not debit the Minister with any such intention; I am sure that he is prepared to accept f u ll responsibility. Nevertheless, all that the bill does is to transfer responsibility from the Minister to the Chief Commissioner. I understood that the policy of the Government was to accept complete political responsibility and get rid of Commission control; yet this measure provides in relation to the summoning of meetings of the Commission that the responsibility shall be taken from the Minister and placed on the Chief Commissioner. It is directly. The second amendment provides .that the elected commissioner may be absent from six instead of three consecutive meetings before forfeiting his seat. No amendment of the act is necessary to effect that change, because section 10 provides for the vacation of office if there is wilful absence from three consecutive meetings, except on leave granted by the Minister, which leave the Minister is authorized to grant. Therefore, the Minister has power to do everything that this bill purports to authorize him to do, and I cannot understand why the measure has been introduced. Clause2 requires that the Chief Commissioner shall give notice in writing to the other members of the Commission of any meeting of the Commission convened by him. I cannot say offhand whether there is any provision in the act regarding the manner but I suggest that the Minister might consult the Acts Interpretation Act to make sure that nptice may be sent by post; it is undesirable that the Chief Commissioner should have to deliver the notice personally to his colleagues. -When leave to introduce this bill was sought I drew the attention of the Minister to a newspaper forecast of its provisions, and a summary of the speech which the Minister delivered when moving the second reading. Yesterday reference was made to the leakage of information from government departments regarding tariff amendments before the schedules were tabled in the House. The Prime Minister admitted the seriousness of these occurrences, and I take this opportunity to emphasize the fact that the right place for the disclosure of proposed legislation is this Parliament. matters were discussed at a public meeting convened by Dr. Alcorn. sarily follow that the views expressed by the meeting would be embodied in a bill to be introduced during this very brief session. I suggest seriously to Ministers that steps be taken to prevent the disclosure of proposed legislation in advance of its submission to this House. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has pointed out that there is no need for the bill. Labour members have told us on many occasions that if they came into power government hy boards and commissions would be abolished, and that the Cabinet would take f u ll responsibility in administration and legislation. .

Under the existing practice many reports are printed as a matter of course which, in my opinion, could be renewed at much less cost and with equally serviceable results. I have already mentioned the matter in relation to the printing of Works Committee reports upon automatic telephone exchanges. There is little justification for putting the country to the expense of printing many of the reports that are tabled. It is, of course, always open to an honourable member, upon the tabling of any paper, to move that it be printed.

Some reports are of great value to persons other than members of Parliament. The report of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, for instance, is most useful to members of the legal profession. I trust that it may be possible to do something to effect economies in this direction. ter) [12.38] I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that a good deal of money could be saved by cutting out some of the unnecessary printing that is done. I shall ask the Printing Committee to make a close investigation into the whole subject and submit recommendations to the Government upon it. I learned, when I was a member of that committee, that many documents which are ordered to be printed are never submitted to the committee, and some that do come before it have already been printed. If we can prevent unnecessary expenditure in this way it should be done. the Leader of the Opposition mentioned this subject a day or two ago, the members of the Public Works Committee have given some consideration to it. We feel that a decision not to print reports in relation to automatic telephone exchanges would not effect the saving that the Leader of the Opposition suggests. When the committee made its first inquiries into proposals for the installation of automatic exchanges, it was necessary to examine many witnesses; but that is not so necessary now. A number of experiments have been made in connection with de-humidifying plants, but we can now determine fairly easily, what installations should be made in different localities. I suggest that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and the committee of which I have the honour to be chairman, should be asked to express their views on the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. It must be remembered that the evidence that we take is printed and proof copies of it are sent to the various witnesses for correction, just as proofs of our speeches are sent to us for that purpose. Seeing, therefore, that the evidence is in type, the printing of it is not an expensive item. Moreover, the members of the Public Works Committee have'to face the criticism which follows their various recommendations, and it is due to. them that the whole of the evidence upon which they base their findings should be available to honourable members in printed form. I agree that so far as possible unnecessary printing should be avoided, but we should be careful not to cut out necessary printing. think it wise that this subject should be looked at carefully. As honourable members know, it is the usual practice for Ministers and others tabling papers to move "" That, the paper be printed"", so that the subject with which it deals may be debated. If a pro forma motion of that description is not submitted we may have to change our procedure somewhat. provides that upon the tabling of a paper any honourable member may move that it be printed and so discuss the subject with which it deals.

High Commissioner's office has, so long as it has been in existence, been the subject of criticism. maintaining that office, judging by results, is wholly wasteful, and the items, appearing on the Estimates, bear that out. tralia House, London, 13 £12,500 per annum. spend merely upon a monument, and the people of Australia are eagerly awaiting a government that will wipe this office out altogether, or so reform as to cause it to justify its existence by results. All that can be said of the High Commissioner's office is that we have a representative in London. It may be claimed that business is transacted through this medium, but I hardly think that the High Commissioner enters into business transactions. It is customary for any work in connection with diplomatic relations The then Prime and business arrangements between Australia and Great Britain to be carried out by the Government departments. The High Commissioner is purely a figurehead, and as the office is at present constituted, I should wipe it out altogether. The State Governments have each an Agent-General in London. I suggest that we should have in London only one Affairs as its permanent official representing Australia as a whole. This officer has peculiar At present the High Commissioner is like a giant dominating six pigmies. These offices should be amalgamated so as to do away with the multiplication of Recently the Interstaffs that now exists in London. It may be said that the State Governments On the last He is the only Australian to occasion when a Labour Government in South Australia appointed an Agent General for that State, I suggested to the Premier that instead of appointing one of the members of the State Parliament as Agent-General he should approach the Commonwealth with a view to bringing about an amalgamation, so that the oflice might become of some practical value to Australia. Nothing came of my suggestion. I am satisfied that the people of Australia are anxious I suggest for something to be done on those lines. The expenditure on the High Commissioner's office is practically absorbed in banquets and receptions. Little or no business is done by the High Commissioner or the Agents-General.. When Mr Tom Price was Premier of South Australia he went to England, following the The expenditure on example of other peregrinating premiers I do not say that offensively, because I believe that every Premier should go abroad and make himself acquainted with The cost of upkeep of Austhe affairs of the Empire and of Europe. Mr Tom Price, unlike most That is too much money to Premiers, did not go to England for a holiday jaunt and to flaunt himself in his exalted position.

Every Australian who goes Home returns to this country with a pitiful story of the waste of money at Australia House. When Sir Henry Barwell was Premier of South Australia he toured the world, and on his return he told a doleful tale of the incapacity of our representatives in London to further the interests of this country. He even went so far as to obtain samples of our goods on sale in London, and to exhibit them at the Adelaide Town Hall. He showed that second-grade, instead of first-grade dried fruits were being sent from here to Great Britain. The present Attorney-General of South Australia, Mr Herman Homburg, has just returned from overseas and he tells a similar story. in suspending the activities of the DeI well remember a gentleman from Tasmania, when on a visit to England, looking into the subject of the disposal of Australian products from the business side. He went to an exhibition of Australian products, and told a friend who accompanied him that he would like to show him what Tasmanian apples were like; but, strangely enough, there was not an Australian apple on view, although New Zealand fruit was displayed. Senator McLachlan, who represented Australia at Geneva last year, has also considered the activities of Australia House, and regards has proved of real benefit to the taxour marketing arrangements in Great Britain as negligible, because we have no counter to the organizations there that can manipulate the markets. If someThat thing is not done by the Government to improve the position, public opinion will force it to take steps in that direction. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) will make the unification of the activities of the Commonwealth one of the trump cards of the Australian party. If he plays them well, he will, no doubt, at least get a trick or two, even if he does not obtain a grand slam. The Minister for Trade and Customs, who is now on his way to the Old Country, and who will, I am sure, acquit himself with credit, should make exhaustive inquiries into the work of Australia House to see if it can be made useful. If any business firm sent a man to England as its agent, it would judge the value of The criticism that he his work by results. The Commonwealth Government should adopt a similar attitude to Australia House. I think that it was the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) who once said that the commercial community should contribute directly to the cost of maintaining tbe office of our trade commissioner in the United States of America, and I agree with him. The work of Australia House should be distributed over three or four departments, which should be conducted by business men. The budget fails to show that any benefit has been derived from the expenditure that this institution has involved. Owing to the action of the Government velopment and Migration Commission it is difficult to know exactly the position in which the Commision now stands. Last session honourable members supporting the Government strongly advocated that commissions generally, and the Development and Migration Commission in particular, should be abolished. This to my mind was owing to their opposition to migration. But it would be a real loss to Australia if the Development and Migration Commission were disbanded, because this body, above all others, payers.

112,Mr M. Cameron (Barker) [2.36],"works in South Australia to the extent of nearly £1,000,000, including £374,000 for afforestation in the lower portion of the South East. My State, unfortunately, is not favoured with large belts of natural timber; but, owing to the work of the Development and Migration Commission, it now has a more vigorous policy of afforestation than any other State. The £374,000 made available for this purpose will enable South Australia to plant about 5,000 acres of forest land annually over a period of ten years. Hundreds of men are now employed in the work, and they are all Australians. They are unskilled labourers, and, if this work were not available to them, they would probably he unemployed. The commission has been investigating a large drainage scheme for an area of nearly 2,000,000 acres in the South East, which has proved to be most productive when properly drained. It is rather low-lying country, and owing to a ridge of hills that runs between this area and the sea, heavy expenditure is entailed by drainage. When it has been made suitable for occupation, it will provide land for hundreds of settlers in a district which has an assured rainfall, and in which droughts are unknown. Eventually, this area will probably be able to support almost as many people as the present population of the State. Therefore, I contend that the activities of the commission are of the utmost value, and I hope that the Government will do nothing to deprive South Australia of this money that is so necessary for its development. Development and Migration Commission has been made the subject of a political attack. Ever since its appointment the criticism has been heard that it is an expensive and useless body, designed to save Ministers from responsibility and work that they themselves should undertake. I hope that with the experience that the Government has already had, the Prime Minister will say frankly that these allegations are not justified. The commission does not do administrative work at all, and it does not enable any Minister to evade his responsibilities. It has never been used, nor can it be properly used, for such purposes. It is an institution founded on the proposition thai we ought to increase the population of Australia, if we can do so ou sound lines. But we can only do that if we are in a position to absorb and find useful work for new entrants into this country. That development and migration should go hand in hand is the foundation principle on which the commission was established. It is a mistake to bring migrants here to increase the population unless the country is able to absorb them, and provide them, as well as those who are already here with useful work. In the setting up of this commission that principle was explicitly adopted by the Commonwealth for the first time, and surely it must commend itself to all honourable members who think that it is possible to develop this country on wise lines, so that it may maintain a progressively increasing population. The Development and Migration Commission has been doing work in connection with the £34,000,00 migration agreement. That agreement provides that money shall be advanced by the British Government, subject to the condition that Australia takes a certain number of migrants ajl of whom are the nominees of the various State immigration agencies. The money is made available at cheap rates for developmental work by the States. The commission has performed a useful function in scrutinizing the proposals submitted under the agreement to determine whether they are economically sound. This is work that ought to be done, aud has never been done so well before. Honourable members who have had any Taolitical experience in the States must know that many so-called developmental schemes have been undertaken in Australia with disastrous results. They have beeu instituted for political purposes, and I am sorry to say that the practice still prevails in some States where the Development and Migration Commission has not been given an opportunity of investigating proposals. The commission has already performed very valuable services in checking and examining proposals for developmental work. The savings which the commission has already procured for Australia amount to far more than the commission has cost. An examination of the actual figures in the possession of the commission should convince the Government that this is true. I do not wish to refer at present to particular proposals",29,Peime Minister S Department

It is doing a poor service to any man to settle him on land under such conditions that, although he works hard for long hours, he can never earn even as much as the basic wage. In the case of a proposed irrigation, scheme, it wa3 shown that the undertaking would have led to the loss of millions of pounds.

Por political purposes attacks have been made on the. commissioii. More than anything else> we need in the country the best brains for the really big national jobs. Australia has been wonderfully well served by the members of the Development and Migration Commission. The practice of attacking such men, not for their own faults or shortcomings, but as a means of attack upon the Government responsible for their appointment, is going to have a very serious effect upon the development of Australia. Questions have repeatedly been asked in Parliament as to the salaries paid to the members of the commission. unless we are prepared to pay for brains, we shall not obtain the best brains. Only now and then do we find a man of great public spirit prepared to serve the country notwithstanding the criticism levelled against him on political grounds. If this persistent attack upon men occupying high public positions is continued we shall Mr Latham. find it increasingly difficult to obtain the services of first-class men. Honourable members know that the hostile criticism In and imputation of improper motives to which members of Parliament are subject prevents many desirable persons from entering the legislatures of Australia. It is unfortunate that the same harmful practice is beginning to operate in regard to other forms of public service. Only today a question was asked in this House regarding the salary paid to the Secretary to the Postal Department. That oflicer has worked wonders since he has occupied his position. He saves his large salary several times over each year. If we aim at the second-rate and the mediocre we shall get it.

There is also what is known Generally speaking, as the 3,000 farms scheme, the foundation of which has led to considerable expense.

The organization issues a monthly organ,in which have been published from time to time encomiums upon the wonderful work of the Development and Migration Commission. This work has been of inestimable value to the Government of Western Australia in carrying out its land settlement policy. I , as one representing a division of that State, have been repeatedly approached with requests that the Development and Migration Commission might be permitted to visit and report on certain areas him an efficient officer. with a view to their greater development. It has greatly encouraged the British Government to feel that 'the Development and Migration Commission is so critically examining all proposals for the expenditure of money under the migration agreement. really been in the position of an architect who prepares plans for the erection of a building. The members of the Commission are the architects of Australia's national development. Many persons residing in more or less fully developed States, like Victoria, do not realize the value of the work done by the Commission. Even in Victoria, however, as has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), the Commission was responsible for preventing the. unprofitable expenditure of. a very large sum of money on the Murray River waters scheme. I ask the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) to give an assurance that the Commission will not be abolished, or its activities restricted. It is due to the States that they should be consulted before any such action is taken. In Western Australia, for instance, the Government has had the advice of the Commission upon the 3,000 farms scheme, and upon proposals for supplying the area with water. The advice of the Commission has been of the greatest assistance to the Western Australian Government, and it has also been able to assure the British Government, which is providing £34,000,000 for developmental work in Australia, that the money is being well spent. To abolish the Commission now would be to follow a penny wise and pound foolish policy. [2.58] -The honourable member for Richmond( Mr R.

If honourable members will consider the organization in London and Australia, they must come to the conclusion that a very strict investigation is required to ascertain whether it is warranted.

We have not taken any definite action. We have made certain representations to the British Government, and its reply will be laid on the table to-morrow. We shall discuss the two propositions with the States in the middle of February next, before action of any description is taken. We have already formed certain opinions; there are others we have yet to form, but we shall come to no decision and form no final opinion, until the whole matter has been thoroughly investigated. made to the Government by any State, urging the continuance of the Development and Migration Commission ? direetly representations from any of the States. There has been press criticism, which to a large extent has been based upon misconception. I intend to have all the facts ready to place before the States in the middle of February. The matter will then be thoroughly discussed. Provision has been made on the Estimates to the extent of £2,000, for the training of domestic servants in England for service in Australia. My experience of my own family, and of the womanhood of Australia, convinces me that that is unwarranted. Formerly, the amount provided for this item was £5,000. I drew the attention of the late Prime Minister to the matter, and he promised to do his best to have the amount reduced. The subsidy to be paid this year to Burns Philp and Company for the provision of a mail service to the Islands of the Pacific is £52,000. The company has in that service the Makambo, the speed of which can be judged from the fact that if there should happen to be a high sea the passengers cannot tell whether the ship is progressing or going backward. The fares charged by the company also are out of all proportion to the distance travelled. I have frequently endeavoured to secure the withdrawal of this steamer. .When a fresh contract is about to be made, it is put in dock, where it is given a coat of whitewash inside and a fresh covering of paint outside, which gives it the appearance of a brand new steamer. Although under the terms of the contract the company has promised to replace it, no action in that direction has been taken, and it is still running between Australia and Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. The vessels used in that service should be comparable with those that trade along our coast. Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island are the gems of the Pacific, and from a health point of view cannot be excelled. If the steamers engaged in the service had suitable accommodation, there would be a very large trade to and from the Islands, with advantage to the commercial life there and beneficial results to those who wish to travel for their health; Only a few months ago the Makambo was compelled to seek refuge in Port Stephens for a day and a night.

But the amount able member for Cowper (Dr. Earle which is being allocated for that purpose Page), and I mention them in no at the present time is fairly substantial, censorious way.

[3.14] -In my budget speech I made a reference to this matter which, although brief, indicated that the Government had not yet determined the manner in which these funds shall be applied. We are aware, of course, that the late Government intended to utilize them to liquidate the accumulated deficit of the last couple of years. That Government also intended to apply to that purpose the surplus revenue of the present year. It was clear, when the present GovernI",33,Peime Minister S Department

128,Mr Theodore,"The honourable£112,500 had to be made. My predecessor might have saved £60,000 in respect of the maternity allowances by fulfilling the promises of his Government to amend the act in such a way as to make the . allowance payable to persons with a family income not exceeding £8 a week. The present Government does not intend to discriminate in the payment of the allowance; therefore that £60,000 must be provided. In regard to the £1,200,000 lying to the credit of the Expropriated Properties Account, it is true that that amount can be appropriated for revenue purposes or for the reduction of the accumulated deficit, or to augment the sinking fund. One of those courses will be adopted as soon as the Government has an opportunity to investigate the matter. The Government has been in office for only a few weeks, for the greater portion of which it has been closely occupied with parliamentary business and cabinet deliberations on urgent and imperative matters. We have had no opportunity to look thoroughly into many matters which, while important, can very well wait until thispprtion of the session is concluded. three years have been-1926-27 , £253,000; I assure the right honourable member for Cowper that the only reason why no decision has been reached in regard to the use of this £1,200,000, is that the Government has not had time to consider the matter in. all its bearings. I am satisfied with the Treasurer's assurance that the money will be utilized in . one of the three ways I mentioned. I wanted to be sure that the money would not be used for additional expenditure. The Treasurer's advance is usually sufficient to cover unforeseen demands, and so long as this trust money will be used for the reduction of the public debt or the accumulated deficit, or the relief of taxation, I am content. In regard to the increases of expenditure to which the Treasurer has referred, I stated last year that the Commissioner of Pensions had drawn attention to a general increase in the payments for invalid and old-age pensions, because the depression had resulted in many elderly people being unable to get work._ Despite that fact, the increase of expenditure above the estimate was only £188,000. In regard to invalid pensions, the last Government was giving attention to a suggestion that the basis for determining invalidity was unsound. The last Minister for Health and Repatriation ( Sir Neville Howse), and I were endeavouring to make the grounds for determining total and permanent incapacitation uniform with those upon which incapacity is determined in connection with war pensions. From our own medical knowledge, and the evidence of experts, we understood that if such an alteration were made, many cases of imposition and claims by persons who are not strictly entitled to pensions would be obviated. The Government intends to alter the basis on which the Iron and Steel Bounty is paid. This will involve an increased expenditure of about £9,000 a year, which, of course, is quite independent of my estimates. I pointed out previously that for the first five months of the financial year, bounty was paid on only 9,000 tons, of galvanized iron. Last year the total was 28,000 tons, and it is evident that the amount to be produced this year will be less. The bounty payments for the last 1927-28, £240,000; 1928-29, £205,000. In estimating the payments for this year I struck an average of those for the preceding three years; and on the information available there appears to be no reason for questioning the provision I made. The committee must have regard also to the possibility of certain savings. I pointed out that each year some decreases of expenditure occur which could not be anticipated, and they are a set-off against the unforeseen increases. I predict that the result this year will be very similar to that of last year. Proposed vote agree to. Proposed vote, £187,943. Will the Attorney-General indicate to the committee his intentions regarding the reporting branch, and state particularly whether he proposes that that branch shall undertake the reporting of the proceedings of the Tariff Board?

The effect of charging for these services was simply that one degreatly reduced. partment paid another for work done; if that principle were applied throughout the Commonwealth departments, there would be an enormous inflation of apparent expenditure and receipts. We decided that the reporting branch should give its services to other departments free of charge, in the same way as the Crown Law Department gives free advice to other departments, upon the many legal problems that arise from time to time. In the past the reporting of royal commissions, the Arbitration Court, the investigations of the Public Service Arbitrator, conferences, &c, has been done by the reporting branch, but the recording of evidence before the Tariff Board has been in the hands of a private firm, which has supplied transcripts as desired to the board and to interested parties. That is an important part of the work of the firm, and whether it be done by private contract or by the reporting branch it must be paid for. If the reporting branch does the work, the Attorney-General's Department has to provide the necessary staff; if it is done by a private contractor the report must be paid for by the Trade and Customs Department. the Tariff Board always been done in that way? lishment of the reporting branch, successive Attorneys-General and Ministers for Trade and Customs have decided that the reporting of the Tariff Board should be left to private enterprise.

The Estimates of the previous Government were prepared having in mind the probability of its industrial proposals being accepted by the people. Had they been accepted this vote could have been There is a vacancy in the position of Conciliation Commissioner. I have already referred in this chamber to the great service rendered to Australia by the late Mr A. M . Stewart, as Industrial Commissioner. In many cases Mr Stewart, by his readiness to assist parties in potential disputes, was able to close the breach, and so save the Arbitration Court a great deal of work. I trust that the Government will make every effort to fill this office without delay, and that the appointee will be a man of wide experience, high ability and character, and suitable temperament, so that he may be able to win the respect of all the parties with whom he will deal. With reluctance I feel that I must again return to an article which appeared in the press upon the morning of the day I handed over my office to my successor. This article alleged that the Investigation Branch of the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth police in Canberra had been used for the purpose of spying upon Labour members and civil servants in Canberra. I at once gave an unqualified denial to the statement, and I am glad that the Attorney-General, in reply to a question that reporting of I asked him on the subject, said that he accepted without qualification the assurance of the officers concerned that there had been no such espionage, and that the dossier supposed to exist had never existed. I could have wished that the Attorney-General had not waited for my question to defend the It was not a matter that affected myself merely as Attorney-General, but it affected all the officers of the department. available the facilities of this House and also the public platforms of the country The matter to refute any innuendoes or charges of political espionage; but the officers of the department, and public servants generally, are not in that position.

Nothing would be more discreditable to an Attorney General, who has charge of the administration of the law, than that he should use the special investigating facilities of his department for the purpose of conducting political espionage, and I am glad that the present Attorney-General has said that the charges made were entirely untrue and unfounded. The officers of our public departments, I am glad to say, serve successive ministries, irrespective of their political complexions, with equal fidelity and loyalty, and I trust that the time is far distant when it will be otherwise. Consequently, they should be protected in every possible way from anonymous abuse. An item appears in the Estimates for this department of £5,000 to cover the expenditure on industrial peace tribunals. For a long time. I have been very dissatisfied with the continuance of expenditure upon these tribunals. Had the proposals of the last Government been accepted by the people the tribunals would have been abandoned and this expenditure saved. Surely all honourable members, irrespective of their party associations, must agree that these tribunals have failed utterly. I do not desire to use any words that will provoke acrimony, but the fact is that we are in the midst of one of the most upsetting disturbances that the coal industry has suffered for many years. Theoretically these industrial peace tribunals should be able to take steps to settle the dispute, but practically they can do nothing, for neither party to the dispute will use them. One of the main reasons for this is that no one in the community can say with certainty whether there are any existing valid awards made by the tribunals. The main hewing rate for coal was fixed in 1920-21 and it was expressly provided that it should remain in force for one year. No one can say definitely whether that award has any legal force or effect to-day. No one will remove this body, and no one can say whether its carcass is animate or dead. In connection with the present coal dispute the Attorney-General summoned a compulsory conference of the parties. It could not reach an agreement, and nothing Mr Latham. happened. The chairman had no power to determine the issues placed before the conference. Theoretically these tribunals are ready to consider any demand that the owners may make for a reduction of wages or an alteration of conditions or to hear any appeal that the men may make for a reconsideration of existing conditions, but neither party will constitute them. The provision made for a quorum is of such a character that if either party fails to attend a sitting of a tribunal, it cannot function. Of course that provision could be altered, but if it were altered it would mean that the decision would, in almost every case, be made by one man, the chairman of the tribunal. As long as this Parliament is obliged to operate under its present limited power in dealing with industrial disputes, we must have an unsatisfactory position. The Commonwealth has power in regard to interstate disputes only. No one can say with certainty whether the awards made by the industrial peace tribunals 'have been made only in cases of interstate disputes. Mr Hibble, the chairman of the tribunals, has been good enough to act in a voluntary capacity, and has done good work. Many of the matters dealt with by the tribunals have concerned only isolated collieries. The plain fact is that the tribunals are unworkable in times of emergency, when they are most needed. The New South Wales Government has complete power to deal with the coal industry, subject to any existing federal award. But its actions have been more or less palsied and hesitant for a long time on account of the uncertainty as to whether there are any existing federal awards. the Opposition think that the people should be asked immediately to equip this Parliament with complete power to deal with industrial matters? myself definitely on that subject at the moment. I should certainly want to examine specific proposals of that nature before I discussed them. Various proposals have been submitted to the people from time to time with the object of securing greater industrial power for the Commonwealth.

One reason for that was that every possible effort was made to secure the maximum agreement between the different political parties before tlie proposals were submitted to the people. statement of the case. pened since 1926. fically with 1926. I know that every effort was made to obtain unanimity in this House at that time, with the satisfactory result that 80 members in the two Houses of Parliament favoured the proposal and only three voted against it. I was one who consulted the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Charlton, on this subject, and I know very well that what I am saying is the truth in relation to the subject. Unfortunately the electors were very much divided on the subject and the proposals were defeated. However, this is hardly an appropriate occasion Eor me to discuss potential constitutional amendments. My object in referring to this subject is to point out that the existtrol. It only remains, therefore, to ing industrial peace tribunals are unworkable and therefore we should not incur heavy expenditure in relation to them. I suggest that it is not advisable any longer to provide money for machinery which, so far from being of assistance in bringing the coal trouble to an end, has proved to be a positive impediment. -Some observations which have fallen from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) make pertinent, a review of the position presented to us by the Estimates. It is proposed under Division 34 to expend £15,679 for the purposes of a court of conciliation and arbitration. ""With much that the Leader of the Opposition said I agree, but T should like to direct my remarks to the whole case, as I see it, and I shall be brief. I understand that the Government proposes to introduce some legislation that will modify, perhaps improve, the present machinery of the court. The proposals of the Government, looked at against the background of recent events, the smoking embers of which still seem to obscure the vision of some honourable gentlemen are farcical. Unless and until the Constitution is amended there are no means by which we can hope to give the people what they are entitled to: that peace and progress in industry, so essential to the welfare of this country. It is of no use to waste time in legislation to patch up once again a fabric of shreds and patches in this court, in preparing, and a continual source of disappointment to employers and employees. I am dealing speciWe have had a serious difference of opinion in this country lately on this very question, and some honourable gentlemen are beginning to realize that they did not choose the wiser way. It is agreed by all that uniformity is an essential factor in maintaining peace and progress in industry. The people have decided in the most unmistakable manner that they are not prepared to secure uniformity by handing over the control of industrial matters to the States. About that there can be no difference of opinion. The people have spoken; they are sick of conflicting awards and clashing jurisdiction; but they do not believe that these things can be swept away by State conclothe this national Parliament with f u l l industrial powers. I understand that the Government intends to summon an industrial conference of representatives of industrial organizations to discuss this subject from every aspect in order to give advice to the Government. May I be permitted to point out that no such conference is necessary at this stage. One course, and only one, must be followed, the Commonwealth must have f u l l industrial powers. Once we have these powers it may be necessary to have a conference to decide how we are going to use them. But first of all we must get them. A plain declaration by the Government of its intention to amend the Constitution, and to make that an outstanding feaure of the next session, would do much to relieve the tension of the minds of all sorts and conditions of people who are prepared to accept the position as it",37,Riley Di D The Honourable I Am Able To Defend Myself I Have

What we want is peace in industry, and this is. impossible as long as long as there people. We know what those amendare seven codes of industrial laws. A decision recently given by the High Court in the case of the American Dry Cleaning Company makes confusion worse confounded. We are every day being shown newer and more alarming aspects of arbitration.

Nothingin the world could be more conducive to industrial unrest. be more repugnant to the natural sense of justice which, I trust, is inherent in us all, or, at any rate,is accepted by us as the only basis upon which government can be carried on.

It depends on the Constitution. may be a difference of opinion; but that can be decided only after litigation, after more and more disappointments, and after more and more money has been expended. Let us begin now, after all these years of bitter disappointment, travail, and experiment in various directions, to demolish this crazy edifice and construct in its place a new and lasting structure on deep and sure foundations. The only amendment of the Constitution that ""will be of service is one that will give this National Parliament full industrial power. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) suggested that the people are not prepared to grant the powers that we require. gestion. last attempt to amend the Constitution had been endorsed by 90 per cent, of opposition-and , despite that, the proposed amendments were rejected by the ments were. One went in the direction that most of us wanted to go; but there was another about which many of us, myself included, had serious misgivings. Whatever may have been the result of the compact in this House with Mr Charlton, the fact remains, that organized labour was not prepared to accept the proposals of the Government. But organized labour was certainly not alone in its opposition to those proposals. A very considerable number of persons who, in their weaker moments, voted for the late Attorney General, strongly opposed them, otherwise The award does not they would not have been defeated by such an overwhelming majority. I want to remind the present AttorneyNothing could General( Mr Brennan) that the amendments submitted in 1913 and 1919, which sought to clothe this Parliament with full industrial powers, came within 1 per cent, in 1913, and less than 1 per cent, in 1919, of being approved by the people. The amendments submitted by the late Government weredefeated by a majority greater than that recorded against any previous proposals submitted to the people by way of referendum. What is wanted is not a conference to consider what powers we want, but a decision of the Government to ask the people to give us full industrial powers. When we have them we can decide what we shall do with them. While I do not deny that we must keep the machinery of conciliation and arbitration moving, I am confident that it is only giving the people a stone when they are entitled to bread. "" We know very well, when we tell them that we will work for industrial peace, and endeavour to put before them legislation that will make for the progress of this country and ensure peace in industry, that these are idle words; that peace in industry is impossible unless and until the national Parliament is given full powers over this vitally important national matter.

If this Parliament had full indushave emanated. trial powers, I venture to say that something might have been done under the Industrial Peace Act. I therefore urge the Attorney-General to give this matter his serious and earnest consideration. 1 ask the Government to make an early declaration of its intention to amend the Constitution. Government will not listen to any suggestion to stop short of the demand for full industrial powers. Unemployment is the great problem of the day. We have now 12.1 per cent, unemployed in this country, the largest percentage in our history. Somehow or other this Government has to find employment for those people; but how is it to do that, when it has no power over industrial matters? This Government has tabled an amended tariff schedule; but it has no power whatever to deal with the effects, whatever they may be-the industrial or economic effects that result from it ; it is tied hand and foot. This Government is now on its trial. It has been given an opportunity, after fifteen years of opposition, to show what it can do, but unless it demands that these shackles shall be struck off its limbs, it cannot hope to make good. I earnestly counsel it to make a declaration, firm and definite, that it stands for the amendas they then were. They take us back ment of the Constitution, and for clothing this national Parliament with full industrial powers, and powers to deal with all national matters.

I do not lay claim to a very full sum of human knowledge upon any subject, and certainly not upon that of industrial powers; but I am in the happy position of being able to say that, personally, I have always been a consistent advocate of the amplification of the powers of this Parliament. I have always supported such proposals, from whatever source they able to say, too, that the same may be said of every member of the present Government, and it certainly may be stated, confidently, of the Government as a whole. We stand for I sincerely hope that the that as a matter of policy. Though it has been borne long, it should be regarded as intolerable for the future, that the powers of this Parliament should be so circumscribed by the arbitrary instrument under which we work that, as a Parliament, we are unable to act effectively in many instances with regard to the minor matters with which we should be able to deal. Certainly we are not able to cope with any outstanding, serious industrial problems that might arise for decision. This Parliament will never he able to legislate satisfactorily for the peace, order and good government of Australia until the people have enfranchised it for the purpose of solving these problems. I believe that our difficulties and limitations in this regard are deep-rooted and historic, and that they go back to that period when in the development of early Australia it was found necessary to set up local government in the various colonies, to the time when the people of Victoria held high holiday because the colony of Victoria was separated from the colony of New South Wales. It was natural that, there should be high holiday then, because inadequate provision-scarcel y any provision-ha d been made for the local government of Victoria, and what applied to that colony applied also to the others That condition had to be amended and ended, and, in my opinion, we went the wrong road in ending and mending it. Instead of establishing effective local government under a united Australia, we set up theseI am almost tempted to call them-pett y sovereignties all over the Commonwealth, and we invested them with full sovereign powers.

We caused a rivalry, an unwholesome rivalry between them, which has not died down, but which has increased in intensity in its influence for separating the various parts of Australia, until to-day, whenever an appeal is made for greater powers for the nation as a whole, it is taken as a challenge to the various local sovereignties that are desirous of maintaining and retaining their territorial and local powers. Sometimes I almost despair about inducing the people to look on this subject unhampered in their judgment, from the point of view of Australia as a whole. possible. orable gentleman's optimism, and I admire it, too, because he is familiar with the history of this matter. He knows, as many of us do, how this prejudice against Australia has developed within Australia itseK, and it is a prejudice that must be broken down. It must be realized that the claim for "" Australia a united nation"" is a real one, and that these local sovereignties are not separate bodies of people, but groups of Australian citizens, each one of whom has an interest in developing the ideal of Australia as a nation. I do not know that this is a particularly appropriate occasion for speaking at large on this great and grave matter. This Government has only recently come into power. Its members did not begin, as a government, to advocate greater powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. Its members asked and they have consistently asked, that these powers shall be invested in the Government of Australia, whatever the political complexion of that Government might be, so long as it reflected popular opinion. Labour unions opposed the proposals sub that, consistently with its policy and platmitted at the last referendum for inform, it will, at no far distant date, take creased powers. true that there was a division of opinion on the Labour side as to the particular propositions submitted. and there was a division on both sides. was a division of opinion amongst Labour kind of governmental representatives, and it is also true that the form in which the questions were submitted to the people left the proposals open to considerable objection and valid criticism, inasmuch as the amplified authority, so far as industrial power was concerned, was not to be placed directly in the Parliament itself, but, in a somewhat apologetic manner, it was to be given to instruments crea'ted by the Parliament. But with all the limitations of the powers then sought, and there were many, and having regard to all the objections that might justly he raised against the proposals of the then Government, notwithstanding the fact that I , as a representative of the Labour party at the time, was strongly opposed in matters of principle to that Government, I was ono of the overwhelming majority in this Parliament-indeed , there was only a minority of one or two-wh o stoutly supported those proposals, and continued to support them until they were overwhelmingly defeated. Whatever difference there may have been in the ranks of the Labour party, it must be acknowledged that capitalism in Australia displayed tremendous enthusiasm to defeat those proposals, and I think that one of the stoutest and most persistent representatives of capitalism, who directed all his oratory and influence against them, was the gentleman behind whom the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) stood in his campaign against the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) at the last election. I do not propose to say anything further about the amendment of the Constitution, except, perhaps, to add that this Government will realize its responsibility in this matter, ""and not by any means put the subject behind it as something not to be considered.

I need hardly say that I was satisfied with the disclaimers of responsible officers in the Law Department itself, and I said so. But when I read allegations, couched in very, general terms, regarding spying into the doings of the members of the Public Service and others, I did not become hectic or excited about it, and I do not think that there was any occasion for the Leader of the Opposition to fan himself into a state of indignation over it to-day. If we were to become worked up over everything that appears in bold type in the newspapers, relating to matters of this kind, we should be in a constant state of undue excitement. No names had been mentioned in the press story, and no definite facts were alleged. It did not seem to me, therefore, that it was the business of an incoming Attorney-General to set in motion any kind of court or commission of inquiry merely because some more or less sensational statements had appeared in the press. I was open then, as I am now, to receive and assess the value of any information which might be afforded to me in regard to the allegations.

I merely say that, judging from the history of private investigation work under the Commonwealth, and the operations of the Commonwealth Police, I feel that the Investigation Branch should be, as a matter of duty, thoroughly sifted and investigated by the Government. I hope to have in the future more detailed reports of the enlargement of the industrial respecting its operations, so that I shall be able to determine whether it renders to the Commonwealth services adequate to the expenditure necessary for its maintenance. There should be a closer association than that. which exists at the predoubt in my mind as to the reason for the sent time between the officers and the head of the department. It is undesirable that a roving commission should be given to any branch of the department to conduct inquiries Avithout furnishing to the responsible head of the department regular and detailed reports, showing preare keenly desirous of destroying the fedcisely the nature of those inquiries and their cost. Nothing that I have said is to be taken as a reflection upon any of these officers. I have met some of them, and they appear to be both capable and conscientious. In that respect I have no comthe confidence of the people greater plaint to make.

The question powers of the Commonwealth has been submitted to the people on many occasions, and the result, in the different States, has always been decisively against the Commonwealth. There is very little refusal of the people to grant .the additional powers sought by the Commonwealth. Almost since its inception this Parliament has contained a number of unificationists. They have become greedy of power, and now a large number eration. I can assure honourable members that had the States not had reserved to them the control of their domestic affairs, we should not have had a federation today. Possiblyi f this Parliament had won powers would have been given to it ; but this they have failed to do.

177,Mr Bbennan,"I spoke for thisobtain greater power. Tbese two great political parties appealed to the people to give increased powers to the Commonwealth, and the proposal was emphatically rejected. The then honourable member for Wannon quoted in this chamber figures relating to the votes cast in the constituencies of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham), the then Prime Minister, and the present Prime Minister, which showed clearly that the people desired to have State tribunals to look after their interests. It is absurd to say that the recent election was fought on one issue. If the last Government had desired to commit political suicide it could not have succeeded better than it did; because, just prior to the election, it brought down a budget which led the people to believe that their interests were to be vitally affected. There were a great many issues before the people. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has urged that the Commonwealth should have wider powers. He has been largely responsible for a great deal of the industrial legislation that we have upon the statute-book. It was he who brought forward, in connection' with the coal-mining industry, industrial peace legislation which took out of the hands of the Federal Arbitration Court the regulation of that industry. We have not to seek far to find what has been the result of that political interference. There has hardly been a day's peace in the industry at Newcastle since that measure was introduced. The central governing authority in Canada has never sought to obtain control of the provincial legislatures. in Canada has much greater power than that which is possessed by this Parliament. [Quorum formed.'] timber-workers in Western Australia asked specially to be relieved from the operation of an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. They prefer to work under a State award. They are so far from the seat of government, and it is so difficult to have their case properly presented, that I am perfectly satisfied that the people of that State would reject a proposal to give to this Parliament absolute control of industrial regulation. Therefore, I hope that the Government will give very serious consideration to this matter before it agrees to the expenditure of a large sum of money on another referendum. have voted for every proposal to take a referendum of the people, with the exception of the referendum on conscription. On the last occasion the Labour party was favorable to it, but the industrial community were opposed to it because of their hostility to Mr Bruce. In that way thousands of votes were lost. One reason of the failure of the previous referendums was thai abstract questions drafted by legal men were put before the people, who could not understand them, and in their uncertainty they took the safe course of voting against any alteration of the Constitution. Some years ago, when I was still in business, I had. an opportunity to explain to some of my wealthy customers why they should vote in favour of grant ing more powers to the Commonwealth, and they were satisfied to follow my advice. Their friends, however, not understanding the issue, recorded a negative vote. Before the people are asked to vote on a proposal to amend the Constitution they should understand thoroughly what is asked of them. When the Fisher Government appealed by referendum to the people a very fine pamphlet, setting' forth the case for and against, was distributed, and did a great deal to educate the public mind. I think this Parliament would make more rapid progress in the enlargement of its powers if it would take the risk of passing the legislation which it thinks desirable, and leave to dissenting persons the responsibility of testing it before the High Court. After all, judges are human beings, and they are not beyond the influence of public opinion. The American Congress has frequently gone beyond the constitution, and usually the decisions of the courts have reflected the opinion of the people. L believe that the present judges of the High Court are not too law-bound to respond to the will of the majority of the electors. Much good might result from an industrial peace conference if sufficient care were taken in chosing the personnel.

180,Mr West (East Sydney) [4.43],"1conference convened by Mr Bruce was that many of the delegates representing the employers were tories in whom the workers had no confidence. them. I had met in conference when I was secretary of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, and invariably they wound up by saying "" These chaps want something which they will not get. Why should we not manage our businesses as we choose? We are the proprietors, and we shall not accept dictation from others."" From men holding such views little in the way of compromise and understanding of the other fellow's point of view can be expected. When Sir Henry Parkes appointed the Labour Commission in 1890 he appointed as chairman Dr. Garran, at that time editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, and a man of judgment and intelligence. The other delegates were six representatives of the trade union organizations and six representatives of industry; but the latter were not proprietors or masters. For instance, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was represented by Mr Cruikshank, an able employee of the company with a thorough knowledge of the details of the industry, and the Hunter River Steamship Company by its chief engineer. The commission did great work, which was the foundation of the Arbitration Act of New South Wales. Mr B. R. Wise drafted the measure, and it originated in the Legislative Council. In recent years the lawyers have had too big a part in arbitration, and they have been the curse of the system. a lawyer? tarian ideals. The quibbles, objections, and evasions on the part of lawyers have cost the trade unions hundreds of thousands of pounds, and defeated the intention of the act. The court has become an institution in which the workers have no confidence, because they have seen how wealthy corporations are able, by briefing the most eminent lawyers, to defeat the true spirit of conciliation and arbitration. I would like to see a peace conference convened; but, unless the delegates are persons in whom both Bides have confidence, very little benefit may be expected from their deliberations. I hope this Parliament will re-asseinble early in February, and continuously apply itself to'problems of urgent importSome of ance to the welfare of Australia. This Government should not, like its predecessors, meet Parliament for a few weeks and then, without having done anything of importance, hurry into the haven of recess. Having the support of an absolute majority of the members of this House, the Government has an opportunity to do the work which the people expect of it. I congratulate the Attorney-General on his reference to the officers of his department. I have met many of them privately and officially, and I believe that, as his experience of them extends, his pride in them will increase. regret that, owing to the pressure of public business, the Government has not been able in this brief session to submit a proposal to seek from the people additional power for this Parliament. I hope that in the forefront of the Government's programme, when the Parliament reassembles early in the New Year, will be comprehensive proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. The greatest difficulty that confronts the Labour party in office is the manifold restrictions contained in the Federal Constitution. We have inherited our Parliamentary system from Great Britain, but the British Parliament is in a very different positionfrom that of Australia. We are restricted in our legislative action because we are bound hy the interpretations of the Constitution by the High Court. I suggest that a thorough overhaul of the Constitution is needed. It .is impossible to secure this by the ordinary method of asking the people for specific powers to do certain things. I hope that the Government, in due course, will consider the advisableness of asking the people to give this Parliament full power to amend the Constitution. There could be certain safeguards in relation to the franchise and other matters which should not be interfered with except after a specific referendum. I desire to see this Parliament clothed with sovereign legislative authority. It is directly answerable to the",45,Riley Di D The Honourable I Am Able To Defend Myself I Have

It has no written Constitution; its powers are based upon tradition and convention. The British Parliament could, to-morrow, alter the whole basis of its system of government by passing an act through both Houses. It could abolish the monarchy, or bring about almost any other revolutionary change. As one prominent constitutional have declared, "" the only thing that the British Parliament cannot do in the exercise of its legislative authority is to change the sexes."" In other words the British Parliament is sovereign in every respect. Our Parliament, on the other hand, is hamstrung, hobbled and impeded by a Constitution which we have altogether outgrown. If the people of Australia were asked to grant this Parliament the power to amend the Constitution and make it a flexible document to suit the changing impulses of time and evolution I believe that they would do it. If such an alteration were made, this body would become a convention as well as a Parliament, and elections would be fought upon great issues of constitutional reform such as the abolition of the-States, distinguish between the conferring of the creation of new States, and the unifying of the functions of Government. Seeing that the State Parliaments have sovereign rights except to the extent that they have been limited by the Federal Constitution, I cannot see why the proposition that I have made' should not be accepted by the Government. I hold that the people have refused to grant additional power to this Parliament in the past because they have felt that the changes that would be made in the Constitution would be irrevocable. We have had difficulty in trying to educate the people on constitution questions. There should be no limit to the power of this Parliament. If a particular government misused the power reposed in it, the people could turn it out of office. I trust this side of the chamber, that we should that in the near future we shall be given an opportunity of considering the making of comprehensive alterations in the Constitution, and that a proposal will be made which will*render unnecessary in the future the adoption of the traditional methods of altering the Constitution. Mr Coleman. of the most important problems of government with which the people of Australia are faced relates to the preserving of industrial order. A comprehensive overhaul of the Commonwealth Constitution would involve many serious considerations. Any proposals for the amendment of the Constitution must awaken rivalries in the States, and between the various economic interests of the country authority is said to as well as differences between people of varying political opinions. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said this afternoon that our immediate duty was to endeavour to get full power for this Commonwealth. He did not think that we need concern ourselves, at the moment, with the use to which such power might be put. Yet that is the main question which always exercises the minds of the people. The electors have hitherto voted in the negative on referendum proposals because they have been apprehensive of the use to which any additional power might be put; in other words, they distrust the Commonwealth Parliament. They have been unable to additional power and the exercising of it, or between the agency and the use to which it might be put. We would be wise to give close attention to this aspect of the subject, and do our best to combat any legitimate or illegitimate fears in this connection. The practical difficulty of persuading the Australian people that, for the purpose of achieving industrial order, it is necessary to equip this Parliament with additional powers is that this would be to the disadvantage of the States. But the present economic difficulty will remain insoluble unless we are granted additional power. I suggest, therefore, particularly to my friends on seek, at this juncture, not an overhaul of the Constitution in its entirety but only additional power to deal with industrial relations. This would involve, not only a consideration of the attitude of employers to employees, but also of the attitude of the Commonwealth towards certain State instrumentalities.",46,Riley Di D The Honourable I Am Able To Defend Myself I Have
184,Mr Curtin (Premantle) [5.7],"-On eThere can be no doubt that the sovereign power of the States has been to some extent interfered with by the statutes passed by this Parliament. The States have not now complete authority over their own affairs, financial or otherwise. For example, an appropriation bill passed by this Parliament may have a serious effect upon a State, although the State is supposed to exercise sovereign rights over its citizens. The State Parliaments have quite definitely resented the manner in which this Parliament has invaded their authority. sovereign rights, but, practically, they have not. In these circumstances, it is of supreme importance that there should be a thorough investigation to discover the extent to which there is invasion by the Commonwealth and*State Parliaments of the nominally sovereign rights of each other. An endeavour should be made to define, not perfectly but reasonably, the respective ambits of these conflicting governmental entities. In all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that any attempt on the part of this Parliament at this moment to obtain absolute political authority would fail. people are not ready to crown with success any ambitious effort of a revolutionary character to make this Parliament in Canberra the sovereign and exclusive legislative machine for Australia. What we need at present is not a conference between employers and employees, but a conference between the States and the Commonwealth, who, at present, may be regarded as partners in the legislative control of Australia. For Western Australia, for example, tion to an award of the Commonwealth two authorities make the law, the ParliaCourt. In this instance, the Commonment of that State and the Parliament of wealth has no power to make ar. the Commonwealth.

It is true that the limiParliament, in the light of what they tations under which this Parliament believe to be its political effect. effect. [45] that political effect will vary according to what party is in power. We cannot disregard the political consequences of constitutional change. It is true that, in respect of the proposals of 1926, I found myself out of' harmony with representatives of my party, who, particularly in Victoria, and to a less extent in New South Wales, favoured the proposed amendments. I did not support them, for two reasons; first, because the proposed change would not have enTheoretically, they have larged the sovereign powers of this Parliament, and would merely have conferred upon existing instrumentalities a sort of super authority to deal with the problem of industry; and, secondly, because it would have placed the exercise of this terrific power in the command of honourable members opposite, whose handling of the industrial problem generally had destroyed the true relations between employers and employees. The previous Government seemed to regard the employers as having a sort of proprietorial right over their workmen. One argument of the right honorThe able member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) did not appear, to me to be valid. He said that the coal problem in New South Wales could not be settled because of the limitation of the powers of this Parliament. If absolute legal power, irrespective of its uses, is the basis on which the coal problem can be solved, I submit that the New South Wales Parliament has sovereign power to settle the dispute.

186,Mr Curtin,"Yes. The estimate of the evacuation by this Parliament of a field in which it already operates, would in no way improve the situation. Those who have special interests in industries, and legislative duties to perform, are gradually recognizing that Australia possesses a two-armed system of Government. It is no use saying that the right arm should be stronger than the left, or vice versa. ""We have inherited this constitutional dilemma. I see failure for any attempt by one party in power in this Parliament, to take from the States without their agreement any of their industrial powers, because the rank and file of the party in opposition would support the States. That has happened in the past, and it is idle for us to deny it. ways. conference of employers and employees, instead of attempting to unite both political parties in this Parliament upon a common recommendation for constitutional change in respect of industry^ it would be preferable for the States and the Commonwealth to confer together, with a view to grappling with this dilemma. tried that, with results disastrous to itself. the Premier's Conference, but the Premiers asked that the Commonwealth vacate the industrial field altogether. something quite different from what I am suggesting. be various forms of conferences; but an attempt was made along those lines. Minister approached the States and said, "" ""Will you give us everything ?"" They said ""No. "" The States were not asked to confer so as to arrive at a common basis for improving the industrial position. There are certain things which the ( States believe that the Commonwealth could do better than themselves. Among them are the solving of a number of social problems. Unemployment insurance is one of these. It is unfair to ask any State to undertake unemployment insurance. I believe that, broadly speaking, the States would agree that the basic wage, from the stand-point of its commodity value-the standard of life-properl y comes within the scope of federal power. Neither this Parliament, nor any court that it established, would get the States to agree that every little variation in conditions, such as camping allowance, dirt money and one hundred and one other things which come within the scope of industrial regulation, should be subject only to Commonwealth sovereignty. That would be wrong. The States will not hand over everything. Domestic servants, for instance, should not be the subject of Commonwealth law, because they are not engaged in any interstate industry. They do not compete one with the other. with railway workers. ' from another viewpoint. There is the problem of the capitalization of the railways and their economic future. One can see reasons for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the State railways ; but not without their consent. railways is very different from the fixing of the industrial conditions of railway workers. monwealth acquired the railways, its instrumentalities should regulate the wages and conditions of the railway workers. Our industrial difficulties will be greatly aggravated by delay, and I suggest that we shall surely delay the solution of this problem if we try to load it with the whole body of constitutional powers required by this Parliament. That might well stand over. The Constitution has recently been reviewed by the constitutional commission, and very many of the conclusions and recommendations of both the majority and minority on that commission will be most helpf u l in bringing about a solution of our industrial difficulties. There should be an agreement between the States and the Commonwealth as to their respective powers. I believe that the States at present would agree, without any enlargement of the industrial powers of the Commonwealth,",48,Riley Di D The Honourable I Am Able To Defend Myself I Have

There should be no variation of the conditions of employment in various States in the same industries. obtained for 25 years. reason why we should deal with the problem now. I hope that we have profited by the failure that has attended previous efforts. The influences that have contributed to the defeat of the referendum proposals in the past are still operating, and we must try new methods to secure the necessary reform. -The honourable member who has just resumed his seat is usually clear in his presentation of an argument, but I must confess that the speech that he has just concluded has left me bewildered. Either this Parliament should possess increased industrial powers, or it . should not. I believe that it is entitled to them, and, until it has them, its functions cannot be properly discharged. It is the duty of the the railway freights on those particular present Government, particularly with the majority it has behind it, and having regard to the issue upon which it was elected, to attempt at once to solve the constitutional difficulties in which this Parliament finds itself. I believe that we shall ultimately acquire the power we seek, and that that power can be secured without an infringement of the sovereign rights of .the States. I rise more particularly to refer to a -matter of local importance. In the office competition of the New South Wales of the Attorney-General at present, there is a case involving a dispute between the New South Wales and the Queensland milling authorities in connection with the transportation of flour on the Queensland railways. A deputation of New South Wales flour-millers recently waited on the Attorney-General to present their side of the case, and I am bound to say that, from what I have been able to gather from their statements to the Minister, they have taken a one-sided stand. It was said by the deputation that an unconstitutional act had been' committed, but I submit that nothing unconstitutional has been done. I think that inquiry will show that for many years several New South Wales industries have been acting contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, to the detriment of Queensland. The New South Wales-millers, in particular, have been about the biggest sinners in this respect. The f.o.b. price of flour ex Sydney for Queensland is now at least 10s. a ton less than that for the Sydney home trade, and for years it has been the practice of the New South Wales millers' combine to dump flour and offals into Queensland. In addition, those millers enjoy a concession in railway freights on flour and offals sent over the New South Wales railways. No honourable member can dispute these facts. The effect of the concession, which is given by way of rebates, is that flour can be landed at Wallangarra from Sydney, a distance of 492 miles, at a cost of 5s. 6d. a ton, which is only the cost of taking flour from a Sydney mill to a Sydney bakehouse. The cost of railing Queensland flour and offals or Queensland maize from Wallangarra to Sydney, however, is 19s. l i d . a ton. Thus there is a discrimination in commodities as between Queensland and New South Wales. In consequence of the treatment to which Queensland has been subjected, the market for Queensland wheat has been imperilled, and particularly for wheat grown on the Darling Downs, which is, after all, the principal, if not the only wheat-growing area in that State, apart from the Maranoa district. A market can be found for this wheat only as flour and offals, and the millers has been one of the facts to which we have had to address ourselves.

202,Mr Morgan (Darling Downs) [5.33].,"prejudiced the interests of both primary and secondary industries in Queensland for many years; but it has been possible for the Queensland Government to bring about an understanding between the wheat board and the millers, which is now operating very satisfactorily. The agreement is now operating for the first time, though not without considerable opposition from certain quarters, and I regret to say from certain interests of growers. But I think that the arrangement is proving satisfactory, and, that when this season's operations are closed, even its opponents will have to admit that something very useful has been done for the wheat producers of Queensland. The success of the agreement was threatened by the railway rates quoted in New South Wales. In the understanding between the Wheat Board and the millers in Queensland, the immediate objective is to produce on the Darling Downs sufficient wheat for Queensland's needs, with a later objective of providing a surplus for export; but if discriminatory rates are to prevail as between one State and another, an act of injustice will be perpetrated. It was with the idea of rectifying that injustice that the Queensland railway authorities advised au adjustment of the rates hitherto prevailing, and the Newcarry wool from the warehouse to the South Wales millers complained to the Attorney-General that this would be an infringement of the law relating to interstate trade. I may say on that point that, in framing the freight rates on the Queensland railways, the authorities in that State did no more than copy, word for word, and letter for letter, the regulaother similar matters, the better it will tions governing those matters that obtain in New South Wales. I have before me a copy of the schedule of the rates operatselves up in defiance of those who grow ing on the Queensland railways, as well as a copy of those imposed by the New South Wales railways authorities. I am moved to speak on this matter, particularly, by reason of the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), in the course of a recent debate, when he taunted Queensland with doing something that was unfair, and was resented by New South Wales. I submit that nothing unfair has been done by Queensland, and that, in all the circumstances, the Attorney-General, when he considers the matter, will find that Mr Morgan. what I have said is correct. He will see that what has been done has been of distinct benefit to the great wheat-producing interests of Queensland. I have been tempted to rise because of the remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan), and also because I desire to stress the need for further industrial powers for this Parliament. Both wheat and wool-growers are penalized by the differential railway freights, and by the operations of the brokers. Some time ago, a party of graziers in the north-west of New South Wales formed a company, by which they thought that they would be able to ship wool and wheat at the port of Newcastle. Two sales have been held with the approval of the Wool Council, and they have proved most successful. Although they have that approval, although sales have been held for two years, although the railways of New South Wales are losing £60,000 a year because of this arrangement, and although the wool producers themselves are losing a further £60,000 in extra freight, the brokers are fighting to prevent the sales being held in Newcastle. The Federal Government has no power to interfere in this matter. In Sydney the railways will wharf free of charge; but in Newcastle, if such carriage is necessary, it has to be paid for. These things are to the detri ment of the primary producers of Australia, and the sooner the Government seeks from the people, by way of referendum, increased power to control this and be for Australia. It is scandalous to think that a group of brokers can set themthe wool; that such a group can insist upon the wool-growers sending their wool 100 miles further to be marketed in Sydney. These agents ought to be cleared out of the way, so that trade may follow its natural bent. I have no desire to prolong this discussion, but I feel that I must reply to a statement of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin).

In the first place it would, I think, be utterly impossible to secure agreement among the representative's of six State governments of various shades of political colour. There is some point in the honourable member's statement that the State representatives were not asked to consider this particular aspect of the matter when they previously refused to concede increased industrial powers to the Commonwealth. The difficulty, as I see it, is that the proposal of speak for the rural areas which I reprethe honourable member for Fremantle would involve the passage of uniform State legislation, because obviously it would be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to exercise certain powers in one State which it could not exercise in another. The proposal would involve an agreement to put through both Houses of all the State Parliaments legislation which, to the dot of an "" i "" and the cross of a "" t "" , must be identical. The question then arises as to how long such an agreement is to last. The proposal is, if I may say so, so absurd that I am surprised that the honourable member should have sponsored it. surrendered through uniform legislation by the' States they cannot be taken back. be considered, and it must also be considered whether it would be possible to embody permanently in legislation an arrangement which would be constitutionally unchallengable. Constitution that the States may delegate powers to the Commonwealth. difference of opinion as to the meaning of that section. point appears to be so great as to render the honourable member's proposal impracticable. The honourable member for Fremantle opposed the suggestion made by myself and others that the Government should, at an early date, draft proposals for submission by referendum to the people for granting this Parliament enlarged powers, on the grounds that no such referendum would be carried. I believe that such a proposal could be carried in the . present temper of the people. Previously, the people were not educated to the extent to which industrial unrest and uncertainty has been fostered by the limited powers enjoyed by the Federal Parliament under the Constitution. As a result of the last election campaign, they are now much better informed. Public opinion has been crystallized. On the subject of wider federal powers for the control of marketing arrangements, I think I can sent, and for Victoria generally, when I say that, among the wheat-growers, dairymen, and wool-growers, there is a strong feeling in favour of the passage of legislation of a federal character. I believe that if the Federal Government had the same power to control marketing arrangements within Australia that the State Parliament has iu Queensland, it would meet the wishes of an overwhelming majority of the primary producers. I suggest that the Government should ask for increased powers only in respect of industrial control and marketing arrangements. There are other questions, I know, such as the creation of new States, but it would not be wise to place too many issues before the people. It is of vital importance, however, that the Federal Government should be endowed with powers to combat the prevailing industrial unrest, and to control marketing, particularly in regard to our export industries, so that we may compete successfully in the markets of the world. Any attempt to put the proposal of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr the Curtin) into effect would merely cause unnecessary delay. do not think that this is the occasion for a full-dress debate on the subject of constitutional reform. The discussion which has taken place was provoked by certain remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes).",51,Riley Di D The Honourable I Am Able To Defend Myself I Have

210,Mr Mctiernan (Parkes) [5.55],"II t has been freely stated that the Commonwealth should have increased industrial powers. SinceI have become a member of this Parliament, I have heard frequent statements regarding the limited authority of the Commonwealth, statements almost amounting to complaints. It is interesting to hear these statements because, when I was a member of a State legislature, and also of a State Government, I frequently heard complaints as to the limited powers of State Parliaments, and State Governments. The position seems to be that members of this legislature feel that the powers of the Commonwealth are limited, because of the large residue of power which remains in the States, and that this Parliament is, on that account, incapable of doing the things which it would wish to do. On the other band, the members of State Parliaments feel that their powers are very much limited, because of the vast powers residing in this Parliament. It appears to be agreed that the present Commonwealth Constitution is crippling not only the usethe powers conferred are those contained fulness of the Commonwealth Parliament, but that of the State Parliaments also. Both the Commonwealth and the States have limited powers. There is a twilight zone about the line where State powers end and Commonwealth powers begin, a zone which, apparently, constitutional experts have not been able to explore. This uncertainty should be removed at the earliest possible opportunity. But when honourable members speak of the need for increasing the industrial powers of the Commonwealth, they should remember that it is important to come to grips with the subject and not content themselves with vague generalities. Do honourable members mean that the industrial powers of the Commonwealth Parliament should be increased, or that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court should be increased ? member says, there is a big difference. The proposals submitted in the referendum of 1926 were for the purpose of vesting a wider jurisdiction in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. ing than that. main objection in the constituencies to those proposals was that if adopted they would have conferred an increased jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and did not propose to confer upon the Pederal Parliament power to lay down the principles and standards upon which the Pederal Arbitration Court should proceed. The High Court has recently shown a disposition to give decisions which enlarge the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. In the earlier years of federation its interpretations were very greatly in favour of the States, and considerably restricted the powers that were thought to be exercisable by the Commonwealth court. In the engineers' case it held that the Commonwealth Constitution had to be construed just as any statute is, that in the document, and that, therefore, the doctrine of the immunity of State instrumentalities did riot apply. Consequently, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration now has jurisdiction in an industrial dispute to prescribe conditions of employment in State enterprises such as railways and tramways. Again, in the "" 44-hour"" case,"" known as "" Cowburn's case,"" which was decided recently, it was held that an award of the Federal Arbitration Court overrides even a State statute inconsistent with it. The New South Wales Parliament had passed legislation designed to pre. scribe a 44-hour standard in the regulation of hours in that State. In Cowburn's case the High Court held that, since the statute was in conflict with the provisions of federal awards that applied to employees affected by that legislation, to the extent of that conflict the State legislation had no effect. In the Burwood Cinema case, the High Court gave a decision which, to some extent, modified the application of the common rule doctrine. affected by the decision in the gas case. its recent interpretations of the Commonwealth Constitution, the tendency of the",52,Riley Di D The Honourable I Am Able To Defend Myself I Have

But it has not universally followed its prior decisions, and the result has heen ments of honourable members opposite to intensify the inconvenience and uncertainty to which previous speakers have referred. I should like to know whether those honourable members who suggest that the Commonwealth should be given increased industrial powers mean' that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration should be enlarged, or that this Parliament should have wider power in regard to legislation on industrial matters. the other? where a misconception has arisen. The vesting of increased jurisdiction in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration would not necessarily give to this Parliament greater power to legislate with respect to industrial matters. But, if tie Constitution were amended in such a w.ay as to vest in this Parliament the power to legislate with respect to industrial matters, no doubt one way in which that power would be exercized would be to reconstitute the federal court and lay down the standards and principles which it had to observe when making its awards. If that were done, we should have in force in the federal sphere a system similar to that which is in force in the States at the present time. When honourable members talk of enlarging the industrial powers of the Commonwealth, do they mean that the Constitution should be amended so as to vest in this legislature the power to prescribe standard hours of employment throughout Australia; in other words, do they mean that this Parliament should have vested in it the power to pass legislation prescribing, say, a 44-hour week for the Commonwealth? It is desirable that we should have a definite statement from those honourable members. member's view? the Government with regard to this matter doubtless will be announced very soon. This is neither the time nor the place to make a statement of that policy. The impression I am trying to convey is that there is a delightful vagueness, ambiguity, and obscurity in the stateregarding the necessity for increasing the industrial powers of the Commonwealth. If the Government should come down with a proposal to vest in the Pederal Parliament the power to prescribe standard hours and thus regulate the conditions upon which the Pederal Arbitration Court shall proceed in the declaration, for example, of a living wage, it will be interesting to hear what honourable members have to say regarding the advisableness of increasing the industrial powers of the Commonwealth. As a member of a State Government one always felt that the Commonwealth had too much power, because it prevented the State from doing what it considered was necessary. But when one comes into this legislature one hears the complaint that the Commonwealth has too little power. The State Parliament of New South Wales some time ago passed the 44-hour week act. When that legislation was being prepared the position occupied by the Commonwealth had to be taken into consideration. One found that the power of the Commonwealth was so great that it prevented the State Parliament from passing a 44-hour week act that would be universal in its application. Then when the question of child endowment was being considered by the Parliament of New South Wales the most intricate and complex constitutional questions arose, as to whether the State legislature could tax the wage-shee4 of employers in respect of employees who were working under federal awards. I believe that the powers of the Commonwealth are too limited, and that the Constitution requires very drastic alteration. Any referendum, proposed should have for its object the granting of legislative power to the Commonwealth Parliament in respect of certain industrial matters, not merely the vesting of jurisdiction in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The chief obstacle to the efficient working of that court is its inability to make a common rule. Its awards now apply only to the parties to the dispute upon which it is adjudicating, and persons connected with",53,Riley Di D The Honourable I Am Able To Defend Myself I Have

220,Mr Motiernan,"The policy of them in a limited way. The Commonwealth has a definite and limited charter. The legislation passed by this Parliament under that charter must be referable to conciliation and arbitration, and to an industrial dispute; and that dispute must extend beyond the limits of any one State. All of those elements must be considered as a composite quantity creating the industrial power of the Commonwealth. I have endeavoured to draw from some honourable members opposite a definite and clear statement as to what they mean when they declare that the Commonwealth requires increased industrial power; whether they mean that the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration should be enlarged, or that power should be given to this Parliament to legislate in respect of industrial matters. I shall be pleased if they will make their position clear. Proposed vote agreed to.

The success of any scheme of university education at the present stage of Canberra's development must depend upon arrangements being made with either Melbourne University or Sydney University, or, preferably, with both, for their recognition of the teaching work done at Canberra. It will be impossible for some time for students to take a f u l l degree course here. They can be given tuition in some subjects of a degree course, and arrangements must be made with the nearer universities, not to the exclusion of others, for the recognition of such work. I am familiar with the subject, not only as a Minister' in the last Government, but also as a member of the Council of the Melbourne University. For some time negotiations on this matter have been proceeding between the universities, the University Association in Canberra, and a committee appointed by the last Government.

I warn the Minister that these methods of propaganda will defeat their own ends. proposed vote of £8,412 for the Solar Observatory at Mount Stromlo includes the provision of £1,362 for the salary of a director. Duffield, died some time ago, and apparently no successor has been appointed. The observatory is carrying out a very important scientific work as part of a world-wide scheme of research, but unfortunately very little is known of it. I ask the Minister to give the committee some particulars regarding the manner in which the £8,412 will be expended, the return that Australia may expect to receive from it, the progress that is being made in research work, and the intentions of the Government regarding the appointment of a director. For the Forestry Branch, £8,577 is provided, and the latest available report of its activities is one furnished to the House in 1927. An examination of it discloses a series of complaints-the year's work had been carried out under difficulties, the staff was insufficient, the students were not properly housed and had to be boarded out under unsatisfactory conditions in the Printers' Quarters, the equipment of the school was incomplete,and a suitable man had not been found for the position of lecturer on Botany. Doubtless some progress has been made since that report was presented, but the committee is entitled to know why no later report is available, and whether the matters complained of have been rectified. morning I asked a question of the Treasurer regarding an application by the Inigo Jones Seasonal Weather Forecasting Trust, of Brisbane, for financial assistance. The Treasurer stated that the application had been referred to the Commonwealth Meteorological branch. This matter has been before the department for many years. About four years ago I asked several questions in the House and had a lot of correspondence with the Meteorological branch, the officers of Jones in every way. The trust is financed entirely by the voluntary contributions of Queensland, citizens and newspapers, and the organizer, in a letter to me, dated 4th December, saidThe economical value to Australia of correct long-range weather forecasts would be of incalculable value, and would also be the greatest factor in bringing about financial stability and general prosperity. Groat strides have been The former director, Dr. made in recent years in determining the lines on which such research work should bo carried on, and Mr Inigo Jones feels assured that inside three years correct long-range forecasts can be made giving definite areas which w ill be affected by drought, the period of duration of such drought, as well as giving the definite areas which will benefit by good rainfalls. For many years Mr Inigo Jones has been issuing these forecasts with surprising success, but for some unexplained reason the department has refused to give him any assistance. For a time he was refused access to the records in the Brisbane Meteorological Office, but that has since been conceded. Apparently the officers of the branch do not understand the value of long-range forecasts or are personally opposed to Mr Inigo Jones. I ask the Minister to examine closely the whole of the facts. Our pastoralists and others would find this long-range forecasting most useful if it could be shown that it is reliable. Mr Inigo Jones has had experience in the department, and has been a life-long observer of weather conditions. In the circumstances, I trust that the Minister will give this matter his personal consideration, and see that Mr Jones gets fair play. for Home Affairs) [8.15] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) seems to be unhappy in his new environment.

Under those circumstances, and division O:-""Provided that the super tax hereby proposed to be imposed shall not be payable by any resident of Australia who was on active service outside Australia with the Naval or Military Forces of any of the Allied Powers in connection with the war between His Majesty the King a.nd his Allies and the Emperor of Germany and his Allies, which took place in th© years li)14 and 1918, and whose military or naval duties required him to be in any part of the field of operations in connection with the war."" I urge the Government to reconsider its decision to impose this additional taxation. Since the motion was introduced, an additional tariff schedule, covering about 100 items, has been tabled in this chamber. The additional income which the Government will receive through the customs, following upon the introduction of this and other new tariff schedules, should render this direct taxation entirely unnecessary. But, even if this were not so, I should urge the Government to impose a tax on amusements and luxuries, instead of this tax on companies and individuals who are producing the wealth of this country. During recent years, the Commonwealth Government has been steadily evacuating the field of direct taxation; but the State Governments have been steadily entering it. The result is that to-day the total amount of direct taxation imposed by the Commonwealth and the States is almost as great as the amount imposed during the peak period of seven or eight years ago. Tn 1921-22, the direct taxation imposed by the Commonwealth amounted to about £4 per head, but in 1928-29 it had been reduced to about £2 8s. per head, a diminution, in round figures, of about £1 12s those men who served overseas. It has The direct taxation imposed by the New South Wales Government in 1922-23 was £3 l is . 9d. per head, but in 1927-28 it was £5 Is. 8d., an increase of £1 9s. l i d . That practically absorbs the whole of the decrease in the federal rate. In Victoria the direct taxation during that period increased from £2 l is . 3d. to £4 2s. 5d.; in Queensland from £4 4s. 6d. to £5 19s. 6d; in South Australia from £3 10s. lOd. to £6 10s. 2d.; in Western Australia from £2 17s. 6d. to £3 17s. l d . ; and in Tasmania from £3 6s. 6d. to £5 5s. ld. In practically every instance the States have more than occupied the field of direct taxation vacated by the Commonconsidering the fact that the heavy duties that are being imposed cannot, during the remainder of this year, have much protective incidence, I urge the Government to reconsider its decision to increase direct taxation. If it fears that the revenue to be obtained indirectly will be insufficient, I ask it to consider the advisability of imposing direct taxation on amusements. There is really no necessity to impose the lowest grade of taxation under this bill. It is proposed to levy a 10 per cent, super tax on taxable incomes from £201 to £1,500. That tax would bring in between £300,000 and £400,000, practically the sum that would be obtained by a tax on amusements. Those taxpayers who come within the lowest grade of direct taxation will feel acutely indeed the . increase in indirect taxation which has been imposed under the two tariff schedules introduced during the last few weeks. I urge the Government to exempt those taxpayers from the operation of this bill, particularly in view of the fact that during the last few months the revenue from customs and excise has actually been £1,597,000 above the estimated average which the Treasurer himself anticipates. The incidental circumstances operating during the last three or four months may have increased the customs revenue, but there is certain to be a much bigger return from the customs revenue this year before the effect of the increased tariff will be felt. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) has moved an amendment to the effect that there should be some exemption from the super tax of frequently been stated by the Labour leaders that there can be no reduction of direct taxation so long as we are faced with heavy war burdens.

[8.40] I m o v e That the amendment be disagreed to. This amendment proposed by the Senate makes provision that proposed new sub-sections 1 and 2 under this clause shall not apply in respect of gold held by any State savings bank. There seems to be on the part of the South Australia Savings Bank, and of most honourable senators, a somewhat unreasonable fear regarding what may happen to the gold possessed by that bank. I understand that it has a small gold reserve of about £240,000 which it desires to retain. The manager of the South Australian Savings Bank saw me in Canberra a few days ago, and I told him that the Government had no desire to appropriate the gold of that bank; that the question of its requisitioning would be decided by the Commonwealth Bank; that that bank would not arbitrarily decide to requisition gold before consulting the convenience and requirements of the State institutions; and that the State bank of South Australia would have no greater claim for special consideration than other similar institutions. I understand that the manager of that bank saw the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who informed h i m that there was no intention at present to requisition the gold of the State bank, and that, if the trustees of that bank thought it necessary to retain that reserve as a basis for credit, no doubt their wishes would be acceded to. The Senate has insisted upon inserting this amendment committee should accept it , because, if inserted, it could be utilized to defeat stages without the primary object of this measure. I do not say that the savings bank would lend itself to receiving the gold of other institutions thus assisting the evasion of a committee (Consideration of requisition in time of necessity by the Commonwealth Bank, but it would be possible for that to happen.

Honourable members in another place are apparently not prepared to trust the Commonwealth Bank Board to administer the measure in a reasonable and rational manner. Their fear is groundless, and I consider that their stand on the matter is unreasonable. There is only one point to which I think that the committee's attention should be directed, and it is that the power of the Commonwealth to legislate with respect to banking is conferred by paragraph xiii, of section 51 of the Constitution. The power is a power to legislate with respect, to banking other than State banking. This Parliament has no power to control banking, so far as it is carried on by a State. There is, however, power to legislate with respect to currency, coinage, and legal tender. The proposed new sectionupon which this amendment has been made provides that where the Treasurer is satisfied that it is expedient for the prothat circumstances made it necessary to tection of the currency, or the public credit of the Commonwealth, to obtain particulars of gold coin or bullion held by any person, the machinery of the measure may be used for the purpose of enabling the Commonwealth Bank to purchase that gold. It appears to me that it is most unlikely that any circumstances would arise in which it would he necessary in the judgment of anybody, whether the Treasurer or the directors of the bank, to requisition gold held by a State savings bank for the purpose of either manufacturing sovereigns or protecting the note issue. I can see that both of those objects could fall under the heading of currency. The Treasurer assures us that it is most unlikely that action will be taken to requisition the gold holdings of a State savings bank. As the Treasurer himself does not control the gold of the Commonwealth Bank, and as the Coinage Act of 1909, provides that the coinage shall be in the control of the Treasurer, and not the bank, it is difficult to see how the requisitioning of gold by the bank' from a State savings bank could bona fide be for the protection of the currency. I am suggesting that a difficulty might arise in the application of this measure, if the gold of a State savings bank were requisitioned, and if that bank raised the point that this legislation could not be supported' by virtue of the banking power, because there is no power to legislate with respect to State banking. Having regard to the fact that the coining of money is controlled by the Treasurer, and not by the Commonwealth Bank, it is at least arguable that the proposed new section could not be supported as legislation under the currency power. I have no desire to see this bill, when it becomes an act, made the subject matter of litigation between a State savings bank and the Commonwealth or the Commonwealth Bank. Unless there is some imperative necessity to make the measure apply to State savings banks, I suggest that the Government might give favorable consideration to the adoption of the amendment. In saying this, I am not pressing the amendment, particularly; I am merely pointing out that there is a possibility of trouble, which could be avoided by further action if it were found deal with the gold holdings of a State bank, or if it were found that the exclusion of such holdings from the scope of the measure was working towards the defeat of its general intention. member can see the danger that might come from acceptance of the amendment. is a certain risk, and I am not raising this point in a contentious spirit.

I do not suggest that the State savings banks, as they are controlled to-day, would take the gold from other banks, but that course would be open to them, if the amendment were accepted.

There is no proposal to put it into operation with respect to the £200,000 in gold that is held by the State Savings Bank in South Australia. Strange to say, that is the only State from which a word of protest has come. I am informed that, in another place, a telegram was quoted by an honourable senator, purporting to be a copy of a message sent to me by Sir Robert Gibson, chairman of the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, in, which he indicated that he was not prepared to support or oppose this amendment. No such telegram was sent to me. purports to have been sent to the Prime Minister. telegram sent to the Premier of South Australia, and probably that is the message that was quoted; but I understood that it was said to have been sent by Sir Robert Gibson to me as Prime Minister. I have made inquiries in my department, and I have no record of the receipt of such a telegram. The other telegram to which I have referred was from Sir Wallace Bruce, who said that he had interviewed Sir Robert Gibson, who The Treasurer had expressed the personal view that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank would not recommend acceptance of the amendment to exempt the gold reserves held by State savings banks from the Bank. I confess I operation of the measure, but inclined to the view that the directors would neither oppose nor support such an amendment. That was as much as to say that they did not wish to enter into the discussion in this Parliament, and they were not prepared to recommend the adoption of such an amendment. If honourable members will again look up the quotation made by the Treasurer, in his second reading speech on the bill, from a letter sent to him by the board of directors of the Commonwealth Banka similar letter was sent to me as Prime Ministerit will be seen that the directors take a very serious view of the position. They opened the negotiations with the GovernAs the bill has ment. We did not seek their advice on this matter; they proffered it. They drew attention to the power given to the Bank of England to call up gold. The bank that is responsible for the issue of notes must take the responsibility of safeguarding the gold reserves. The board of directors recommended this measure in the strongest terms that could be employed, and, on their recommendation, the Government has acted. We take the responsibility for the bill, giving the Parliament and the people the assurance that the powers conferred by the measure will be used with the advice and cooperation of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and will not be employed against any State savings bank or private bank unless the necessity arises. The Government will take the responsibility of protecting the gold reserves of this country from any possibility of their serious depletion.

It is most important to maintain faith in this country in the stability of all the savings banks, which are the repositories of the savings of the poorer classes of the people. The gold that is at present lying in the vaults of the South Australian State Savings Bank was specially placed there in 1907, -when there was a serious disturbance in the United States of America. Ever since that time a line has appeared in the balance-sheets of that bank, stating that it held £200,000 in gold. Many of the depositors have been accustomed to seeing this statement every year, but when the next balance-sheet is published the item may have vanished. Only a couple of days ago I received a letter from an old constituent of mine in Coif's Harbour, asking me whether I thought there was any danger to his savings because of the Commonwealth Government's proposal to concentrate all the gold in the Commonwealth Bank. I pointed out that his savings would be absolutely safe, but the fact that the letter was written indicates the atmosphere of uneasiness which has already been created. I ask the Government to accept this amendment. especially if a safeguarding provision is inserted to the effect that gold reserves in State savings banks must be at no time greater than that held on the 30th June last. If it is true, as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said, that there is no need to assume control of the gold held by the savings banks, there can, in my opinion, be no objection to this amendment. If this exception is not granted a good deal of antagonism will be aroused in the States, and, at the same time, a certain amount of doubt will be caused as to the constitutionality of the measure. In my opinion, we should meet the bank on this matter. That cannot do any harm, and it may do some good. I am surprised at the attitude taken up by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr bound to support it because their friends Latham) and the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) on this matter. Their reasons for insisting on the amendment seem very trivial unless there is behind the proposal some purpose other than that disclosed. It has been suggested that some sentimental value attaches to the £200,000 in gold hold hy the bank. I never heard before that there was much sentiment about gold, which is generally regarded purely as an instrument of profit. Are we to assume that the trading banks have the idea that if this exception is made in favour of the savings banks, they will be able to defeat the purposes of the bill by depositing their gold in the savings banks? been inserted at the direct request of the savings bank. It has nothing whatever to do with the trading banks, and the safeguard I have suggested would prevent the trading banks from availing themselves of it. to be somewhat vague. Under one section of the Constitution the Commonwealth has no power to deal with State savings banks; but, on the other hand, it has been granted full power in regard to currency. Just what is the position of the State savings banks? If they are legally compellable to meet all demands in gold they could not stand a ten minutes rush. The Victorian State Savings BankI t can do no harm, always holds as little gold as possible, because gold hoarding does not pay. It must pay 4 per cent, on every pound of gold it holds. Its practice is to put the gold into the trading banks, and hold as little till money as it can. The depositors get receipts for their money, and the savings bank has the right by a series of deposits in the trading banks maturing monthly to draw on the trading banks up to the extent of £200,000 monthly to meet claims should they be made. In the meantime the gold is earning 2 per cent. The gold reserve may be regarded as a form of till money for the savings bank, but it is on deposit, and is earning interest. I am surprised that this amendment should receive the support of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) and the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page). Either they consider themselves in the Senate are responsible for its introduction, or because they think that there is behind the amendment a movement on the part of the trading banks to",61,Commonwealth Bank

261,Mr Grouch,"The position appearsuse the savings banks for the purpose of destroying the effectiveness of this measure. I dissent from the view that there is any ulterior motive behind the request that the State savings banks should be exempt from the provisions of this bill. The gold reserve is held by the Savings Bank of South Australia because its directors believe that to be in the best interests of the community. There was a run on the savings bank in 1914, and it was due to the fact that the bank was able to pay out in gold that the temporary panic was so quickly allayed. just as good. tainty the possession of gold gives a feeling of security which the possession of notes is not able to convey. Besides, a person who has withdrawn his money feels much more anxiety about keeping gold in his house than he would about keeping notes. It is not true that this gold reserve represents so much idle money which the savings bank would otherwise be able to let out as interest. The Savings Bank of South Australia pays its depositors a higher rate of interest than does any other savings bank in Australia. The extra security afforded by the possession of this gold reserve is one of the factors which enables it to do so. It pays.4| per cent, on deposits up to £500, and 4£ per cent, on deposits from £500 to £1,000. The Commonwealth Savings Bank, which accepts larger deposits, pays 4 per cent, up to £1,000, and 3 per cent, on deposits between £1,000 and £1,300. The South Australian Bank accepts deposits without limit from friendly societies, and pays the higher rate of interest on the whole of them. In addition its funds are available on good security, at a very reasonable rate of interest, for the promotion of legitimate enterprises. Out of a total of £23,500,000 available for investment it has £6,549,340 invested in 9,572 mortgages. This indicates that the possession of a gold reserve is not an excessively conservative precaution. It has a definite value, and has contrading banks of Australia to defeat the tributed to the conspicuous efficiency of the bank. This efficiency is measured by the rate at which it can lend money, and the rate of interest it can pay its depositors. Judged by those standards it gives better service to the public than does the Commonwealth Savings Bank. It is not in the same position as a private bank. It is dealing with a very large number of persons who have had little experience of currency conditions. The customers of most of the private banks know that legal tender in the form of notes is just as good as gold, but many of the men and women who deposit with the savings bank have not had the advantage of a financial education. The population of South Australia is approximately 600,000, and there are 488,500 accounts in the State savings bank. That, of course, does not represent the number of individual depositors. gold deposits? number of depositors is so great that it must include a great number of persons who do not realize that a pound note is as good as a sovereign, and for that reason are likely to become anxious if the gold reserve of the bank is removed. other State savings banks besides that of South Australia? ings banks do not follow the practice of showing the amount of their gold reserves in their balance sheets. In the Victorian State Savings Bank balance sheets, for instance, the gold reserve is lumped together with the currency. In the South Australian Savings Bank there are 217,862 accounts of less than £20 each. There are 40,000 accounts of between £20 and £50, while the average value of all accounts held by the bank is £66 3s. 3d. The board which manages this hank conducts its business, not for profit, but in such a manner as has contributed to the welfare of the community. The board now asks that it may be allowed to retain its gold reserve, and to continue showing it in its balance sheet. Apparently the Prime Minister and the Treasurer fear that if this amendment is granted the State savings bank's may be used by the purposes of the bill.

It is difficult have pleasure in supporting the amendto understand why the Government will not accept an amendment of this sort at the request of an institution such as the South Australian State Savings Bank. If that were a private institution there might, perhaps, be some reason for viewing the request with suspicion. The attitude of the Government towards the request of this bank, which holds the savings of the people placed in its keeping for the purpose of tiding them over hard times, is absolutely inexplicable. The Treasurer has stated that there seems to be a tremendous amount of anxiety as to how he and the Commonwealth Bank Directors will exercise the powers proposed to be conferred on them by this bill. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the anxiety is not so much as to how he and the present directors may act, but as to what action may be taken by their possible successors. No one knows better than the Treasurer himself that statements made in this House with regard to currency inflation, and also in the press, are such as to cause alarm in the minds of people with savings to safeguard. I ask him not to treat such criticism as has been offered as personal in character, and to concede what, from every point of view, must appear to be a reasonable request from a public institution. There is certainly nothing ulterior in this request of the State Savings Bank of South Australia. The position simply is that that bank wishes to maintain Unimpaired its credit with its depositors, which number almost 300,000. The very fact that this bill will take from it the small reserve of gold that it holds may shake the confidence of the people in it. the gold from it. MrM . CAMERON -It could be taken if the Treasurer should so desire. The depositors in this bank comprise mostly those whose savings are not great -wh o can easily be stampeded if a feeling of lack of confidence should be aroused. I cannot admit the correctness of the Treasurer's contention that the acceptance of the amendment would defeat the purpose of the bill. It would be a very easy matter to regulate the amount which the bank could hold. I ment. It is strange that South Australia should be the only State which is raising any difficulty in this matter. I should like to be informed by honourable members who come from that State, whether the depositors in the Government Savings Bank there are paid in gold when they present withdrawal slips. I presume that they are paid in Commonwealth bank notes. In 1927, the following sums were deposited in the various State savings banka of the Commonwealth:£ New South Wales .. 78,351,733 Victoria 65,352,619 Queensland 22,452,749 South Australia 23,600,897 Western Australia ., 9,694,396 Tasmania 5,073,544 Northern Territorv 48,025Total. . 204,573,963 It is strange that those who are in charge of the State Savings Bank of South Australia should be unique in the Commonwealth in raising these groundless fears. Doubtless this action merely foreshadows a canard that will later be broadcast in South Australia, that this Government is taking away the people's savings. The position which these gentlemen are endeavouring to maintain is entirely untenable; because we have not been told that there is any rule applicable to banking in South Australia which requires this institution to pay its depositors in gold. May I say a word upon the constitutional question raised by-the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) ? This is an illustration of the extreme legalism of the federal system under which we are governed, and shows the necessity for giving complete power to this Parliament, so that its position in all matters will be absolutely certain. I do not feel that there is any risk in this particular case. The bill has been drafted by officers of the Commonwealth Crown Law Department.

On the subject of banking, it is true that the Constitution lays it down that the power of the Commonwealth relates to banking, other than State banking; but it proceeds to sayAlso State banking extending beyond the limits of tbe State concerned, the incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money. Section 51 (xxxix) provides that the Gommonwealth shall have power to legislate with respect to "" matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof."" I , therefore, submit that this bill is expressly made referable to the powers of the Commonwealth with respect to currency, coinage, legal tender, and the issue of paper money. It will not operate unless the Treasurer issues a proclamation ; and before he does so he will satisfy himself that such action is expedient for the protection of the currency or the public credit of the Commonwealth. I suggest that the Commonwealth has complete power in relation to the protection of its currency and its public credit. The High Court would not challenge the expediency of any proclamation that might be issued; it would leave to the discretion of the Treasurer the question whether a proclamation was justified on the ground of expediency. In view of the fact that the provisions of the bill have been carefully drafted by the Crown Law Department, and that there does not seem to he any doubt as to the constitutional warrant for it, its passage ought not to be delayed.

I do not propose to accept it, because the matter is such a vital one. Apparently, there is indisposition on the part of honourable senators of another place to trust the Government. If the amendment were inserted in the bill serious consequences might ensue. If it became necessary to requisition the reserves of gold held by the trading banks and then to place a restriction upon its export, it is likely that the Commonwealth Bank would make arrangements with the trading banks to take over their gold and, so far as was practicable, give them cover in London or arrange cover for exchange purposes through the Bank of England. In the light of what has been done in the past in these matters, the Bank of England might arrange to give cover to the equivaout subask that that gold be not shipped immediately, hut ear-marked and held at its disposal to he shipped when required.

I , therefore, move That the amendment be disagreed to The fact that the Treasurer accepted the previous amendment, although he had resisted it when it was moved in this chamber, gave me a faint hope that he would accept this one also. When the bill was introduced it was supported by the statement that it was on substantially the same lines as English legislation and that it was asked for by the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank. As a matter of fact the English legislation contains no provision enabling the Treasurer or the Bank of England to limit the export of gold; on the contrary, all gold bona fide required for immediate export i i excepted from the requisitioning power of the Bank of England, and the public is entitled to obtain gold from the bank in 400 oz. bars. Therefore this bill is essentially different from the legislation which was passed in England so recently as 1925 and 1928. The letter which the Treasurer read from the Commonwealth Bank Board, when moving the second reading of the bill, did not contain any request that power to prohibit or restrict the export of gold should be vested in either the board or the Treasurer. that the Government has received a later communication from the board, and I ask the Treasurer whether the directors of the bank have, since the bill was introwealth Bank. If the committee has any duced, expressed any view as to the desirability of including the clauses relating to the export of gold.

The letter which the currency, credit and finance, they will admit that that would be a very serious cance of this provision, involving, if put in operation, the abandonment of the gold standard, it can only be regarded as experimental legislation. For many years we have managed without legislation of this character; that, of course, is not necessarily a condemnation of it, but in regard to the very delicate matter of international credit it is wise to proceed warily. The bill has been introduced avowedly on account of certain emergent circumstances that are said to exist at the present time. That being so, it is reasonable to ask that its operation should be watched during a limited period, after which Parliament may have an opportunity to reconsider it in the light of experience. amendment is absolutely unnecessary, and if agreed to would defeat the whole purpose of the bill. I hope that the committee will not agree to it. [9.39] -A t the second-reading stage I said that I had had both written and oral communication with the chairman of the Board of Directors and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank regarding this legislation, and that the definite recommendation of the chairman was contained in a letter, the relevant portion of which I read.

As a measure which would very materially help the position in the meantime, and in addition, having regard to the precedent, would, in the opinion of the board, be a sound measure of permanent legislation, my board definitely recommends your Government to consider immediately the bringing in of legislation on similar lines to that which now exists and is operating in England. The English legislation does not prevent the export of gold, but actually provides for it in certain cases. The letter specifically states that the directors of the bank do not desire to do anything that may interfere with the convertibility of the currency. It is universally recognized by economists that an embargo on the export of gold renders the currency inconvertible. The .directors of the bank recommended the Government to introduce legislation similar to that passed by the British Parliament, and understood that such legislation would not prohibit the export of gold.

On this point the directors say thatIt should he pointed out that the nominal rate of 35s. per cent, is what is known as above "" gold point"", that is to say, that it would be cheaper to export gold from Australia to London rather than pay 35s. per cent, exchange. When this point has been reached, it becomes necessary for those in charge of gold reserves to see that the position does not operation of the measure should be limited get out of hand, and this immediately affects the position of the Commonwealth Bank. What is the meaning of that? It is surely that when the nominal rate of exchange reaches 35s. per cent, it is cheaper to export gold than to pay the exchange rate. The Commonwealth Bank directors desire, in the interests of Australia, to concentrate our gold reserves and to prevent gold from being sent overseas, when such export would unduly reduce our reserves. What is the substance of this amendment? It does not attack the principle of the bill. The measure is either sound or unsound. Honourable members opposite have not dared to declare that it is unsound. mental. It is based upon sound principles which have been adopted in other parts of the world. than the measures of other countries have gone. ber does not desire to be convinced against his will, and I shall not attempt to convince him. The amendment is either sound or unsound. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has had some experience with the Commonwealth Bank, and he should know that the bank authorities always do their best to protect our credit. The amendment is childish. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) would not have agreed to such a limitation being placed upon vital legislation introduced by the last Government. We are responsible to the people of this country for what we do. I say definitely, as the head of this Government, that we regard this and the other amendment as vital and capital. If they are persisted in by another place, this bill will be wrecked. The directors of the Commonwealth Bank realize that there is a serious danger of the credit of the country being injured if our gold is exported to any great extent, and we are proposing to safeguard the position by the means suggested, in the bill. To suggest that the to the 30th December of next year is ridiculous. As the Treasurer has pointed out, a serious position might arise on the 10th December next year. could ask for the period of the operation of the measure to be extended. ber does not seem to realize that Parliament may not be in session at that time. A most difficult position might arise with which we should find it impossible to cope. The Treasurer has stated that one Australian firm alone has indicated that, if it cannot make better arrangements for credit in London, it intends to present to the Commonwealth Bank £2,000,000 worth of Commonwealth notes and demand gold, which it will export. If one Australian firm could do that a score could do it, and we should be powerless to meet the situation.

We should riot be asked to agree to extraordinary legislation of this description, which must seriously affect our trade and commerce, without being given much more information than has been supplied to us. The information that I have received is to the effect that the Commonwealth Bank directors asked for a temporary measure, which would enable them to concentrate our gold reserves. But the Treasurer introduced a bill which, if passed, would have given him absolute power to refuse the request of one applicant to export gold and to grant that of another. If we refuse our financiers the right to export their gold our credit must be seriously impaired overseas. able to carry on our commercial operations if we cannot meet our accounts?

It is true that the financial depression which exists at present has created credit difficulties. But a somewhat similar state of affairs existed in New Zealand in 1927. At that time the banks increased the interest rates, but were able to reduce them in 1929. The banks had been making larger advances than the deposits warranted. They increased interest rates with the result that the position soon changed. We should be prepared to follow the example of New Zealand.

The Prime Minister has purported to -reply to the points which have been raised by honourable members on this side, but he did not in any way touch upon the fact that the Bank Board expressly avoided recommending the placing of any embargo on the export of gold. finitely and clearly recommended legislation on English lines, and the characteristic of English legislation as distinct from certain continental legislation, is that it contains no provision for the prohibition of the export of gold. The rest of the speech of the Prime Minister was against placing a time limit on the bill's operation. He assumed that by the 30th December, 1930, the Commonwealth Bank might have lost all the gold that ithad requisitioned. It is evident that the bank would still have the gold, and would be able to finance on that gold on the 1st of January as on the 30th December. been handed back. wealth Bank would have paid for the gold by the issue of Australian notes, and it would have the gold on the 1st January, and thereafter. There would, therefore, not be the financial disturbance which the Prime Minister has suggested would take place as a result of the amendment. I rose principally to ask whether the Treasurer would state the views of the Associated Banks. [10.5] -It is true that I have had communications, oral as well as written, from the members of the Associated Banks of Melbourne and Sydney, but it is impossible for me to traverse the whole of the conversations and correspondence. There is really no necessity for me to do that. There was no recommendation in any communication from the Associated Banks suggesting that the Government should put a time limit on the operation of this bill. ""With regard to the restriction Gabb, J. M . upon the export of gold, the view of the Associated Banks, as far as I can recollect, was that the banks should be given the right of ordinary cover in London to the extent of the requisitions of the Commonwealth Bank. I informed the Associated Banks that that was a matter for discussion with the Commonwealth Bank authorities. The Prime Minister has clearly defined the policy of the Government, and has justified our opposition to this amendment. If another place insists upon the amendment, it will have to bear the responsibility of destroying the bill. The board deThe bank authorities have made it clear that they regard the present situation as menacing, and that it should be met by legislation of this character. We were asked to pass legislation before Christmas, and the Government is prepared to carry out the wishes of the Commonwealth Bank. The imposition of a time limit upon the operation of this bill does not affect the question of urgency. The object of the bill is, first, to concentrate our gold reserves and, secondly, to prohibit the export of gold. Under the amendment that prohibition would operate immediately for thirteen months from now. It is, therefore, idle for the Prime Minister to suggest that a time limitation placed on the bill would prevent the Government from taking action to meet any unforeseen and urgent situation that might arise.

As any proclamation relating to the export of gold will be made only after the receipt of a recommendation from the board, and as any such proclamation will indicate the period for which it is to remain in force, and as the necessity for action under the bill may arise after the thirtieth day of December, one thousand nine hundred and thirty, it is undesirable to limit the operation of the act to any specific period.

316,Mr Yates,"A t any rate, there is astrenuous times than those now being experienced, and, since we are now enjoying peace and comparative prosperity, we should either cease saying that we are not over-borrowing, or admit that we are still fooling the general community. I suggest that during the coming year the Treasurer will require more money than he now proposes to raise by way of loan. By our borrowing policy we are merely playing a trick upon the workers of the Commonwealth in the interests of the "" money-bags"" who are juggling with gold. Our present difficulties are due to the enormous interest bills that we have to meet on borrowed money, which we only receive by way of a transfer of credit. I myself have used a Commonwealth bond for the purpose of building a house, and, if that money had already been spent by the Commonwealth, how could I use it again? Whenever a loan bill of this nature is introduced, I shall record my protest against it. I object to this fetish of borrowing until governments find themselves up against a dead end. Great Britain has made her notes inconvertible, and she will have to use them and the credit of the country for the purpose of meeting her needs. The note issue of £59,000,000, has never been repudiated and has never given a. check to industry. In the last twenty years, Sydney has been practically re-built; even buildings erected that the money for them should be raised fairly recently are now being pulled down to make room for more modern structures. This shows that the country is prosperous. It is said in some quarters that an inflation of the note issue brings about an increase in the prices of commodities. I recall that, during the war period, we taxed excess profits to the extent of 75 per homes by instalments when a comprehencent., allowing the profiteers to retain 25 per cent, of the ""loot."" In objecting to the passage of this bill, I am not breaking faith with the Government or with my party, but I am carrying out a promise to my constituents. If the Government continues in the course that it is now pui'suing, by perpetuating the system of borrowing, it is riding for the fall that comes to all capitalistic governments that adopt deliberately the immoral, and almost criminal practice of over-borrowing. I wish to impress upon the Government what must be a necessary consequence of continuing our present borrowing policy. I do not wish to delay the business of the committee, but there are a few things which I feel I must say, especially after listening to the speech of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates). He belongs to a party which believes in the socialization of most of our public activities, and I remind him that it is impossible to build railways, post offices and homes for the people entirely out of revenue. To put the cost of constructing such capital works on to the revenue account would be impossible; it would tend to retard our rate of development rather than accelerate it. Consequently, if the honourable member desires that public borrowing shall be completely stopped, he should be prepared to start further back, and stop the prosecution of those public works which Ave noAv consider to be necessary. During the past six years £23,000,000 has been spent on works for the Postmaster-General's Department. Of this amount two-thirds Avas spent on labour in Australia, and the provision of copper Avire mined in our mines, and manufactured into Avire in the factories of Australia. Provision is mad© for Australia, which has totalled the expenditure of £1,000,000 for the construction of Avar service homes. Surely it is reasonable, Avhen homes are being constructed to house the people, by loan, seeing that the homes are paid for over a period of 30 or 40 years. It would be an intolerable burden to require the taxpayers to provide out of revenue all the money required. It has been found necessary in every country of the Avorld to alloAv the people to pay for their sive housing scheme has been undertaken. We should be proud of the fact that in Australia so many people own their own homes. We need to impress upon those from whom we borrow money that the public debt of Australia is quite different from that of other countries, because the money borrowed by us has been used for the creation of national assets. Take our railways, for instance. Although they may not be paying UOAV, Ave have created a railway system Avhich will serve the needs of a population three or four times as great as the present, and eventually the railways will pay.",71,Bankruptcybill N O 2 1929

I have always maintained that they are an asset because Of their indirect benefit to Australia, and if we had a greater population they would become a source of revenue instead of being, to some extent, a drag upon the nation because of the interest which must be paid on the cost of their construction. Against the money which has been borrowed by the States there are tangible assets in those States themselves. has said that the railways are not assets. member for Adelaide to cease from interjecting. It is not possible for the debate people. We should then be able to proto be conducted on proper lines if he conduce enough to permit of our meeting our tinues to interject. ment's loan programme represents a curtailment as compared with previous programmes, but the last Government must be given some credit for this. Last year, loan expenditure amounted to £7,700,000; this year it has been reduced to £5,200,000. When honourable members who support the Government were in opposition, they complained that this curtailment would increase unemployment. The position of the Commonwealth Treasurer has altered during the last few years in regard to the country's loan commitments. To-day he is no longer a free agent, responsible only to this Parliament. As Chairman of the Loan Council, he is responsible for finding money, not only for the requirements of the Commonwealth, but for those of the States also. The time has come when the Commonwealth's loan policy should cease to be a party question. The Loan Council is composed of representatives of different State governments of varying political complexions, and non-party decisions must be arrived at. It is not possible, I maintain, to raise within Australia all the money needed for State and Commonwealth public works. That, I know, was a plank in the Prime Minister's platform, but if we are to continue our present practice of providing Government-owned facilities for the people, we cannot raise all our requirements in Australia, and at the same time afford opportunities for the development of private enterprise. I have always admitted that we should raise as much of our loan money as possible in Australia, but we should avoid trespassing on the needs of private enterprise. That was the policy followed by the last Government. In previous years we have raised as much as £13,000,000 for State and Federal requirements. In other years it was necessary to carry out large loan conversions in Australia, and we could not then raise money here for public works. It will be possible to carry out the Prime Minister's policy of raising our requirements for public works within Australia only if honourable members opposite' assist to fill Australia with own loan requirements, but that condition of affairs can be brought about only by hard work. It cannot be done by utilizing soft money as the honourable member suggests. We have used too much soft money in the past, and that, to some extent, is responsible for our present difficulties. I can promise that the two parties on this side of the House may be relied upon to support every sound proposal for the improvement of Australia's credit. Already the financial agreement with the States and the provision of a sinking fund by the last Government have tended to produce that effect, while the fact that Australia's borrowing is controlled by a loan council will promote confidence in the money markets upon which Australia relies for her loan requirements. The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore), when introducing this measure, was good enough to tell us that our credit in London was lower than that of New Zealand, South Africa and the other borrowing dominions, but he was not able to tell us just why that should be. If honourable members will study this bill they will find that it provides for the construction out of loan money of many works which should be paid for out of revenue.

323,Mr West (East Sydney) [9.15],"instance, it is stated in the hill that every ought to be stopped. I am not so foolish State may carry out certain works from loan money up to the value of £300 in each case. When the Fisher Government was in power it took particular care that public works should be paid for out of revenue. We should give the financial interests on the other side of the world credit for noticing how we expend the money we borrow. There is also in the bill an item relating to passage money and medical fees for assisted immigrants. Apparently, if an immigrant coming to Australia requires so little as a dose of salts or castor oil, or any' other medical comfort, the cost is to be defrayed out of the loan account. This will appear a ridiculous item when the measure is read on the other side of the world, for we must remember that other Parliaments take our oflicial papers as we take theirs. As I have pointed out, each State is allowed to spend, out of loan money, sums amounting to not more than £300 in each case. I do not know how many such sums there will be. They may amount to £299, or £200; some may be as low as £10 or £12 for replacing glass in broken windows, or for painting shutters, but they can all, apparently, be paid out of loan funds. Loan bills used to be brought before Parliament by the last Government, and I suppose this Government has copied its predecessors, and perpetuated the same stupid way of drafting them. I trust that my will be helpful to the Government. There are several other items in this measure that ought never to find a place in a loan bill. The expenditure on them should be defrayed out of consolidated revenue. I have no desire to obstruct the passage of the bill, but I trust that the departmental officers will give some consideration to the representations I am making and endeavour to prevent extravagant expenditure from the loan fund. During the term of office of the Fisher Labour Government, every effort was made to refrain from borrowing. Over a three-year period £1,000,000 was provided out of revenue for postal work, and the money was found by means of taxation. The result was that large interest payments were obviated. present policy of continually borrowing as to say that we can carry on without borrowing; but I certainly think that if we exercise our faculties properly we can reduce it considerably. In the last seven or eight years, financial matters have not been brought forward until the end of the session, when they have been discussed during all-night sittings or late at night. I trust that the present Government will not continue that practice. I represent an important constituency, which contains some of the ablest and most earnest men in the Commonwealth. They are connected with financial institutions and large businesses, and are well acquainted with our present financial position. It is my responsibility to look after their interests. We are adopting an unfriendly attitude when we go on the London market to raise a loan in a time of financial stress. That is the case at the present time. Any person Avho studies the financial journals will realize how acute is the position. The rate of interest for short dated bills is now Qi per cent. This financial stringency is having an adverse effect on industry, and affects not only Australia but every other part of the Empire. It is a reflection upon Australia that she should have to pay more for her money than do South Africa and New Zealand. Some one must have the courage to draw attention to the dangerous position we are occupying. Our national * debt at the present time amounts to £167 per observations on these matters head. That is a staggering burden for such a small population to carry. Years ago, when McMillan, Stuart, and other Treasurers in New South Wales were faced with a deficit they sold Crown lands at £1 an acre to make up the deficiency. Some of that land has since become very valuable. In the Clarence River district, and along the North Coast of New South Wales, it .is worth as much as £100 an acre. I trust that these few remarks of mine will have some effect and that next year we shall be given more time for the consideration of Australia's problems. I hope that the Government will not again ask the House to agree to the borrowing of money for the mending of The shutters and the cleaning of windows. Do honourable members realize that even the cost of sending food to the lighthouses is to be charged to loan, and that telephone boxes, wires, poles and other perishable material used in the Postniaster-General's Department are to be paid for with borrowed, money, upon which our children will have to pay interest? I do not like having to make these observations; but it is my painful duty to take the last advantage that will be presented this session to protest against the callous indifference of the Government and Parliament to the manner in which loan moneys are applied. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. IRO NAND STEEL PRODUCTS In Governor General's message, resumed from 11th December (vide page 1046), on That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to amend the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act 1922-1927. Honourable members experienced great difficulty in following the case presented by the Assistant Minister for the proposed increase of the bounty, because of the pace at which he spoke; but since yesterday I have obtained some particulars from the Trade and Customs Department, and have also examined the reports placed before Parliament which are submitted annually by the manufacturers who receive bounties under the provisions of the act. I propose to quote to the committee figures showing the importation of galvanized iron sheets, flat and corrugated, the production in Australia, and the number of persons engaged in local manufacture. Contrary to what one would expect they show a diminution of exports, and an increase of local production and of the number of persons engaged at Lysaght's factory. The importations in the last four years have beenYears. 1925-20 .. 89,500 .. 2,045,512 1920-27 192728 192829 Honourable members will see that between 1927-28 and 1928-29 the importations decreased by 20,000 tons-equivalen t to nearly 20 per cent. The particulars of local manufacture areTons. 1925-20 .. .. .. 18,931 1920-27 ' .. .. 26,121 192728 .. .. 22,990 192829 .. .. 28,515 I turn now to the number of persons engaged in Lysaghts' works. The Assistant Minister spoke of the possibility of large numbers being dismissed. It is possible to confuse the number of persons employed in the factory with the number engaged in the production of a particular commodity. Possibly men have been dismissed from the factory; but they may not have been engaged in the manufacture of galvanized iron. By committee: Consideration of the provisions of the Bounties Act, under which £404,000 has been paid to Lysaghts in respect of the production of galvanized iron sheets, it is necessary for the recipient of the bounty to submit an annual report to the Trade and Customs Department. These reports show that the number of persons employed by Lysaghts in the manufacture of galvanized iron sheets in 1926-27 was 454, and in 1928-29, 545. Summarized, the statistics I have quoted reveal that for the year ending the 30th June last the importations were less than in any of the last four years; the local production was greater, and the number of employees has increased by over 20 per cent, in the last two years. Unless the Minister can adduce very convincing figures to supplement those that are available to e , there would apm pear to be no justification for increasing the bounty. Another factor should carry weight with us in considering this subject. ""We know that the coal industry is in a difficult position. Honourable members of the last Parliament will recollect that the Prime Minister of the day gave reasons which convinced his Government that it would be a good thing to make a temporary grant of Is. per ton to a fund for the purpose of reducing the Tons.

325,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [11.5],"BrokenH ill Proprietary Company gave an undertaking about that time that if the price of coal were reduced by 4s. a ton it would reduce the price of steel by 12s. a ton. If such a reduction could be made in the price of steel it would appear that a substantial reduction could also be made in the price of galvanized iron. It seems inevitable that within the near future the coal mines will resume operations and that the price of coal will be reduced. I say nothing whatever, at the moment, about who will bear the cost of the reduction. If the price of coal is reduced it should improve the position of the galvanized iron manufacturing industry. Ou this ground, also, there is little justification for the introto produce all the galvanized iron we duction of this bill at this juncture. Certain factors with which the Leader of the Opposition is evidently unfamiliar should be borne in mind. Personally, I am opposed to the payment of bounties when an industry has been placed on its feet. I , and I believe the persons interested in this industry, would prefer a duty instead of a bounty in the existing circumstances. But in deference to the views of some honourable members opposite, who feel that the imposition of a duty upon these products would increase the price of them, particularly to the fa raters, the Government has introduced this measure -Nothing that the honourable member The company which will be principally affected by the passage of this bill was encouraged to establish works in Australia by the promise that adequate protection would be afforded to it. Three years ago the Tariff Board made an exhaustive inquiry into the position of the industry. The company promised that if it were given sufficient encouragement it would duplicate its works at a cost of £250,000. The Tariff Board recommended that the existing bounty should be increased to £4 10s. to enable this to be done. The company, in all good faith, proceeded with the duplication of its works. In the eight years that it has been operating in Australia, it has paid only one dividend on the capital invested. If the plant is duplicated, the output will crease in imports. The Leader of be increased from 30,000 tons to 60,000 tons annually and regular employment will be provided for between 400 and 500 additional men. It is estimated also that extra steel to the value of £35,000 annually will be required, and that £5,000 more will be spent annually in zinc from Tasmania. The coal consumption will be increased by 200,000 tons per annum and a large number of additional fire bricks and a considerable additional quantity of sulphuric acid will be needed. Moreover, the wages bill will be increased by £300,000 annually. In addition to these direct advantages, there will be other indirect advantages to associated industries. The question which we should ask ourselves is: Shall we enable this company require here or shall we compel it to close its works and oblige our people to import galvanized iron from abroad? The company cannot be expected to continue its opera tions if it cannot pay a reasonable dividend on the capital invested. Seeing that a bounty of £4 10s. per ton was recommended by the Tariff Board three years ago, and that the company has incurred considerable expense in expectation of the recommendation being approved by this Parliament, I submit that we should pass the bill. Probably in twelve months' time it may be possible to substitute an effective duty for the bounty now proposed. for Newcastle has said seems to justify the proposed increase in this bounty. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has ishowji clearly that this industry has made good headway under the existing bounty. In the year ended SOth June, 1928, we produced, in Australia, 22,990 tons of galvanized iron, and in the year ended 30th June, 1929, we produced 28,500 tons of it. This shows that the increased encouragement given by the advancement of the bounty from 52s. to 72s. per ton was effective. I cannot see, therefore, why we should add an additional 18s. to the bounty now. Under the existing conditions the manufacturers have increased their output and there has been a corresponding dethe Opposition has referred to the fact that it is highly probable that there will be a decrease in the price of",75,Bounty Bill

If the decrease amounts to 4s. a ton in New South ""Wales, it would materially reduce the costs of production in this industry. lished fact. eagerly looked forward to, and it is considered to he inevitable that some such arrangement must be made. In the absence of any evidence that an increase of the bounty is immediately necessary, we should at least wait to see whether the coal dispute is settled before coming to a decision. It takes three tons of coal to produce a ton of steel, and if the proposals for a reduction in the price of coal are acceptable to the coal-mining industry the cost of producing steel will be 12s. a ton less than it is to-day. I do not know whether the saving is as great on galvanized iron as it is on steel, but it must be very substantial, and I submit that, for that reason alone, this proposal to increase the bounty should be deferred until we ascertain what is to be the future cost of coal. The figures show that this industry is making substantial headway under the existing tariff. There is therefore good and sumcient reason for deferring the proposed increased bounty on iron and St66i. much prefer that assistance should be given to an industry by way of a bounty to an increased tariff. absolutely. to encourage an industry to employ labour by giving it assistance, the people generally should be taxed to pay for this. According to the figures submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, Lysaghts employed 545 persons in 1928-29. Let us assume that there are 500 workmen receiving a wage of £250 a year. That would amount to £125,000. The local manufacture is about 30,000 tons. Therefore, a bounty of £4 10s. a ton would amount to £135,000. In other words the amount of the bounty would more than pay for the whole of the wages bill. Surely that is an extraordinary position. I strongly urge the Government to reconsider its decision before going on with the bill. Lysaghts have been extending their works for some years, and if the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition are correct it appears to me that by giving this bounty we are greasing the fatted pig. Lysaghts with free labour. amounts to. This money has to be raised, and I have grave objections to taxing the people for this purpose. The money is better in the pockets of the people than in the hands of a Government, which is too fond of paying large sums of money for the encouragement of certain secondary industries. I urge the Government to reconsider its decision before finally passing this bill. of the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition it is doubtful whether this industry is worth the price that we are paying for it. Already bounties have been granted to it to the extent of £400,000. The total number of employees at Lysaghts' works at the end of last June was 545, which means that for every employee directly engaged in this industry it costs the taxpayers of Australia £200 a year. If the expectations of those who support the proposed bounty are realized, the output of this industry will be doubled, and, in that event, the taxpayers next year will have to raise £200,000, or more, in order to pay this bounty. The industry is not worth the price. The other night we discussed the grants that were being made to certain States. Those were not bounties, but something in the nature of partial compensation for disabilities under federation. A grant of £2,500,000 was made rather grudgingly to one State; yet this iron and steel industry has already been assisted to the extent of £400,000, and that sum is still to be increased. We do not know how long this burden will be placed upon the community. This industry is apparently well established, and for that reason I can see no reason for increasing the bounty. I do not desire to speak at any length, because any protest against the payment of this bounty will be useless. The point made by the Leader of the Opposition was that under the old bounty of £3 12s. a",76,Bounty Bill

348,Mr Forde (Capricornia,"Acting( Mr Hughes), who, I think, was responsible for its coming to Australia and establishing branch works here. The bounty was first paid in 1923-24. Mr The total amount of bounty paid up Massy Greene, and later Mr Pratten, as Minister for Trade and Customs, gave the company a definite assurance that, if it extended its plant, he would not only help it with a bounty, but would also impose a sufficiently high duty to enable it to carry on successfully. As a result of the promise given, the company extended its plant from eight mills to twelve. This resulted in increased production, and there has been a gradual increase in the number of employees. marked that this increased bounty should not be granted, because there might be a reduction in the price of coal. I point out that, if the working costs come down, there is nothing to prevent a reconsideration of the amount of bounty if the Government of the day deems it advisable; or the substitution of a duty for the bounty; that matter can be left for the future. The company has been carrying on in Australia under great difficulties. We have been told by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that we have no proof that the company has not heen making phenomenal profits. Under the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act, the department is required to examine the accounts of these companies every twelve months, and satisfy itself as to the profits made. Section9 of the act providesIf the net profits of any person, firm, or company claiming bounty under this act exceed, in any year, fifteen per centum on the capital employed in respect to the business in connection with which bounty is payable, the Minister may, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board, withhold so much of the bounty payable as will reduce such net profits for that manufacture this commodity in our own year to fifteen per centum on the capital employed in tbe business. Therefore, the interests of the taxpayers' are ar^ply safeguarded. This company has only paid a dividend for one year during all the years in which it has been operating; that was a dividend of 5 per cent. Before a company can obtain a bounty under this act, it must satisfy the Minister that it uses all Australian materials, and pays the rates of wages laid down by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. There is a maximum adopted. Mr Forde. expenditure under the act, in any one year, of £250,000, and any sum not expended in the year can be carried over. to the 4th December this year was £404,816. The present carry over amounts to £275,000, which, together with the £250,000 provided for the current year, makes a total of £525,000 available. The Tariff Board went carefully into the whole subject in 1926, and, when this company obtained the price of £29 a ton as against the present price of £24 10s. a ton, the board recommended a bounty of £4 10s. a ton. To-day we find that, One honourable member rein some qualities of galvanized iron, the English price of iron landed in Australia is 30s. a ton less than the Australian price. Por 26 gauge primo quality iron the price in store in Sydney for the British manufacture is the same as the Australian price, including the bounty. This company finds that it would be impossible to carry on without the bounty; it would have to go out of manufacture in Australia, and to import all the iron required to supply the Australian market. Buti t has developed the industry in Australia, and its aim is to increase the production of this commodity. I believe that it is the duty of the Government to assist the company. The payment of this bounty will mean an extra expenditure of £9,000 for the present financial year and the employment of an additional 350 men. The company will greatly extend its plant, expend £250,000 of additional money, and double its output. We have evidence that another company intends to manufacture galvanized iron in Australia, and I believe that in a few years the whole of the demand will be met by local factories. Isi t not better to country than to import it? If we do not give the bounty, the 600 men now employed in this factory will be put off. Honourable members should pass the bill without further delay.

There is to be an increase from £3 12s. to £4 10s. a ton. In this particular industry 545 men were employed for the year ended the 30th June last. The production of galvanized iron was 28,515 tons (a) for the twelve months and the amount of bounty paid at the old rate was £102,650. If we study the figures relating to the number of men employed, and the amount of bounty paid, we come to the surprising conclusion that the latter amounted to £188 for each man. Nowi t is proposed that the bounty shall be increased by 25 per cent. Assuming that the same ratio is maintained between the number of men employed and the number of tons produced, the future payment will be at the rate of £235 per annum, (b) for every man engaged in the industry. £1 a ton, which the industry enjoys, and regard that as though it were a bounty, we find that we. shall be subsidizing the industry altogether to the extent of £287 for each man engaged in it.

Green). A t page 5 the f o l lowing paragraph appearsH'.M.A.Sl Moresby will continue; until approximately December,, 1929, the survey and triangulation of the Great Barrier Beef, for which services special funds were provided are. under Defence Equipment Act 1928'. The work referred to is the survey of the coast of Queensland, particularly in the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef. Fundsf or it were made available by tbe late Government, in the firstplace, in 1924', and further provision was made in subsequent years u n t i l 1925. Judging by this statement, it is not intended to proceed further with this very valuable work, which was commenced in 1928. The survey arose out of a resolution that was passed by the Pan Pacific Congress held ; in Melbourne in August, 1923,. as> f o l lows :That, in view of the scientific and economic interest attached to the Queensland coastal waters within the Barrier Reef regions, the Government of the Commonwealth is specialty urged to undertake a detailed hydrographic 1 stwvey of this area ait the earliest possiblemoment, and to make availablefunds' and facilities to enable the Navy Department to carry out the work without delay. This swvey was intended to cover a distance of 1,200' miles along theeast coast of Australia. To make it possible, the British Government placed the Moresby at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government without charge, and also made available scientific experts to* assist in the survey. In the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef, the coastline is treacherous and constitutes a great d'anger to vessels travelling along it , particularly thoseproceeding to the East Indies and the China seas. The charts that are being used today for the navigation of those waters were marked by Captain Flinders well 1 over 100) years ago. Apparently the Government now proposes to discontinue the work. Very valuable work has been done OF DEFENCE. by the survey parties. They have examined the Curtis Channel and located a number of shoals not shown on the chart.

Very little is known of the direction and set of the currents, and because this area is subject to hurricanes and tropical storms, it presents great difficulties to navigators. Storms and hurricanes cannot be controlled, but we should do all in our power to see that our navigators have up-to-date charts, and so prevent the unnecessary sacrifice of life. Many disasters have occurred on the coast, and I hope the Minister will give to the committee an assurance that the survey will proceed, par-' ticularly as the British Government has been generous enough to place a vessel at, the disposal of the Commonwealth. I understand that at present the vessel is in the vicinity of Port Jackson. Another feature of this report is the tribute paid by the Minister and the officers of the department to our citizen forces, which the Prime Minister recently described as a farce and inefficient. newspaper report the Prime Minister made that statement at a social function in Melbourne, and it has been repeated in this chamber. This statement, prepared by direction of the Minister for Defence, saysThere hue been a general all-round improveTrust Fund, to meet the cost of the initial ment in the citizen forces, while steady progress has been made and maintained by all ranks. The standard of efficiency is reported to be the highest since the Great War. Notwithstanding that testimony the citizen force is to be disbanded on the ground that it is inefficient. Another paragraph refers to the Aerial Ambulance Service. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr ""White) raised this matter in the House some time ago, and I hope that he has received a satisfactory reply from the Minister. tribute to the good work Q.A.N.T.A.S. Ltd. is doing for the transport of doctors, nurses, and patients, in the outback portions of Queensland. This service was inspired by the Presbyterian Inland Mission, and I am pleased to know that the Government proposes to continue the subsidy that was made available by the last Government. Under the heading of "" Munitions supply branch,"" I read that the manufacture of rifles at the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, has been discontinued. I hope there will be an explanation of that. WhilstI regret the necessity for preparing for war, I think we shall be particularly foolish if we discontinue entirely the manufacture and collection of the necessary arms and equipment even for our volunteer army. I ask the Minister to explain how the Lithgow factory will be utilized after it discontinues the manufacture of small arms. The concluding paragraph of the explanatory statement prepared by direction of the Minister for Defence states that the programme approved by the last Government for the development of munition production in Australia has been practically completed. Is the matter to be left there, or has the Minister any further proposal to put forward for supplying our requirements of munitions? A scheme has been adopted for the development of an air port for Brisbane at Archerfield, near Cooper's Plain. In reply to a question I asked recently, the Minister informed me that an amount of £11,500 has been reserved out of the unexpended balance of the Civil Aviation preparation of the site. This project has been considerably delayed because of the difficulty experienced by the Lands Department in getting the land at a reasonable cost. That difficulty was overcome only recently, and I hope there will be no further delay in proceeding with the work. I was sorry to hear the Minister state, when dealing with the loan estimates, that the Government does not propose to proceed with the construction of the ANZAC memorial square at Brisbane. I hope the Archerfield air port will not I have. meet with the same fate. Many people who are out of employment in the district have written to me, asking that the work be commenced as soon as possible. In all parts of Australia are large numbers of unemployed. The Government promised to find work for everybody, and I urge it to proceed at once with the preparation of this air port, and so relieve unemployment m one district, at any rate.",81,Surveying Ship

366,"Mr Francis,","I desire to pay aa.m.] I have-not had an opportunity to do more than glance hurriedly through the explanatory statement of the estimates of expenditure prepared by direction of the Minister for Defence. The opening paragraph states that the period of the five-years' developmental programme initiated by the last Government in 1924 expired on the 30th June last. That is evidence of something accomplished. The last paragraph says"" The programme approved by the late G6vernment for the development of munitions production in Australia has been practically completed."" I notice, also, that the strength of the citizen forces is to be greatly reduced. With the completion of these two programmes, and with a smaller citizen force to train, will the Government maintain the present expen-. sive staff and overhead organization of the Defence Department? During an earlier debate I was asked if I thought that the Secretary of the Defence Department should receive a salary of £2,000, and I replied that he should. The Secretary has an opportunity to render great service to the Minister, and to earn every penny of his salary. The present occupant of that oflice returned from London only about two years ago,and probably has not yet had time to tackle his job as thoroughly as he should. But I recommend to him the example of the first Secretary for Defence, Captain Collins. He was very careful in administering the departmental funds, and Be allowed no overmanning, overstaffing, or overpayment. Because of his rigid control of the expenditure he incurred the displeasure of the military officers, and was constantly attacked by them; but he was able to manage the department most economically. Estimates, I find that the present Secretary is almost embarrassed by a multitude of accountants and other financial assistants. In addition to an assistant secretary drawing £1,012, are a finance secretary, who receives £1,112; a chief finance officer, £888; an accountant, £624; and six district financial officers, averaging £645 each. Turning to the naval side, I find that a director of navy accounts is receiving £962; and Large salaries are also paid to finance officers in the air force. Apparently there is no co-ordination between these three branches of the service. The Secretary for Defence should advise the Minister on matters of this description. I am amazed to discover that no fewer than eight officers of the army staff corps receive salaries in excess of £1,000. It appears that £1,000 is the minimum salary in this section of the service. The First Naval Member and Chief Member of the naval staff is paid £3,000 per annum; the Secretary of the Central Administration £2,000 per annum, and two other officers in tlie Central Administration more than £1,000 each. One oflicer alone has been granted an increase of £100. The First Chief of the general staff receives, in addition to his salary, an allowance of £500. Reference to page 142 of the Estimates will show that it is proposed to increase the salaries of members of the permanent staff by £3,870--fro m £126,705 to £130,575. If this sort of thing is allowed to continue, our experience of 1908-9 will be repeated. When the defence estimates were under consideration that year the Labour party was successful in securing a reduction of the vote by £1,000,000 Sir John Forrest was at that time Minister for Defence, and he threatened to resign, but upon pressure being brought to bear upon him, he reconsidered his intention and retained his office. If a casual glance through the Estimates reveals such anomalies as those I have mentioned, I feel sure that a complete analysis of the position would astound, not only the Minister, but honourable members generally. Glancing through the I have been astonished to discover that the Commonwealth is making contributions to the Imperial Navy Pensions Fund, the Imperial National Health Insurance Fund, the Imperial Unemployment Insurance Fund and the Imperial Widows, Orphans and Old-age Pensions Fund.

We are spending a large sum of money in training men at the Jervis Bay Naval College. When they reach a certain standard they are sent to England for further training. Upon passing their examinations there they come back to Australia to such subordinate posihis case is deserving of special contions as sub-lieutenants, although they are sideration. Each of these cases should qualified to take up positions as lieutenants. This is not as it should be. The fact of the matter is that the Royal Australian Navy is a mere appendage of the Royal Navy. It is deplorable that after nineteen years, our own Australian-born trainees are not permitted to fill reinterests of one individual only. We are sponsible positions in the Royal Australian Navy. The position at the naval base at Western Port is even more unsatisfactory than the position at Duntroon. Everything possible is done to anglicize the staff there. The men who play Australian football are seriously prejudiced in regard to advancement. The English offieers in charge are doing their utmost to encourage English customs and English games. Soccer and rugby footfall are played in preference to the Australian rules game, as is the case at Duntroon. I trust that the Minister will investigate the matters I have brought under hie notice. If he does so I shall feel that my remarks have not been in vain. direct the attention of the Minister for Defence( Mr A. Green) to an anomaly in connection with the Imperial pensions paid to residents of Australia who served in the British Expeditionary Forces during the war. The case of Mr Lawrence Browne was a sergeant in the Royal Army Medical Corps. in Australia in April, 1909, and resided here until he left for England in June, 1915, to enlist in his old unit. He returned to England only because he was rejected for service in Australia. He arrived in England on 29th July, 1915, enlisted at once in his old unit, served in various theatres of war, and was discharged in England on the 16th . April, 1919. He returned to Australia on the 16th September, 1921. He went to Canada'in 1919 en route for Australia, but was detained there owing to the illness of his wife. Mr Browne claimed payment of the £50 grant which was given to Imperial reservists domiciled in Australia, provided that they returned to Australia not later than the 30th June, ' 1920. Browne did not return until fifteen months after tliat, but be considered on its merits. There are only 25 to 30 applicants, and the expenditure involved, according to the defence files, is £5,000. I wish to draw attention to the manner in which' this financial regulation has been manipulated in the all ready to pay a tribute to Captain Hinkler, who flew to Australia and subsequently returned to England. Captain Hinkler was an applicant for this Imperial service grant. He was not eligible, because he had not complied with the conditions of domicile. Yet he was given the sum of £153 by the, late administration, because of the allegedly special circumstances which the Government claimed entitled it to disregard the regulation. I do not cavil at Captain Hinkler getting this grant, but if the Government could place a liberal interpretation upon that regulation in one case, the whole of the other cases should be reviewed. Browne sold up his home and left Australia because he was not accepted for service here. He went to England, served in the Imperial army, and returned to Australia. On several occasions I have brought this case under the notice of the Minister. I again ask him to review them carefully, and wherever possible to rectify the anomaly that exists at present. During the budget discussion I criticized He arrived the Government's defence policy and its decision to abolish compulsory training. To-night I shall confine my remarks to other matters to which I think the Government's attention should be drawn. I look upon compulsory training as a fail accompli. It will not be amiss for me at this stage to point out that when a soldier member of this House speaks on a subject of which he has some knowledge, I do not think that it . should bei regarded as an opportunity for honourable members such",83,Surveying Ship

The honourable member for Corangamite ( MrI hope that the Government will give Crouch) when speaking the other night was distinctly unfair to the air force. He said that it was useless, or words to that effect and that when a plane was lost dent of the Aero Club, I was apin Central Australia, the air force could not go to the rescue of the aviators. associated with that incident with which the honourable member should familiarize himself. At that time the air force was using gift equipment. Aeroplanes of 1917 design had been given us by Great"" Britain. Those machines were perfectly safe and satisfactory for training, but they were not suitable for long distance cross-country flying. It was the irony of fate that the suitable Wapiti machines, such as honourable members have seen flying over Duntroon, were just landing. the air force as a force; I said that we vice to Tasmania. had received little result for an enormous expenditure. pilots equal to the world's best.

Under those circumstances, it must be maintained at a standard of efliciency. consideration to the establishment of an air service between Tasmania and the mainland. Some years ago, when Presiproached and asked if I would organize an air service to Tasmania. I went to There were many things great pains to bring it about, but was unsuccessful. The late -Postmaster General( Mr Gibson) and the present Postmaster-General( Mr Lyons), then Premier of Tasmania, were enthusiastic about the scheme and were prepared to assist in establishing it. In 1927 the late Government promised an air service to Tasmania, but, unfortunately, the financial stringency that followed prevented the Government from carrying out its promise.

371,Mr White,"We have in Australia tralian Air Force have accomplished theof overcoming some .of the difficulties under which Tasmania, now suffers. One of those difficulties is the almost annual strike of seamen that occurs during the Christmas season. Tasmania would then receive more of the tourist trade to which she is entitled. The Minister for Defence has taken exception to my recent criticism of him, and has endeavoured to disprove certain facts and figures quoted by me. I realize that he is new to the work of his department, and is more or less bewildered; but what I have quoted is unfortunately true. On the 6th December last T asked the Minister a question regarding the proposal to adopt a new military uniform, and I inquired if it would be provided by June next. The reply that I have received is as follows:I am now in a position to inform the hontralia were invaded, the honourable memorable member that sumcient stocks of the existing pattern uniform are held to permit of his share, and, if he were a conscientious issues being made to any persons duly enrolling in the military forces. I ask the Government whether it is fair to indulge in what almost amounts to false pretences. It is almost playing a confidence trick to say, time and again, that attractive uniforms are to be given to volunteers. Much has been said on this matter, as well as on the formation of Scottish and other national regiments. The establishment of compulsory military training and the abolition of national regiments was a great democratic movement. The uniform issued to the troops was considered good enough for active service, and in it the traditions of the Australian Imperial Force were founded, and use under any system. Government, unfortunately, promised that a more attractive uniform would be provided, to induce men to volunteer. It was quite wrong to promise that. The Government now says that it will continue to issue the uniforms that it previously condemned. The Minister has told us that volunteers were coming forward as they should, and has accused me of discouraging enlistment. figures quoted by him, but I was correct in my statement that only about 10 per cent, of the rank and file were enlisting, as from the figures he has quoted have to be deducted the officers, non-commisMr White. sioned officers, and band, who number about 70 in each case. ThatI am not discouraging enlistment is proved by my own battalion, in which the enlistments are at least equal to the best in Victoria. For this I claim no personal credit, as special facilities are afforded the Melbourne regiment in the way of extra recruiting depots. When I criticized the voluntary system, I did it as a matter of policy, and in my capacity as the member for Balaclava. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lewis) spoke of boy conscription, and the enlistment of children of 11 years of age. Has he read the Defence Act? He ought to know that, at the age of 17 years, the senior cadets begin their training, and after that they serve for three years in the citizen forces. Even now, if Ausber for Corio could be conscripted to do objector, non-combatant duties could be found for him. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) said that he hoped that the survey work round the Australian coast would be proceeded with. Finally, I trust that the excellent work of the Air Force in completing the survey of the Great Barrier Reef will not be interrupted. This duty gave excellent opportunities to Air Force pilots to demonstrate the usefulness of the Seagull amphibian machines while aerial photographs furnish some of the best material available for map-making. it should be suitable for for Defence) [1.40 a.m.] -The honorBut the able member for Moreton( Mr Francis) spoke of the withdrawal of the Moresby from the work of surveying our coastline. The late Government was responsible for that, because no provision was made by it on the Estimates for the £60,000 that would have been required to carry on the service this year. The present Government, on assuming office, was faced with a deficit of £5,000,000, with a prospect of a deficit of £2,000,000 I take no exception to the at the end of the year, unless heroic efforts were made to square the ledger. No one is keener about this survey than I am, and no part of the coast is more in need of it than that of Western Australia. Still, the honourable member to",86,Surveying Ship
372,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie,"Ministe rwhom 1 have referred was entirely mistaken in saying that the charts are over 100 years old. Defence has not been thrown overboard by this Government, as the honourable member suggested, but a policy has been introduced in accordance with the platform of the Labour party, which favours voluntary instead of compulsory military trainiug. So far as the manufacture of munitions is concerned, the leeway has been made up, and there is a full supply at present. If more munitions were manufactured they would deteriorate, and would have to be destroyed. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Lewis) referred scathingly to the salaries paid to various officers in the Defence Department, and it is my duty to defend men who are not in a position to speak for themselves. Defence Department has onerous duties to perform. He entered the department as a civilian, and he has to act as a buffer between the military, naval, and air arms of the service, each of which is anxious to obtain a good deal of money. It is his duty to advise the Minister in this matter. In comparatively few cases have the salaries of officers been raised. The fact that this year £712,000 is to be spent less than last year shows that a radical saving is being effected. cluded special defence expenditure which was met out of reserves; but, taking the ordinary votes, the expenditure on his department will be £507 more than last year. ment proposed to cut down the expenditure considerably. It decreased the Estimates by £500,000, and this Government has made another cut of £160,000.

The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch) alleged that too big a proportion of the personnel of the Australian Navy had been imported, but the fact is that 75 per cent, of the personnel to-day are Australians. His allegation might have been true once, but not now. The The Secretary to the suggestions offered by honourable members in the course bf this debate will be reviewed more fully later, and will be given what consideration is possible. Honourable members cannot expect me to effect a revolution in the administration of a department in three weeks. The man) referred to the treatment of an ex-service man, Lawrence Browne, by the department, over the payment of a grant. It must be remembered that there are certain regulations governing these matters, and in this, as in the payment of old-cage pensions, &c, anomalies sometimes occur. This man had been discharged from the forces fifteen months subsequent to the 30th June, 1920, the last day on which, according to regulations, payments could be made. In those circumstances, I think there were reasonable grounds for not giving the man a grant. It has been mentioned that Hinkler received a grant of £130, although his case was similar. That, I maintain, was an unfortunate way of recognizing Hinkler's achievement, and £ represented a lack of judgment on the .. 3,864 part of someone associated with the last 14,000 administration.

Any suggestion that Ministers and their officers may not be acting in the interests valuable rights of honourable members to of tbe majority of the people is met with various forms of abuse, and suggestions are made that such critics are in favour of the importation of black labour, undermining the standard of living, and throwing Australians out of employment.

I have on to discuss any particular item of the tariff, but rather the functions of the Tariff Board. I submit that the Tariff Board has been ignored in connection with certain items in the tariff schedules that have been tabled recently. It appears to be obvious that the recommendations of the five economists to whom I have referred have not found favour with the Leader of the present Government, for it has introduced new duties without any inquiry whatever having been made in relation to them.

I support the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham). It is extraordinary that this important item should be treated with indifference. It ill-becomes the Ministry, at this early stage of its career, to ignore questions put to it by the Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps the Attorney-General, if he is in difficulty over the question, could have a consultation with the Treasurer, who is a tactician in these matters. a.m.] I can assure the committee that the Country party is equally interested in this subject. For the year 1928-29, the expenditure was only £1,951, yet the sum of £5,000 is provided for this year, when less will be required. I ask the Attorney General to enlighten the committee as to the justification for the item. -The Industrial Peace Act was passed in 1920, for the purpose of dealing with certain industrial difficulties that had arisen at tliat time. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which had been on the statute-book for many years, was considered not to have been entirely successful, and an endeavour was made to introduce a new system of dealing with industrial disputes. The Arbitration Act provides that interstate disputes shall be heard by a single judge; but, under the Industrial Peace Act, an attempt was made to introduce the parties to a dispute into its determination, by giving them representation on the tribunal. It is true that there is a provision in the Arbitration Act for assessors to sit, but, unfortunately, this has been seldom utilized. Under the Industrial Peace Act, there is provision for representatives of both sides to sit together, with a chairman appointed by the Government of the day. In making the choice, the desires of the parties are studied. These tribunals have been sitting for a number of years in the coal industry. Theoretically, they can deal only with interstate disputes, but, in fact, they have been dealing in an irregular manner with many other disputes, and the present position is that all the matters controlled by industrial peace tribunals are in a condition of complete confusion. I challenge anybody to say clearly what the position is with respect to the hundreds of so-called awards supposed to have effect under the Industrial Peace Act. The late Government, attempted to deal with this matter, and the effort failed; but that does not relieve the present Government from its responsibility. I do not ask it for a complete and industrial policy at this stage. I wish to know why it is now proposed to provide £5,000, to be spent in the current year on these tribunals? Nothing like that sum was spent last year. It was proposed by the late Government to abolish these tribunals. ment provided this sum. year only. There was a provision at the end of the Estimates of the Attorney General for an amount expected to be saved, that was largely made up of savings to be effected in connection with the Arbitration Court and the Industrial Peace Tribunals. It is true that the general figures were left unaltered in many cases. It was proposed in the Maritime Industries Bill, introduced by the late Government to put an end to the Industrial Peace Tribunals. If the present Government were using them to settle the present coal dispute, one could understand their continuance, but that is not being done. The provision seems to be entirely unnecessary. Proposed vote agreed to. Proposed votes, Refunds of Revenue, £1,000,000 and Advance to the Treasurer £3,000,000 agreed to. WAB SERVICES PAYABLE OUT OF REVENUE. Proposed vote, £1,419,821.

I have submitted a case to the Minister, and it has been very reasonably dealt with. .

The honourable gentleman spoke of the persistent attacks made upon men occupying high State positions, and said that such attacks were calculated to render it increasingly difficult to obtain the services of first-class men. hostile criticism and the imputation of improper motives were generally detrimental to the best interests of the service. The questions I asked were not directed against this oflicer in any personal sense whatever. assumption by the Leader of the Opposition of a superiority quite unwarranted by the facts. He referred to my question in a manner which I thought would have been considered a breach of the established procedure of this House. I claim that any honourable member of this House in asking questions concerning important services or important offices under the Crown should not have his motives impugned. For some time past I have been interested in the career of the gentleman occupying the position we are now considering. There are many reasons for that. In the first place we find that this officer ia in receipt of a salary of £4,000 a year, and that he is an importation into this country. My questions were not inspired animus against the officer, but by a desire to establish the principle of preference to Australia and Australians in all our legislative and administrative acts. This gentleman receives £4,000 a yeara greater salary than that paid to the Prime Minister. It is a monstrous thing that this should be so. Is it implied that no Australian is competent to fill this position. Is there anything to justify the subordination of officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, who have spent their lives in honourable service to their country? My attention was first drawn to this officer by the issue of a quantity of very skilful publicity matter systematically issued in his interests. I engaged in a research of such publicity. The result would astound any one interested in such activities. Quite a number of questions are still to be addressed to Ministers concerning this officer and his activities. deal of his personal leisure in order to increase the efficiency of the department. put many good Australians out of jobs. He has been described as a man who has performed wonders since he has held this He remarked that position. I admit that he has performed wonders, but they are not of the kind we should admire. He has worked wonders in skilfully securing orders for overseas combines and manufacturing firms to the constant and systematic disadvantage and I deprecate the loss of Australian manufacturers, and to the impoverishment of Australian workmen.

I am speaking uow out of a desire to ventilate something that very much needs ventilating. The appointment of this officer is characteristic of a number of appointments for which the late administratiou was responsible. They were of such an amazing character that this country has been absolutely swarming with chairmen of evasions, presidents of prevarications and directors of delays. A great deal has been said and done from time to time in the name of efficiency, and some of us have come to loathe the very word because of its misapplication. Efficiency experts may well be classified with experts of the three card trick, and of the walnut and the pea. Against that kind of expert any member of this House is, I think, entitled to raise his voice in protest. The Leader of the Opposition has said that this officer saves his large salary several times each year, but we have not been favoured with any particulars to substantiate that claim. several times monthly, I should say. been responsible for millions of pounds of Australian money being paid away to overseas interests, and for thousands of Australian workmen being deprived of a livelihood. ber does not supply any figures in support of his statement. figures when the honourable gentleman to whose remarks I am replying failed to give any particulars of the large sums allegedly saved several times each year by the superlative qualities of this intellectual giant. The claims made on behalf of this officer may be justified to a very large extent, but I suggest that a very poor compliment has been paid to the intelligence of this country. The Leader of the Opposition, in the course of his reference to my questions in the House, said that some persons achieved some small degree of popularity wdth the unthinking by advocating ' certain methods, but that they did an ill-service to Australia. I am willing to concede that the honourable gentleman believed what he said, but I urge him to think again. Honourable members will observe in his statement the same calm. assumption of superiority, as previously stated by me, and a claim for a monopoly of good intentions, good thinking, and good service to Australia. The conclusions arrived at by the Leader of the Opposition suggest confused thinking on his part, and have led to the acceptance of conditions which are certainly doing a real ill-service to Australia. I deprecate the line of criticism that has been indulged in by the Leader of the Opposition in having singled out one who ventured to ask certain questions. I had every justification for asking those questions. I did so in the best interests of the public services of the Commonwealth, and on the principle of "" Australia first, now and always."" a.m.] I have not risen to defend the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, but. I cannot refrain from expressing amazement that the honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat should adopt such a hostile attitude towards him. Mr Brown is recognized throughout Australia as a man of outstanding ability. He is in control of its greatest business enterprise, and is doing wonderfully good work in the service of the Commonwealth. The principal charge of the honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) against Mr Brown is that he is a Britisher. I have not the slightest doubt that, although the association of the present Postmaster-General with Mr Brown has been very brief, he recognizes in him a gentleman of outstanding ability. That was the opinion held of him by the late Postmaster-General, and it is held also by others who have been in close association with him. My reason for rising was to refer to the proposed vote for South Australia. I regret that this year it has been reduced by £88,717.

Unquestionably the department has made wonderful progress during the last seven years, particularly in regard to the facililating to both. ties which have been given to the more remote portions of the continent and to rural producers generally. I sincerely hope that the policy of the present Postmaster-General will be along similar lines. The policy of the late Postmaster General was to establish services wherer ever possible without providing buildings of too costly a nature. There comes a time in nearly every town when the building that was erected many years ago is no longer suited to the business that has to be transacted. several such buildings in my electorate. At the Wolsley post office a considerable quantity of mail matter has to be dealt with. It is a most inconvenient office both from the point of view of the public who have to be served and also for the postal officials who have to handle a mass of mail matter in a space that is too crowded for efficient working. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide a very much better building. The present structure is on railway property that is not easy of access, and is altogether too cramped for the work that has to be done in it. The post office at Edwardstown is on the boundary of my electorate and that of the honourable member for Angas( Mr ject to the provisions of the Queensland Gabb) who, if he were here, would support my remarks concerning it. Edwardstown is a rapidly-growing suburb, but the postal facilities are not in'keeping with the volume of business that has to be transacted. Malang and Clarendon also have outlived their usefulness. From conversations that I have had with the Postmaster-General, I believe that it is his intention to continue to extend the facilities that were provided by the late Postmaster-General. While he is doing that I hope that he will consider the needs of towns where the postal facilities are out of date. Where there is more than one town close to the border of two States considerable inconvenience is caused by the fact that one has not a telephone directory Sir. M. Cameron. of the other The* residents of such towns would be deeply appreciative if the Postmaster-General would instruct his department to provide for the use of subscribers in each town telephone directories reI hope that the Postmaster-General will not accept the picture that has been painted by some honourable members regarding the valuable service that is being given by his department. It is claimed that great progress has been made by thp department during the last six or seven years. I am not acquainted with the work or the capabilities of the gentleman who is receiving £4,000 a year to control the business of that department, but I can There are say that during the last six or seven years both the postal buildings and the postal services have sadly declined. The buildings, more especially in the western districts of Queensland, are in a shocking condition. A system has been established-and I hope that the Postmaster General will not allow it to continueof inviting tenders for the erection of post offices. The majority of the buildings in my electorate are tumbling down; and in places where settlement has sprung up postal facilities have not been provided for the people. Mount Isa to-day has a population of 3,000, and its requirements are served by four officials who are housed in a tin shed.

I notice that funds have not been provided for the establishment of a post office there. The other day I was advised by the Postmaster-General's Department that it had invited applications from persons who were willing to erect a building which they would be prepared to lease to the department for the next five years for the",98,Postmaster General S Department

He did not suggest that persons coming to this country from the other side of the world could not become good Australians; rather did he complain that Australians have to leave their own country to be appreciated. I speak feelingly, because three of my own children have left Australia. The policy of the Postal Department during the last few years has been entirely wrong. In my own electorate, rents are being paid by the department which would more than cover the capital cost of adding a story to the Newcastle post office. Notwithstanding these high payments, the accommodation provided for the officers is inadequate. In other places postmasters, who were really caretakers of Commonwealth property, are to be moved out to make way for the constructional staff and others. That is a short-sighted policy. Country people should have all the facilities that can bo provided, hut I know of places where the department is regularly losing revenue because it will not make adequate provision to gather it in. As soon as the Postmaster-General has had time to get into his stride, he should look into these matters, and, while ensuring that the interests of the department are protected, give better service to the public. other occasions I have said in this House that officers who have not an opportunity to defend themselves should not be attacked by honourable members. I do not know the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, but I have heard severe criticism of his administration, and the Postmaster-General should inquire into the statement that a lot of postal material is being imported which could be made in Australia. Criticism of this kind has come from officials and others in different States. I heard something to that effect in a capital city only a fortnight ago, and the remark made by Eldridge) suggests that such criticism has some foundation. The salary of £4,000 paid to Mr Brown is excessive, having regard to the fact that in young and developing country districts services that would not cost much but would be of great benefit to the residents are withheld because of the financial stringency. the head of the Department. of £4,000 we could get the services of an Australian who is equally well qualified. The South Australian Government engaged a railways commissioner from America at a salary of £5,000 a year for seven years; the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner is an Australian, and I would prefer him to Mr Webb at the same salary. The amount that could be saved on the salary of Mr Brown would provide some of the services that are at present denied the people in the rural areas. We should give Australian engineers an opportunity to show what they can do. The Deputy Directors are Australians, and they are always ready to investigate, personally, the requirements of country districts. I would give such men an opportunity to show what they can do as head of the department, rather than import a man from",100,Postmaster General S Department

While I deprecate the making of charges against a public servant who is not able to defend himself, I must admit that there is justification for some of the statements of the honourable member for Martin( Mr re-employed. Eldridge). It has been said that I should be the last to complain about the work of the previous administration, because of what has been done in my electorate. I reply that my electorate is the second largest in the Commonwealth. This may not count for much in the ordinary way, but it counts for a good deal when it comes to the provision of postal facilities. Eyre Peninsula, which is part of my electorate, is half as large as Victoria. Until a few years ago it was not developed to any extent, but rapid advances have been made there recently, and the provision of postal facilities is very much behind the requirements. I visited the town of Minnipa a few months ago and found that the small post office there was overprior right of appointment. We cannot crowded to a serious degree on the business day of the town. A similar condition of affairs was noticeable at Wudinna. At KImba the young postmaster is obliged to live in a most dilapidated house, although a block of land was purchased some time ago for the purpose of erecting a house for him. I urge the Government, notwithstanding the financial stringency, to give close that I have already given to the honorattention to the requirements of the country districts. I have privately asked the Postmaster General to do his best to provide employment for certain married returned soldiers who, as temporary employees of his department, have recently been dismissed. 80 or more young men should have been brought from various towns in Queensland and as far north as Cairns and placed in the positions formerly filled by these returned soldiers in the Sydney Post Office. It must have cost the Government between £20 and £30 on the average to bring these men to New South Wales. The Minister for Markets and Transport has assured us that there will not be any more evictions of soldier tenants from war service homes, and I appeal to the Postmaster-General to give an assurance not only that there will be no further retrenchment of returned soldiers who are temporarily employed in his department, but that as far as possible the men already dismissed will be General) [4.8 a.m.] -The reason why the services of certain temporary officers have been dispensed with is that a system of training introduced by the previous administration some time ago, particularly in the telegraph department, has produced a number of qualified young men who, as permanent officers of the Public Service, are entitled to preferment when positions become vacant. In the circumstances the Government has had no option but to give these men employment in preference to temporary employees. Men have been brought from Queensland to New South Wales because positions have become vacant in New South Wales to which such officers had a keep the work of the Public Service in the various States in watertight compartments, and I suggest that very few honourable members would desire to do so. General make every attempt to absorb these dismissed temporary employees in some other capacity? able member that every attempt will be made to do so. No one regrets the retrenchment of these men more than I do. Certain criticism has been levelled against the permanent head of my department, MrH . P. Brown. I have not had a long experience of the Commonwealth Public Service; but I was for a long time. I cannot understand why associated with the Public Service of Tasmania, and I learned to value the loyalty and fine service rendered to that State by its public officers. I also learned during an extended ministerial experience there that it was the duty of a Minister to be loyal to those who were loyal to him. I have every intention of being loyal to my officers. I wish to say quite definitely that I have had no reason to believe that there is any lack of loyalty or efficiency on the part of the head of my department towards me or the Government.

I did not misinterpret them. permanent head of my department is not an Australian. For my own part, I favour the policy of preference to Australians, but neither I nor this Government is responsible for this particular appointment. In any case, I trust that we shall not be so narrow as to refuse to recognize the merits of a man who is a native of another part of the Empire. that as there were Australians competent to discharge these duties, preference should have been given to one of them. native; but my parents were not, although they helped to build up this country. Those-who come here from other parts of the Empire should be encouraged to assist in the development of Australia. I hope that we shall not count it against a man that he is not an Australian native. Some comment has been made about the salary that is paid to Mr Brown. This was fixed by the previous administration, but again I suggest to honourable members that we shall gain nothing and possibly lose a great deal by offering poor salaries for the leading positions in a department which handles millions of pounds every year. A good man can save his salary ten times over in his department. broadly and aim at securing the greatest possible efficiency. UntilI am convinced that an officer is not earning his salary I shall have no objection to paying it, whatever it may be. The honourable member for Martin asserted that the permanent head of my department was doing things detrimental to the best interests of Australian manufacturers and was assisting outside manufacturers. It has been the policy of successive Governments to administer this department as a business undertaking. In these circumstances the permanent head of it must act in a business-like way. If a particular Government desires to give special preference to Australian products at a considerably greater cost, I have no doubt the head of the department will carry out the policy provided that he is given the necessary funds to do so. of previous administrations for many years to give preference to Australian products. previous administration this officer discriminated against Australian enterprises, Australian technique and Australian workmen. has not proved those statements. whelming evidence in support of them. ment must accept responsibility for what has happened in the past, and this Government will hold itself responsible for what happens in the future. It has been said that great things will happen when the present Postmaster-General gets into his stride. That, of course, will depend upon the amount of money made available to me by the Treasurer. The provision of additional postal facilities in country districts depends upon financialconsiderations. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) has said that the Department has been guilty of sweating. I shall look into that matter. If there is sweating it can be overcome only by providing sufficient money from revenue to prevent it or by cutting down the service.

The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) suggested that an extra storey should be added to the post office at Newcastle, but there, again, the money has to be found to carry out that work. It is of no use finding fault with the head of the department, because, unfortunately, the funds at his disposal are limited. This Government is doing much more than the previous Government did and proposed to do this year. When I took office I found that it would be necessary to dismiss at Christmas time over 1,300 men engaged upon new works, because the money made available by the previous administration for such work would be absorbed by that time. Recognizing that these works were necessary I put the case to the Cabinet, and I obtained the assurance that au additional £400,000 would be made available. That has enabled me to continue those works until the end of this financial year. The 1,300 men who were to have been dismissed are to continue in employment and an additional 400 men will be engaged. The suggestions that have been made by honourable members will be given serious consideration by the department and myself, but it must be recognized that the state of the finances is the key to the situation. I hope that the position in regard to postal and other facilities will, by the end of the financial year, be so much improved that honourable members on both sides will have little cause for complaint.

(6) The alternative request of the growers, submitted on the same occasion, for an increase in the duty on imported leaf and a decrease in the excise duty on locallygrown leaf. (o) As to whether the arrangement entered into between the Commonwealth Government, certain States, and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, to carry out experiments in the growing of tobacco leaf in Australia, is in the best interests of the growers. (d) As to whether, in the best interests of the growers, the arrangement should be altered so as to ensure that the Federal direction of experimental work should be made a permanent phase of the tobacco growing industry in Australia. 2.

I consider that we are Speaker, as well as towards honourable members generally, and the members of the various staffs who have always been so good to us. I wish to draw attention to two matters upon which I feel considerably aggrieved; 1 refer to the taxation that is being imposed on the people by the tariff schedules that have been placed upon the table of this House, and the absence of reports of the Tariff Board, requests for which have been made time after time. Those reports must be in the hands of the Ministhe impression of a member of the Band ter, and they should be made available to honourable members. Recommendations made by the Tariff Board are for the guidance of not only Ministers, but also Parliament and the public. It is contended that many of the proposed new duties have a scientific basis. I should like to know who is the scientific genius who induced the Minister to increase the duty on microscopic slides by 2,600 per cent., and on hoods for children's hats by over 1,000 per cent. We should be given an assurance that the reports which have been dealt with will be sent to honourable members so that they may be able to make some preparation for the debate on the schedules.

Having reached the present stage in our protective policy, we are justified in asking that something be done for that section of the community which provides the wealth that enables the Government to give effect to proposals such as that which I have described. . I express regret that it has been necessary to adopt this stand in the closing hours of the Parliament; but I am perturbed because many of the reports of the Tariff Board have been dealt with by the Minister, but have not been presented entitled to demand that they be placed before us as early as possible.

The appropriation for the year, 1929-30, amounts to £5,000.

I do not know whether those newspapers consider that the honourable member was actuated by lofty ideals and altruistic motives in making that attack. Another newspaper has alleged that the officers of a particular Government department had been guilty of espionage.

I trust that the Prime Minister will announce the intention of the Government before we rise.

During the election campaign the Labour candidates exploited the coal position and the sufferings of the people. ""What is the miners Christmas box? What are their greetings? They are filled with an utter despair. and misery stalk through the Hunter electorate. Have the miners broken the law, or refused to obey the award ? No. They desire to be law-abiding citizens and to obey the law. The previous Government stood behind the coal-owners, ready to club the miners into submission and eager to break the award under which they were working. Although all parties in this House realize the extent of our constitutional difficulties, they have, at least, some duty to perform to the coal workers. Honourable members cheer one another, so why not give the mining community greetings? wrong in both sides of this House agreeing to give the mining community some little comfort for Christmas? In my electorate there are women with careworn faces, and on the advent of the anniversary of the lowly Nazarene something should be done for them. 1 mentioned in my last speech, when I was in a different mood from that in which 1 am to-day, but I should like to enjoy my holidays in my electorate, secure in the knowledge that the mining community are getting some little comfort. I ask the Leader of the Opposition whether he would oppose a grant to these people, who have committed no wrong and broken no law? Would the members of the Opposition criticize this Government outside this House if it were courageous enough to give, say, £20,000 or £25,000 to the miners to tide them over the Christmas holidays ? That would be little enough. There are 36,000 of my constituents absolutely on the verge of starvation, and I appeal to all honourable members not to let this opportunity pass without giving them some assistance. I do not wish to criticize the Government, but I withdraw nothing of what I said on Tuesday last. Had this Government had the courage to take over the mines, the people of Australia would have suffered no opposition. We on this side of the House would have lost Mr James. is because the Government nothing. We would have lost not one power. Labour supporter or one Labour vote. When the late Prime Minister committed an unconstitutional act in attempting to deport Walsh and Johnson, did he lose one Nationalist vote ? No, he did not. He was returned to power. Did the last Premier of New South Wales lose any votes Starvation when he committed an unconstitutional act by trying to place a tax on newspapers? No, he did not. Therefore, 1 say that had this Government attempted to take over the mines it would have lost nothing even if it had failed. The Government should be prepared to carry out its election promises to the people, and had it taken any action to open the mines, that would have strengthened its hands when asking the people for full industrial powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. Yesterday I put a question to the Attorney-General, and it has not yet been answered. I do not say that the AttorneyWhat would be General has deliberately not answered, but when I asked the question he requested me to place it upon the notice-paper for to-day. There is no notice-paper for to-day. This House will adjourn, and my constituents will have to suffer a long period of want before that question is answered. I believe that in courtesy to me the Attorney-General should answer that question to-day. I also intended to direct to the Minister for Defence the question that the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) raised. WhatI wish to know now is whether this Government has the courage to give some cheer to the miners, who have committed no breach of the law? There does not seem to be any sympathy among honourable members for the miningcommunity. The miners are looked upon by some persons as being of a red revolutionary character. That is an altogether erroneous idea. These people are law-abiding citizens. They desire to remain law-abiding citizens. The only time when sympathy is extended to them is when the public reads in the daily press that 20, 30, or perhaps 50 miners have been sent to eternity through some explosion or other disaster. These men go down into the bowels of the earth, toiling -to procure the fuel required to keep industry going, to provide power for transport purposes, and to give the community warmth in winter, and the other comforts that result from the use of electricity and gas and the operations of steam-driven machinery, for a thousand purposes. Honourable members do not realize, as I do, that these comforts are purchased at the cost of the sweat and blood and the miserable lives of the miners.. Honourable members do not understand my position. Some complain that I speak with too much emotion. But from my tenderest years I have been closely associated with the people employed on the mining fields, and know their sorrows and hardships. When a mere child of eight I saw my eldest brother brought home a corpse, and my father a cripple, as the result of an accident in a mine; and in later years I have had to convey the news of tragedies to the wives and children of men who have been killed. I implore honourable members to consider this matter from my viewpoint and to try to appreciate what I am telling them. They will find, if they study them with sympathy, that the miners are only human beings, after all. In conclusion, I urge that the questions I am about to ask may be answered before the House rises. This is what I ask the AttorneyGeneralI n view of the fact that the New Soutli Wales Government proposes to permit a breach on the miners' award by employing miners and others at Rothbury colliery at lower rates than those specified by the Federal Coal Tribunal, which was created by this Parliament, and has been registered under the Industrial Peace Act, all are, because of the poisonous gas to does the Attorney-General intend to take action to restrain the State Government and others from committing a breach of the award? I direct my next question to the Minister for Defence( Mr A. Green), or to the Prime Minster( Mr Scullin), whichever of those Ministers is able to answer itIs there any truth in the published statemake it pay owing to the difficulties exments that two van loads of equipment, such as bedding aud tents, arc being sent from the Liverpool military camp to the Rothbury colliery?

I have already spoken on the motion now before the House. lowsW ill they take their courage in tlieir hands,, and grant £23,000-no t £1 per head-to the suffering women and children on the northern coal-fields ? I do not propose to cover the whole of the ground traversed by my friend, the honourable member for Hunter, but I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the very serious position on the coalfields. One realizes that much has been done, and that the powers of the Commonwealth Government are limited with regard to this matter; but, since it appears that the trouble will spread beyond the borders of New South Wales, and as the New South Wales Premier is positively taking sides against the miners, will the Government give the whole position its earnest consideration, to see if something can be done now to make the mine-owners fall into line aud bring the trouble to an end ? The honourable member for Hunter knows that I am fully conversant with the position on the coalfields. The mine taken over by the State Government is not only dangerous, as they be contended with, but, especially so, because of the natural dip of the seam. Jt is a mine in which no amateur should work. Yet this is the mine which has been selected by the New South Wales Government to be put into operation. Why? Because the company that has been operating it has never been able to perienced in working it.
