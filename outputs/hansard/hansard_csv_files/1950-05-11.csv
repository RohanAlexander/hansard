If detailed complaints about this and other similar matters have not reached the Minister, will he have an investigation made to ensure that displaced persons and their families shall bc treated fairly? viously been made to me about the lack of heating in accommodation provided for the displaced persons to whom the honourable member has referred. I shall investigate that complaint immediately. With respect to complaints about the food supplied to migrant hostels, I personally have inspected a number of those hostels. So far as I have been able to ascertain the quality of the food supplied has not altered since the Government in which the honourable member was a Minister was in office, and I am certain that his colleagues, the former Minister for Immigration and the former Minister for Labour and National [821 Service would assure him that the food prepared under hygienic conditions. The only complaint that has previously been made was in respect of food that was supplied to men who were working under hot conditions with the result that some of the food became tainted. I assure the honourable member that the food supplies generally are of high quality and have given general satisfaction.

That is not so. It is true that some government annexes which are engaged in the manufacture of ammunition and ordnance accept civilian orders, but none is at present engaged in the manufacture of .22 calibre or shotgun ammunition. As far as I am aware, Imperial Chemical Industries Limited is a large manufacturer of ammunition of that type. Its output is distributed in the ordinary way through the trade. I am not aware that any such ammunition is being exported. IndeedI doubt whether any is being exported.

At least five types of jet-propelled airliners are being constructed in Great Britain at present, but they require not less than 3,000 yards of runway for take-off. There is no aerodrome in Australia at present that could accommodate such types of aircraft. appreciable lapse of time will occur before jet-propelled aircraft will be in operation in Australia. Plans are in prospect for the extension of existing runways at capital city airports so that they will be able to cope with jetpropelled commercial airliners by the time they are likely to be operating here. I believe that the runways at Darwin are already long enough to . accommodate such machines. I remind the honourable member, however, that other considerations than the length of runways must also be taken into account. One of these is the difficulty caused by the scorching of runways. These matters are being considered by the Department of Civil Aviation. for Immigration whether it is a fact that passports were issued to Messrs. James Healy, Ernest Thornton, Walker alias Dixon, E. V. Elliott and other Communist party leaders before' the advent of the Curtin Government in October, 1941. If so, will the honourable gentleman indicate whether it was the Lyons Government, the Menzies Government or the Fadden Government that issued or reissued passports to those and any other Communists? Isi t a fact that, under the Passports Act, the Minister may cancel any passport at any time? If so, why has he not cancelled the passports of Messrs. Thornton and Elliott, who left Australia recently, and why did he allow Mr Elliott and the Minister for Air to leave Australia together in the same aircraft last week-end? I ask the Minisduring the period that the honourable member has mentioned, passports were issued hy previous governments to the gentlemen to ""whom he has referred. A t no time has any restriction been placed on the issue of passports to persons on account of their political or industrial activities. The only limitation, as was indicated yesterday, has been in the case of passports for travel to India. Specific requests from that country have been received by this Government, and previous governments, that passports issued to known Communists should not be made available for India. There has not been at any time a policy of refusing passports along the lines indicated by the honourable member. The Government has under consideration at the present time, as was mentioned earlier, the question of what should be done in relation to passports when requested by known Communists. The decision of the Parliament on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill now before it will no doubt have some bearing upon the attitude of the Government in this matter. I do not know whether the honourable member who makes the strong representations in favour of refusing passports to Communists is stating the official policy of his party. If he is, I shall be glad to have confirmation of his statements from his leader. Such confirmation would be of great assistance to the Government in its consideration of this problem. regard to an answer given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture recently to a question concerning the supply of cornsacks to Australia, will the Minister bear in mind the necessity for similar action relative to the supply of onion sacks ?

While answering this question, I am happy to be able to say that since I replied to a recent question on cornsacks, I have been informed, that, as the result of a direct request by the Prime Minister to the Indian Government, 70,000 tons of cornsacks and material for making cornsacks have now been allotted to Australia. This quantity is slightly less than the'total amount we shall require, but it gives me good reason to hope and expect that there will be no acute shortage of sacks in any of the industries needing them. There are some matters associated with the ultimate shipment to Australia of the sacks which are still a matter of negotiation, but I have no doubt that the basic problem has been solved. formed me in answer to a question yesterday that it was not proposed to make any funds available for new developmental projects anywhere in the Commonwealth.

Is it also a fact that that project has cost the State of New South Wales approximately Â£2,500,000 to date, although not one steel rail has yet been laid? Is it a fact, too, that the route traverses one of the greatest open-cut coal-fields in Australia? It is situated near Wollar, and its estimated area (vide page 2407), on motion by Mr is approximately 5,000 square miles.

53,Mr Blrd (Batman) [11.6],"Thisdriven underground. The banning of the Communist party in this country will not solve the menace of communism here. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the electors of Australia at the moment approve of the banning of that party. In other words, they approve of the bill up to clause 4. I have taken an unofficial Gallup poll during the last two week-ends to ascertain the opinions of my electors regarding the bill, and I say quite unhesitatingly that a great majority of them favour the Government's proposition up to the point that I have indicated. It would be useless to try to develop an argument to show that that is not the case. It can also he generally agreed that the Australian people are united in their detestation of underhand, harmful, communistic methods. To use a vernacular term, they have "" had "" the Communist party. I suggest that the Communists, by a succession of anti-social and anti-national actions, have forfeited whatever sympathy the community may have had for them in the past. Nevertheless, a very thorough examination should be made to determine whether communism and its attendant evils could not in fact best be suppressed or defeated through the adoption of a more democratic policy in this country and by putting such a policy into action to the fullest possible degree. As I said a moment ago, the banning of the Communist party will not suppress the evils attendant upon the machinations of Communists themselves. I consider that, irrespective of the merits or demerits of the present measure, the main, battle-ground of the Communist party is in the trade union sphere. However, this legislation, for what it is worth, is certainly deserving of the support to the proposal I have mentioned to see what it can accomplish as a method of combating the Communist party and some aspects of its activities. A close examination of the bill, however, has led me to believe that endless problems will present themselves for solution once the measure has come into operation. Of course, it is the Government's responsibility to face up to those problems, and I shall leave the Government to face them, but I consider that it would be wise at this juncture to mention some of the problems that may arise when the measure has become law. Experience in the last war has shown that in spite of a most efficient police and counterespionage system in the countries occupied by the Nazis, underground organizations were able to carry on with a great degree of impunity. I believe, therefore, that irrespective of certain of the provisions contained in this measure the Communists will still be able to operate underground. I know that it has been said tliat they are underground at the moment, and I also know that at this very moment they are making definite plans ahead in order to harass the Government and the community by the use of underground cells. It is possible that when, by virtue of this legislation, certain Communists who hold office in the. trade unions have been removed from such office, the prestige of the people persecuted, or rather prosecuted-honorable members may use whatever term they please according to their points of view-wil l be enhanced and their advice will be clandestinely given through groups or by medium of men who are in secret sympathy with them, and in such circumstances the advice may perhaps find more general acceptance than it does under the present conditions. The Communists, working underground, will undoubtedly make efforts to continue their policy of causing industrial disputes. AlthoughI see these eventualities, I cannot deny that the people in their present frame of mind are prepared to give this measure at least a trial. Despite the sneers of honourable members opposite that the Labour party has not fought the Communist party in any way, I consider that it is impossible to contradict successfully the fact that the Labour party and trade unionists have consistently fought the Communists on whatever ground has been available to them. It is my deliberate and calculated opinion that, irrespective of the merits or demerits of this legislation, the battle against communism must still be won in the trade union sphere, and I hope that honourable members opposite and the people of Australia will not be led to believe that if this legislation is carried the battle with communism will have been successfully concluded. Nothing could be further from the truth. In recent years many Australian trade unions have successfully rejected Communists who had previously held those unions under their sway. I am prepared to concede that all unions have not yet been successful in doing so, but a great number of them have been successful in that respect. The Labour party has organized industrial groups that have already provided very stubborn and successful opposition to the Communists. Those groups will continue to fight the Communists under whatever name they may come to be known in the future. Perhaps, they will call themselves progressive, or militant, Labourites. In that way, ultimately, the Labour party, will eliminate Communist influence from the trade unions. The Australian Labour party industrial groups were formed as the result of the growing realization by trade unionists that it was their responsibility individually to deal with this matter and that they should not leave it to the Government, to a few trade unionists or to a few energetic members of the Labour party. Communism will be eradicated only when trade unionists themselves realize that that responsibility is primarily theirs. They can discharge it by taking a more active part in the management and conduct of their organizations, particularly by supporting only men who are not Communists in the election of their office-bearers. Although the Labour party has conin the co-operative movement. sistently preached opposition to Communism, supporters of the Government have attempted to line our party up with the Communist party. They have said that the objectives of both parties are similar, and that members of the Labour party are only staging a sham fight against the Communists. The history of the Labour party disproves that allegation. Indeed, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) himself, in his second-reading speech, laid great emphasis upon the fact that the Labour party has from time to time made strong declarations against the machinations of the Communists. He quoted a strongly worded resolution that was Afr. Bird. passed unanimously at the 1948 conference of the Federal Executive of the party, in which the party as a whole castigated the Communists. As recently as last Sunday, Dr. Sydney Berry, a visitor from England, when speaking at Wesley Church, Melbourne, saidTrade unionists in England are the inplaeable enemies of communism. That is the attitude of the Labour party towards the Communists, not only in Australia, but also in all countries within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Mr Herbert Morrison, the Deputy Prime Minister of Great Britain, epitomized Labour's detestation of Communist methods in a speech that he made on the 23rd March last when he saidThe Communist programme was ""trickery in politics, treason in matters concerning the defence of our homes, trouble-making in industry, and tyranny wherever they can seize control' by hook or by crook "". There has been, in the last year or two, a great and healthy rejection of Communists in our trade union movement, but they still hold some positions of importance. They should be democratically got rid of as soon as possible. No doubt it will take some time to cleanse our trade union movement entirely of this taint, but no day should go past without members of trade unions reminding themselves who are these men in key positions who are pledged to subvert the unions to their own purpose of conspiracy against the nation, men who are responsible to the Communist party rather than to the trade union rank and file. We cannot pretend that all is right with cnr economic democracy as -long as men, who are heart and soul committed to destroying democracy and damaging our economic well-being, occupy key positions in our great democratic trade unions, or, for that matter, Those are the sentiments of the Labour movement throughout the world. Despite the fact that the main purpose of the bill, which is to dissolve the Communist party, is accepted generally, considerable uneasiness exists in the public mind concerning certain machinery provisions of the measure. We must remove every vestige of justification for the claim that the measure is in any way totalitarian in nature, and also all doubt whether it will bring about a state of affairs that will be worse than that which it seeks to remedy. We must ensure that in the present revulsion of feeling against the extreme left we shall not precipitate circumstances that will encourage the extreme right to impose its will upon the democracy of this country. During recent weeks many people have informed me that they helieve that certain provisions of the measure constitute a threat to the liberty of the ordinary individual. That uneasiness has been expressed in the columns of newspapers throughout Australia which consistently support the non-Labour parties. Those journals have questioned the wisdom of certain provisions of the bill. For example, the Melbourne Sun of the 4th May, in a leading article, dealt with the amendments that tbe Opposition has foreshadowed and statedSome of the provisions of the bill which the executive urges should be amended have already aroused doubts and questionings in the minds of persons unconnected with the Labour movement and unswervingly opposed to Communism. The Melbourne Herald in a leading article on the 3rd May statedAt the same time it must be recognized that many Liberal-minded people who are not members of the Labour party and who are staunchly opposed to Communism are concerned about some machinery aspects of the bill which they fear may imperil longcherished principles of civil liberty. The placing of the onus of proof on the accused, the wide powers of search given in the bill are two of the things that are causing some uneasiness. On the 4th May, the same newspaper published an article by E. H . Cox, its political correspondent at Canberra, in which he saidAfter six days of study and examination, some uneasy reactions to parts of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill are emerging in Canberra. Those who have these misgivings are neither Communists nor, in general, members of the Labour Party. They are advocates of vigorous and sustained measures to stamp out Communism lock, stock and barrel. After referring to the general criticism that is being made of the machinery clauses of the bill, the writer continuedThere are fears in the first place that the Bill puts the Security Service in a role never intended when it was created, and into one which by traditional British standards is a little sinister. Also causing some concern is the principle of the right to break into premises and search tliem without warrant when it is suspected that the premises contain Communist property. The Bill confers this upon very vaguely named authorities who will presumably be Commonwealth Security or Commonwealth police officers. This is a power which contraverts the perhaps hackneyed but deeply-seated principle of British community life that a man's home is his castle. If I had sufficient time at my disposal I could give many more illustrations of the uneasiness that exists in the community concerning certain provisions of the measure, but I have produced sufficient evidence to show that the public and the press are of opinion that the bill should be amended along the lines foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley). The implications of the bill as a whole should be examined most carefully. For that reason, I regret that the Government has decided to guillotine it. I should like a definite assurance from the Government that this legislation will not at any time in the future be applied to non-Communist militants in the industrial movement. It may be that at some time in the future militants in the trade unions could be accused of doing what the Communists are now accused of doing. Will the provisions of this bill be extended to them? What will be the reaction of the Government if , when Communist activity ceases, at least officially, as the result of the implementation of the provisions of this bill, strikes still continue? Will the Government then turn against the trade unions as a whole? Has not the protection of the individual been diminished by the decision of the Government to use undisclosed sources of information, by its reversal of the principle of the onus of proof, by the retrospectivity of this legislation and by giving to certain persons the right of search without warrant? These serious questions should be very carefully .considered before a final decision is reached. In my view this bill places too much faith in government decrees. We accept the position that if this bill becomes law it thereby becomes the policy of the country, but we do not believe that everything in the garden will then be rosy. In its proposals to implement the principles of this bill the Government has adopted ideas which are foreign to the Australian set-up. For that reason the Opposition proposes to submit four amendments during tbe committee stage. I hope that the Government parties w ill not pre-judge them and airily dispose of them by saying, "" The whole b ill or nothing "". I understand that the Prime Minister has already said that he w i ll not accept any amendment that interferes with the principle of the bill. The underlying principle of the bill is the banning of the Communist party. endorses that principle. The method by which that principle is to be implemented is, however, a vastly different matter. The four amendments which Ave propose to submit Avill deal only w it h matters of method. I express the opinion that if the Government does not accept the proposed amendments this legislation, in the course of time, w ill become unworkable and will cause more dislocation, confusion and chaos than exist at present. I conclude by stating the opinion of a very influential neAvspaper, which by no stretch of the imagination can be regarded as a champion of Labour, on the amendments proposed to be submitted by the Labour party. In a leading article entitled "" Next Move Rests Avifh Ministers "", which was published in the Melbourne Age, on the 9th May, the following paragraphs appear:The general tenor of machinery amendments suggested by the Labour Party shows that it is in close touch with public opinion. Of the disputed questions, that relating to onus of proof is the most contentious, closely folloAved by that dealing with the right of search without warrant. From the outset, many people AVIIO haA'e no partisan interest in the bill, but approve its main purpose, were somewhat taken aback at the radical departures from established usages and procedures and the fact that these things were proposed by a Liberal Government. Since discussiou of the bill began, the conviction has grown that objections to infringements of British practice have substantial validity, and tliat these proposals invite any person. The preamble to the bill sets resistance unless it can be shown beyond doubt that the main purpose would bc defeated Avithout such noA'el, drastic, and even revoluthis Parliament w ill do its duty by protionary provisions. When the gravity of the circumstances provoking this legislation is acknowledged, it is a very serious step to write into one of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation a principle that denies to the individual the normal assumption of innocence till proved guilty, Avhile excusing the Crown from the normal obligation of proving its case by facts and evidence. Mr Bird. This legislation, as varied by the four amendments which are to be submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, w ill be worthy of a trial. I have grave doubts of its efficacy, but at least if the Governnient accepts the amendments to be submitted by the Leader of the Opposition the legislation w ill have the support of the peoph' as a Avhole. Time alone w ill prove whether this very contentious experimental legisThe Labour party lation is effective. Parliament Ave legislate under the provisions of a Constitution which was drafted by some of Australia's greatest men representing every Avalk of life in the community. They Avere steeped in the British ideas of freedom-freedo m of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of political views. The framers of the Constitution realized that it was necessary to provide means for the protection of these freedoms. So, engrafted in our Constitution, are a number of sections designed for that purpose. Any act of this Parliament which invades those freedoms i? ultra vires the Constitution. Accordingly, no citizen of this country need fear that any of his vital freedoms may be infringed by an act of this Parliament. Those Avho drafted the Constitution realized that if a government is to exist it must be able to protect itself against its enemies. Avhether from abroad or within. So. they engrafted in the Constitution the wordsThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to legislate for the peace, order, and good goA'ernment of the Commonwealth Avith respect to . . . the defence of the CommonAvealth. Another section of the Constitution not only confers on the Executive the right but also imposes on it the duty to preserve the Constitution. This bill has nothing Avhatever to do with free speech. It ha.s nothing to do w i th the political views of out that there are certain enemies of Australia within this country and thai tecting the Constitution and the people of Australia from the activities of those enemies. This, then, is a defence bill. Indeed, insofar as it ceases to be a defence bill it is obviously ultra vires the Constitution. As a defence b ill it recognizes what has been proved beyond",19,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
54,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [11.31],"In thisdoubt, namely, tbe existence of enemies witbin this country and it states that this Parliament and tbe Executive bave the duty of protecting the people of Australia from their activities. There is nothing particularly new about the provisions of this bill. It merely proposes a re-imposition of the ban on the Communist party which was imposed on two occasions by a previous government but in a more complete form. The earlier legislation failed because it went only a part of the way. They did not fill up all the holes in the legislation. The Communiste were able to carry on their traitorous and seditious activities because of the loopholes that existed in that legislation. On a previous occasion, the Communist party was banned by the Menzies Government, but when Labour came into power it removed that ban. I suggest that that was the Labour party's undoing. In 1947, this party which had legalized the Communist party realized that these men were traitors to the country, that they were fifth columnists and that they were working for the overthrow of our constitution and the destruction of our rights and liberties. So the Chifley Government passed an act to deal with the Communists and to place a partial ban on them under the defence powers of the Commonwealth because it realized that they were traitors to the country. I have before me the bill that it passed. It is entitled "" An Act to Provide for the Protection of Approved Projects and for Other Purposes "". This act was passed by the Chifley Government with only one purpose, which was to prevent traitors in this country from interfering with its defence. There is no better way in which the need for the bill before the House can be proved than by quoting the words of a very distinguished lawyer, a former justice of the High Court of Australia, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition-the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). When the right honourable member introduced the bill to which I have just referred, he was attacked by the very same men who are attacking the Government and its supporters at the present time, namely, Communists and fellow travellers. The right honourable gentleman had to defend himself and his Government and not only did he defend himself with the spoken word but he also produced this little booka very excellent book-bearin g the Australian flag on its cover with the title, ""Hands off the Nation's Defences "", by the Right Honourable H . V. Evatt, Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. In this book the right honourable gentleman first asked whether the Labour Government had a mandate to do what it proposed to do. .1 ust as it is being asked to-day whether the present Government has a mandate to ban and outlaw the Communist party so the right honourable gentleman first inquired concerning his mandate and then cited the mandate that he had. It was a mandate from his own party to pass that particular bill, a mandate given in a resolution of the Australian Labour party which was passed on the 10th May, 1949, and which read as follows:It is apparent that the propaganda recently issued by the Communist Party in connection with this undertaking is for the sole purpose of defeating the Australian defence policy in the interests of a foreign power. That is the mandate that was given by the Australian Labour party to pass the bill to which I have referred. The object of the bill was to deal with people who were traitors to the country and were destroying Australia's national defence in the interests of a foreign power. The right honourable gentleman gave a history of his bill. He wroteIn June, 1947, the Chifley Government introduced, and the National Parliament passed with only one dissentient, the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act. The necessity for this measure in the interests of the defence and security of Australia was clearly shown by the recent attempt by a few persons of Communist sympathy to bring about a "" black"" ban of the long-range weapon project iu central Australia. There was no mincing of words in that statement. This bill was aimed at the Communist party. Why? Because, as the former deputy leader of the government stated, it was a traitorous party. The right honourable gentleman went on to say what people are saying to-day, in these termsCritics have alleged, for example, that the new act goes further than is necessary for defence; and that the act unduly curtails freedom of expression. That is exactly what honourable members means and destroy freedom of speech and of the Opposition have been saying. The expression. On page 2 of this excellent right honourable gentleman proved in this little book book that that argument was entirely fallacious when he wroteI assert, in reply, that the act strikes at the would be saboteurexactly the same man as the bill before written by a distinguished member of the House strikes atand not at the legitimate critic That bill now before the House does not cluded a passage under the heading strike at the critic or at the person who "" A very ugly incident ""-and I remind believes in Communist philosophy.

The Constitution guarantees it. The bill will not touch one Labour man or one Socialist unless that Labour man or Socialist-o r Liberal for that matter-desire s to bring about the overthrow of the Constitution by revolutionary means. The Communists are being dealt with in this bill under the defence power of the Commonwealth because they are attempting to overthrow the Constitution by revolutionary means. In this little book the right honourable member for Barton wroteI assert in reply that the act strikes at the would be saboteur and not at the legitimate critic and that the act safeguards freedom of speech and expression as fully as though that fundamental democratic right were written expressly in the Constitution. Similarly this bill will protect the freedom of the people because it will defend the Constitution against those who propose to overthrow it by revolutionary honourable member. the Labour party and is a very well reasoned document. The author inAlthough the attempt temporarily fizzled out, it constituted a very ugly incident, and it has undoubtedly The Government also felt that in its attempt to prevent sabotage the full co-operation and support of organized labour would be Government better assured, and misunderstanding prevented, by avoiding any resort to the Crimes Act. This Government could have resorted to the Crimes Act. In fact, some members of the Opposition have suggested that it should have done so. But why did not the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) resort to the Crimes Act, when he was Attorney-General, as he has said in his booklet that he could have done? Why did he introduce a measure to impose a partial ban upon the Communists? The truth is that he knew that it would be better to do that than to invoke the Crimes Act. The only fault of that measure was that it did not totally ban the Communist party; it merely excluded Communists from the defence project in Central Australia because they had placed a ban upon the undertaking. Had the right honourable gentleman gone the whole way and banned the party entirely, we should be enjoying now greater prosperity and happiness than we have.

Similar provisions might be justified in very special circumstances. En other words, the right honourable gentleman claimed that the Crimes Act, which was in existence during the entire eight years of Labour government, could be used to cast the onus of proof upon a defendant, and in certain circumstances could properly be invoked for that by (1.) purpose.

As provision for searches to be made with the right honourable gentleman has stated out warrant, and I hope that the Governin his booklet, when dealing with traitors ment will be able to accept an amendment there are circumstances in which the onus providing that a magistrate's authority of proof should be placed upon the defenshall be obtained before a search is condant.

63,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [12.0],"O nI refer to the second-reading speech of tie Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on this subject. He said that at one time he was not in favour of a ban on any political party, but that time and circumstances had caused him to revoke his former opinion. In the same way I say, in my own humble capacity, that at one time. I should never have approved or supported any measure which banned a political organization, but I believe that the circumstances of to-day are different. Because the pressure is urgent, because of the world march of events and the clash of great forces, and because of the critical man has a value only in as much as he position of Australia, I express here and now my sincere support of that portion of the bill which deals with the Communist party. In regard to certain other parts of the bill, however, I shall later make some observations which I trust will be considered and accepted by the Government parties. Therefore, I preface my first, remarks in this debate by saying that I disagree entirely with the honourable member for Sturt( MrI n that postulate, man is reduced to the Wilson) who, if I heard him correctly, said that communism was a political creed. researches lutionary creed. political creed. If the conclusions from my researches into this subject are correct, and those researches have extended over a long period of years, communism is more than a political creed. It is a code of life, a philosophy, a code of procedure and a political dogma. From the mouths of those who expound the Communist theories that form the principles on which the party drives its objectives closer to their goal, we gain the best condemnation of communism. That is my justification for supporting certain provisions of this bill. I propose to read at length quotations from the works of Commuuist leaders, past and present, and I shall not apologize for doing so, because I believe that, on this most important subject, an honourable member should justify his attitude. I consider that the Communist party should be banned or abolished and I shall endeavour to justify my opinion by showing that, in all states of society, the Communist party is a menace to man's dignity, to religion, to civilization, to law and order, and to the normal processes of democracy. I give my approval to certain clauses of the bill because I believe that we must support those essential features of our society that the Communists seek to destroy. I have said that communism is a code of life and of morals, and reduces man to the indignity of being a mere cypher. Marx himself saidMan, of and by himself, has no value. A belongs to a revolutionary class. As soon as he ceases to belong to that class, his usefulness also ceases. Marx also wroteThe idea that every single man in the world has value is the essence of democracy, and democracy was born of a Christian notion that every man has an immortal soul. We deny that man has a soul, we deny a man has value. It is only as a member of the class that he has worth. position of a cypher without a. soul. Communism is opposed to freedom. Engels, If I am coi'rect in my who was one of the great fathers of materialistic atheism., known as communism, saidFreedom is the right to do what you MUST. We can imagine the sneer on his face when he pronounced those words. Engels illustrated the point by sayingIfI drop a stone from my hand, the stone is free to fall because it obeys thc law of gravitation: so, under the Communist system, you are free so long as you obey the mind of a dictator. . I repeat that I make no apology for reading at length extracts from the works by the fathers of communism, because, whatever may be the faults of the Communists, there is this to be said for them, that they follow slavishly the doctrines that have been expounded by Ludwig von Feuerbach, Marx and Engels, and translate them into ordinary practice. They never deviate from the words and from their interpretation by the latterday apostles of Marxism, namely, Lenin and Stalin.

Using the phrase of Charles Kingsley, he applied it to communism of his day, and to his creed, as enunciated in Das Eapital, and repeatedReligion is the opium of the people. Lenin carried the point further in 1913 when he saidAll religious ideas are an unspeakable abomination. God is, historically and socially, a complex of ideas engendered by the ignorance of mankind. At the Seventh Soviet Congress, which was held in 1935, a Communist made the following statement:We shall fight without mercy all who bar our way in the struggle against God. It amazes me that, in view of those fundamental Communist philosophies, some ministers of religion have the effrontery to appear on platforms with Communist speakers and mouth the platitudes of empty communism. the attitude of communism towards ethics. Eegardless of our political differences, we recognize that there is a certain code of ethics in democratic societies. But the Communists reverse the rule of ethic3. I cite the writings of their High Priests on the attitude that Communists are to adopt towards codes of behaviour. Lenin saidIn communism, every form of ruse, deceit, lying and knavery is permissible. Stalin, in supporting that particular statement, saidCommunism is founded upon violence which recognizes no law and is restricted by no duty. Trotsky wroteCommunism is founded on the principle that the end justifies the means and anything is good which furthers the revolution and anything is bad which deters the revolution. Dimitrov, the Secretary-General of the Comintern in 1935, saidWe are sometimes accused of departing from our Communist principles. What stupidity! What blindness! We should not be Marxist and Leninist revolutionaries, nor disciples of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, if we were not capable of completely altering our tactice, and our mode of action as circumstances may dictate. When a party is based on such philosophies, it presages no good for the country in which it is functioning. Por the reasons that I have enunciated, I believe that some of the early provisions of the bill are justified. The future, for Australia, is forbidding if the Communist party's principles are allowed to be engrafted on the body politic. The Communists, if they are permitted to flourish undisturbed, will pursue their policy of class warfare and the enthronement of the proletariat, and that objective is to be accomplished by a sanguinary revolution that will destroy the principles and the things that most Australians hold dear. I shall read another extract from Left Wing Communism in which Lenin wroteDictatorship of the proletariat to be achieved by the fiercest and most merciless war and a resolute and persistent struggle, sanguinary and violent. In Infantile Sickness, Lenin also statedI warn our followers to expect a war a hundred times more difficult, more drawn out, more complicated, and the most blood-thirsty war that could be possible between nations. In his book Insurrection, Lenin wroteThe victory of the proletariat could be achieved by wading through rivers of blood. His remarks were supported by the Communist text-book on international revolution, Armed Insurrection, by Neuberg. The following statement appears on page 215:The masses must realize that they are going into a bloody and desperate armed struggle. Contempt for death must become widespread amongst the masses so as to make victory secure. Their watchword must be to attack, not defend; their objective-the pitiless extermination of the enemy. I pause at that stage. In all sincerity I am amazed at the temerity of honourable members opposite in accusing the Labour party of sharing the objectives of the Communist party. I point out to them that the Labour party in Australia and Labour and socialist parties throughout the world are the first parties marked down for destruction in the Communist upsurgeI f honourable members opposite will read about the strategy and tactics of world",28,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
66,Mr Ceemean,"Let us considercommunism in a book that was not produced by any Communist authority but by the United States Office of War Information, they will find confirmation of my statement on almost every page. The capitalist classes are not singled out by the Communists to be destroyed first. The classes and parties akin to the Australian Labour party and the Australian working class are singled out for destruction by the Communists. The whole history of the Communist upsurge in the countries of Europe shows that the Communists' first desire is to exterminate the socialist parties which represent the working classes. tries have been taken over by the Communists. members to the case of Poland, where a government known as the Lublin Government was established as a result of a wicked decision by the Big Three at the Yalta Conference. When that government was firmly ensconced in the saddle the men picked out for liquidation were not the capitalists but men like Froelich and Zoehler, who led the socialist parties in that country. When the Communist party was firmly established in power in Czechoslovakia who were the people to whom the Communists turned their attention? They were the representatives of the labouring classes who belonged to the equivalent in that country of the Australian Labour party. Communism hopes to see society fall into two classes, an upper class and a proletariat, the latter of which it will be able to dragoon and discipline for the destruction of the former. In Australia and in other British countries the class represented by the Labour party is the barrier between those two classes, and that is why the Communists seek to destroy it. Honourable members opposite have alleged that the Labour party has a kinship with the Communist party. Such allegations are unfair and unjustified. To support my statement about violent revolution being the aim of the Communist party, I again quote from the Communist text-book Armed Insurrection, by Neuberg, which states at page 266Street fighting, aiming at the physical extermination of the enemy, should be entirely without quarter. Any sign of human feeling from the proletariat to its class enemies during the armed struggle merely creates fresh difficulties, and may, if circumstances go against us, lead to the failure of the movement. With those thoughts in mind it is obvious that these are inward manifestations of the outward methods that are repugnant to all of us. They lead us inevitably to the conclusion that it is consistent with Communist principles and practices that a state of economic disorder should exist and to the fact that in countries in which the Communists exercise power their aim is to exterminate the classes opposed to them. It is also consistent with those refer honourable practices and principles that there should be a constant and unremitting war against religion. That is revealed by the imprisonment of distinguished members of religous orders whose only crime was that they upheld the law of Christ. I repeat that illustrations could be given indefinitely and extensively to show that these manifestations are but an outcome of the inward drive of Communist philosophy. I now turn to the amendments that are to be submitted by the Labour party when immediately the bill is at the committee stage. As this subject has been very extensively canvassed during the course of the debate, it would be idle and repetitious if I were to go over the whole of it again, but I submit that if this bill is to be workable and not to be a negation of human liberty and fundamental rights in this country, the Government might be well advised to accept the amendments that we propose to move. I know that honourable members opposite can cite measures adopted by this Parliament that have contained the onus of proof provision, but the general application of the law in this community is that the onus of proof is upon the accuser and not upon the accused. I believe that the Government could, without sacrificing the effectiveness of this measure, accept the Labour party's amendment in that respect. Other matters that are to be the",29,Honourable Members Hear Hearl

68,"Mr Cremean""","Isubject of amendments are the right of search without authority, the right of appeal and some other matters that are allegedly fundamental features of the bill. Closer analysis, however, shows that they really are not fundamental, but are unnecessary applications of the authoritarian principle. It seems to me that if those provisions are to be retained in the bill we might just as well revert to the conditions that operated in Russia in the times of the Czars and decide that we shall have another Ochrana at work in this country. I deplore, as does every decent democrat who hates communism, the drift towards authoritarianism in this country. We have had indications of that drift in the course of this debate. We have had, for instance, the statement by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) that certain members of the Labour party could be declared under the bill when it becomes law. I consider that by that statement the Prime Minister has lost the estimation that many people had for him because of his undoubtedly fine presentation of his second reading speech when he introduced the bill. His statement is an indication of the present trend to authoritarianism. If that trend continues the Government will be doing more to accelerate the advance df the Communist party, whether above ground or underground, than it could possibly imagine. I suggest that the inclusion in the bill of the amendments that this party proposes to submit, will not impair the effectiveness of the measure. I sincerely trust that the bill will achieve its first objective, sion, but I do weep over the attacks on which is the suppression of the Communist party. I shall shed no tears over the Communist party when it has been suppressed, because I recognize its evils, and so does practically every honourable member on this side of the House. When honourable members opposite suggest that the Labour party is closely akin to communism I wonder whether they are just political fools or are just raking in the political ash-cans of their own imagination. Do they honestly believe that that imputation has any substantial basis? They know as well as I do that even though there may be Communists and fellow travellers under cover in the Labour movement, the same thing applies Mr Cremean. to the Liberal party. During a strike by engineers in 1947 the plans of the Chamber of Manufactures in Melbourne leaked out to the Communist party. It became fairly obvious that one member of the Chamber of Manufactures was letting these plans become known to the Communist party. It was subsequently discovered that a member of the Chamber of Manufactures had told his wife, who was a Communist, of the plans, and that she in turn had passed them on to the Communist party. but his wife was a member of the Communist party, and all the plans that were being prepared by the Chamber of Manufactures to break that particular strike or lockout were leaking out to the Communists. It would be well, therefore, for honourable members opposite, when they make the imputation that we have Communists in our ranks, to ask themselves Australian whether that might not be true of their own party. Any Communists in the Labour movement are not known Communists. As soon as they are discovered to be Communists they are expelled. Over the years the Labour party, by its unremitting opposition to everything communistic, has steadily put its house in order. Could the same statement be made about the parties opposite? I leave the matter at that stage and shall now summarize what I have had to say. There is no room for communism in this land of Christian ideals and democracy. I shall not weep over its suppresman's fundamental freedom and personal rights that are contained in this bill. I think that in order to make this bill workable the Government and its supporters might be well disposed to accept the amendments that we shall submit. has indicated that he will accept some of them. of them. That they are reasonable most honourable members know.

72,Mr Cremean,"Let him accept allmember of tbe Labour party and while I have been a member of it I have stood for election eleven times. I have always been opposed by a Communist candidate except on one occasion. The bitterness and virility of the opposition between the Labour party and the Communist party exist not in theory but in fact. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr to the tyranny of the few. In short, this Calwell) could tell the House that I had the great honour to have a brother who made his mark in the Victorian political sphere and who was respected by all people. His life was filled with fights against communism and his death was accelerated because of the worry that resulted from his recognition of an evil that the members of the Liberal party did not wake up to until a very late stage. First we should disabuse our minds of the claim that the apparent reduction of the number of registered Communists is due to any governmental action or tactics employed by a Labour government, because it was disclosed in evidence that was given before the royal commission that inquired into communism in Victoria that it is part of the Communist tactics for members ostensibly to leave that party and to work under cover in some new guise. Therefore, the claim that there has been a substantial reduction of the membership of the Communist party is false. A Labour columnist, Dr. Lloyd Ross, in expressing opposition to this measure, saidThe bill should not be judged on its intentions only, which are presumably good, but it should be judged on its applications, which are presumably bad. It should not be judged on the principles but on the methods necessary to carry those principles into effect. We can cancel out that opinion by citing the purpose for which the bill has been introduced, and by realizing that communism is subversive in its intentions and dangerous in the application of its principles. Dr. Ross also saidThere is no act of sabotage, or sedition, that cannot be tried or prevented by existing laws or under the normal practices of the law. That view does not take into account the danger that arises in relation to the defence of the country. If we do not deal brutal with sedition until after the event, it will be a case of too little too late; and parison. should we act too late in a matter of national defence our failure could have the effect of bringing about complete national paralysis. Perhaps, the Czechoslovak people comforted themselves with that belief, but it did not prevent a "" red "" coup, the effect of which was to subjugate the vast majority of the people measure does not deal with isolated acts of sedition; it is aimed at an international plot that threatens the whole economic structure of this country. Is it not better to take legislative action of this kind in order to prevent that possibility from becoming a reality than to delay action until it is too late and then try to comfort ourselves with melancholy reflections about what might have been? We must concentrate upon the intention behind the bill. We must realize that for the first time in our brief history we are face to face with a condition of affairs that has been a common experience in all European countries down the centuries when there has always existed the obligation not only to secure their frontiers but also to protect their ideologies and internal economies against the risk of sabotage by foreign agents. This bill is an assurance that the Government lccognizes that obligation, and in spite of doubts or fears upon the point, we shall either succeed or record for ever our unfitness for the task that the people have entrusted to us. I shall consider, first, the principles of the measure, and, secondly, the objections that have been raised to it. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) quoted a statement by the Prime Minister of Canada in which he said that it is impossible to submerge an opinion. But who is dealing with opinions in this instance? This bill is aimed not at opinions but at subversive activities. In order to make clear what it does aim to do I shall quote a statement that was made by another Canadian, Mr Drew, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian House of Commons. Recently, when he proclaimed his intention to submit to that legislature a motion calling for legislation similar to this, he saidWe are dealing with the most terrifying, reality the world has ever known.

78,Mr Bowden,"The members of thenot be here to-day to debate this or any other measure. As the Prime Minister has said, it would be an act of criminal folly to allow this conspiracy to go further. To do so would be to invite national disaster and indicate that we, as members of this Parliament, are false to our trust. Governments of the past have been much too tolerant of the Communists. Indeed they have been tolerant to a degree that it would be charitable to describe as foolishness. That tolerance has ended. In this bill we recognize the danger and accept the challenge. The Labour party, if it can be considered as an entity separable from many members who subscribe to its doctrines, opposes this bill. Let us have no splitting of straws about the measure. We know perfectly well that the overwhelming majority of Labour members in this House think on this subject the same as we do, but we also know that several meetings of the Labour party were required to determine the party's attitude to this bill. These several meetings were necessary to enable the Labour party to do two things. The first was to placate the warring factions in its own organization; and the second was to devise a formula under which it might fight a rear-guard action for the purpose of delaying the passage of this bill and at the same time give an appearance of not offering any objection to it. If the Labour party had no intention to delay this bill or to protest against it Mr Monk would not have been against it holus bolus. I need not remind the House that Mr Monk exercises a great deal of influence in the affairs of the Labour movement. If every Labour member in this House was permitted to vote as his conscience directed one meeting of the party would have been suflicient to ensure the speedy passage of this bill. I am prepared to examine any amendments that may be proposed if they are designed to retain or maintain the cardinal principles of British justice; but in doing so I shall relate the object to the subject. I shall be guided by the principle that desperate diseases require desperate remedies. If a man is dealing with a snake, he does not approach it in the same careless manner as he would Mr Bowden. approach a rabbit. Delay may be dangerous. The Communists may be encouraged to make one last desperate throw of the dice. They may say, "" If we are to go down, we shall go down fighting "". If , as the result of any action they may take, there is a major dislocation of industry throughout Australia which brings misery to millions of people, whowill be blameworthy? Will it be those who are trying to legislate against the possibility of such an action, or will it be those who, in one way or another, are trying to encourage it? I believe that there is merit in the case that has been submitted by the Opposition. Its merit is recognized by the Government. The first objection of the Opposition is to what the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) has described as interference with the rights of trade unions to elect their own officers. That criticism is based on a wrong premise. The Government is not in the slightest way concerned with union officers as such; but it is concerned, and rightly so, with who or what shall be the inspiring force in industries that are considered essential to the development and successful defence of this country. Let us not forget that this is a defence measure. The Government has said that it is the responsibility not of the trade unions but of the Government to determine these matters. The Government will not shirk its responsibility. If this bill is honestly interpreted it will be seen that it constitutes no danger whatsoever to any law abiding citizen. Any person who deliberately propagates a belief in the contrary opinion, whether for personal or political advantage, is just as guilty as the persons whom we seek to control. The second objection of the Labour party to this bill is that it proposes what is considered to be a reversal of the principle in the British process of justice that any man shall be deemed to be innocent until he has been proved to be guilty. There is some merit in that criticism. I have given some thought to it. I have tried to find out whether there is any difference, and if so, how great a difference between that principle and the principle embodied in tbe measure now before U3. Under the present system, a person who iÂ« suspected of a serious crime is arrested. by it. I reiterate that law-abiding citizens Tn order to arrest him a policeman may enter his home, and, if necessary, forcibly of this prerogative of the Government. take him out of his bed. The person is subsequently charged and arraigned before a court. Acting on the assumption that he is guilty, the Crown prosecutor gives him everything he has in the "" locker "". In the eyes of the prosecution the accused man is guilty until he himself or his counsel has proved that he is innocent and that he has been wrongfully charged. If his defence is successful, he is released. Under this legislation a person deemed to be guilty of an offence against the provisions of this legislation will be declared. Declaration under this legislation is equivalent to a charge under the existing laws of the Commonwealth. A declared person may protest his innocence and engage counsel to defend him. If he is subsequently proved to be innocent he will be released. So, the distinction between the system proposed in this bill and that which applies commonly in the laws of the Commonwealth is in some respects rather illusory. How different are the methods now proposed from those employed in Communist countries where accused persons are tortured into making an admission of guilt! The third objection is that the security shall conclude my speech with the words officers may enter the honse of a suspected with which I began it. This bill imposes person with the right of search.

Are honourable members opposite considering those whose rights we seek to protect, or the rights of the suspected saboteur?

Wben society is threatened by war and aggression people scamper hastily home to the fundamental realization that it profits a man nothing to gain possessions, knowledge and power if he loses the freedom on which they are founded.

Because when men become so addicted lose sight of their responsibilities then seized by any leader or minority group that can promise greater benefits to the people in Teturn for the abandonment of their freedom and rights. When men become so intent upon selfish exploitation of their rights that majority interests are side-tracked in favour of a greedy minority, then freedom is also threatened. Por only so long as freedom remains a force for the welfare of all people will for it. Why have people come to believe, Mr Speaker, that democracy is a free ride which does not require them to earn their way? One major cause is certainly a declining sense of responsibility in the home and in the community. Because the family is the basic unit of society, it is there that responsibility begins and unless the young men of this Because lescence. A family is no longer a group good citizenship at the very source. If men are to cherish the freedoms that come to them under democratic self government they cannot be disciplined into devotion. They must be brought to value the great spiritual possessions to which they are born by assuming from childhood a share of the responsibility for safeguarding those possessions. Good citizenship springs from an appreciation of the great values of our institutions and from an active participation in them. It is immoral to claim the freedom of the ballot unless one is ready to share that freedom with every other man. It is hypocritical of people to insist upon freetion side of the House. I have believed dom of opinion unless they grant equal freedom to those who oppose them. It is fraudulent to insist upon the freedom of the press if that freedom is denied to others. Democratic institutions will continue to flourish only so long as they are fed on freedom for all, not on an abridgof the people who take no interest in their ment for some, whether they be Communists or some other oppressive section of society. This contest between the integrity of the individual and the integfew people, In short, the leaders of rity of the State could conceivably last to the end of our lifetime. Theoretically, the odds are on the side of the forces of freedom because where the .State is an instrument of government employed by individuals for their common welfare the progress of the State is naturally propelled by the progress of the individual. Unfettered people will advance further and faster in spiritual truths, social imthe present Government were during the provement and material reward than any slave people, irrespective of the lash under which they labour. Democracy cannot be defeated in a struggle against communism. It can lose only by default. It can only lose, Mr Speaker, if people deny, through indifference and neglect, their personal responsibilities for its security and growth. When one sees the tentacles of communism reaching out to grasp power in every country to-day one can only come to the one conclusion that communism must be stopped somehow at some point, otherwise at some time in the future we shall all be suffering Communist domination-that is to say, all of us who are still alive. The questions that have to be faced in this country are how best to deal with the Communist menace without unjustly affecting the lives of the vast majority of Australians who are not Communists and how to protect their civil liberties. I intend to support the second reading of the bill. I do not oppose the banning of the Communist party or any fellow traveller who espouses the cause of a foreign power which is not acceptable to Australia. I only question the method of putting the objectives of this bill into operation. The political and industrial rottenness of the Communists is well-known to me and to other honourable members on the Opposithat they could be better fought in the open. I have believed that, by making the social and economic conditions of the people better and by giving them security, Communists would disappear politically and industrially. That would be so if it were not for the apathy of the majority own welfare or the welfare of this nation. The fight against communism in Australia has been left to a comparatively Labour organizations have fought the Communists more vigorously, more bitterly and more effectively than any one else. That is why Communists always oppose Labour candidates at elections. One does not hear of many of them opposing the Liberal or Country party candidates. I wonder where the members of coal strike of last year. DidI see them on the coal-fields, fighting the Communists in an endeavour to get the miners back to work? DidI see them suffering the abuse, the threatened violence and the actual violence which I and some of my comrades from this side of the House suffered? I did not eee any Liberal party or Australian Country party, men there, trying to do a job for this country. Their only interest in the strike on that occasion was to discredit the Australian Labour party. They stood back hoping that the Communists would destroy the Labour party. But we did not fail. We persuaded the miners to return to work, and we defeated the Communists. That was proved later in a ballot that was conducted by the northern branch of the miners' federation, which threw the Communists out of office. It was also proved by the results of elections conducted by the Federated Iron workers Association, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, all of which tipped out their Communist office bearers. The coal strike last year was the result of a Communist conspiracy. industrial disturbances are fomented by thf Communists. I have always fought Communists when they have instigated illegal strikes and I shall continue to do so, but nobody should imagine that every strike in Australia is caused by the Communists. Tbat is not so. Many strikes occur because the workers are unable to secure justice by any other means. When the Prime Minister ("" Mr Menzies) named a number of Communists in industrial unions during his second-reading speech, wby did he not at the same time name some of the top-line Commiinists who carry on their activities underground? cÂ£.n tell the honourable member. It is a well-known fact that Communists are to be found in ranks other than those of the workers. Many Communist party leaders are professional men, commercial men, and heads of industrial organizations, but they remain in the background, although they play an important part in directing Communist activities in Australia. I believe that the Prime Minister is fully aware of that fact. I only hope that, if this bill becomes law, the men of whom I am speaking will be screened just as effectively as will be the Communists in the ranks of the trade unions. The Government would be wise to accept the proposed amendments that have been foreshadowed by the Labour party and thereby protect the people who may be wrongfully accused through a misuse of power, false information, or the spleen of some person in authority. We have had experience of the misuse of delegated authority by officials who sometimes look upon themselves as little Hitlers. I repeat that I intend to support the motion for the second reading of the bill, but, at the committee stage, I shall oppose the vicious That was one of the essential steps in the and undemocratic clauses that it contains. most illuminating feature of the debate so far has been the division that was taken in this House last night to determine whether the bill should be declared an urgent measure. Members of the Labour party to a man opposed the motion, thus indicating that they did not consider it an urgent measure. Many other Fortunately, we on this side of the House realized the urgency and extreme importance of the bill and therefore we provided for its passage to be expedited. We have heard much wailing and gnashing of teeth from members of the Opposition. As the bill merely sets out to deal with Communists and communism, one would expect it to have the support of all true Australians. However, by their impassioned criticism of certain essential clauses of the bill, various members of tbe Opposition, either wittingly or unwittingly, have taken up the cudgels for the Communists. On Tuesday night we heard the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) at his inglorious best. I use the word "" inglorious "" because nothing is so hollow as hypocrisy. He said that clause 9 struck at the heart of British justice. The right honourable gentleman had no qualms about British justice when, in 1947, he forced upon an outraged people the legislation that was designed to nationalize the banks. British justice did not matter to him then. The protests of the people went unheeded and he completely ignored their demands for the liolding of a referendum, a procedure that would have been of the essence of British justice. referendum on this proposal? altogether too many interjections, and many of them are coming from the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson) and one or two other members of the Opposition. I ask that the honourable member for Bass be given an uninterrupted hearing. Others will expect similar courtesy in due course. that the nationalization of banking was advocated by those arch-conspirators and founders of communism, Marx and Lenin. procedure that they advocated to convert",36,Honourable Members Hear Hearl

That was essential in time of war, of course, but as the Prime Minister has said, we are technically at war with Russia now. silence. If honourable members wish to dispute my request, they can take the proper course to do so. able members that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act, which was introduced by a Labour government, conferred upon the Government the power to compel any person, whether he be relative, friend or enemy, to inform against a claimant for benefits.

Mr Curtin interjecting, member for Watson( Mr Curtin) interjects again, I shall deal with him. interjections, Mr Speaker, because they show that the truth is hurting members of the Opposition. Referring to the bill, the Leader of the Opposition said that the Government was using a steam hammer to crack a nut. Why is the right honourable gentleman attempting to play down the importance of this extremely urgent measure? Why is he attempting to minimize the seriousness of the Communist menace ? I remind him that about 90,000 primary votes were cast for Communist candidates at the last general election, which indicates that the Communist party is gaining strength rather than weakening. The coal strike of 1949 has been mentioned often during this debate and the Labour party has admitted that it was Communist-inspired. That disturbance cost Australians untold millions of pounds in terms of lost production and wages. The Opposition has suggested that the bill will drive the Communists underground, unless it is amended. Everybody should know that the Communists have been underground for a considerable time past and that this legislation will not have the effect of driving them further underground. The Leader of the Opposition declared that Communists had gained leading positions in the trade union movement because they had been able to obtain benefits for the workers when others had failed to do so. Is that the real reason why some members of the Labour party have refused to come out in the open to fight communism? This morning thc honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) read some revealing quotations from I remind honorthe writings of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). We have also heard the meanderings of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) along the garden path. In view of such utterances by leading members of the Labour party, there can be little cause for wonder at the fact that the sincerity of members of the Opposition on this issue has been called into question. I do not believe for a moment that the average member of the Labour party is in favour of communism or is working with the Communists. Nevertheless it has been demonstrated beyond dispute that certain objecI do not mind the tives of the Australian Labour party and the Communist party are identical. I defy members of the Opposition to disprove the assertion that their party's platform provides for the complete socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. That objective is identical with one of the objectives of the Communist party. The members of the Opposition are making a valiant attempt to avoid the real issues involved in the bill, but we have only to consult a map of the world in order to expose the real aim of .Soviet Russia. That aim is complete domination of the world by the Communists. There are Russian agents in our key unions. Such agents are also working actively in the State Departments of Education and in the transport and coal industries. In those positions, they are able to tie up the nation completely and hopelessly.

The blame for these shortages can be laid fairly and squarely at the door of the Communist party, whose disruptive tactics have succeeded as the result of the ineffectiveness of the policy if the former Labour Government. I emphasize the fact that I do not regard rank and nie members of the Labour party as being opposed to the bill in principle. However, progress would be assisted if they would be more honest about their attitude to the measure. I believe that, if they were allowed to speak been heard from honourable members according to their consciences, many of them would openly support the bill as it stands. But caucus has ruled that they must not do so, and a great deal of time has been wasted by useless talk about the protection of British justice. I have spoken of the similarity between the objectives of the Australian Labour party and the Communist party. That fact brings to my mind a point that was debated yesterday by the honourable member for Hindmarsh Cameron), who produced the old chestnut about the Blackburn interpretation of the Labour party's objectives. The honourable member's story does not cut any ice with most thoughtful people, but, lest anybody should be fooled by it, I shall make the facts absolutely clear. The Blackburn interpretation was never officially passed, and it never became a part of the platform of the Labour party. Rule6 of your own conference clearly states that any matter affecting the policy or platform must be passed by a clear majority of all your delegates. able member should address me and not the Labour party. Speaker. At this particular conference a majority did not vote for the Blackburn interpretation. ber at the conference? minutes. Despite the fact that this interpretation was re-affirmed in 1948, it still is not. part of the platform of the Labour party and so the platform of that party is indisputably one of complete socialism. On that line of thought the Labour party runs parallel to the Communist party. No attempt will be made to ban bona fide members of the Labour party, and provision will be made to protect them. However, it is perfectly clear that by espousing a system of socialism the Labour party is wittingly or unwittingly running on parallel lines to the Communist ideology. Therefore, it is not remarkable that people sometimes raise very serious doubts about the sincerity of the members of that party. Some very reasonable expressions of opinion on this bill have opposite, notably from the honourable member for Hoddle( Mr Cremean) and the honourable member for Burke( Mr Peters). I think that generally speaking the Opposition agrees that this is an essential measure. If it really wants to get rid of the red brand which people have placed on it then it should amend its own platform so that its ideology does not run parallel to that of the Communists. The most important aspect of this bill is that ( Mr Clyde it sets out to deal with the King's enemies -the Communists-becaus e communism strikes at the very root of British traditions. Communists, throughout the years, have proved themselves to be ruthless saboteurs, and as such they must be ruthlessly stamped out. That is the real purpose of this bill. Tinder this legislation nobody other than a Communist need have any fears but known Communists should have much to fear. rising to make my contribution to this debate I first say that I shall not make any apologies for declaring myself a militant trade unionist. I have been an honourable member of an honourable trade union for 36 years.

I am a member of the Australian Labour party which has been built up over the years by the pioneers of this great country of ours, and I make no apology for my membership. Nor do I apologize to any honourable member on the Government side for saying that the Labour party must fight both communism and fascism. We shall carry on the fight against disruptionists despite the money that is being poured out against us and the character assassination of our members. The Labour party needs no excuse; it has a definite policy. I oan speak with some experience about industrial matters because I have dealt with both employers and employees. I have sat at the same conference table with employers, and in all my experience I have never met such a vindictive group of men. They employ lawyers and personnel officers to try to wring the most out of tha employees by some clause or word that they insinuate into awards. They do that to try to rob the workers of their just rights. Such actions are the cause of most of the trouble in industry to-day. The trouble is not always caused by the Communist leader, who after all has only one vote in his trade union. In my industrial organization, every member is entitled to vote. Every member can exercise his vote in a compulsory ballot. munists in your union? that is due to the very foolish ahd apathetic attitude of the rest of the members. There are 166 Communists in the Sydney branch of the Boilermakers' Union. There are 5,000 members of that union and if those who are not Communists were all to attend their union meetings and not listen to the propaganda that comes from honourable members opposite, a Liberal Government would never hold office. I was very interested to hear the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) on the second reading of this bill. listening to that speech, I recollected the time when the right honourable gentleman held the portfolio of Attorney-General in travelled abroad as a representative of that Government, and after visiting all parts of Europe he returned to Australia. The first person that he spoke about on his return was a chap called Hitler. I shall read to the House an extract from Smith's Weekly of the 5th November, 1938. The extract isOn October 4th occurred the most ominous event to date-the speech by Mr Menzies, Pederal Attorney-General, to the Sydney Constitutional Association, in which he frankly declared his admiration for Hitler's dictatorship and his contempt for Australian democracy. That is something for honourable members on the Government side to think about carefully. Minister actually say? gentleman was backed up by another honourable member of this House who formerly was Minister for Education in the Stevens Government in New South Wales. He saidThere is no use in having a democracy unless it can rise to a crisis as well as a dictatorship. I do not mention any names, but they are two of the people with whom we have to contend in this Parliament to-day. I see in this bill a deliberate attempt to fasten the shackles of fascism upon the Australian trade unions. We have heard well known trade union executives named in the Prime Minister's speech on the bill. One night we were told of the uncanny methods .adopted by the secret agents of our security service. We were told remarkable stories of their powers of deduction and of the way suspected persons are shadowed night after night and how their activities are traced even though they meet behind closely guarded doors. The following night the House was told that a mistake had been made and needed correction. That admission was made by the Prime Minister himself.

The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr over the air. I shall now deal with Ward) interjected to the effect that the right honourable gentleman could declare a couple of the Labour senators. The Prime Minister repliedI am obliged to the honourable member for constituents have asked me, relative to the suggestion. I can think of at least one that provision, "" What is the Government Labour senator whom it would be easy to declare. I suggest to the House that that was a threat. Then the honourable member for East Sydney saidThe Fuhrer has spoken. And no truer words were ever spoken. The Prime Minister repliedI can think of one member of this House site will agree that the people of Auswho might escape only by the skin of his teeth. That was actually another threat. I am concerned by those threats, and if the Prime Minister looks around the House for somebody to declare, then most members of the Liberal party may be in danger of declaration. I am concerned about why the people of Australia should have to be shackled by legislation of this kind. After the remarks during the Prime Minister's speech to which I have directed attention, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) interjectedThe right honourable member is on dangerous ground. Then the Prime Minister remarkedI agree-o n dangerous ground. If this is able gentleman that he might restrain his interjectors. . . . That is the very thing that Hitler did.

An ordinary working man, who is declared a Communist, will not be able to bear tha cost of an appeal to the High Court in order to establish his innocence. Let us consider what may happen. A peace officer at, say, Alice Springs, who has nothing better to do than go around peeping through people's windows and through keyholes to see what the horrible trade unionists are doing, may knock on the door of a house, arrest the man who occupies it, and drag him to Sydney or Melbourne, and the victim will 'have no course open to him other than to lie in gaol and wait until the court can hear his appeal.

I told honourable members at the beginning of my speech that I was opposed to communism in any shape or form, and I have not heard any honourable members opposite make a similar declaration.

Every member of the Labour party whom I have known over the years, is a good Australian and has produced something for the benefit of the community as a whole. Can honourable members opposite make a similar claim? Of course, they cannot! They merely preach that harder in the interests of the country. They want somebody else to do the work. The Minister for Externa] Affairs made his speech on this bill in his usual glib, arrogant, cheap and crude manner. I realize that it is the only manner he knows, but he insulted the people of Australia, and attempted to link the Labour party with the Communist party. YetI recall that his first action as Minister, when he went abroad, was to collaborate with a notorious Communist, Dr. Soekarno, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, who collaborated with the Japanese in the murder of the sons of Australia.

We then see evidence of the fascist touch. The Leader of the Opposition was assailed with untruthful statements by an honourable member opposite who said that he had, when he was Prime Minister, appointed well known Communists to various Commonwealth boards and commissions. Such a statement is a deliberate lie, and the honourable member knows it. observation of the honourable member for Watson that the statement made by another honourable member was a deliberate lie is offensive to me, and I ask that it be withdrawn. honourable member for Watson to withdraw the words to which objection has been taken. Chair, I withdraw the words ""deliberate lie "". false. was a false statement. The honourable gentleman knew that it was false. There is a definite procedure observed in the [83] appointment of representatives of trade "" unions to Commonwealth boards and commissions. If a government establishes a board on which the representation of a trade union is desirable, the organization concerned is informed of that fact, and its members elect their representative. His name is then forwarded to the Government. I recall that the Chifley Government informed the Waterside Workers Eederation that its two representatives on the Stevedoring Industry Commission were not acceptable to the Government. The Waterside Workers Federation insisted on sending those two persons as its representatives on the commission, with the result that the Government abolished that body and established the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board. A ll honourable members opposite will agree that the honourable gentleman should withdraw his statement publicly. Despite his criticism, the Labour party's great leader, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr But when the wharf Chifley), is a very great Australian who is revered the world over for his tact, great country during the period of transition from war to peace. The Australian people are very grateful to him for pntting Australia on tbe sound financial footing on which it stands to-day. Honourable members opposite have stated that certain provisions should be removed from this measure. But what is the reason for the introduction of this bill? Many members, and a big proportion of the leaders of the Communist party are people who are not Australian-born, but who have come here with a ready-made doctrine to soften our nation up and to prepare us as victims in readiness for their masters to come and absorb us. Trior to the last general election the parties at present in oflice left no doubt in any one's mind about how they regarded communism. We said on every possible occasion that we would ban the Communist party. We are now in the statement was course of carrying out that promise.

139,Mr Gilmore (Leichhardt) [3.31],"workers, but for the application of a foreign doctrine. On every occasion when trouble loomed in the industrial field, whether it was imaginary or real and deliberately caused, the Communists have stepped in and have been able to sabotage our economy for their own ends. Much has been said in this House about putting value back into the Â£1. I remind honourable members that it is not possible to put value back into anything, particularly the Â£1, unless we have a satisfactory level of production. The first thing for us to do in seeking to put value back into the Â£1 is to find out how the value was lost from it in the first place. munistic control of certain trade unions As far as I know no statement has been made in this House up till now attaching blame to any person, or to any party, for the loss of value from the Â£1. Chifley Government was to blame. Government that was led until last December by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) was responsible, to a degree, for depriving the Â£1 of some of its value because of its procedure which had the effect of aiding and protecting communistic policy in this country. blame lies. The years in which Australia was under socialist rule were the years in which our production dropped. Due to the unprecedentedly high prices that we have received for the commodities that we export money has flowed into this country at an ever-increasing rate. That money has accumulated because people were unable to spend it owing to the fact that production was lagging with the result that the goods that they would otherwise have bought were not available. That accumulation of money has produced the spiral of inflation that has gained in strength to such a degree that we -are now forced to ban the Communist party and break its control of certain key trade unions, so as to allow honest trade unionists to follow their vocations peacefully and to produce the goods that our nation so urgently requires. This will eliminate one of the main causes of inflation. When money is plentiful and goods are scarce the people suffer most. I remind honourable members that it is the people who make up the nation and who suffer most at the hands of the Communist party. Coal is in short supply. Industry is hamstrung. The output of even the simple necessaries of life has shrunk until it is almost impossible for people to obtain all their requirements. Value has gone out of the Â£1, money is accumulating each year, and we are now caught in an inflationary spiral. It is necessary to ban the Communists in order to achieve full production. Consider the transport industry. Due to the comthe movement of this country's transport has been hindered and slowed down by ""go-slow"" tactics and rolling strikes. Who suffers in the long run from such tactics? Do the shipping companies suffer? No. They can pass the extra cost caused by those industrial troubles on to the manufacturer. Does the manufacturer suffer? No. He is able to pass his added costs on to the wholesaler. Does the wholesaler suffer? No. He can pass his added costs on to the retailer, and the retailer in turn can pass his added costs on to the little people who, in the ultimate, comprise the nation. That is one reason why the Communist party has by its actions driven the people to ask for this bill. On Tuesday night I listened to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) when he appealed for British justice. Are people who have sabotaged our nation and who would sabotage it again if they were allowed to do so entitled to British justice? The Leader of the Opposition apparently wants British justice on a one-way basis. Such people would give no justice to the British, and we are an integral part of the British Commonwealth. Yet we heard from the Leader of the Opposition an impassioned appeal for British justice. I hope that any justice to be given will be justice for all. Russia still holds 370.000 prisoners of war who were captured in Asia, as well as a great number of prisoners who were captured in the European theatre of war. orable gentleman should return to the bill.

144,Mr Speaker,"Order! The hongain control in this country they woulcl treat us in a similar manner. N'o decent man need fear this measure. All he will have to do, as has been pointed out, will be to declare that he is not a Communist and he will be able to go free. Honourable members opposite have had a great deal to say about the clause that relates to the onus of proof. The statute book contains acts that were introduced by Labour governments which include provisions that the onus of proof shall be on the individual charged with an offence under those acts. It is evident that the red tide is coming our way. It is signincant that the advance of the Japanese forces during the last war was first halted in Australian waters just as the first setback to the Communist party will also bc administered by this country. The foreign doctrine that the Communist party has brought here is such that the people demand that it shall be driven from our shores, that our people shall be free and remain free, that our economy shall not be depressed, that our production shall be buoyant and that we shall be able to buy the goods thaf are so necessary for our national development. For these reasons, and also for the reason that Australia is the land of my birth and I should not like to see it slip into the hands of an enemy through any negligence upon my part, plus the reason that the Communists have made the people of Australia suffer, I support the bill. bill purports to deal with the Australian Communist party and ita ancillary and subsidiary bodies either already formed or which may be formed as a cloak to cover up the real aims and objectives of international communism with which the Australian Communist party is linked. One of those aims is the overthrow of constitutional government by force and bloody revolution. The bill is also designed to deal with individual Communists and to disqualify them from holding office in the Public Service and in industrial organizations. The grounds on which the Government requests the power to take those steps are related to the defence and safety of Australia and its people. It is taking this action by virtue of the defence power of the Commonwealth because the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) alleges that Australia is menaced by a fifth column that is operating in the interests of a foreign power with the object of undermining our economy, sapping our industrial strength, softening the will of the people and weakening the defence of this country generally. Those interests"" regard Australia as a ripe plum, and are waiting for it to fall into their lap. Our potential enemy has been said to be Russia and its satellites in Europe and Asia. ""Whilst it is true that we are now at peace, it is also clear that, virtually, we are engaged in a cold war which many people believe will inevitably develop into a shooting war. In any event, we must admit that to be a strong possibility. We have been warned of the imminence of a shooting war by noted American service leaders. According to the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 3rd May, General George Kenney. who was war-time Commander of the Allied Air Forces in the Pacific, saidHie Bussian leaders probably had gone so far as to set the year for their attack. The international situation is now so explosive that war could start at any moment through a diplomatic blunder. Rear-Admiral Walter Boone, who was Commander of the United States of America Seventh Fleet, was also reported in that newspaper of the same date as sayingTo-day, with the world political and military situation as it is, war might break out at any time. However, war was not necessarily imminent. In view of those warnings together with the outline given by the Prime Ministei of fifth column activities by the Communist party in this country, there would appear to be little doubt about the constitutionality of the main provisions of this legislation. However, grave doubt exists about the constitutionality of those provisions which will affect the liberty and rights of the ordinary individual. In that respect, the Government's proposals go far beyond what is warranted even in an emergency of the kind outlined by the Prime Minister. At the same time, the Government is charged with the responsibility of safeguarding",47,Govebnment Supfobtebs

146,Mr Morgan (Reid) [3.44],"Thistlie nation and it must act as it deems fit. Obviously, it bas access to information that is not available to tbe Parliament or tbe public. In addition, we must have regard to the technique of modern warfare. Modern inventions indicate that the next war will be somewhat in the nature of a push-button war and that it will be fought with supersonic guided missiles and atom and hydrogen bombs. One can confidently forecast that such a war will practically be over before the peoples of the world even know that it started. In comparison with such, a conflict Hitler's blitzkrieg and the Japais generally approved second thoughts have nese attack on Pearl Harbour fade into insignificance. The Prime Minister very capably outlined the situation with which the Government must deal, and he impressed upon the people the real danger that confronts the nation. However, one might ask whether this is the opportune time for the action that the Government declares it must take, and whether the action proposed to be taken is too drastic. The right honourable gentleman said that the measure was both novel and far-reaching, and that it provided for the first time in the history of this or any other English-speaking complete banning of a political party. Of course, the Communist party is now party in the accepted sense of the term, but as an international conspiracy. This measure will create a new class of citizen, the "" declared"" person. In future, such persons will be dubbed "" Commos"", and they will be social pariahs. They will be deprived of certain citizen rights. Whilst the Government, under this measure, does not go so far as Hitler did when, under his decree, every Jew in Germany was branded on the back with the name Juden, we must be careful that it shall not be enabled eventually to follow in his footsteps and later apply this legislation to social democrats, radical leaders and, ultimately, to heads of churches and other leaders of thought in the community. The views of the Labour party on this measure were clearly expressed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) Mr Morgan. in this debate as well as in his policy speech at the recent general election. Ihe right honourable gentleman emphasized that the only effective way to deal with the Communists is to meet them in the open and by the ordinary processes of the law relating to treason aud sedition. On this aspect of the measure, warnings have been expressed uot only in the Australian press but also in newspapers overseas. The Melbourne Age in a leading article in its issue to-day, statesAlthough the central purpose of the Bill induced a widespread conviction that dangers are implicit in the measure drafted and would be removed if some of the amendments suggested by Labour were adopted. Within a few days of his opening speech, designating 53 individuals as communists the Priine Minister found it necessary to make several amendments as to names of communists in the key unions. Such things suggest the fallibility of officials and exemplify the risks inherent in a power to declare ancl impose penalties without having to substantiate the case before a court of Law when the person concerned appeals. I venture to say that if the Prime Minister had taken the members of the Government parties into his confidence and submitted this measure to them before he country, for the introduced it in the Parliament, it would be entirely different from its present form and would embody some of the amendregarded not as a political ments that the Leader of the Opposition has foreshadowed. The Manchester Guardian, another conservative newspaper, commented upon this measure as follows:. . . A State could protect itself without taking such wide general powers. Mr Menzies tries to justify his Bill by arguing that ' We are not, except in a technical sense, at peace'. But neither are we, even in a technical sense, at war. Nor is war yet imminent. As it comes nearer, restraints on the freedom of tbose who might be dangerous must increase. But to use extreme measures at this stage might turn out to be a boomerang. There might be dangers in following the more liberal course, but risks must be taken. Risk is the very essence of Democracy. Criticizing the proposal to place the onus of proof upon the accused, the same newspaper saidI t should not be difficult to argue that this proposal is an innovation from the Cominform's own idea of law. How can a man prove he isn't a member of the Communist body? The New York Times, another conserva"" a socialist, Communist, uprooter of law tive newspaper, in an editorial on the 29 th and order and an arch-anarchist"", beApril last, saidAny move such as Australia was taking in tion League that had just been formed to banning the communist party called for ciradvocate the cessation of the transportacumspection as well as firmness.

These are some legitimate freedom of discussion and social of the matters that we have to consider experiment. A similar warning is contained in a recent to this measure. minority judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States of Americai n relahonorable members on this side of the tion to the validity of the non-Communist House have said that we appreciate the oath to which trade unions are obliged to fact that the Government has been given subscribe as a qualification to have their a mandate by the people to outlaw the claims dealt with by governmental triCommunist party.

There is no need for any political movement force, bloody revolution and civil war witb all its miseries and borror. Tbese methods must inevitably defeat the very purposes which they are intended to serve. Worthy ideals cannot be achieved % by unwortny methods. The end does not justify the means. In Eussia and its satellite countries to-day what may have first been intended to be a great ideal has been turned into the greatest tyranny the world has ever known. There is a tendency on the part of honourable members opposite to refer to socialists in terms of derision. I remind them that the principles of socialism were first enunciated by great Christian gentlemen, such as* Eobert Owen, Keir Hardie, William Morris, and others. They were actively engaged in the field of social reform long before Marx, Lenin and Stalin were ever heard of. They were visionaries who envisaged a new social order in which what Christ referred to as the second commandment would be nut into effect and all men would be brothers in every sense of the word and share equally the good things of this earth. The Eussian tyrant.3 who have taken control of a great portion of the earth have shattered the dreams of socialists tbe world over. Marx and Lenin based their teachings on material philosphy and overlooked human and spiritual values. In order to evaluate what international communism stands for, we must consider its leading protagonists, and, in the light of modern psychology, endeavour to understand, if we can, their approach to the problems of mankind. Many of them, including Marx, Lenin and Stalin were frustrated in their owi personal and domestic lives. All were ambitions and hungry for power. They adopted the technique of the bandits of old. the modern Eobin Hoods, the Dick Turpins and the Ned Kellys who "" cashed in"" on the social injustices of their times and set themselves up as the champions of the people. Their role was ostensibly to rob the rich and give to the poor. They cashed in on the struggle that has gone on through centuries between the "" haves"" and the "" havenots""; but they remained bandits and they established the greatest reign of Mr Morgan. tyranny the world has ever known. Let us consider Stalin's background. Stalin was a Georgian who was born and bred in a district under the heel of the Czars which centuries before had been overrun by Genghis Khan. The Communist International adopted the fifth column methods that had enabled Genghis Khan to overrun Europe and Asia and establish a reign of tyranny. They improved on those methods by the application of modern science and industrial infiltration and the world has seen the result. In the old days the reign of the tyrant could be successfully ended on the death of the tyrant. To-day with Russia under the control of the politburo the world finds it much more difficult to deal with world communism than it did to deal with the tyrants of old. We may take some consolation from the fact that all gangster regimes break up from within. The first r if t in the iron curtain is to be seen in the struggle that is taking place between Tito and Stalin. I trust that that struggle will continue, that the Communist regimes will meet downfall, and that the peoples of tlie world will be able to co-operate in a spirit of true democracy. Whilst we approve of this bill in principle, considerable doubts exist in the minds of Opposition members, and of the people generally, whether this measure is on the high national plane that the Prime Minister has claimed for it. We wonder Avhether or not the right honourable gentleman is motivated by political considerations to turn the existing situation to his advantage. The bill Avas launched in an atmosphere of sensationalism. GoA'ernment members said that it must be accepted holus bolus or there would be a double dissolution. By advance publicity disseminated They were throughout the States the Prime Minister sought to create hysteria among the community. In effect, the Labour party Avas put on the spot. The Prime Minister pointed the bone and said that the Labour party must accept the bill without amendment. It is pleasing to note that the right honourable gentleman has since changed his attitude and has now indicated, that he will accept reasonable amendments. I have not time to deal with the individual clauses of the bill; but I point out that they go very much further than waa indicated by the Prime Minister in his second reading speech. In that utterance which lasted more than an hour the right honourable gentleman devoted 90 per cent, of his remarks to the preamble of the bill which explains the implications of revolutionary throughout the country and in this House was led to believe that the sole purpose of the measure was to deal with revolutionary communism. An analysis of the clauses of the bill proves otherwise. Tbe preamble, to which the Prime Minister devoted so much attention, merely contains a recital of the position from a constitutional angle and has nothing to do with the legality of a number of clauses that follow. I refer honourable members to the definition of a Communist in the first part of the bill and also to the provisions relating to a body of persons in clause 5 (1.) (c). It is clear that the bill is not confined to Communists, as such, or to revolutionary communism for it includes provisions which might relate to other schools of socialist thought. To-day many socialist doctrines are advocated by various bodies. The Christian Socialist Movement, the Catholic Social Justice programme, and the World Council of Churches all advocate reforms of the kind that were advocated by Marx and his successors. It may be contended that the advocacy of such doctrines will bring members of those organizations and supporters of those programmes within the ambit qf this legislation. The preaching of the doctrines of free education, the right of trade unions to organize, the sharing of the profits of labour and the like might bring the persons concerned within the ambit of this legislation. A hundred years ago such doctrines would have been regarded as revolutionary and those who propagated them would have been summarily dealt with, and as was the case with the Tolpuddle martyrs, transported to other parts of the world. I remind honourable members that the Tolpuddle martyrs were seven devout Methodists who 100 years ago endeavoured to form themselves into a trade union. They were the forerunners of the great trade union movement, but because work of the militant minority is in regard to in their day they were regarded as reactionaries, they were transported for life. The bill should not contain any ambiguities. It should be definitely restricted to those with whom the Prime Minister has said it is intended to deal. ( Mr Ryan) -Order! The honourable communism. Everybody member's time has expired. bill is of national importance and as such it should he considered only from the national point of view. No suggestion of party political advantage should arise in the consideration of a bill of such great importance. The establishment and proof of the allegations contained in the preamble of the bill is complete justification for the implementation of any measure, however stringent its provisions may be, for the complete destruction of the Communist party in Australia. I agree that the bill cannot convert or alter rhe traitorous or treasonable trend of thought that exists in the minds of individual members of the Communist party. It does, however, destroy the efficacy of the organization of those members. The present procedure of the Communist party has been developed with the object of causing a red revolution in this country, and has been cunningly conceived as part of a well executed attempt to gain control of the trade union movement. The people of Australia are well aware of the effectiveness of Communist control. Mr Thornton has stated that, according to the teachings of Lenin, without control of the trade unions revolution is impossible. For that reason the Communist party set itself out to gain control of the trade union movement of Australia in accordance with directions from Moscow. Tf anybody thinks that the Communist plan for a red revolution in this country is melodramatic I suggest that they examine the cunningly conceived plan of the Australian Communist party whioh fits the pattern laid down in Moscow. This plan is revealed in a letter which emanated from the red International Labour Union and was published by the Bed Leader, a Communist party publication, in 1934. This letter reads in part as follows:One of the greatest shortcomings of the",48,Govebnment Supfobtebs
147,Mr Acting Deputy Speakee,,52,Govebnment Supfobtebs
148,Mr Wight (Lilley) [4.14],"Thi. sthe war preparations in the Pacific, particularly to the war preparations of the Australian Bourgeoisie. The militant minority must develop a big campaign against prepairations for an anti-Soviet war. Orders are to develop a wide activity amongst the workers, particularly in the transport industry, and attempt to organize demonstrations and strikes against Australia's participation in the war plans of the imperialists The Communist party has followed that procedure. I think that fact was indicated in Queensland during the recent railway strike. That strike fitted a deliberate pattern to tie up Australia's transport and was not aimed at attaining any other objective. It was a test strike which was aimed at testing the degree of tolerance of the members of the union. Deliberately, government documents which were sent by the Premier to the trade union were withheld from the knowledge of the trade unionists. When the patience of t h unionistswas completely exhausted a meeting which had been called in Ipswich Trades Hall was closed down in order to stop them from ending the strike. Those were the tactics of the trade union's Communist executive. The good trade unionist will have nothing to do with the Communsts but to-day the trade union movement, to a large degree, is controlled by the Communist party and the good trade unionist, who is one of the finest citizens of the country, cannot express himself. I found proof of that during a conversation with a member of the staff of the railway workshops at Ipswich to whom I suggested that he should rise to his feet and protest when he complained about the action of the executive at the meeting which I have referred to. He said, ""You forget thnt I am a married man with children and I work at the railway workshops and it would be very easy for a large piece of machinery to f a l l "" . This man was not exaggerating. RecentlyI was discussing the Communist domination of the Waterside Workers Federation with an inmate of the Greenslopes Military Hospital, who was himself a member of the Wharf Labourers Union. He insinuated almost the same thing concerning the tactics adpoted by the Communists in the trade union movement. The culmination of the Communist plan was only too clearly expressed in e Air. Wight. passage in a book entitled, Readings in Leninism Number 4. It statesThe task of the party is to utilize these minor everyday needs as a starting point from which to lead the working class to the revolutionary struggle for power. This mass action includes: Strikes; a combination of strikes and demonstrations; a combination of strikes and armed demonstrations and finally, the general strike conjointly with armed insurrection against the state power of the bourgeoisie. The latter form of struggle, which is the supreme form, must be conducted according to the rules of war; This plan is being constantly developed and it is the duty of this Government to protect the country from these servants of Moscow, who are perpetrating an act of undeclared war within our country and on our people. In order that they may fulfil their plan, it is necessary n for them to gain control of the trade union movement. To destroy their plan it is necessary to destroy their grip on the trade union movement. Unfortunately, the Australian Labour party industrial groups which have attempted to do this have met with a very small measure of success. It is because their attempts were unsuccessful that this bill is necessary in order to eliminate the Communist control from trade unions. An example of the failure of the Australian Labour party industrial groups is given in a Communist publication called the Building Workers' Journal. This confirmed report statesTlie attitude of well known Queensland anti-Communists and leaders of Australian Labour Party Industrial Groups in their respective unions towards Communists has undergone a remarkable change. Each well known anti-Communist and leader of Australian Labour Party Industrial Groups expressed at the recent Q.T.TJ. Congress their admiration of the Communists in clear and forthright terms when arguing on a resolution calling upon the workers to defeat Menzies and Fadden and vote and work for the Labour or Communist party. These speakers said, "" There is no doubt about the fact that the Communists are always good trade unionists. They fight for better conditions on the job but I disagree with them politically "". "" We should vote for the official Australian Labour Party ticket"", said another speaker. "" I know the Communists are very good industrially but they will only split the vote."" That report by the industrial group of the Australian Labour party indicated only too -well that those particular members of the group had had the wool pulled over their eyes. For the success of the Communist plan it is absolutely necessary that these "" r e d "" unionists should appear to be good unionists. A majority of the Communist leaders have been trained in Moscow. Such meD as Thornton and Sharkey have had training in Communist schools in Eussia. Those men, because of their training and because of their knowledge of trade union affairs, have been able to express themselves most vocally at trade union meetings and have gradually risen to the top of their organizations. Only by an apparent show of interest in the trade unions bave they reached those positions. It is absolutely essential that the Communist party should select men whocan impress the trade unionists that they are fighting for them, for such men can rise to the top of the union. Thus, can the union be controlled by the Communist movement. The trade unionist should be assisted to destroy the Communist influence in his union. Anybody who suggests that the Communist party does not exercise control of the trade unions need only examine the strikes that have occurred in this country during the past year. Excuses, not reasons, were given for causing those strikes. Many of them were absolutely uncalled for. I believe that the Communist party's plan provides for a deliberate pattern of strikes in order to test the tolerance of the various trade unionists so that in the event of a general strike being called these men will know how long they can maintain such a state of affairs, and how long it will take to develop a course of action which will result in a revolution. The"" red "" tactics have not benefitted the trade unions. Statistics prove that whilst moderate trade unions improved the conditions and wages of their members by 75 per cent, last year, Communist-controlled unions improved the wages and conditions of their members by only 72 per cent. the honourable member mean by ""Comtell the workers that the bill is designed munist-controlled unions""? Mr ""WIGHT I mean unions in which Communists exercise control over the members. The Waterside Workers Federation would, I think, be an example. It seems strange that the unions which have succumbed to Communist domination are those which are most important to our defence. They include metal trades unions, the maritime unions and the miners' federation. The Communists also plan to gain control of the food unions. They have combined all the metal workers into one union with the idea of bringing under the domination by one small group of Communists of a vast group of good Australian trade unionists. I suggest that honourable members of the Opposition, instead of making facetious objections and interjections should consider giving this bill their support. The implementation of this bill will cause a definite reaction on the part of the Communist party of Australia. Every soap-box throughout the country will be mounted by members of the party, who, with their customary rantings and ravings, will declare that the measure is fascist-inspired and aimed at the destruction of the trade union movement. The Government does not seek to destroy the trade union movement. On the contrary, it regards the trade unions as an essential part of the nation's social structure. I sincerely hope that the Labour party will support the Government in implementing the bill when it becomes law, because the Communist party will endeavour then to cause industrial havoc throughout Australia. It will try to persuade unionists that the measure is aimed at the heart of their movement. That will be a deliberate lie. Members of the Opposition would be well advised not to rise, with their tongues in their cheeks, and, after criticizing the bill bitterly, declare in effect, "" I shall support the bill because I have been ordered to do so "". When the Communists begin to stir up trouble in industry after the bill becomes law, the Labour party should exert its influence with unionists in order to gain their support in emptying Communists out of the trade union movement so that it may continue to flourish under sane",52,Govebnment Supfobtebs

At the Annecy tariff negotiations, ten countries sought to accede to the Oeneral Agreement and at the conclusion of the negotiations the contracting parties decided that accession of the new members and tbe putting into effect of the concessions should be carried out in two distinct stages. The first stage required approval hy a two-thirds majority of the then 23 members by the 30th November, 1949, for admission of the ten new countries to the agreement. This decision was taken by the previous Government, and tlie United Nations Secretariat was advised that Australia agreed to the accession of the ten countries. [Quorum formed.] The second stage required each government to notify the United Nations by the 30th April, 1950, of its intention to apply the Annecy concessions, and application of the concessions had to take place within 30 days of notification. Australia is at present provisionally applying the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and has also agreed to the accession of the further ten countries. Taking these factors into consideration, it was decided to apply the Annecy tariff concessions, and the Secretariat of United Nations was notified accordingly on the 28th April, 1950. Progress reported. Debate resumed (vide page 2518). [4.40] -Before I proceed to discuss the terms of the bill, I propose to finish the story that was begun by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight). was not a fairy story. I have been gravely concerned throughout this debate by the attitude of Government supporters who have attempted to speak about the trade union movement without showing any regard for accuracy. If any proof were required of the seriousness of their misstatements, it was finally supplied by the honourable member for Lilley. When I asked the honourable gentleman to nominate the transport unions that he alleged were under the control of the Communist party, he made some remark about my interjection being facetious. He evaded the question, which I asked deliberately and in all seriousness. When the honourable gentleman made his accusation, he was referring to a trade union of which I am the federal president. He told only half of the story of' the Queensland strike and, in the process, he attempted to brand good trade unionists with the stigma of communism. The honourable gentleman does not know enough about the Queensland strike to be able to tell the whole truth about it. I notice that he has left the chamber. That is in keeping with the attitude that honourable members opposite have adopted throughout this debate. not nonsense. The honourable member played about with a subject that he did not understand and then left the chamber. As the federal president of the Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, I summoned the meeting in Brisbane that sent the first body of men back to work after the Queensland strike. I know what happened. There was no dropping of bags of wheat or pieces of machinery at that meeting. The hall was packed when the decision was made and, at my direction as the federal president of the union, the men agreed to go back to work. The honourable member for Lilley should obtain the facts before attempting to brand my union as a Communist organization. Concessions that had been denied to unionists for twenty years were won as the result of the Queensland strike. Those of us who are prepared to lead the trade unions in tlieir efforts to gain their ends by conciliation and arbitration must be concerned about the manipulation that consistently goes on behind the scenes in order to assist people who acknowledge the Communist doctrine that strike action is always best. Such activities are a constant source of worry to all decent trade unionists. The Communist Party Dissolution Bill, like every other measure that,is introduced in this House, must be either good or bad. Honourable members should concentrate their attention upon that issue rather than upon the general principles that have been discussed during this debate. Nobody will deny that the principles embodied in the measure are important, and I agree with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), who said that they were very far-reaching. Therefore, the bill deserves the closest examination, not so much for the things that it says, but for things that will happen after it becomes law.

156,Mr E. James Harrison,"It isare so far reaching that they may interfere with the liberty of the subjectBeforeI was elected to this HouseI had almost six years experience in another legislative chamber of this country, where the leaders of liberalism were ever on their feet demanding that there should never be any interference with the liberty of the subject. Consequently, when I came to this House and discovered that the first big measure to be dealt with was legislation which could interfere with the liberty of the subject, I analysed it very closely. If the liberty of the subject is to be interfered with, it is necessary that there shall be two important safeguards: Eirst, that the grounds for the interference are important enough to warrant an interference-and in this case I think we can agree on that point-and secondly, that the machinery used will not introduce a set of circumstances which might easily result in fascism. There is no honourable member on the Government side, and I appreciate that there are many young men there who rendered good service to this country during the war, who was in the real fight against communism in this country. this side were fighting fascism, which is me refer to the Communist manifesto. I just as bad. agree that they were fighting fascism. old hands, have ever seen that manifesto, But I warn them to be very careful not because otherwise there would have been to take any action which may allow some reference in their speeches to indifascism to raise its head in this country. cate their familiarity with it. need not tell us that. is a warning that must be given here. manifesto issued by the Communist party There is not a member on the Government in 1930 statesside who appreciates the attacks that have been made by Communists upon decent party precisely because it is able, through trade unionists during past years.

I suggest that the honourable member knows very little about the matter because I heard him say this afternoon that the Government is concerned about the leaders of trade unions who have the power to influence great decisions. I say that the Labour party is also concerned about that matter. I declare now that there has been no dispute regarding where the Labour party stands in respect of the Communist party. My fight with the Communist party has been in progress for many years. The beginning of the fight goes back beyond the memory of many honourable member on the Government doubt whether honourable members of the to it.

Now let us test whether this measure is good or bad by the standard of what actually occurred to decent trade union leaders during the time the Communist party was banned. I relate this story not because I was concerned in it, but because if this bill is to succeed able member for Lilley( Mr White) that the Government must devise ways and means of overcoming a situation similar to that which existed in 1940. I doubt whether that woulcl be possible without the introduction of one-party government. I want honourable members to follow closely just what did happen. There can be no question that the Prime Minister has always held opinions about communism that are nearly fanatical. Proof of that can be found by looking back to 1941, twelve months after the banning of the Communist party. ber now supports the Prime Minister's views. views are capable of being translated into action, I do support them. I bave made it clear that I shall be in any fight that will succeed in exterminating communism in this country. But I do not want to take part in a fight the result of which will be the same as that of 1940. be on the losing side. many occasions in the trade-union movement I have been on the losing side, bur I have not yet squealed. Mr Churchill, the Prime Minister of England, broadcasting on the night of the 22nd June. 1941, announced that his Government had offered to the Government of Soviet Russia any technical or economic assistance needed, and stated positively tha: whereas he had been a consistent opponent of communism, that attitude had faded away before the spectacle then unfoldin'On that night the Prime Minister of Australia ( Mr Menzies) declared thai his Government dealt with Communists on a purely domestic basis. That statement followed Mr Churchill's broadcast. The Prime Minister of Australia averred that the attitude of his Government towards communism was then based on its domestic subversive activities and not on its international ramifications. I emphasize the domestic basis first of all, because that was the Government's concern in 1941. To-day it can be called an international matter, and T agree with the statement of the honorthe ramifications of communism extend throughout the world. In the final analysis Australian communism must be dealt with on a domestic basis in thi> country. The Communist party in Australia was strengthened as a result of its beingbanned in 1940. The present leaders of communism in the industrial field, including those nominated by the Prime Minister in his speech on this bill, had their positions as leaders in the trade union movement strengthened because of the readiness of the employers to bargain with them. Their bargains in many cases side-tracked the Arbitration Court. Those of us who were really fighting communism in the trade unions found our own strength diminishing because of the policy of employers in collaborating with the Communist leaders. At that time they were Communists no longer, because the Communist tag had been taken ofi them. Early in 1941 a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court criticized the Minister for Labour and National Service, the same gentleman who holds the portfolio in this Government, ( Mr Holt) for calling a conference to discuss industrial matters without paying the court the courtesy of notifying of the matters that were to be discussed. That was the sort of thing that confronted the decent trade-union leaders. The Communists were able to capitalize at every point, even to the extent of having a Minister of the Crown with them when it came to a matter of dealing with things that should have been dealt with by the Arbitration Court. That sort of thing has put them into their present position. and Thomas got out of gaol?",59,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

171,Mr Cramer,"I s that how Ratliffnoticed a report in the press to-day that the Prime Minister took the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) to task for something he said yesterday about a red herring across the trail. To introduce the Ratliff and Thomas episode is to do far more than draw a red herring across the trail. On tbe 17th March, 1941, during the hearing of a case, Judge O'Mara asked one of the employers' representatives whether he proposed to call as a witness the Minister for Labour and National Service.( Mr Holt), in connection with evidence given by the general secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Union. That evidence was to the effect that in the presence of Mr Sutherland, an organizer of the union, the crane drivers at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, who were members of the union, had been promised an increase of 6s. a week in marginal rates. In the case it was stated that those on him. crane drivers went back to work because of the assurance that they had received from the Minister. This system of bargaining on the part of a Minister and the masters of industry made untenable the position of the Australian Labour partu union leaders who believed in a policy of conciliation and arbitration. That was because the tag had been taken off the Communist leaders. Consider for instance Wright, who was mentioned by the Prime Minister. He .became an Australian Labour party leader. In consequence of the ban al] decent Australian Labour party men will never forget and will never forgive the government for preventing them from dealing with the Communists who were then and still are our enemies. The Minister adopted the policy of collective bargaining. I challenged the honourable member for Lilley's statement that Thornton had been trained for two years in Moscow, but the honorahle gentleman avoided the issue. Thornton did not have to do two years' training in Moscow. He got his build-up, and most of his strong support, because he was consistently able by bargaining with the employers to achieve results that we trade unionists could not obtain through the Arbitration Court. At the moment, Tuornton is ""on his way out"" as the rfiieral secretary of ths FeJurated Iron workers Association, not by reason of any action by this Government, but because the decent trade unionists are coming to the surface, and are taking the control of the organization out of the hands of Thornton and company. If we were trusted, we should prosecute our campaign until we had achieved that objective. Let honourable members opposite make no mistake about that. long? pends on how long the Government is prepared to drive them underground, where we cannot get at them. ber voting for the bill? past is to be taken as a precedent, Thornton is not worrying two ""hoots"" about the effect that this bill will have honourable member that? the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) desires to collaborate with Thornton, that is his business, but I shall not do so. I shall explain to the House what well may happen in these matters, without our knowledge. That is the danger. If I were aware of the details, I would divulge them. The Communist party has some one to take Thornton's place. That person may have an Australian Labour party ticket; he may be a member of the Liberal party; or, at the moment, he may not belong to any political party. But that is the line that the Communists will follow. If Thornton is removed from his office in the Federated Iron workers Association, it will soon be found that another officer of that organization will be bargaining with the employers outside the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in order io achieve objectives, and he will gain victories that cannot possibly be won in the court itself. Let us be honest about our approach to this matter, and cast our minds back to what happened to those decent trade unionists who were members of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council in 1941.

We got the Communists out into the open, but it took us a chamber. People like the honourable considerable time to get rid of them. However, I am gratified to be able to say that decent trade unionists did regain control of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, because we were able to put the tag on the Communists. At the present time, we have a two-thirds majority on the council, not because of the effect of legislation like this bill, but because we ere courageous enough to fight communism in the highways and the byways. assist the honourable member. you are honest, and I believe that you arehonorable gentleman to address me. shall do so. I assume that Government supporters are expressing their honest opinions when they criticize the stand that the Labour party has taken on this bill. They wonder why we are so bitter about this matter, but those of us who have played an active part in the Australian Labour party in fighting the Communists know that we are right. HughesEvans and Company were able, in the guise of the Labour party tag, almost to capture control of the Lahour movement in New South Wales, and decent trade unionists and Labour men realized at that time that they came so close to success only because the government of the day had pulled the tag of communism from them. May I be excused for being somewhat sceptical about this bill, because once again the Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and National Service are leading this campaign against the Communists. May I also be excused for having doubts about what will happen when this bill becomes law.

AN HONOBABLE MEMBEB -Keep it clean. keep it clean as long as he keeps it clean. The next matter that worries me is the method that the Prime Minister employed when introducing this bill. A measure of its proportions should not have been introduced, in an atmosphere of hysteria, yet, in my opinion, such an atmosphere was deliberately generated in anticipation, possibly, of a double dissolution. I cannot dismiss that thought from my mind. Precisely the same hysterical kind of approach led to the establishment of fascism, about which one honourable member has spoken. This bill should not be discussed in an atmosphere of hysteria. After all, the question of whether or not it means what it says, and whether the ramifications of the various clauses are as Government supporters interpret them, are not the fundamentals that should cause all of us the most concern. Our principal concern should be the necessity to preserve the liberty of the people, and our Australian way of life. There is not one honourable member who would not do anything in his power to banish, if it were possible, the doctrine of communism from Australia. The matter about which we have to be certain is not whether the machinery clauses of the bill should be amended. What we should keep in mind all the time is whether or not this bill will have the results that the Government claims it will have. This is my answer to an earlier interjection.

It must duced in an artificial atmosphere of hysteria. The Prime Minister put on a show, with which his speech was in keeping, and it still rings in my ears. The right honourable gentleman himself described the proceedings as a show, because on the following day at Grafton he said that the show he was then attendsions that that development has been their ing was different from the one at which he had been present on the previous night in this House. speech certainly aroused hysteria in the the Labour party.

It is proposals are valuable, they may be significant, too, that the drafting of the bill took a considerable time, and T thought that the Opposition would have noted that fact. It is the most important bill in the Government's legislative programme for this session, yet many weeks passed before the Primo Minister( Mr Menzies) introduced it. That, in itself, is evidence that we did not approach the problem of dealing with the Communists in a spirit of, "" Now we have these ' varmints ' we can destroy be remembered that in the history of federal government in Australia, the political parties that are now in office have had the greater part in forming the Australian way of life, of which we are so proud.

192,Mr Charles Anderson (Hume) That The Government Will Probably Be,"accepted. However, in my opinion, this bili is the very minimum that can be effective to destroy the menace of communism that is in our midst. In passing, I remind the Opposition that the Chifley Labour Government seldom, if ever, accepted an amendment that was submitted by a member of the then Opposition, but we are a democratic party and will carefully consider reasonable proposals. 'Government supporters were very keen to learn of the attitude that the Labour party proposed to adopt to this bill, because the Communistmenace is a national menace. I listened carefully to"" many Opposition speakers, and, quite frankly, I was disappointed, as I usually am when I listen to them. The Opposition's attack on this bill is dictated largely by political motives. Its approach to the .measure may be summed up in these words, "" How does it affect us politically? It would be political suicide for us to oppose the bill. What is the least that we can do? Let us support it in principle and vote for the second reading, but we shall pull the fangs in the committee stage, hecause the Government already possesses power under the Crimes Act to deal with the Communists "". Members of the Opposition know that there is political dynamite in the bill. vernment introduced it? have gained that impression from listening to the speeches of Opposition members. is not giving honest, whole-hearted support to a bill that is designed to preserve our national life. Can anybody doubt that the present period is critical? Yet Opposition members are playing party politics and are forgetting the real issue-the safety of Australia. himself may find that there is political dynamite in the bill. not consider that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) gave any sincere reasons for the Labour party's objections to certain provisions of the bill. He said that history and his own knowledge had shown him that at no time had repressive measures stopped the birth of new ideas in nations. He cited as instances of that fact the nationalist movements in India, Pakistan, Ireland and so on. But these were nationalist movements inside each of the nations concerned. Communism is an international movement, and so the right honourable gentleman's arguments fall to the ground because they are not sustained by facts. Communism is a foreign conspiracy. I do not believe that the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) can find much wrong with this bill. Honourable members know his reputation in connection with his appearance before the Privy Council in relation to a very different measure from this one. There was no time limit on his remarks on that occasion, and he spent day after day arguing before that body. He was not speaking under any time limit to-day, yet he spent only three-quarters of an hour covering one point over and over again. A reasonable conclusion is that the point was not really very good. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson), whom I and other honourable members on this side of the House respect very much, and other honourable members opposite, have told us that they have fought communism all their industrial lives. The only thing wrong with that claim is that honourable members opposite have not yet realized that communism Gohas defeated them. That is the reason for our having introduced this measure. They say, in the words of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), ""We fought them with our hands "". Yet comThe Labour party munism is stronger now than it was ten years ago. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) also had something to say on this matter. He is always amusing to hear, but his speeches are dangerous. He said, in effect, that people who are seeking out traitors to this country are police informers. Would he shield a man whom he knew to be a traitor to our country, or would he tell the police? Speeches like that do no service to a country that is in fairly serious danger. We all must realize that we should not be blind to the fact that a cold war is at present in progress, and that that cold war is no child's play. It is not ""Kiss in the r in g "" or "" Postman's knock"". From where is this cold war being",63,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

Skilled men direct those agents and they know their job. How are we fighting them? We shall be fighting them uselessly until this measure becomes law. It is a curious fact that right throughout the proud history of the British nations we have never had to worry about traitors or renegades. Why has that been so? There have been civil wars in Britain, but once an external enemy has shown his teeth the British race has always united. Why do we now have traitors, not only in Britain, but also in Canada and other British countries? The reason is that the British race has developed its democracy on a basis of spiritual values, and while that democracy was based on those values there was never any treachery. But communism is a materialistic concept. That is one reason why we are in conflict with the Labour party on this matter, because socialism is also a materialistic concept. Now that materialism has come into the picture we have traitors to deal with. interpretation. Honourable members may read in a book which is in the Parliamentary Library the report of the royal commission held in connection with the Canadian spy trials. It is an ugly story of Canadians and other British people who were enticedaway from their loyalty to their King and country to treachery and treason by people who preach the gospel of communism. We can remember how in Australia, at the outbreak of the last war, the Australian Communists were sabotaging our national effort. Were not the Communists doing their filthy work behind the lines while our men were fighting on the battle fronts? Yet those are the people who are almost supported by honourable members opposite. What has been happening in Australia during the post-war period, and how has it affected us? We have seen a prominent trade unionist, Mr Monk, the president of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, going up and down the country saying that this bill will interfere with the rights of the trade unions. What right have the trade unions to arrogate to themselves the further right to harbour traitors in their ranks? Are not Coinmunists traitors? Why should the trade unions be allowed to harbour them? We must remember that one of the plans of the Communists is to infiltrate the trade union movement. Let me read an extract from Mr Justice Lowe's finding on communism in Victoria. He saidThe means and stages by which the Communist party aims to achieve its objective are(a) Leadership of and influence in trade unions. (6) The use of political and general strikes. (o) The education of the masses to the use of their political power through such strikes. (d) The use of strikes, demonstrations and armed demonstrations where the Communist party considers them necessary . . . and so on. I believe in trade unionism, but I do not believe that any section of the Australian community has the right to harbour traitors in its ranks. We have a lawfully constituted Parliament, elected by the people, and the country should abide by the provisions of measures that it passes. When we discuss communism we are inclined to forget just what it has cost us in the last half-century to preserve our way of life. Honourable members will recall that between 1914 and 1918 we lost thousands and thousands of fine men, and that many thousands of others were maimed, in a dreadful war. The same thing happened again in the last war. What were those men fighting for? They were fighting for our way of life and for their country against external enemies who threatened both. What did they die for ? What were their last thoughts? Their last thoughts were that they were dying to preserve our liberty. Yet we now find in our midst traitors and treacherous people who are trying to destroy the very things for which those men gave their lives. We should have less bickering in relation to a bill that is of such national importance as is this measure. We are confronted with a revolutionary movement that emanates from the Kremlin in Moscow. I ask people to think",64,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
197,Mr Andrews,That is a very narrow,65,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
198,Mr Charles Anderson,"forward into the future. We do not know when the storm may strike us. We can read daily in the press the warnings of eminent soldiers and sailors, both British and American, that the storm can break at any time. Let us look at it from our own point of view as members of this Parliament. After all, we are the representatives of the people and the safety of this country lies in our combined hands. It lies not only in the hands of honourable members on this side of the House, but also in the hands of honourable members opposite. If an international conflagration were to start, where and with what forces do honourable members think the Russians would attack ? What forces would be used against Australia ? Would they be white and Russian? Not that I consider that there is any advantage in being destroyed by white Communists rather than Asiatic Communists. The forces that the Russians would employ against us would be neither white nor European. They would be Asiatic. I have had unhappy experiences of Asiatic forces. We must consider this whole matter very carefully to ensure that we do not, by our neglect and by putting party politics before the national interest, cause posterity to regard us as ""guilty men"". We have heard not once but a dozen times during this debate that the number of Communists in this country has been and is being reduced. The number is now about 12,000. I remind hono;-able members that the Communist campaign against the security of Australia is not being conducted by amateurs. Surely honourable members must realize that the brains behind this movement are not stupid. Why should the Communist leaders in Russia keep their "" f if t h column "" in this country plainly in view ? What is the use of a "" fifth column "" that can be seen readily? The Communist activities that we see above-ground are only for propaganda purposes. Most of the Communists are operating underground. Honourable members opposite have said that this measure will drive the Communists underground. As I have said, many of them are already underground and have been for a long time. Nobody knows how strong they are. All that we do know is that they are strong, and it is high time that strong measures were taken against them. Numbers do not count. The number of Communists in Australia may be falling, but just remember how many Communists it took to win control of Czechoslovakia. The C.sechs were people very much like ourselves, a liberty loving and a cultured people witb a great record for fighting for their freedom. They won that freedom after World WarI . , but the Communist party, representing only 14 per cent, of the people oi Czechoslovakia, took it from them. On' 14 per cent.! A few cells, and when are the Czechs to-day? How many Communist cells have we in this country to-day? Where are they? We are not playing a game. We are in a cold war. and the more the people realize that fact Hitler? Hitler was the same sort of fellow as those that we are fighting. He was a Nazi, a totalitarian ruler, and Nazi-ism was a form of socialism. We have heard quite a lot of bickering over this measure between the political parties represented in this House. We have actually alleged that the objective sought to be attained in the Labour party platform is similar to the objective of the Communist party. We have not made that allegation for party political purposes. Honourable members must realize that it is possible to have totalitarianism in a democracy if the Government is of one side only. Had we had such a democracy we should have taken the first steps to a dictatorship. That is what happened in Germany and Russia. We could not have a real democracy with a Parliament that had only one party represented in it, consequently I do not wish to destroy the present Opposition and should probably never succeed if I tried to do so, but I should like to ensure that it shall be a safe Opposition, and for a long time to come of the safety of it?

202,Mr Charles Anderson,"I amof a capitalist family. He attacked capitalism yet boasted about his way of life. We have heard too much loose talk about capitalism. Capitalism is democracy. Some people forget that capitalism is the only philosophy that allows men freedom of thought, freedom of speech and political freedom. garten. shall do so if the honourable member cau prove that capitalism and democracy are not one and the same thing. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) once said, ""We are plucking the fowl of capitalist society"". But we are still living in a capitalist society and the honourable member for Hindmarsh enjoys the way of life that that society has given to him. In our capitalist society every man has an opportunity to succeed. I do not say that democracy is perfect, but we have means of reforming and improving it. When honourable members opposite talk about capitalism they should remember that capitalism and democracy ar. one and the same thing. Monopolistic capitalism is a different matter. The honourable member for Hoddle( Mr proletariat. WhilstI shall spare the Cremean) failed to finish his story; he did not tell us what was the biological result of the Labour party's flirtation with the Communist party. I am not aware of what it was, but there are certain things that cannot be denied. The Communist party has exercised an important influence upon the framing of the Labour party's platform. The fact is that Mr Jock Garden was a member of the Socialization Committee of the Labour party as late as 1947. Did he not have some influence in the framing of the party's platform? As I had intended originally to speak in this debate next Tuesday, I have not with me copies of the Labour party's platform and the Communist manifesto, but several points of similarity in the objectives of the two parties come to mind. The Labour party's objective to amend the Constitution to clothe this Parliament with greater powers is in line with the Communist policy of centralization. The Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) made a lengthy comparison of the Labour party's platform with the Communist manifesto. The two documents advocate compulsory unionism. Further evidence of the influence of the Communists in the framing of the Labour party's platform, is provided in Labour's objective to socialize the banks. The only countries in which banking is nationalized are Communist countries. Again, whilst the Communist party is opposed to arbitration-that is one weapon that it has consistently used in order to dislocate our economy-the Labour party advocates that the duty of determining wages and conditions of employment . that now devolves upon the Arbitration Court, which is above party politics, should be transferred to this Parliament. Like the Communists, Labour also opposes universal military training. Next, the Labour party advocates the training of workers to occupy managerial positions in industry. Of course, Government supporters' and honourable members opposite place different meanings on the term "" workers "". The Labour party regards only a certain class as workers. But that objective is advocated also by tbe Communists as part of their aim to establish the dictatorship of the blushes of honourable members opposite on that point, I emphasize that during the last four years the Communist general staff, which is directing the Communists in Australia, has succeeded to a very great degree in sabotaging our heavy industries. The effect of such tactics upon our way of life is obvious, and, in addition, they prevent us from rendering assistance to those countries that need our economic help. To that degree Communist sabotage has seriously affected Australia's foreign policy. There are pariahs in every race, and I classify the Communist as a pariah. However, as he is human and as we have a democratic system of government, we cannot destroy him ruthlessly. At the same time, we must not permit him to continue to spread his foul disease throughout this Commonwealth. The only way to deal with rabid Communists, as they are human, is to pull their fangs; and the object of this bill is to do just that.",66,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
203,Mr Pollakd,G o back to the kinder,67,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
204,Mr Charles Anderson,"Ithe outset of my remarks I accept the invitation that was extended hy honourable members opposite, particularly by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr instance, the Government is resorting to Wight), to members of the Opposition to announce their support of the measure. However, never before has a bill been introduced in this Parliament with so much ballyhoo, reminiscent of a Hollywood premiere, as that which marked the introduction of this measure by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). In advance of the event, the announcement was made over the air and was published in the press that the people would hear from the right honourable gentleman words that would shake the nation. The Labour party owes nothing at all to the Communists. Politically and industrially it has always fought the menace of communism in this country. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) made much of the fact, that a Communist. Paterson, was elected to the Queensland Parliament. That is true, but Paterson was not elected by Communist votes alone. I have first hand knowledge regarding his first success at the polls in that State because on that occasion the Lahour candidate whom ho defeated was my uncle. Paterson owed his election mainly to the support he received from the Country party, and I shall tell honourable members why members of that party gave their support to him. After that election was over Country party supporters made no secret of the fact that they had voted for the Communist candidate, in the belief that if he were elected he could easily be knocked over at the following general election. However, at the subsequent poll he was re-elected. It is idle for supporters mind. It achieved that objective, and it of the Govermnent to say that the Labour party is a political bed-fellow of the "" Comms"". more in common with the Government parties than they have with the Labour party. They have always endeavoured to smash the Labour movement, and at every general election they have attacked not non-Labour but Labour candidates. The workers of this country have already awakened to the growing menace of communism within the industrial movement. This bill is the outcome of a realization on the part of the Government that the "" Comms"" are already on the way out as the result of Labour's consistent fight against them. In this Communist tactics. It has introduced this measure in order to get on to the band-wagon and to be in at the kill so that it will get the kudos for thc destruction of the Communist party; but that party will be destroyed, not by any action on tbe part of supporters of this Government, but by the efforts of Labour supporters who commenced this fight and are determined to finish it. On that point, the Melbourne Agn of the 28th April had this to sayOne aspect of communism that should be borne in mind is that the influence of Communists and their powers of mischiefmaking have been on the wane for some time, largely because of counter-action by the moderate and responsible elements of the trade union movement. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Charles x\nderson) said that representative comment overseas upon this legislation endorsed it without exception. If the honourable gentleman had read yesterday's newspapers he would have seen a report that a motion that was submitted in the Canadian House of Commons by the Progressive Conservative party for the imposition of a ban similar to the ban proposed under this measure was defeated by 147 votes to 32. The same honourable gentleman also said that Labour's criticism of this measure was dictated by party political motives. The people will recall the Goebbels-like propaganda that the Government poured out during the last general election campaign in order to foster a fear complex in the public well knows that this measure will be ineffective. It has introduced it merely The Communists have in order to maintain that fear complex for party political purposes. This measure reeks of party politics. Let us examine the background of the bill. Reference has been made to the ban that a former Menzies Government imposed on the Communist party. I remind supporters of the Government that during the period of operation of that ban the membership of the Communist party reached its peak of 30,000,",67,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
205,Mr Eioedan (Kennedy) [5.35],"A twhereas since the ban was lifted the membership of the party has decreased substantially. It is not merely coincidence that Canada has had a similar experience. When the Canadian Government banned the Communist party, that party was revitalized and continued to carry on its work under the name of the Progressive Labour party. It was because of that fact that a few days ago the Canadian House of Commons, as I have already said, rejected a motion for the extension of that ban. Just before the last Parliament was prorogued, the banning of the Communist party was discussed at a meeting of the Liberal party. At that meeting the present Prime Minister, as Leader of the Liberal party, opposed the proposal because he realized that the ban would be ineffective. they were indulging in the same practice. However, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), who submitted the motion, won the day by one vote. The Australian Labour party is the only political party that has persistently fought the Communists in this country. In Germany, the Nazis and the Communists collaborated and destroyed the Social Democrat party and smashed the free trade unions. Subsequently the Communist party was smashed by the Nazis. In this country members of the Government parties and their supporters join with the Communists in singing a hymn of hate of the Labour party. As happened in Germany, there is an alliance between vested interests, members of the Government parties and their political bedfellows, the Communists, when a general election campaign is in progress. When a general election is imminent Government supporters and their friends, the Communists, join forces in a common attempt to destroy the Labour party. Unlike the Social Democratic party in Germany, the Australian Labour party cannot be smashed. This bill was born in fear, and it is being nourished by fear in the hope that at the next general election the people will again rally to the support of the Government parties. The Prime Minister knows very well that the provisions of this bill cannot be effective for at least two reasons. This legislation cannot be effective, first, because this Parliament does not possess the legal ifr. Riordan. powers to do what the Government, by its means, proposes to do. I do not intend to discuss the legality of the bill because that aspect of it has already been very fully dealt with by the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). direct your attention, Mr Speaker, if you have not already noticed it, to a coterie of Government supporters, one of whom has just concluded his speech, who have not ceased interjecting since the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) commenced his speech. There has been no reproof from the Chair. the attention of other honourable members who had already spoken to the fact that It must cease. slight knowledge of the legal position that the Government does not possess the powers to do what in this bill it has set out to do. I know something of Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights. I have read some of the decisions of superior courts in this country in relation to matters affecting the liberty of the subject. This legislation will provide a rich harvest for members of the legal profession. I foresee many attacks being made on it first in the High Court and, ultimately, in the Privy Council. The references in the Prime Minister's second reading speech, to the existence of a cold war will not influence the decisions of the High Court, which on numerous occasions has delivered judgments relating to the powers of this Parliament. In relying on the defence power to justify this measure the Government is leaning on a weak reed, though it hopes to make some sort of show of possessing the necessary authority, in order to justify its introduction. In actual fact the power of the Parliament to legislate in this connection i9 limited to legislation relating to Commonwealth employees. The High Court has already decided in the petrol case that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot rely on the defence power in peace-time. Legal enactments authorizing action against persons who commit treasonable offences, including the Crimes Act, are already on the statute-book.",68,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
206,Mr Roseveab,I rise to order. I,69,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
207,Mr Speaker,I have had to direct,69,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
208,Mr Riordan,"I know from myThe second reason why the bill will fail to achieve its purpose, even though it withstands legal challenge, is that an ideal can never be destroyed by an act of Parliament. History has proved the truth of that assertion over and over again. Although these facts are known to the Prime Minister he disregards them because he looks upon this bill as a necessary part of his campaign to capitalize politically the fear that exists in the minds of the people in relation to communism. That the outlawing of the Communist party cannot be effective is obvious to those who have studied history. In all countries Communists have always been a jump ahead of the legislature and of judicial machinery. Let us consider what success has attended the efforts of governments of other countries to ban the Communist party. In Canada, the Communist party was banned in 1940. The party merely changed its name. l n Switzerland also, when the Communist party was banned in 1940, the party changed its name. When the ban was lifted later it did not bother to revert to its original title. In Brazil, the Communist party, although banned, carried on its activities underground. In Franco Spain, ruthless suppression of the Communist party was equally ineffective. In that country the Communist party is flourishing vigorously underground. In Russia in the years prior to 1917 all efforts to destroy the Communist party failed notwithstanding that they were accompanied by expulsions and gaolings. This Government seeks to achieve what the governments of other countries have failed to achieve. When, in 1917, the Russian Revolution had attained some measure of success, Communists who had been expelled from other countries flocked to Russia and all efforts to destroy the Communist party throughout the world completely failed. stronger where wealth and abject poverty, misery and degradation exist among the people. Another depression could smash the living standards of the great bulk of the people of Australia and swell the army of the hopeless. The Communists would then intensify their efforts in a very fertile field. Communism cannot be stamped out by suppressing the Communist party, by challenging it in negative terms or by taking purely negative action. Communism can best be combated in Australia, and for that matter in any part of the world, by ensuring the security and freedom of the people and by uplifting their living standards. These are the means by which communism can best be attacked: First, it can be combated by reducing the great social gaps so that there shall be no very rich and very poor people in the community. That can be achieved by the reduction of taxes, the lowering of prices, and the raising of living standards. Secondly, communism can be attacked by strengthening and continually expanding social security, and by increasing unemployment, sickness and accident benefits, age and invalid pensions and the like. President Truman is facing the same sort of problem in the United States of America. He is being assailed by vested interests of all kinds. He realizes that if he is to succeed in his fight against communism, he must fight it in the economic and social fields. Thirdly, communism can be rendered ineffective by making our economy depression-proof by the provision of safeguards against stagnation and the immediate implementation of a programme of national developmental works. I have endeavoured unsuccessfully on many occasions during the last few weeks to obtain information from the Government about its plans for national development. Up to the present the only information T have received is that the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) will not make money available for that purpose. A programme of national developmental works should be drawn up for immediate implementation in the event of a recession. We do not want a repetition of the. conditions that existed in 1932 when oneCommunism grows third of the people of this country walked the streets looking for work. We should learn from the bitteT lessons of the past. Surely honourable members opposite realize that if another such catastrophe should hit this country a glorious opportunity would be provided for the growth and expansion of communism. Fourthly, the menace of communism can be dealt with by making provision for a greater flow of goods between one country and another. communism by removing currency barriers and by restoring the convertability of currency. member is getting outside the scope of the he did nothing whatever to fight it and bill. to indicate, Mr Speaker, the means by which communism in this country can best be attacked. Sixthly, we can stem the tide of communism by a return to the Christian way of life and living. Finally, ful country of ours. This is a tolerant we can combat communism by establishing complete economic and social security. We should fight the Communists with weapons that the people understand. living standards of the people and ensure TO them that security and freedom which eery man desires for himself and his family. Sitting suspended from 5.58 lo 8 p.m. Mr Speaker, there is something unprecedented in this measure, not only in its range and sr-ope, and the' circumstances under which it has been introduced, but also in the manner in which it has been received in this House. Everybody is for it, but some are not so much for it as others are. It is a bill which, a thing as this until thc right honourable by general consent, is aimed at a party to which every honourable member in this House is opposed. Scathing denunciations of communism have been made by honourable members in all sections of the House. Surely the Government might expect whole-hearted support of its policy as set out in this bill. But whilst everybody, as I have said, is for tbe bill and everybody denounces communism, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) approaches this measure in a characteristically cautious manner. Except for one brief interval in his career, he has always been against driving the Communists underground. The very name of communism is, to him, sacrosanct. He approaches the matter with doubt and hesitation and deprecating words. He says that communism should not be sent underground, because while it has legality it can be fought. What has he done to fight it? Until this bill was brought down, nothing. Communism is Fifthly, we can attach acknowledged to be more powerful in this country to-day than ever it was. The right honourable member cannot rid himself of the heavy responsibility for the honourable fact that during his eight years of office nothing to avert its advance.

I have as much right as any man to speak about Lahour, and I say that I never knew a Labour leader who would have dreamt of doing such member for Macquarie did it. He did not like unloosing the armed forces of the Commonwealth, but he did so because he dared not call upon the Australian Workers Union to do the work.

237,Mr Htjghes,"I shall leave thattrickery; to employ cunning; to resort to illegal methods; to sometimes overlook or uonceal the truth-al l for the sake of penetrating into the trades unions; to stay there gained with one set of unions. For twenty and by every and all means to carry on the work of communism. That is a revelation of communism which ought to find its way into the hearts of the people of this country and of every honourable member in this House. Rut the Leader of the Opposition refers to this treacherous, subversive and seditious purpose as ""Ideological Philosophy"" and implores ue not to drive it underground. What can communism do underground that it cannot do now? Communism is a dagger at the heart of this country. Everything that we value, material and spiritual, is in deadly peril. The world fears war. From what quarter can war come except from Russia? communism and communism is Russia and as Lenin says, we cannot live in ;i peace; one party or the other must go down. Which is it to be? The Leader of the Opposition and some of his supporters say that the Government must pull its punches; that it must not hit too hard; that whilst it is permissible for it, in an academic way, to say something about communism, it must not do anything lest it infringe the rights and liberties of these gentlemen who are our fellow citizens. member said that he saw a great danger to unionism in this attempt to limit the power of unions to select their own leaders. He demanded, in effect, that we should allow trade unions to continue to engage Communists as their leadersand there is no doubt whatever that, with the notable exception of the Australian Workers Union, all the great unions of Australia to-day are led by Communists. We are asked to believe that those Communist leaders are in their positions because that is the wish of a majority of unionists; but any one who is familiar with the workings of unionism knows that there is no truth whatever in such a statement. The Leader of the Opposition should know that perfectly well, because he is a unionist. He should know that, in practice, most unionists leave the business of their unions to the few. They do not attend union meetings or, if they do attend, they are over-awed or outmanoeuvred by the disciplined minority Mr Hughes. that represents the Communist party. I speak from the great experience that I years I was the executive officer of the Sydney Wharf Labourers Union. I established the Waterside Workers Federation and was its president for fourteen years. I was the head of the transport workers' industrial organization, for which some members of the Opposition can vouch because they were members of that federation. Unionism flourished and became the power in the land that it is under the system of government that is imperilled by the Communist party and its adherents in Australia. I repeat that the peoples of the world fear war. From what quarter do they apprehend attack? No power threatens Russia is them save Russia. People speak about the cold war, but that has been proceeding for many years. There is also a hot war, a shooting war, and nobody has attempted to do anything about it. Look where Russia is to-day. Russia is communism. Without Russia, communism would be at large without a directing force. When World WarI . ended, Russia's security was more effectively assured than it had been at any other time in its long and chequered history. To-day, Russia has gained half the world. It now controls The right honorahle effectively, either de jure or de facto, 1,100,000,000 people-hal f the population of the world. Communism is not an insignificant movement confined within narrow territorial limits, and with objectives which threaten the security of no other nation. It is a world force which aims at the enslavement of mankind, as some honourable members have suggested. Members of the Opposition have even asserted that this Parliament has no power to deal with the Communist party. Tell the people of Australia that we have no power to deal with the organization that has cawed countless strikes, stoppages and labour upheavals and that threatens us with war, and listen to their reply! The honourable member for Kennedy ("" Mr Riordan) declared that the bill was ultra vires and that the Parliament lacked the power necessary to enact any measure that could deal effectively with the deadly peril that menaces everything that we cherish. Let ns consider where we stand. War may break out, but otber perils besides a shooting war threaten the nation. The population of Japan is increasing at the rate of 2,000,000 a year and now totals almost 84,000,000. All populations are limited by food suppliea Saturation point has been reached in Japan. Where are the surplus millions of Japanese to go ? They must get out of Japan or perish. Where in the world, is there room for these millions? Where can they find food or make homes for themselves? Where is there a country at once so inviting and so vulnerable as is Australia? Throughcut my political life I have done my best to arouse the nation to a realization that we can hold this continent only if we prove ourselves fit to develop its resources and, should the need arise, to defend it. We have done great things in defending our country. The White Australia policy, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in this House a few days ago, has been in force since the very establishment of this Commonwealth. That policy would have been but an empty boast but for the fact that we had behind us the strength of the British Navy. We nestled securely under itr wing for 160 years, but those days arc gone. The security that we owed in part to our remoteness has gone. The command of the seas is no longer the dominant factor in the maintenance of world peace. We have the atom bomb, we have conquered the air, and revolutionary changes have taken place in the outlook of men. After all, in this world "" there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so present terrible danger to the free nations of the world because hundreds of millions now lisp its litanies. The people of Australia must do everything within their power to arrest the onward march of Eussia and communism. As I have said, communism now prevails over 1,100,000,000 people. All Eastern Europe is under its sway. It stands with its foot on the very edge of the Mediterranean, which will give it command of Africa and the Suez Canal, the gateway to Australia. Yet we are told to do nothing! Eussia is an armed camp. It can put millions of men into the field. Its naval, land and air forces far exceed those of any other country. Yet we are told that we must not drive communism underground. I should be the last to claim, even for a moment, that this measure represented in any way an attack upon Labour. I would never lend myself to such an attack. My political career would provide a complete answer to such a charge if ever it were made against me. But I believe that Labour must be up and doing if it wishes to continue as a great force in this country. It must purge itself of the evil forces of communism. It must smite its enemies hip and thigh. It ought to be the very vanguard of those who wish to defeat, or at least arrest, the onward march of communism. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) has said that the bill is not constitutional. Tell the people that this danger, which threatens everything spiritual and material that they value, is beyond the control of this Parliament and they will rouse themselves and raise a shout that will move men to action, demanding that the power shall be given to us. This National Parliament ought to have the power to deal with all national problems. A threat is aimed at the heart of the nation and, if anything stands in the way of our defence against that danger, tbe impediment must be removed. I have spoken very warmly because I feel warmly on this subject. I warn honourable members that there is an unbridgeable gulf between communism and us. Communism is opposed to everything that we believe in. We believe in liberty, they sneer at liberty. Communism is an everWe believe in the rule of law and in. arbitration. I remind the right honourable member for Barton of the fact that, although the law forbade all strikes in the coal industry and he had the power to launch prosecutions against lawbreakers when he was Attorney-General, the prosecutions that he did launch could be counted on the fingers of one hand. This country depends absolutely upon the power that is derived from coal, but he did virtually nothing to prevent strikes in the coal industry. We believe in arbitration; the Communists spit on arbitration. They use arbitration when it serves them and put it behind them when it does not serve them. That applies in particular to the Waterside Workers when Prime Minister is to be made a Federation, to which I gave some of the pale and colourless thing by comparison best years of my life. It has fallen into with that of the present Prime the hands of avowed Communists, who Minister( Mr Menzies) if this bill lead processions on May Day. honourable gentleman's time has expired. ing Communists.

247,Mr Speaker,The honourable memparty to the second reading of this bill.,75,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
248,Mr Fraser (Eden,"Monaro) [8.32]. it by no means follows that we do nothas always unreservedly declared that the Communist party is a menace to the well-being of every Australian home. It is a menace in the same way as are the provisions of this legislation. The Labour party has always pursued a positive policy against the Communist party and during the eight years of Labour in office the number of members of the Australian Communist party in this country was reduced from 25,000 to 13,000. With a continuance of the Labour Government the number would have continued to fall until it had become insignificant. But Labour no longer being in office cannot now apply its policy; instead it can merely thwart tlie application of any other policy than its own through its Senate majority. In the result there might be no policy at r.ll on a matter which it is agreed needs strong action. It could be argued that that would be an untenable position for auy political party to take up. Tbere is another matter of major importance, and that is the Government's claim to special knowledge of dangers facing this nation. That is information which the Government says it cannot reveal to this House. The dangers are supposed to flow from the imminence of a shooting war with Bussia. We are only technically at peace now, says the Prime Minister, and he alleges that a criminal conspiracy exists amongst the top Communists aimed at the internal destruction of this nation. Every government is charged witb the prime duty of defending Australia. This Government makes these grave statements of thc imminence of war, and of the existence of a treasonable plot, not on the mere basis of press reports that are available to everybody but on the basis of secret information of the kind that is available only to governments and which cannot be revealed. The Opposition has no access to that information and no means of weighing or checking it. The responsibility for those statements and the needed in the bill. Passage of these responsibility for the defence of Australia both rest upon the government of the day, not only this Government, but whatever government might be in office. An immense and improper responsibility would be assumed by any Opposition which chose to set aside completely such sta tements merely because it has not had an opportunity of checking or weighing ;.hem. Likewise a responsibility rests upon the government of the day to obtain the power that it claims its secret despatches show that it requires. I put forward these considerations briefly at the outset because there are so many citizens who hate this legislation as much as I do, to whom this matter is of very great importance. I trust that they will recognize the weight of these contentions. Some honourable members on the Government side have said that it is enough that the Government has a mandate. They say that that is all the justification that it needs for its legislation. I refuse to bow to such a contention as that. The principle advanced by these honorahle members rests on the unqualified acceptance of majority rule. If another Nazi-minded government obtained an electoral majority to imprison and send to lethal chainbers all Jews, or members of any other minority religion, would the right to do that have to be conceded to the Government because the majority had spoken? To reverse the case, if the Government of Israel received an electoral majority for a proposal to suppress and annihilate the Arab minority, must all good democrats accept that mandate simply because the Government had won a victory at the polls? By no means; all individual human rights could he outraged if that principle were correct. The Labour party tells the Government that there are well-defined limits to its mandate on this subject. It says that the Government is seeking to exceed its mandate with unexampled tyranny. It is making an assault on the rights of ordinary people. The Labour party will fight these excesses, and for that reason it will propose a number of safe-guarding amendments to the bill. The Labour party puts them forward as being necessary, and as therefore being the minimum changes amendments will still enable the Government to fulfil its pledge to the electorate to dissolve the Communist party, but the amendments will substantially reduce the very wide powers which the Government is seeking under this bill. The proposed amendments are to safeguard the people, and at this point another question may well be asked. That is: Why safeguard Communists; why should disloyalists be defended at all? The defence is not of Communists, or disloyalists as such; it is a defence of their acceptance in this community. Since rights and freedoms which long experience has taught us that all men must possess unless they are removed from them by due process of law upon proof of guilt. There must be proof of their guilt and a conviction in a duly constituted court. That is our British system. Despite those who to-day sneer at Britain's difficulties, who praise every country except their own and who preach a foreign ideology, let us be wise enough to recognize the imperishable value of the British concepts of freedom and justice, and let us hold fast to every one of them."" the reformatories and the prison camps annihilation ? nist party as the subtle enemy of these concepts. I accept that honourable members opposite are similar enemies because they would destroy those concepts by this infamous bill. Far from defending Communists, the Labour party ha9 fought them and is fighting them to-day in both the political and the industrial world. It they can be reinforced. The peace forces is fighting them and winning. I see with me to-night colleagues who, during the last twenty years, have never ceased from opposing the Communists. There are men here who have been set upon in dark streets by gangs of bashers. They have been kicked and left for dead, but have risen to carry on the struggle. They are still fighting. The Labour party is the enemy of the Communist party, and until that party has destroyed the Labour party it cannot obtain power in this country. What happened in other countries will happen here. The big business Nazis and the rural Fascists are the allies of the Communists and are fighting for the destruction of the Labour party. We shall not deliver ourselves into their hands. Honourable members interjecting, too much interjection. The honourable member is entitled to a fair and uninterrupted hearing. can be a deadly menace to Australia's well-being in two ways: first, by the actions of its members either singly or in joint enterprises; and secondly, by the spread of the ideas that it holds, and the spread of the ideas that it holds, aud their acceptance in this community. If we have to deal with those two deadly menaces, let us examine the first of them -the Communist actions that may be injurious to this country. To deal with those actions law enforcement agencies exist; the laws themselves exist and they are very wide and stringent; the police forces, the special police forces, the peace forces and the security forces exist; the law courts, the magistrates, the justices and the judges exist; and the prison cells, are already in existence. If the existing laws to deal with illegal actions are not strong enough-and they are very strong-the n they can be strengthened. bill? they can be strengthened, l f the law enforcement officers are insufficientand there are many thousands of themand the security forces can be doubled in size. Similarly, if there are not enough courts, magistrates, and judges and if there are not enough prisons to hold those wbo have been proved guilty and convicted in the courts, they can be provided. The honourable member for Curtin( Mr Hasluck) considers thai, such remedies will be provided by this bill. That is an entirely innocent belief. The Government will not accept the way I am describing. It insists on tearing down the structure of British justice and British freedom and of branding as "" un-British"" all those who stand in its way in this matter, because-and this is the point that I wish to make-it seeks to tear down the fundamental principle that the law is no respecter of persons. When acts or utterances are made illegal under British law they must be applicable to any person irrespective of who commits or makes them. That is the principle. The bill ignores it by placing persons and groups",75,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

254,Mr Feasee,"No, I shall show howof persons beyond tbe law. I do not for one moment believe that tbe ordinary people of Australia are unaware of the vital importance of maintaining that principle of British law, of the importance to them, to their families and to their neighbours. I am sure that whenever the opportunity comes, they will show just how much importance they do attach to it. So much, then, for the means of dealing with the actions that members of the Communist party could commit against the interests of this country. But it is equally essential to counter ideas that are promulgated by the Communist party. This Government seeks to do so by an Act of Parliament, by a law, and by the forces that are arrayed to implement it. Is there anyone foplish enough to think that it can be done by those means? The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), in his second-reading speech, quoted Pandit Nehru's splendid statementYou cannot impale an idea on the point of of individual freedom and individual a Bayonet. Of course you cannot, and the whole lesson of history is that every attempt to suppress an idea actually spreads that idea. This bill will bave that effect unless every lesson of history is wrong. The Government, by this kind of action, will arouse sympathy and support for men who may not deserve it. It will issue a challenge to young and adventurous minds to study and to uphold the ideas which, by this legislation, it will become dangerous to possess. It will place a stone in the path of every man who seeks by persuasion to defeat those idea.3, because it will enable him to be nortrayed. even wrongly, as an ally of those who seek to defeat those ideas by force. The only way in which the idea that is propagated by the Communist party may be defeated is by presenting a better idea, and by making it a read and living thing in our community and in our lives. What is that better idea? Surely it is the idea of the supremacy of the individual over the State-the State as the servant of the individual and never his master. Surely it is the idea of the dignity of human personality, of the right of every ordinary man to even-handed iustice, of his right to worship his God [84] as he chooses, of his right to express his opinion freely, of his right to useful work and to choose the work that he will do and of his right to provide for his family and to enjoy their societythe sacred rights of his home. That is the better idea which the Labour party poses against the Communist idea. is quoting from Liberal party policy. by this bill. I believe that all those rights to which I have referred are extinguished in the countries that to-day are ruled by totalitarian governments. I believe also that the Communist party method, by wbich the end justifies the means, by which fraud, falsehood and slander are permissible against every one who stands in the party's way, does represent a potential threat and danger to all those things that I have just described. But the very provisions of this bill are an equal threat to the existence of those essential ingredients justice. To escape a Communist dictatorship, we do not have to cast ourselves into the hands of a Fascist dictatorship, and I am certain that the Australian people will never knowingly do so. Mr Pearce interjecting, ber for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) apparently thinks that the people would knowingly do so. He is very frank. cent, of the people are in favour of this bill. ber does not mean that 95 per cent, of the Australian people would knowingly cast themselves into the hands of a fascist dictatorship? However, there is no need for them to do so. It is by the strength of the democratic idea, and by our adherence to it, that the strength of communism has been minimized in this country. It. is only by a departure from the democratic idea, as is intended by this bill, that we shall open the way for the victory of materialist ideas, in whifh all moral considerations are swept aside like chaff before the wind.

266,Mr Mccolm,"Before turning to thebut, as I bave said, I hope that tbey will be submitted in the right spirit. The first thing that we should consider, as other honourable members, including the right honourable meinber for Bradfield, have stated, is that this bill has been introduced as a defence measure, with the purpose of defending His Majesty's realm and our Commonwealth of Australia. There are few matters of greater importance to the Australian Commonwealth or to the British Empire. It is amazing that almost every honourable member opposite who has risen to speak on this matter has started off by saying that he proposes to vote for the measure. Honourable members opposite agree with the preamble to the bill and that the Communist party of Australia is a subversive and dangerous body. They knew that long ago, and so I consider that they stand condemned out of their own mouths because one of the prime functions of au Australian Government is to protect the Constitution and the Commonwealth. They failed to do that when they were in office. They failed to take any action against treachery and treason, although they admit that there are treasonable organizations in this country. I now turn to some of the statements made by the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Chifley), because I believe that they ?hould never have been made by a man of his experience and intelligence. To start with he said that history had more or less shown us that every minority group that had been suppressed had eventually come to power. He implied by that statement that one day he expected to see Russian communism in power in Australia. That is truly an amazing statement to come from a man who is an ex-Prime Minister of this country and who is now Leader of His Majesty's Opposition. He mentioned among other things that other countries of the British Commonwealth and of the world are opposed to this legislation to ban the Communist party because they believe that it is an undemocratic measure. Yet we find that the governments of countries like Canada and the United Kingdom agree with us about the danger of communism, because now when they find dangerous Communists in posts that demand secrecy they withdraw them from Ifr. McColm. these posts if, in their slowness, they find them in time. I believe that removal of men from their positions merely because they are members of a party that is considered to be legal or of an organization that is recognized as being legal, is the greatest negation of democracy of which I have ever heard. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Fraser) has stated that he beUeves that history has proven to us that this legislation cannot succeed because similar legislation has never succeeded in the past. He used the same argument as his leader that minority groups that have been suppressed have eventually come forward and taken control. I remind him of the atomic bomb. If he believes in his own theory he could never believe in the existence of the atomic bomb, since there had never been one before. There has to be a first time for everything. I believe that this Government is leading the other countries of the British Commonwealth by introducing legislation that will prove effective in dealing with the enemies of our Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned at one stage that sections of the Commonwealth Crimes Act confer sufficient powers to enable the Government to deal with Communists. He seemed to forget that as Leader of t.he Labour party he is pledged under the terms of that party's platform to repeal those sections of that act. I consider that a gentleman in his position should reason more wisely before he makes such statements. The Leader of the Opposition asked all honourable members on this side of the House to make themselves clear about where they stood concerning their opinions of the associations or affiliations between the Labour party and the Communist party. I should like to make myself very clear on that point. I do not believe that there is any direct association between the Labour party and the Communist party, or that there is any desire in the Labour party to have such a direct association. But I dislike fascism and communism and in that respect I agree with the honourable member for ""Watson( Mr Cuitin), so I cannot help remembering that Nazi-ism in Germany was "" National Socialism "", that Russia is the Union of "" Socialist'' Soviet Republics and that the Labour party has recently boasted of socialistic intentions. I have no fear that there is any immediate desire on the part of the Labour party for an association with the Communist party. I think that honourable members opposite sincerely believe that their socialistic theories can assist our Commonwealth. 1 consider, however, that they forget that history has shown that no government has ever adopted a policy of full governmental control of the means of production, distribution and exchange without eventually being led, whether it wanted to be or not, to totalitarianism. Any totalitarian State is akin to communism. In that respect 1 believe that there is a danger, not in the ultimate objectives of the Labour party but in the ultimate results of the actions of the Labour party. The main opposition that honourable members opposite have advanced to this bill-althoug h they say that they will vote for it, which is a most peculiar position with which I shall deal 'later-seem s to spring from the Government's proposals in relation to communism in the trade union movement. Honourable members will recall that before this bill was actually introduced the Leader of the Opposition and other members of his party said that they believed that the bill was intended merely to smash trade unionism. hear the honourable member say that. He is talking nonsense but be is at least consistent. Honourable members opposite will by now have realized that this legislation has been very carefully prepared to ensure that it shall not interfere with trade unionism. If honourable members opposite cla'ni that any trade union has the right to harbour a Communist within its ranks and to he directed by known Communists and known traitors, then I claim that such trade unions must give way to the power of the elected government of the country, been use any trade union Mr Curtin interjecting, the right to dictate to the Government of the country. 1 believe that a great majority of honourable members opposite know of, and believe in, the sincerity of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). Most of them are familiar with the splendid work that he has done for trade unions in the past, and they talk with their tongues in their cheeks when they say that they are afraid that this legislation has been designed to damage the trade unions. Its purpose is to root out the traitors in our midst and in the midst of the trade unions. I , for one, would take strong exception if this legislation were merely intended, or were used in any way, to damage the genuine trade union movement. Most other honourable members on this side of the House would feel the same about it. I believe that honourable members opposite who represent the great trade union movement should remember that they have said that the trade unions themselves can defeat communism in their ranks. They did not add the words "" given time "", but it is quite obvious that they would need time to defeat the Communists. I know and believe that the majority of the trade unions are doing what is in their power to root out tbe Communists in their midst but all the dangerous Communists in our Commonwealth who are in positions in which they can do harm are not necessarily members was! of trade unions. So that if the matter of rooting out Communists was left entirely to trade unionists their work agaiust the Communistsin their midst would not affect these other Communists in any way. It could not affect a Communist who was working on a secret or defence project, in one of the armed services or in the Commonwealth Public Service. This legislation amply covers Communists who are outside the trade union movement and who incidentally are among the most dangerous of Communists. I ask honourable gentlemen who represent the trade union movement to hear that in mind, and to be sincere in their expressions of opinion either for or asfflinst this measure. If they are' in favour of the measure T should like them to say so without as much hypocrisy as",80,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

270,Mr Speaker,Order!,82,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
271,Mr Mccolm,"No trade union haswe have had in the last day or so. Honourable members opposite have also displayed an intense dislike of the provision to plaee the onus of proof upon the accused instead of the accuser. I , personally, have always believed that except in extreme circumstances that procedure can be extremely dangerous. It must be handled wisely when it is used; and it has been used, because all countries at various times in their history have been compelled to put aside ordinary laws in order to ensure their national safety. This is an instance of that kind. I remind honourable members opposite that during the war not only were individuals taken into custody and put in prison secretly without trial, but also that a number of them were executed secretly with the public knowing nothing about ""the matter until after the war had -ended. Such cases are sad, but at times they are unavoidable. I have a particular interest in the provision to place the onus of proof upon the accused, because T have appeared before a court martial at which the onus was placed upon me to prove my innocence. I know how hopeless such a task can bc. As the result of those proceedings I spent several months in solitary confinement, and I realize how hopeless a person feels when he does cot know why he has been confined and bas no knowledge of the specific charge Seing made against him. Nevertheless, if this provision is necessary in order to tmash communism, I support it. Some honourable members opposite have indulged in arrant hypocrisy and cant. BeforeI was elected to the Parliament I w83 employed in the Queensland Public Service and it was part of my duty to asfist in the administration of building :ontrol legislation which, in certain -iircumstances, placed the onus of proof upon the accused. I carried in my ?ocket-book an authority signed by -he Minister concerned which gave me ;be right to enter upon or into the oroperty, or premises, of any person if [ suspected that illegal building opera3 one were being carried out thereon, atherein. That legislation was enacted n a State in which a Labour government ias heen in oflice for 35 years with a ireak of only a few years. ome honourable members opposite who itr. McColm. know of the existence of that legislation should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for adopting the attitude that they have adopted in this debate. I have already said that I believe that one, or two, clauses of the bill should be amended, and I shall be interested to learn the details of the amendments that the Opposition proposes to put forward. However, honourable members opposite sliould make up their minds about whether they are supporting, or opposing, the measure. I am certain that any one who has listened to their speeches will not be able to decide exactly what they really think. It appears that for political expediency they say that they support the bill, because they realize that the people are strongly behind the Government in this matter. Having made that declaration, however, they have proceeded to tear the. bill to pieces merely as a pretext to get some political propaganda off their chests. The Americans very aptly describe persons who behave like that as mugwumps-the y have their mugs on one side of the fence and their wumps on the other.' Again, I ask honourable members to tell the Parliament which way they are facing because it has been impossible for any one to decide that point up to date. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) opened the debate on this legislation with a speech of the greatest emotional power that I have ever heard delivered in this Parliament. His speech dealt very little with the provisions of the bill, but very extensively with the right honourable gentleman's views on the tenseness of the international situation, the history of communism, the writings of Marx and Lenin from which he quoted extensively, and Australian trade unions. If the menaces are such as the Prime Minister has described them, it is high time that the debate was removed from the emotional level and changed to cold thinking and clear analysis. Supporters of the Government have described the bill as a treason measure and have referred, in support of that argument, to one of the nine "" whereases "" that make up the preamble. .Somewhere among Therefore, those whereases appears this statement",82,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
272,Mr Beazley (Eremantle) [9.20],"which is the only real reference to In that speech the right honourable gentletreason in the billAnd whereas the Australian Communist and treason would be strengthened and Party is an integral part of the world Comthat a conviction under those laws-and munist revoli tionary movement, which, in the King's dominions and elsewhere, engages in that presupposes a court action-woul d espionage and sabotage and in activities . . . qualify a person for the punishment that I ask honourable members to direct their feature of the bill is that after beginning attention to the words "" espionage "" and with a preamble relating to treason "" sabotage "" because the meaning of those it proceeds to talk about industrial activiwords might more conveniently be sumties and provides for punishments that no marized as mass murder. The spy, or one could regard as commensurate in the saboteur, is a mass murderer of his respect of treasonable acts. Surely, if a own people. As the bill declares that the man is a traitor, engaged in treason and Communist partu engages in those activisabotage, and the Government is aware ties one would expect it to provide of that fact, the Government will not for the punishments to be applied deal adequately with him by disqualifyin respect of mass murder, espionage ing him from holding office in a trade and sabotage.

274,Mr Beazley,"I refer the honorsubmit all of them to the power of theHonorable members opposite bave spoken very emotionally on this bill. However, some of tbe emotional sting bas been taken out of tbe debate, altbougb some bonorable members opposite do not appear to be aware of the fact, by a statement that the Prime Minister issued to-day to the press in which he declared Lis preparedness to accept certain amendments which, as is well known, the Opposition proposes to submit. Buti n referring to one of the amendments the Prime Minister made a most peculiar statement. For the edification of the honorit hie member for St. George( Mr Graham), I shall quote from that statement, in which, I note, the right honourable gentleman twice usurped the prerogative of using the plural. That statement readsThe hill does not, in our opinion, touch the place cif a member of the Parliament. But we are nnitp willing to put that beyond doubt by a provision similar to that in the Crimes Act (Section 22), which is as follows:Nothing in this Act shall derogate from any power or privilege of either House of the Parliament or of the members of committees of either House of Parliament as existing at tlie commencement of this Act. The psychological background of that statement is obviously the exchange of pleasantries, that took place between the right honourable gentleman and the honorahle member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) when, jokingly or otherwise, the Prime Minister suggested that certain members of the Parliament could come within the scope of the bill . If this is a treason bill, why should members of the Parliament be exempt from its provisions? The mere fact that the right honourable gentleman has stated that he is willing to amend the bill by inserting a clause exempting a member of the Parliament from its provisions is a clear sign that this is not a treason bill and that its emotionally powerful introductory preamble has no real relation to the text of the measure. ber is entirely overlooking the oath of allegiance that is taken by a member of the Parliament. If a member of the Parliament violated his oath by commuting treason he would come within the provisions of the bill. Mr Beazley. remind honourable members that in one British dominion the activities of a member of the Parliament were questioned. A member of the Canadian House of Commons who, if my memory serves me aright, was named Rose, was indicted for treason and was convicted. No sensible person would suggest that any member of the Parliament should be exempted fro m the provisions of any treason law. The faet that the Prime Minister is prepared to amend this measure by inserting such a clause is a clear sign that it does not deal with treason at all. We should be more sensible if we confined our attention to the measure now before us and took fewer opportunities to wax emotional on the subject of treason, as has been done so frequently by honourable members opposite during this debate. I want to make only one request in relation to the second-reading speech of the Prime Minister. I ask the right honourable gentleman to state in his closing speech what he meant by the expression "" We are technically at peace"". If he considers war with Russia inevitable, and that we are virtually at war with Russia now. it seems strange that there .still remains in this capital territory of the Commonwealth a Russian legation and a Russian ambassador, and that the first psychological steps to mobilize for the conflict should be taken by Australia and not by the T n ted States of AmericaT ; and the Tjnited Kingdom which, normally speaking, would he the first nowers to bear the brunt of an assault. Honourable members opposite have referred to the destruction of the right of the Communist party to appeal against its dissolution and to the preservation of the right of accused persons to appeal to a single justice of the H i gh Court. It is not posi ikle to say whether they are right or not. That would depend upon whether the H i gh Court would consent to hear a Communist party challenge of the legality of this legislation when its provisions had been first applied to the party's property and organization. There is a precedent for such a challenge. During the war ? i organization known as -lehnvah's Witnesses, which was declared to be an unlawful organization, challenged thc declaration in the H i gh Court.",84,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
275,Mr Drummond,The honourable mem,85,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
276,Mr Beazley,"T h a t is true. ITbe court had to determine whether a body which had been declared unlawful had a right to appear before it. It detergrateful if the courtesy that honourable mined that the organization had such a right. All I can say is that the last decision in a similar case gave to the declared body the right to appeal on the ground that its declaration of illegality was beyond the Commonwealth's defence power. I believe that if the bill remains unamended, the Communist party will be the only organization to which the legislation applies that will have the right of appeal. The Communists will have the initial right to challenge the legislanegative. He will not know what accusation in the High Court, and to call upon the Commonwealth to prove that they come within the ambit of this bill. If the legislation is validated, the right of appeal of persons who are merely suspect will be extremely limited. ber for Forrest may be referring to a derision at a Liberal party meeting to amend the legislation. If he denies that there is a limitation on the right of a person to appeal when that person is confined to appealing to a single judge with the onus of proof resting on himself, the honourable member's view of what constitutes a limitation does not coincide with mine. The legislation before us is contradicstatute-book. He is not in a position to tory. A person who is declared, and is removed from his occupation because he has been declared, will have a right of appeal to a justice of the High Court. If the Government is absolutely certain that its declarations will be correct, why should it allow a right of appeal at all? If the Government is not absolutely certain that its declarations will be correct, why does it place a limitation on the right of appeal? That seems to me to be a problem that no honourable, member supporting the Government has attempted to explain. member deal with the problem? Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) asks bow I would deal with the problem. He knows very well that we intend to submit certain amendments which are designed to broaden the right of appeal. That is how we propose to deal with that particular problem.. I should be members on this side of the House extended to the Prime Minitser during his second-reading speech could also be extended to me during the course of my attempt to justify those amendments The proposal before us amounts to a perversion of normal operations of the court. The ordinary procedures of evidence are to be set aside. An accused person will not know of what he is accused. He will be asked to prove a tions have been made against him. He will be asked to prove that he is not something. He will not be confronted by his accusers and he will have no ready access to the court. gency (Coal Strike) Act contains somewhat similar provisions. purely of a temporary nature and it contained a provision to the effect that at the moment the Governor General declared the state of emergency to have passed the whole of the act was repealed. The honourable member is advancing the argument that these powers will not be abused. He should remember that tlie Government proposes to place this legislation permanently on the guarantee the actions of governments over the years. I remind honourable members opposite that when the Immition Act was passed in 1901 it was said the dictation test would never be applied to Europeans and Britishers. That intent emerges quite clearly from the initial debate in this House, but as time has gone on the dictation test has been applied to Europeans and Britishers alike. If we put on the statute-book legislation in permanent form we should consider it as permanent legislation and not imagine that because we believe that a certain government may be trusted to wield its powers effectively and fairly, they will never be abused. For that reason I surest that lenr^lation of the character of th*t now before us sliould he very carefullv examined.

282,Mr Beazley,"That legislation wasto explain the limitations of this measure. declared and has a proper chance to They believe it to be an arrow directed precisely at the Communist party. Some have been at pains to give us an indication that they believe that its provisions should be much wider. As usual, the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), who is also Deputy -Prime Minister and Treasurer, had the temerity to suggestI do not know in which of his several incapacities he was speaking-that the Australian Labour party and the Communist party are identical, the logic of his argument being that this legislation should' cover -u wider field. The inference that could he drawn from his remarks was subsequently denied by a succession of Governnient speakers and, in fact, it was completely denied by the Prime Minister iin his statement to the press that the Government is prepared to amend the bill to provide that it will not apply to members of the Parliament. Government members cannot sit quietly and endure the expression of one unpopular opinion. I hope that the mentality that has been displayed by Government members during this debate will not be tbe mentality that they will exhibit when they are wielding the powers to be conferred on the Government by this legislation. During the Queensland general election the Treasurer said that the Labour party in Queensland was the forerunner of communism because it had sought to compel the Governor of that State to act on the advice of his Ministers and because 22 years ago, it was responsible for the abolition of the Upper House in that State. His ideas about communism are very vague. I believe that this measure will fail in by the Opposition in regard to this its purpose because it lacks precision. Honourable members opposite have never sought to imagine how this legislation will operate. A person may be declared and removed from office in a trade union. How does the Government propose to orevent him from exercising authority in his union? Does the Government prome. pose to direct special police to attend all trade union meetings? Does it intend to place a cordon of police around the trades halls in order to make sure that a declared person shall not influence the decisions of a union? If a person is itr.

The Prime Minister could very well accept an amendment to the bill to give him such a right. already been agreed to by the Government. has agreed to make certain amendments that have been indicated in a very unsatisfactory manner in his press statement, simply hecause of the stand taken matter.

The requirement that the Government shall obtain a warrant by establishing to the satisfaction of a magiswould have heard the Minister for Extrate that there is a case for breaking and entering is a safeguard for authority as much as for the person concerned. If there is to be a whole class of unknown security agents with unlimited rights of entering there must exist an opening for all sorts of imposters to enter all sorts of premises on any pretext and the necessity to produce a warrant will be a safeguard for authority as well a3 for the individual. Those honourable gentlemen opposite who have spoken on this bill have described it as a treason measure, but they have failed to justify its lack of precision as a treason measure and have failed to explain why industrial powers are embodied in a measure that has a defence preamble. I very much suspect that this legislation was drafted in haste and was presented to the House because the Government believed that it would sever the parliamentary Labour party from the trade union movemeut or split the parliamentary Labour party down the middle, or that it would be a good political ground on which to force a double dissolution. As an instrument for giving effect to the purpose of its professed aim of dealing with treason it does not bear analysis. As an instrument of industrial legislation it incorporates the new and dangerous principle of endeavouring to expand the industrial power of the Commonwealth in peacetime per medium of the defence power. If the Governnient had been sincere it would have brought down two pieces of legislation of the kind that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. This measure looks, socially and politically, very imprecise, and, in the clauses which apparently the Government is going to retract, it manifests a most cavalier attitude towards the individual. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), Mr Speaker, first put up Aunt Sallies and then proceeded to knock them down. He deliberately endeavoured to deceive this House by stating that the Government, after continued pressure from the Opposition, had at last decided to accept some amendments to this measure. Had he been paying attention to the debate, the honourable member ternal Affairs( Mr Spender), very early in the debate, say that the Government would be prepared seriously to consider any amendments that were submitted during the committee stage. This Government, thank heaven, is showing an attitude altogether different from that of the previous Government, which, in the three years during which I sat on the Opposition benches, refused to accepi amendments except on two occasions when it. changed a "" but"" to an "" and "" and changed the word ""religion"" to "" Christianity "". amendments which were quite different from that sort of nonsense. member for Fremantle did not say either that he would support the bill or that he would oppose it. I grant that he has not acted as the rest of his party bave. They, if I may use an Australian colloquialism, "" have had two bob each way "". The honourable member may have spoken in the way he did in case his speech caught up with him at a future date. But other honourable members of the Opposition have been endeavouring to back every horse in the race. The Labour party knows very well that it opened its ranks to the inrush of communism in 1921 when, at its ninth annual conference which was held in Brisbane, I think on the 21st and 22nd October, it adopted in to to, the resolution put by the All-Australian Council of Trade Unions. The year 1921 was only four years after tbe October revolution had occurred in Bussia, by means of which the Communist doctrines of Lenin and Marx were first put into effect. The first Communist leader in this country, Mr Jock Garden, secured the adoption of that resolution at that conference. Honourable members of the Opposition have spoken about a Blackburn declaration, bnt such a declaration has never existed.",87,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

Years after that conference the Labour party persecuted the man who had tried to talk that' meeting into showing some sense. Years afterwards, members of that party came into this House Speaker. My point of order is that the decisions of a conference of the Australian Labour party in 1921 have very little, if anything, to do witb tbe bill be that the existing law should before the House. a lot about Fascists, Nazis, Socialists and Communists,, and other such references during the debate. able member for Wills( Mr Bryson) will remember that he is not at a football match now. I do not intend to lay the whole of the blame on the Australian Labour party, but I repeat that that party laid its ranks open for the inrush I have mentioned and to-day is endeavouring to get rid of its effects. Quite a number of unions which support the Australian Labour party, have, for years past, realized this danger and have taken the action necessary to prevent the increase of the power that had been obtained by Communists in trade unions. Before dealing with the measure before the chamber, I want to pass a few remarks about the speech of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser), who said that he absolutely hated this legislation, but was going to vote for it. That, to me, seemed a strange attitude to adopt. He hates ihe legislation and yet he is going to vote for it. If he were true to his colours he would at least vote against the measure. But he realizes that he is caught in his own trap. He referred to the Nazis. I do not refer to members of the Australian Labour party as Communists because I know that the description would not be true, and I remind the honourable gentleman from Eden-Monaro that nobody on this side of the House has had the audacity to do so. What we have tried to drum into your heads is that you have been travelling along the wrong road for many years. able gentleman will address me. I am still here. ing to explain to honourable members of the Opposition, Mr Speaker, that the policy of the Labour party parallels that of the Communist party to such an exexistence for some time. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has said that there is no need for this legislation but strengthened. If he was referring to the Crimes ActI would remind him that it is the intention of the Australian Labour party to remove those sections of the Crimes Act that deal with industrial matters. If their detestation of this bill is as great as some honourable' members of the Opposition would have us believe why, in the eight years during which they were in oflice, did they not strengthen the Crimes Act? I have yet to be reminded of any statement by any honourable member of the Opposition that such a thing would be done. The remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro did not ring very true in that respect. It has been said by some members of the Opposition that during the coal strike the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the present Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Fadden) were nowhere in evidence. Honourable members know what happened in those days. The right honourable member for Kooyong, from his place at the Opposition side of the table, made an offer to the then Prime Minister that he and the Leader of the Australian Country party would accompany the right honourable gentleman to the coal-fields if he would go with them, but the offer was declined. For any one to say that the leaders of the present Government did not offer any assistance to the government of the day during that coal strike is for him to utter a deliberate untruth. We did not oppose the legislation on that occasion. We supported you right up to the hilt. honourable gentleman will address me.",88,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

299,Mr Speaker,"Order! The rightMr Speaker, went through in very good time. What are the objects of this bill? As the Prime Minister stated, its objects are to outlaw and dissolve the Communist party, to pursue it into any new or associated form and to deal with the employment of Communists in certain offices and under certain circumstances. In dealing with the last portion of that statement, honourable members of the Opposition have said that Once a man is declared he will lose his employment. That is not so. Under the bill, a declared person will lose his employment if he is employed by the Commonwealth Government, Also, the fact that a person has been declared will prevent him from holding office in a union but only if that union is declared to be one connected with a key industry. So why all this hullabaloo about a man being deprived of his employment? There is nothing in this legislation to stop the individual from expressing his opinion or from thinking whatever he wishes to think. There is provision for stopping an individual from carrying out actions which would be to the detriment of this country, but the statement by honourable members that every one is going to be deprived of his or her employment immediately is far from the truth. It has been said that this Communist party which it is intended to abolish is a revolutionary body. Some people say that it is not. Honourable members will recall that Lenin said that it was necessary to use any ruse, cunning, unlawful method, evasion or concealment of the truth in the carrying out of the policy of what we now know as communism. The Soviet Government employs "" fifth columns "" in all countries in which it is permitted to install them. It issues orders able member for Melbourne ( Mr to them and they obey. Those underground organizations are in the habit of camouflaging themselves as political parties, and the title that they usually choose is that of the Communist party. These fifth columnists take full advantage of all the democratic liberties, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, while attempting to destroy the system that affords such protection to them. I cannot understand any Australian, in this Parliament or elsewhere, trying to defend such a revolutionary movement. The Communist party is a cancerous growth in our midst. Everybody knows that the best means of attacking such an organism is to tackle it while it is yet young before it has had time to spread. Gardeners and farmers do not allow noxious weeds to grow and spread their seeds until eventually they overrun and destroy the cultivated plants. They attack the pest as soon as it appears and destroy it if possible before it has time to cast its seeds. The Communist party should have been attacked in the same way long ago. I do not say that the Lahour partu sponsors communism, but at any rate it has been beguiled by the movement so' that it has failed to take any action to eradicate it. When members of the Opposition were in power, they did not attempt to enact legislation against the Communist party because they knew that they would have to face its representatives in order to gain endorsement for re-election to this Parliament. They have been somewhat timid Communist can vote in a Labour party pre-selection ballot. member may say what he likes, but I should like to know why the Labour party failed to take action against the Communists. The Chifley Government acted during the coal strike only after it had been forced to do so by outside pressure. It did not move in the earl? stages of the dispute even though it knew that it could have prosecuted the instigators of the strike under the Crimes Act. I recall an occasion when the honorCalwell), who was a member of the Chifley Government, declared that, if an opportunity presented itself, he would be the first to repeal the repressive sections of the Crimes Act. The Communist party of Australia has openly avowed that it is opposed to the democratic liberties that we enjoy.

A man in that situation would not waste time removing the furniture from the house. He would tackle the bushfire first and try to stop it from burning down the house and all its contents. We must treat the Communist menace in the same way. Militant Communist minorities in other countries have swooped and gained eontrol at propitious times. We must guard against such betrayals. The Government has a mandate from the people to enact this legislation. The right hon^ orable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) and the honourable member for Fremantle bave declared that it is unconstitutional. At least let us enact it and then put it to the test. If it should be proved to be unconstitutional, we could amend it accordingly. The fact is that the Government is honouring its obligation to the electors. Do members of the Opposition want to have an ogpu or an N.ICYJD.?

303,Mr Calwell,"There seem to besay that they hate communis!*. Why, theii, do they not support the Governnient in enacting, this measure so that the growth of communism, can. he stopped.? Any reasonable, sensible and logieal amendments that they propose will be treated on their merits. We shall, not forsake the principle of the bill because we were elected to power, by the people upon our promise to deal with tbe Communists and we shall not lot the people downNeither shall we let down the trade unions, which members of the Opposition claim to represent, though I dispute that claim. In my opinion, some members of the Opposition were elected merely because they boarded the band wagon of unionism. Lenin told his disciples that they must use any ruse, cunning and concealment of the truth that would"" help them to gain their objectives. We must fight cunning with cunning. We must conceal from the Communiststhe methods by which we learn of their activities and run them to earth. If we were to prosecute them by the ordinary means, the obiect of this bill would be> defeated immediately. After the first trial of a declared person, they would know how we obtained information about their activities and would be able to evade the effect of the legislation. I remind honourable members of the Opposition of what Stalin wrote in his book, Problems of Leninism, which is available in the National Library for them to study. He statedThe development and the support of the revolution in other countries is an essential task of the victorious revolution. Thus the revolution victorious in one country must not consider itself a self-contained entity, but a support, a means of speeding the victory of the proletariat in other countries. Xhat the dictatorship of the proletariat is a stubborn firjht-blood y ancl bloodless, violent and peaceful, military ancl economic, educational and administrative-agains t the forces and traditions of an old society. The strategy of the Communist party, directed from Moseow, is to spread its disciples throughout dependencies, colonies and countries,in which people are striving for liberation. They have conquered China. They became active in southern China many years ago, but Chiang Kai-shek was too strong for them then and they retreated to north-western China, from which they moved again in their Latest successful, advance.. To-day, the 40O,000,0ftO people of China are dominated by the Communists, who are at our very doorstep. If the word to go was given hy Stalin to-morrow, Communist fifthrcolumnistswould join in an uprising from one end of the country to the other: in readiness to support the hordes that would, come from the north. This legislation represents the first step in the right direction and has my wholehearted support, and I am sure it has tbe support of a great majority of the Australian people. -Communism was mentioned in Australian politics much earlier than 192.1. It was first mentioned in this country almost as soon as, the Communist manifesto was issued. party. used against the Liberal party. I have a clipping from the Melbourne Herald of the 31st May, 1927, under the heading """"Fifty Years Ago To-day"". It reproduced the following item from the Herald of the Slst May, 1877, just on 73 years ago :The government policy speech delivered at Geelong last night by the Premier, Mr Berry, will undoubtedly have the effect of disarming those political adversaries of the Liberal party who have tried to affix the ohjectionable nickname of "" Communists"" to those who are only a few degrees less conservative than themselves. I move on now to 1925, in which year advertisements were inserted in the now defunct Morning Post of Melbourne by Stanley Melbourne Bruce under the heading "" Democracy or Communism ? "" Those advertisements declaredIf democracy i * to prevail, the Government must be returned with a majority in both Houses. That Government was returned to office, but it did nothing about communism. It is true that an act was passed in 1926 at the instance of the present Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, who was then Attorney-General, under which certain people who were alleged to be Communists, Walsh and Johansen, were to be sent out of the country. The law was passed in July, 1926, but the people affected appealed to the High Court.",91,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

306,Mr Calwell,"No, but it was onceThe present right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) represented them and the view that he expressed was upheld by the court and the appeal was allowed. Until 1932 no further attempt was made to deal with communism. The 1932 amendment became a dead letter from the day it was enacted. Therefore, all this talk about communism has been more of a political weapon than an earnest desire to do anything in regard to communism. Speaking now parenthetically, the same Thomas ""Walsh who was a Communist leader and who was so declared, if that term can be used, in connection with the 1926 legislation, some time later left the Communist party. After a time he became an organizer in Newcastle for the Nationalist party. He was interned during the war because of his pro-Japanese activities. That illustrates that many men have many changes of view in their lifetimes. Ihe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in his second reading speech, quoted resolutions of the Australian Labour party at its federal conferences and at meetings of its federal executive. tingly, by his recitation of the terms of those resolutions, he showed the uncompromising opposition of the Labour party to communism. By so reciting he unwittingly nailed the false and vicious propaganda of the anti-Labour forces that the Labour party and the Communist party are allies, or that socialism leads to communism. I know those resolutions well. .L took part m drafting them in the same way as I have had a hand in drafting every resolution of every federal conference and every federal executive meeting of the Labour party during the last twenty years. I voted for those resolutions as did the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) and many other honourable members who were delegates. Some honourable members who have been talking ahout communism have been trying to repeat the stories they have borrowed from America and other places. They have tried to smear socialism with all the social sins or whatever other pins there mi'rht he. of the Communist party. We have always known where we stand in relation to communism. It is an axiomatic pn'n ei nie that human greed breeds Mr Calwell. human misery, and human misery breeds communism. I am and have always been anti-Communist; I am and have always been anti-capitalist. No political organization, political party, association or section of the Australian people more completely and utterly rejects the beliefs .find the practices of the Communist, party than does the Australian Labour party. The Labour party is completely and unequivocally opposed to communism. It is sometimes embarrassed by communism, and extremely irritated and annoyed by specific Communist activity. The Labour party believes that in one sense this Parliament is not banning communism. It believes that the Communists ban themselves, not by what they say or by what they teach, but by their anti-social actions. They have sorely irritated and exasperated the Australian people. The Government claims, very piously, that it wishes to protect the community and the nation. The fact is that under our democratic system the Unwit[(.rmunity and the nation can protect themselves very well not only from communism and fascism but also from the ruthless and hungry monopoly of capitalism which these selfappointed protectors propose to reimpose on them. What the reactionary forces in this country really want, and what they ask for, is the right to establish a:id maintain a regime of poverty, insecurity, inequality, depression and malnutrition if they can do so. The system that they represent, to me and to every other true Labour man, is as bad as communism itself. Like communism it is a system that can be p^iritaiued only by force and fraud. The Prime Minister quoted a list of 50 dangerous men. He said that they were 50 Communists. I could quote another list of 50 dangerous men who are not Communists, men who hold within the hollow of their hands the control of the monopolies, trusts and combines of this country and who, by tlieir anti-social activities, and by the way in which they fix prices and control banks, insurance companies, mines, tbe iron and steel industries, the pre&s and every other agency of propaganda and profit in this nation, exploit the whole of the Australian people from the cradle to the grave. Communism, under a well-ordered, prosperous and democratic system of government, will wither on the vine. I need hardly add that in such conditions monopoly capitalism will wither and disappear in the same way. If we had a just order of society we should not be troubled by monopoly capitalism. The fact is that both these extreme, materialistic and cruel beliefs are withering rapidly throughout the more enlightened countries of the western world. But the harder fight for survival will certainly be made in Australia by monopoly capitalism, because in this country it is more deeply entrenched. That system represents a real threat to the happiness and well-being of future generations of Australians. If monopoly capitalism is to have another long and dreary term of office in this country, then communism, which is not and has never been a political force in Australia, may yet become one. When people suffer from the pangs of hunger they are not content with gradual and orderly social progress. When men and women are prevented by economic circumstances from performing to the full the duties of parents towards their children, they are inclined less toward thought than toward action. When young men and women go out into the world strong and eager, educated to make a full contribution to the life of the nation, able members really want to get rid of and they are deprived of the opportunity to work, marry, make homes and raise families, they listen to strange doctrines. It may seem odd to honourable members on the Government side who have never known poverty, privation or frustration to hear of these things and to realize that they exist in this country. In all the capital cities of Australia to-night there are many thousands of people who cannot get, homes. In all our cities there are fetid centres of human settlement where there are as many as 49 houses, or so-called homes, to the acre. In such places communism grows. This legislation may or may not be passed. The Communists may be driven underground, but communism will never be defeated unless it is defeated by a better idea. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Fraser) has told the story. What are the facts of history? The first country to become Communist was the first country to ban communism. That was Russia. Then the example of Italy may be considered. In 1923 Mussolini, a renegade socialist, came to the aid of the monopoly capitalists in that country. He banned communism and it remained banned in Italy. There were islands of exile for those who were Communists or who had dangerous political thoughts. It was not until 1945 that the people of Italy had an opportunity of expressing themselves in their own way. In that year Mussolini was assassinated. Two years later a free election was held in Italy, and after 24 years, during whicli no election had teen held, 22 of them being years of fascist rule, the Italian people went to the polls. One out of every three Italians at that election voted Communist. In Germany nobody, apparently, destroyed communism more effectively than did Hitler. Yet, after Hitler's death the Communist forces became almost the strongest power in Germany. Why are we worried about the peace of Europe to-day? We are worried because the Communists, under Russian tutelage, are the most formidable menace to the peace of the western world. Communism is a danger throughout the world and it was created by the forces of capitalism. Do honorcommunism? If they do, they should first get rid of capitalism. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) honoured me with an interjection. He can go back to his Melbourne club, the most reactionary body in Australia, and get the plaudits and cheers of its members for the speeches that he and his colleagues make in this Parliament, but unless they do something to destroy the present basis of society, tliere will not be peace in this country. There will not be industrial peace in Australia and the anti-Australian forcei of revolutionary socialism will operate here as similar forces operate elsewhere. When the farmers produced the good things from the earth in the depression years and did not get a reasonable return for their produce, in their grinding poverty they had no reason to be satisfied with, tbesystem, of society in. which they lived. When, the workshops of the eountry were empty, when thelardiers of the nation were bare and the unemployed camps, and prisons were full , the Communist agitator' bad bis-, chance andiTOmmunism.changed, from, a political tkefiry into a red andi rareenous revokftionary blaze. It flamed for a time._ It began to flicker in the yeaj;s of theChifley Government because of ther improved social conditions whieli that government bmught about. The Labour Government distributed the: wealth of this community more equitably than it had ever been distributed before, as, is shown by the income tax laws of the nation. That was one of theretarding forces operating against those who wanted to stir up strife so that, they could impose their false philosophy aaid their alien ideology upon, the Australian people.. able member must deal with the bill. capitalism and communism. nothing about capitalism in the bill. that this country will not Be rid of communism until it gets rid of capitalism-, and I am replying to all sorts of people with all kinds of views and voices who seem to think that all that is necessary in our present society to ensure peace in industry and full production is to get rid of the Communists and communism. That is just arrant nonsense. I do not think that the Australian people will ever accept again the situations that existed in other times. The leadersof honourable members opposite will not be quite happy about the future of society if f u l l employThere are other people whose views are ment is not maintained. That is if G. J. Coles can be called a leader, if Sir Walter Massy-Greene, one of the representatives of the Collins House group can be termed a mentor, or if Arthur G. Warner, M.L.C, of Victoria can be called a leader. Honourable members opposite fear the growth of communism. I refer them to an article in the March-April issue of the Beview of the Institute of Public Affairs, Victoria in which they will read this sentence under the heading, "" Full Employment and! New Economics ""The invariable lesson of economio history is that thagreater the boom,, the deeper and moie disastrous the subsequent depression. It is. one wer would do well to heed in Australia just now. We have aheady Tet the post-waT boom iir Australia develop beyond thebounds of aU. reason: and common sense-. able member is gettingright away from the bill. to point out that people who say that the present system of society will collapse are worthy of being quoted here ? If you will bear with, me while I read two. more sentences, Mr Speaker, you will see that these people are really concerned. The quotation continuesWe should endeavour to. re-trace oursteps while there is yet time and time is running out. Without a decent measure of responsibility, we will fall again into depression and unemployment and in that eventuality. member is getting away from the bill altogether. this, sir? member tries to get away from my ruling I shall not hear him at all. ruling. But this is a sentence from the same statement which must throw fear into the hearts of every capitalist member in this Parliament. It is conceivable that we would vote ourselves into the economic tyranny of the totally planned state. That has a lot to do with the bill. Only people who are doing well out of modern society are concerned about protecting it. entitled to be heard when they talk about communism. They talk about it in no uncertain voice.

325,Mr Calwell,"Communism in thisI f people can be declared Communists for the things that they may say in advocacy of revolutionary socialism, surely people should be made responsible and punishable under this bill for the things that they may say in the guise of revolutionary fascism. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) had an article published in the Melbourne Herald last Saturday, in the course of which he statedUnder tlie bill, onus of proof is placed on the that a person should be given an effective parson declared, but the moment that person states on oath that he was not a Communist within the specified time, the onus of proof reverts to the Commonwealth. I think that the Minister will not claim that he has been misreported. leagues have made that plea here frequently during the la=t few months. The Minister is one of the few people left in the Government who can describe himself as a Liberal, and write the initial consonant with a small "" 1 "". If the quotation that I have read is the Government's view, and I hope that it is, I suggest that, instead of placing the onus of proof on a declared person absolutely, the fact of a declaration should be made prima facie evidence against him. That would result in the onus being cast uoon such person to negative the presumption. If the person concerned were able to produce evidence to negative the presumption, or declared on oath that he had not done anything to justify the declaration, the onus of proof should then shift back to the Crown. If the matter remained in doubt, the declaration would not be substantiated. If the Minister will incorporate in the bill a provision to give effect to my suggestion, or express his own thoughts in it instead of leaving it capable of the other interpretation that the onus is on the accused to prove his innocence absolutely, we may be making some progress towards protecting the liberty of the subject. I make another point. Before a declaration is made, the person concerned out of which communism grows and should be advised, so that he may have an opportunity to disprove the allegation that he should he declared. It wonld honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who be an awful thine if a person were presented with a copy of the Gazette, or were told that his name appeared in it as a potential or actual traitor, and that he had been declared under this legislation and could lodge an appeal if he wanted to clear himself. No principle of justice is observed when a person is declared, and is then told, ""Well, you have to clear yourself from the declaration "". The Minister should ask his colleagues to examine the proposals that I have outlined, particularly the point right of appeal, in addition to the opportunity to disprove the statements that had been made against him. If my suggestions are adopted, many people in this country, who want this bill, and who are not tied to any political party, may be satisfied that we are not what they think we are, namely, a people in a frenzy and fear who are doing things that we should not do. The Communist party, if suppressed, might go underground and take another name. It might call itself the ""Progressive Liberal party"", although tl^at wou!d be a contradiction in terms, hecause I have never known a Liberal who was progressive. The"" Retrogressive Liberal party "" would be more apt. The Communists might even salvage in the dust-bins of history and collect one of the numerous aliases that our political enemies have used. They might blossom forth one day as a kind of re-incarnated United Australia party, or Nationalist party. member for Griffith( Mr Berry) says too much, he may provide them with ideas. But they will function underground while the conditions of our society are propitious. If we want to protect our society and the security of this nation to-day and to-morrow, and if we desire to maintain our position in a world that is now fraught with many dangers for us, we must not hesitate to attack the evils that I have outlined at some length.

The threatens the democratic way of life. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) All these things are quite true. The hontook the stand that the Labour party orable member for Hoddle( Mr Cremean) would support the bill, because the Gowas most eloquent and effective in that vernment had obtained a mandate from strain; but if that alone was his reason the people at the last general election to for supporting this bill it still would introduce legislation of this kind.

Theredom of thought, and with his remarks on fore, his arguments must be treated as that subject. I agree, but this bill does not inconsistent and hypocritical. Another reason that honourable members Opposition ( Mr Chifley) gave instances opposite advance for voting for this bill, of revolutionary ideas which subsequently of which they strongly disapprove, is that had gained general acceptance. I remind they regard it as ineffective. Those the right honourable gentleman that the honorahle members are members of the Communist party, wherever it has seized federal legislature of this country.

Therefore, I contend that this bill is justified, and I proThey have even expressed fears that pose to show that the methods provided in the bill to which honourable members opposite take such great exception are also justified. A great song has been made about the liberty of the individual being threatened. I think that it was the Leader of the Opposition himself who said that in no other country had such extreme legislation been passed. remind him that in the United States of America, in the Constitution of which there is written a protection of the rights of the individual-it is commonly called the people's "" bill of rights""-legisla tion very similar to that now before this House is being enacted. The Hatch Act in the United States of America prevents any person who holds subversive ideas from being a government employee. Then there is the Taft-Hartley Act, which also deals with subversive activities in trade unionsa matter to which this bill directs attention. leaked out of the United States of America than any other country. in spite of the written guarantee in the American Constitution of the liberty of the individual, the people of the United States of America are facing the Communist problem in much the same way as this Government is facing it . There is no such guarantee in our Constitution, although the liberty of the individual is traditionally protected. In the United States of America also, there is the Voorhis Act, which requires the registration of subversive organizations. All these enactments are legal infringements of the liberty of the individual. Australia's problem is aimilar to that of the United States of America. By reason of our written Constitution we have a limitation on interference with the liberty of the individual, and for that reason we must justify any action that we take to restrict that liberty. If we can show-and I submit that we have done so-that the Communist party alone is a menace to this country, then we are justified under the defence power in introducing this legislation. Honourable members opposite have expressed fears that that provision will be abused and will be directed against trade unions. it may be direeted against the Labour party or other political parties. They should be well aware from their own experiences that the High Court of Australia is a jealous interpreter of the Constitution and its interpretation of it would not allow the misuse of the defencepower of the Commonwealth that honorI able members opposite have suggested is possible. The mere fact of claiming in an act of Parliament that its provisions are within the defence power does not automatically bring such legislation actually within tbe ambit of the defence power. Such legislation has to be bona fide and genuinely directed towards the use of the defence power. The fears of honourable members opposite are therefore entirely groundless. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) suggested that a great number of constitutional cases would come before the High Court as a resnlt of the passage of this legislation. I do not doubt that people will try to test the legislation, but the honourable member was entirely wrong when he said that only the Communist party would be entitled to test its constitutional validity. It would be open to any person or organization accused or declared under the act not only to take advantage of the right of appeal but also to test the constitutional validity of the act. That is a protection given by the Constitution that this Parliament could not, by its own action, withdraw. I turn now to the statements of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) who said that in his view the legislation was too sweeping and too general and that the Government of which he was a member had taken certain definite measures against communism that, be claimed, were examples of the right way in which to proceed in definite instances where communism was proving a menace to this country. He instanced the general coal strike last year, the rocket range case and the twosedition cases in which charges were laid under the Crimes Act against members of the Communist party. Those actions were successful. They dealt with particular cases as they arose. I suggest, however, that the",98,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
331,Mr Roseveab,Yet more secrets have,99,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading
332,Mr Freeth,"That may be, butright honourable gentleman has lost sight of the whole problem that we face. That problem is whether this country can stand many more coal strikes such as we faced last year. Can it stand the continuing and daily interference of the Communists who are infiltrating through all our democratic organizations ? He has lost sight of that aspect of it completely and he has also forgotten the air of respectability with which the Communist attempts to disguise his activities. Although specific instances do arise, they usually arise too late. It is time that we had on our statutebooks legislation for the taking of specific steps to cope with the general and continuing nature of the Communist problem. has asked why the bill does not provide that the ordinary procedure of the courts shall be followed. I should have thought that the reason why was fairly obvious. If it follows that unusual legislation is necessary it can only be because the legislation already on the statute-book bas proven ineffective. That legislation has, in fact, proven ineffective, although it may, as I have mentioned, be successful in isolated instances. Therefore, we must take the action of declaring people and by so doing prevent them from holding government employment and from holding an office in a trade union. We have in mind particularly key trade unions. In spite of all the successful prosecutions for which the right honourable member for Barton claims credit, the Communist party has continued to be active. Asi t is continuing with its work, some more drastic action has to be taken against it . What exactly is the liberty of the individual that is to be interfered with by this measure? First of all, the individual affected is to be denied the right to be employed by tbe government. I do not know whether any provision is written into, or understood in, our Constituton that any man has an undeniable right to be employed by the government. Is this provision of the bill, therefore, such a gross interference? Surely any government which is trying to carry on effectively bas a right, even without legislation, to dismiss any of its employees who are engaged in subversive activity. Tbis bill merely lays down specific instances in which the Government may dismiss employees who are members of the Communist party or of au organization affiliated with Communist activities. What is the other interference with the liberty of the subject? The bill simply debars a member of the Communist party from holding office in a trade union. If honourable members opposite had their way employment by a trade union would almost be government employment, because once eveiything else had been socialized the trade unions would be socialized too. No member of the community has any inherent right to hold either a government job or an office in The right honourable gentleman a trade union. That is the whole crux of this bill so far as the liberties of the individual are concerned. Suggestions have been made that the bill goes too far, because it goes further than naming and dissolving the Communist party. It must be admitted that if we are to take action against the Communist party we must follow its members in whatever direction they dissolve, because it has been our experience in the past that the tactics of the Communists that are laid down by the organization include an arrangement that the party should have simultaneously a legal and an illegal sphere of operations. So strenuously have the Communists tried to cloak their above-ground activities with an air of respectability that they have even that holy of holies, the Labour party. I understand that the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) can prodared, in the face of all the opposition that we have heard about from honourable members opposite, to attempt to penetrate duce documentary evidence that there has been a certain degree of association between the Communists and the Labour party. We accept the protestations of honourable members opposite that they loathe the Communists, but there can be no denying that the Communists have tried to penetrate the Labour party organization and to confuse the issues in the Labour party. When a Communist was elected to the Queensland Parliament he voted with the Labour party and he tried to tell the public that because he was a socialist and the members of the Labour party were also socialists they were all pursuing the same objective. knows that that is not correct. its members tbe Labour party has in the past associated itself with Communists. That is indisputable. I do not say that the Labour movement as a whole approves of such an association, but we had an example only recently when the Peace Council was declared by the Australian Labour party to be a Communist organization. Yet a member of the Senate said that it is quite a harmless body. The air of respectability with which it clothes itself dupes other people who cannot see where is it leading. I propose to say something now concerning the onus of proof about which honourable members opposite have made a great deal of fuss. Mr ""WABD -Put a bit of ginger into it ! ber for East Sydney( Mr Ward) can be relied on to supply all the ginger that is necessary. Because the bill places the onus of proof upon the individual, it has been alleged that it transgresses a fundamental principle of English law. The fact is that since the eighteenth century one principle of common law, which has not needed the support of any statute, has been that when the facts of a particular matter are peculiarly within the knowledge of one party the onus of proof lies fairly upon him. A person who has been "" declared"" under this legislation should know better than any one else whether he has been a member of an association that has engaged in activities connected with the Communist party. He should know, too, whether he himself has been engaged in dangerous activities. Of course, special statutes have continuously imposed an onus of proof of innocence in certain cases where the facts of particular matters are peculiarly within the knowledge of individuals. Examples of that are. supplied by the Omciai Secrets Aet a^d the Larreny Act in England, and by the Criminal Codes in Australia, as well as by similar acts of the various States, most of which require thnt a person who has been, charged with having in his possession goods reasonably suspected of having been stolen shall bear the onus of proof of his innocent possession of the goods. ilfr. Ward interjecting, honourable member for East Sydney would be very happy if he realized that if he went walking abroad at night with a screw driver and a penknife in his pocket he could be arrested for having housebreaking implements in his possession, and the onus of proof would be on him to establish his lawful purpose. Where a particular type of offence is of unusual danger to the community it has been the habit of legislatures to place the onus of proof of innocence on an accused person. This bill is different, however, in that an individual who is affected by it will not be charged with having committed any offence, but will merely be "" declared "". However, where a person is charged under the penal provisions of the measure, as for example, with carrying on the activities of the Communist party, he will be prosecuted in the ordinary way, and he will be given the benefit of the doubt by tbe courts until the prosecution establishes its case. As Mr Justice Isaacs said in the case quoted by the right honourable member for Barton and also by the Minister for Hie general requirement of the law is that the onus of proof is placed where the interests of justice are best served. If honourable members opposite realized that fact they would recognize that there is no grave injustice in placing a certain cnus on a person or an association that is declared under the bill. In the debate that has taken place there has been a certain amount of loose talk about the onus of proof resting upon an accused person. All that any persbn or association that is "" declared"" under the bill will be required to do will be to make out a prima facie case that he or it should not have been declared under the bill. The appellant will be required to bring a certain amount of evidence of innocence, and if, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence is credible and the appellant has made out a case, the Government must either show its full hand and give him an opportunity to rebut it, or the court will accept the appellant's evidence and allow",99,Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 Second Reading

'Certain wide responsibilities are placed upon tbe Executive by the bill. The Executive has the responsibility of deciding whether a person or an organization is engaged in activities that are prejudicial to the defence of the country; but it has always been the responsibility of the Executive to make decisions of that kind. In this connection Mr Justice Isaacs statedThe nation has tlie strongest right to trust its executive officers, who are administering the law, to be both vigilant and careful. Honourable members opposite have imputed all sorts of improper motives to the Government for having introduced this legislation. However, if we are to discuss it intelligently we must realize that whatever Government is in power it must be presumed that it will do its best to administer the law fairly. Of course, the present Government has also been accused of all sorts of improper motives in introducing the Social Services Consolidation Bill to extend child endowment payments, and other recent bills, but I suggest to honourable members opposite that they do not do their cause any good by making such suggestions, because, in doing so, they expose the lines on which they would be likely to act if they again attained power. adjourned. COAL STRIKE: AUSTRALIAN ""WORKERS That the House do now adjourn. [11.13] I desire to bring to the notice of the House the fact that certain statements have been made concerning the Australian Workers Union. On several occasions a statement has been made by people who should know better that the Chifley Administration used the army to mine coal when the Australian Workers Union had offered to supply labour to work the mines. That statement does not contain a scintilla of truth but in relation to the Australian Workers Union is completely false. ment ? able members are aware, I am not permitted to say who made the statement, but it was made by a person who should have known better; in fact, I go so far as to say that he did know better. I wish to clear the good name of the Australian Workers Union, of which, I am proud to say. I have been an executive oflicer continuously for the last eleven years. 1 Lave held the highest administrative office in that union in South Australia, and at present I am a member of its federal executive, and federal vicepresident. I have indicated the positions that I hold in the union in order to support the statements that I am about to make in relation to that union's att! tudo towards the use of its members as strike breakers and to indicate that my statements bear the imprimatur of authority. The Australian Workers Union, at no time, discussed the question of supplying labour to work in the coal mines or open-cuts in New South Wales, or anywhere else, during the last coal strike. If such a proposal had been mad< to the federal executive I am as certain as .1 stand here that it would not have agreed to it under and conditions. The Australian Workers Union has a truly Australian outlook, and would never be prepared to allow its members to act as strike-breakers or industrial scabs. the army? talking about the army.

Therefore, Mr Dougherty has been slandered by people who have carried out their nefarious attacks under privilege. If they had not enjoyed that immunity their statements would have rendered them liable to a charge of criminal libel. Not one of those persons is prepared to say openly that the general secretary of the Australian Workers Union offered to the Prime Minister of the day to supply labour from the Australian Workers Union for the purpose that I have indicated. Such a statement is a deliberate lie. Yet, the Liberal party in its propaganda has stated repeatedly that the Australian Workers Union was prepared to supply labour for that purpose, but that the Government would not accept the offer. to the Australian Workers Union. does; because any trade union that is prepared to allow its members to go as strike breakers into any industry in which the employees are on strike, is not worthy of the traditions of Australian trade unionism. The Australian Workers Union is the last trade union in this country that would ever stand for such treachery. wish to refer to a matter relating to social services that has been brought to my notice by many of my constituents. I am sure that other honourable members have received communications from their constituents upon the same subject. I shall outline the problem by reading the following letter which I received from a police officer who has a family:The facts are that on the 15th July last year a claim for an invalid pension was heard before the pension magistrate here, Mr R. P. Furmage, in respect to my son, Donal Alfred1 , born the l l t h October, 1932. Don is a "" blue baby"" and will never be able to work and will be an invalid for the short time he will be with us. I took him to the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne last October with a view to having an operation performed to try and give him a bit longer life, but after a week in there, one of the foremost surgeons in Aushe was a hopeless case and that nothing could be done for him. of a kind that I have seen frequently, and against which I again protest. It is as follows:The application for the pension was refused on the ground ""that he was adequately maintained by his relatives"", meaning, of course, me. The letter continuesThisI think is most unfair after all the years I have contributed to the Social Services Tax, and if I had not taken care of my earnings, and had nothing he would have no doubt received the pension. After the age of sixteen years he is not an allowable deduction from income tax, although he is wholly maintained by me. Two doctor's certificates were lodged with the claim that he will never be able to work owing to his heart condition. The writer of the letter has asked me to take up this matter. I have received similar letters from invalid young people. It is a tragedy that young persons between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years should be pronounced unfit ever to do any work. Their maintenance throws a tremendous strain upon their parents, who muet also incur considerable expenditure in respect of medicines and medical treatment for their afflicted offspring. I believe that the social services legislation should be extended to cover these young persons. Probably there are many hundreds of them in Australia. They should receive invalid pensions unconditionally, irrespective of their parent's incomes. In most instances, their parents are now earning reasonable incomes, but later as the result of an economic blizzard, their incomes may be reduced. I see no reason why special provision should not be made for young persons from, say, sixteen years of age who have been certified by doctors as being permanently disabled, either mentally or physically, and I urge the Government to consider making the necessary financial provision in the budget and extending the scope of the social services legislation.",102,Union Armed Forces Invall D Pensions

348,"Tralia, Mr Officer","Brown, informed me thatLabour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [11.26] I listened with, interest to what was said by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr we may well ask ourselves what has Duthie). I represent in this chamber the Minister for Social Services, but I have no detailed knowledge of the facts that the honourable gentleman presented or of the policy that underlies the decision that was made. I shall ensure that my colleague is informed of the comments that have been made and the facts that have been presented. Doubtless, he will examine the matter sympathetically and consider whether anything can be done to meet the situation. I do not think I should allow the very remarkable speech, if I may so -describe it, of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) to pass without comment. Through the .years the Australian trade union movement has developed a fine tradition of solidarity and comradeship, and I should be the last person to criticize that tradition. Properly applied, it is a splendid Australian attribute. But some persons who claim to represent the trade union movement have developed a perverted sense of loyalty. They appear to have a completely wrong conception of the values that should be applied in matters that involve the constitutional authority of a democratic government and that affect the best interests of Australia. There eould be no more striking illustration of that perverted sense of loyalty than day. No objection was raised by the that which was exhibited to-night by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. He referred to the general coal strike and claimed it as a virtue that not only was a great Australian trade union with a fine democratic tradition not asked to assist the Government that was then in power to break a Communist-inspired and unlawful strike but that if it had been asked to do so, it would, according to his solemn assurance, most certainly have rejected the request. That was an extraordinary statement for any member of this Parliament to make. It would have been extraordinary if it had been made by a trade union official acting in his official capacity, but when it is made by a man with a long experience of trade unions who also has the responsibility of being a member of the democratic Parliament from which the Government of this country is chosen, become of the democratic tradition in Australia and what hope there is for democratic government. A Labour government came to the conclusiona conclusion that it publicized by public statements and advertisements throughout the length and breadth of Australia-that the general coal strike was Communist-inspired and directed, and that it was a treacherous strike. It was regarded so seriously by the government of the day that special emergency legislation was introduced, under which the fund? of trade unions were frozen and icrius of imprisonment of officials of trade unions were stipulated under certain conditions. The Government also called upon the armed forces of the Commonwealth to assist in maintaining coal production although that action was contrary to the printed platform of the party from which the members of the Government were drawn. In circumstances such as those, what duty is owed to the government by citizens of the Commonwealth? Whether they be members of trade unions or whether they be persons who, although not members of trade unions, regard themselves as true Australians, the duty of all citizens is to give the best support that they can to the government of the members of the armed forces, whose services were utilized, although the job of acting as strike breakers must have been just as distasteful to them as it would have been to members of the Australian Workers Union. They sought no part in that struggle and they had no desire to act in that way against fellow Australians, but they were asked by the government of their own country, in a crisis that had been stigmatized as Communist-inspired, to assist in maintaining essential services. I say that any man with a true sense of public spirit and patriotism, whatever his occupation, who was asked at that time to assist the government in maintaining essential services should have acceded to",103,Union Armed Forces Invall D Pensions
349,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister for the request. I do not accept what was said by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as a true reflection of the attitude of the rank-and-file members of the Australian Workers Union, which is a patriotic trade union. If it has stood for anything, it has stood for the determination of industrial disputes by the peaceful method of arbitration. It has supported arbitration throughout Australia, and has thereby earned the respect of the Australian community. I say that the honourable gentleman slandered a body of his fellow Australians when he said that, if a Labour government, in a crisis of that kind, had appealed to the members of the Australian Workers Union to help it to maintain essential services, they would have rejected the request. The honourable gentleman may speak for the oflicials of the union. As I have said, the officials of some trade unions have developed a perverted sense of loyalty. Their first loyalty is to their country and their second loyalty is to the democratically elected government of that country. Before they place their loyalty as trade union officials first, they should re-examine their standards of value and decide where their true loyalty should lie. I should not have intervened in this debate had it not been for the utter rubbish that was uttered by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt). The honourable gentleman may have a knowledge of some subjects, but he certainly has no knowledge of trade unionism. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr palatable. The honourable meinber for Clyde Cameron) merely stated the fact that his organization was not asked to participate in the dispute to which he referred, and he then said that, in his opinion, if the request had been made it would have been rejected. I believe he is more qualified to judge the opinion of members of the Australian Workers Union than is the Minister, who probably has never been a member of a trade union. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has been a prominent official of that organization for very many years. [ know how disappointed honourable memnot. propose to comment on tlie remarks bers opposite must have been that the of the honourable member for East Sydney memhers of the Australian Workers( Mr Ward) because, as usual, he has in Union were not asked to work the open this debate, as he invariably does in every cut mines. Listening to honourable members opposite and not knowing their record, one would think that they were the champions of the trade unions.. Over the years anti-Labour governments have direeted legislation of the most repressive kind against the trade unions. They are now contemplating further action to smash the trade unions. They wanted the members of the Australian Workers Union to work the open-cut mines for the sole purpose of driving a wedge between the workers in the coal-mining industry and workers in other industries. The workers are not likely to be misled by tbe statements of the Minister for Labour and National Service. They are much more likely to take notice of their own trusted oflicials. I prefer to believe what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said about this matter than to accept the word of the Minister, who, during his life time, has never been associated with a trade union. I could cite instance after instance in which anti-Labour governments have used strikebreakers in what were purely industrial disputes, not because they believed that the safety of the nation was at stake, but because they wanted to smash the unions. That is their record throughout the years. It is sheer rot for the Minister to say that ho believes in the great traditions and the solidarity of the trade union movement. Anti-Labour governments, of which some Ministers of the present Government were members, have used coercion of all kinds to compel the workers to undertake tasks which they regarded as unHindmarsh was quite justified in stating tbe facts of this matter. I do not intend to go over tbe whole sorry history of the coal strike. 1 merely rose to support the honourable member for Hindmarsh who honestly told us what he knows to be the facts merely for the purpose of protecting the members of his organization from the unwarranted attack that had been made upon them by a member of this Government.",104,Union Armed Forces Invall D Pensions

351,Mr Gullett (Henty) [11.38],"I dodebate in wbich he participates, made a bitter and deliberate attempt to stir up further ill feeling in the community. That is his stock-in-trade in this House as it always has been outside this House. 1 propose to refer to one aspect of the matter that has been raised by tbe honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Glyde Cameron). In particular the honourable member characterized as strike-breakers and scabs those who were called upon to work in -New South Wales open-cut coal ui.'ues during the coal strike last year. In ordering the troops of this country, who fairness I sliould remind the House that some one had to do that work at that time. The strike took place only a short while ago and we all remember the state of affairs that resulted from it. We remember the terrible plight of the people of Sydney as the result of that strike. Not only was the entire population of -Sydney put to great inconvenience and forced to suffer grave hardships, not only was unemployment daily growing so rapidly that a state of total unemployment would have been quickly reached, but also the hospitals were forced to refuse to accept patients, most of whom were workers. In a hundred and one ways life in Sydney had become intolerable. It is the most terrible nonsense for honourable members opposite to claim that they are the representatives of the workers. Do they know anything of the inconvenience and suffering inflicted on the workers in Sydney as the result of that strike? regard the sufferings of the people of that city as a matter of no account? No work was heing done in the northern coal mines of New South Wales. As the result of the very carefully organized planning of the Communist controlled miners' federation, there were no reserves of coal. Almost immediately after the strike began ovonev was in chaos. Someone had to produce eoal ancl it was clearly the Government's task to provide the means by which coal could be won. Surely the most obvious persons to select for that task were the members of the Australian Workers Union. Members of that organization were still working at the Leigh Creek mine in South Australia and in certain mines on the south coast of New South Wales. No indication had been given by the organization that its members were not prepared to undertake the work. They were the obvious choice and we expected the Government to ask them to undertake the work. In stead, the Government took a most contemptible and cowardly step. It did not ask the members of the armed forces to undertake the work; it ordered them to do so because they happened to be under its control. In my view the Government was guilty of the most disgraceful act in. are drawn largely from the rank and file of the people, to go into the industrial areas and to undertake work which should have been undertaken by the members of tbe Australian Workers Union. When the Government was faced with the choiceof asking the members of the Australian Workers Union to undertake the work or of directing members of its armed forces to do so, it placed political party consideration first and the interests of the country last. Every honourable memberknows that as the result of its action,, great bitterness was engendered in theminds of many people towards the members of the armed forces. It has never been the practice in British countries tocall in troops to undertake work that theworkers refuse to undertake. I very much resent the application of the terms "" strike breakers "" and "" scabs "" to thf se soldiers who worked in the mines, not rf their own volition, hut under compulsion by theDo they Government. They were, in reality, the benefactors of the community. They were the scapegoats of the Government which exercised its authority over them, as an easy eolution of a problem which it did not have the guts to face squarely.. That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the-affirmative.
