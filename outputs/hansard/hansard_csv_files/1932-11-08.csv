24,Motions (By Mr Lyons) Agreed To,"I have received from the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The desirability of imposing conditions on Commonwealth grants for unemployment relief, requiring that, not less than the basic wage shall be paid, whether the works carried out are fully or partially paid for from Commonwealth moneys"". Five honourable 7tiembers having risen to support the motion. Question proposed. feel impelled to bring under the notice of honourable members a matter associated with the disbursement of Commonwealth moneys for relief purposes, in connection with which the Government is not specifying proper conditions and wages. As a result of the amendment of the 1932 Loan Act, a committee was set up in South Australia to assist the Commonwealth and State Governments to expend these moneys on work of a profitable and useful nature, in a manner that would afford the maximum of relief to our unemployed. Upon this body the Commonwealth Government has two representatives. Recently, it. applied to the Commonwealth Government for a grant of £20,000, to be used in subsidizing graziers, farmers, and others engaged in primary industry in South Australia, in the employment of those now out of work. It is hoped that primary producers, by this means, may be enabled to undertake work which they would not otherwise put in hand for some time. The grant is to be made on condition that it does not result in displacing a party to a plan which, if put into any one now employed. The Commonwealth, it is proposed, shall subsidize farmers or graziers to the extent of 15s. a week for each person employed, and the. employer, if in a position to do so, shall provide another 10s. a week. Suitable board and lodgings are to be provided for the workers, and the conditions of the workers? compensation, shall apply to them. If this system is introduced, a dangerous precedent will be created. It should be laid down that the workers shall receive the basic wage. Probably the Prime Minister will say that most of those who will find employment under this scheme are youths, but I disagree with him in that. Naturally, the first demand by employers will be for mature men who have had experience in the work to be done. If men of that class are employed, it is reasonable and just that they should, receive the basic wage fixed by the Arbitration. Court. The money is not to be spent on sustenance, but will represent wages for work done. Naturally, I approve of any proposal for providing work for those in need of it, but surely the great volume of unemployment at present existing in Australia should not be made an excuse for breaking down the working conditions which have been established-for the protection of the people. This is how the proposed plan will work out: Each man will receive 15s. a week from the Commonwealth grant, besides his board and lodging. According to the last declaration of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, board and lodging is estimated to be worth £1 3s. 5d. a week, so that the worker will receive value to the extent of £1 ISs. 5d. from the Commonwealth subsidy, and his board and lodging. It has been _ suggested that the employers should contribute another 10s. a week, which would bring the total wages or their equivalent up to £2 8s. 5d. a week. The Commonwealth basic wage is £2 17s. 6d., and the basic wage for South Australia is £3 3s., so that the workers employed under the scheme will receive 9s. I d . a week less than the Commonwealth basic wage, and 14s. 7d. a week less than the State basic wage. The Commonwealth should not be operation, will result in breaking down existing working conditions. However desirable it may be to assist primary and secondary industries, we should adhere to the principle that the workers must be fairly paid.

27,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"provided by the Commonwealth Parliament was not providing employment. Some municipalities which objected to paying less than the basic wage asked for permission to pay the full rates fixed by the court. Then the employers asked the Federal Arbitration Court to set aside the award. rates in respect of relief works, so that they could legally pay less than the basic wage; alternatively, the court was asked to award a lower rate for relief works. The court, realizing that the object of Parliament was being defeated, and that relief works were merely being substituted for the ordinary refused the application, and insisted that the basic wage should be paid, and that the margins for skill should be observed; that if carpenters or plumbers were employed at their trade on relief work they must receive the rates to which they were entitled under awards. After months of discord, the Legislative Assembly of Victoria legislated to provide that basic rates should apply to all relief works; where a person was not employed for the full week he should be paid per day or per hour not less than the rate prescribed by award. The-Legislative Council at first refused to pass this measure, but after the bill had been sent up a second time by the lower House, it was passed. result is that at last some real benefit is being derived from the relief expenditure. The workers are getting the prescribed minimum rates for the work they are doing, and are not taking the places of regular municipal employees and others by whom this work would be done in ordinary circumstances. The inducement for municipalities and private employers to have their ordinary works undertaken by relief labour at lower rates of pay has been removed. The ordinary works are carried out under the usual conditions, and the relief employment is additional. Another reason why the basic wageshould be paid is that most relief employment is rationed; a man may get work for only three or four days a week. If a job is distant from the city, a man may be employed for two or three weeks continuously, but he is then put off for an extended period. Underthese conditions rationed employees do not average even Air. Holloway. approximately the basic wage. If the additional money granted by the Commonwealth may be used as the local authorities or private employers think fit, the rates of pay become so low, especially when the work is rationed, that a man's earnings amount to little more than the dole. The man who accepts relief work forfeits the dole, and men have to think seriously whether they will continue on the dole or accept employment at rates which amount to little more. Relief expenditure upon the conditions obtaining in South Australia will not yield any real benefit to the community. We might as well programmes, expend the whole of the money on maintenance and doles if we do not insist on at least the minimum wage being paid in connection with relief works. The Commonwealth Government should not allow itself to be made a party to the violation of awards of the federal court and deternfinations of wages boards. The minimum wage of £3 3s. in Victoria and £2 17s. 6d. in South Australia is low enough-in fact, with broken time it is too low-and the rate should not be further lowered on the plea that relief is being given to the needy. The Commonwealth Government should suggest to the State authorities that, in order that this expenditure shall yield the maximum of value to the community, at least the basic wage shall be paid to the relief The workers. M,r. LYONS (Wilmot-Prime Minister) [4.5] -When the original provision was made for the relief of the unemployed during the winter months, it was decided that the money made available should be expended by the States with the assistance of advisory bodies, on each of which the Commonwealth would have two representatives. This Parliament felt that the best way to give the relief needed was to allow the States to have a free hand, and to apply their own laws in respect of the expenditure of this money.

29,Mr Lyons,"The State had exable by the Commonwealth was therefore utilized for the purpose. The Commonwealth is not expending the money directly, as in New South ""Wales. It is expended on a £1 for £1 basis. Had we laid down conditions at the commencement of the scheme, there would certainly have been much greater delay in beginning the works, and giving relief to the unfortunate unemployed. In order to begin the work as soon as possible, we thought it better to make the money available immediately, and to appoint to each of the State bodies two Commonwealth representatives, who have to approve of works before they are put in hand. That permits the States to carry on relief work unhampered by any conditions imposed by the Commonwealth, except that the money has to be expended on reproductive work, and on work giving relief to the unemployed. wealth representatives advised to insist upon the payment of award rates? conditions at all. This expenditure is under the control of the States, and if there is a breach of a State law, the remedy must be found by the State itself. If it were demonstrated that a State was taking advantage of the circumstances of t the unemployed, by imposing unfair conditions, then the Commonwealth would have to reconsider its position. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( MrI see no reason, in the circumstances, for Holloway) emphasized the fact that there was no need for the Commonwealth to lay down conditions respecting the expenditure of moneys for the relief of the unemployed in Victoria, because the conditions laid down by the Victorian Parliament were entirely satisfactory. There is no reason why the government or parliament of each State should not deal with these relief funds as it thinks fit, because it is responsible to its people the Loan Council is for works to be carfor the expenditure of the money. would emphasize the fact that in tlie case of South Australia only a small proportion of the total amount expended on relief work was made available by the Commonwealth. Money was made available in that State for the purpose of assisting the farmers, because we recognized that the majority of them would not be able to carry on without some relief. That work was of a reproductive character, aud the grant made by the Commonwealth Government to enable it to be carried out was comparatively small. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said that the Victorian Parliament has insisted upon the basic wage being paid to those employed upon relief work, but that the men employed do not get the ful l weekly wage, because of the work being rationed. On such works one batch of men would be employed for a certain period and then another batch would take its place. Such conditions could not be applied to the work that is being carried out in South Australia. The men are sent to farms. They receive their board and lodging and, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh has pointed out, an additional amount of 10s. a week. That work cannot be rationed. It is infinitely better for a man to have that class of work and a full weekly payment than to receive the basic wage for two days of the week. That class of work is of a more reproductive character than many other works upon which the money made available by the Commonwealth is being expended. I speak with some experience, because in New South Wales, by reason of our desire to push on with works, many of those undertaken were approved on the bare basis of providing relief for the unfortunate unemployed. interfering with the conditions laid down by South Australia. There is no necessity for the Commonwealth Government to make any further grant to the States, for some time, at any rate, for the relief of the unemployed, because they have sufficient money available and plans prepared to provide employment on a bigger scale than before. The expenditure that has been authorized and provided for by I ried out by the States, for which they are entirely responsible. The Commonwealth does not share in any way in that responsibility, and therefore has no right to impose conditions upon the expenditure of the money by the States. Buti f it can be demonstrated that advantage is being taken of the unemployed, and that they are being deprived of conditions to which they are justly",18,Unemployment Relief Formal Motion For Adjouenment

That is the underSteps were taken to prevent the State standing upon which the legislation was passed by this Parliament, and there can be no alteration of the arrangements until the Commonwealth is asked to give further assistance to the States for the relief of the unemployed. -The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) referred to the fact that in each State advisory committees had been set up to deal with the expenditure of the moneys made available by the Commonwealth for the relief of the unemployed. It may interest him to know that in New South Wales, under the direction of the advisory committee there, certain sums were allocated to municipal councils, for the assistance of the unemployed, and that Ave can bring before the House, if necesobjection to the breaking down of the sary, evidence to show that, in some instances, the relief work was distributed among certain residents in the municipalities-concerned who owed rates to the councils, and that the amount so owing was deducted from their wages. I admit that there is an obligation on the part of every person, who can do so, to pay. his rates, but I feel certain that it was never standards, and that his policy to-day is intended that municipal councils should deduct debts owing to them from moneys given to them to be expended for the relief of the unemployed. suggesting that preference was given to those who owed rates? tible action; the more contemptible because the unemployed so treated were not informed, when engaged for this work, that arrears of rates would be deducted from their payments. This relief work was given under false pretences, and the action of the municipalities concerned has shown what methods some authorities are prepared to. adopt in order to collect what is owing to them by ratepayers who are not in a position to meet their obligations. The Prime Minister, when a member of the Scullin Government, had experience in connection with the expenditure of Commonwealth money for the relief of the unemployed, and he knows that no difficulty arose in respect of the payment, not merely of the basic wage, but of award rates on relief works. Governments from lowering the then existing standards. He will remember the discussions that took place in the Cabiuet, and the methods that were employed to compel tbe States to pay at least the basic wage. We have been told frequently in. this House, that the man who pays is entitled to call the tune, and there is no donbt that, as the Commonwealth provides these funds, it should call the tune by insisting that the States, in expending this money, should observe the Arbitration Court awards. The argument of the Prime Minister, that the expenditure of this money is subject to the State laws, and his statement that he is anxious to leave the States unhampered, lead us to believe that he has little or no basic wage provision. not providing any of the money that is being expended by it. position worse. We are, therefore, entitled to conclude that the Prime Minister has no desire to preserve existing similar to that which we strenuously fought against at the general elections of 1928, when we contended that it was the desire of our opponents to throw the workers into the open economic ring. That seems to be still their desire to-day. It may seem enough to offer as excuse for what is beinij done in the difficulties of the rural industries, and to say that the farmers must be assisted; but we must not be unmindful of the difficulties of the workers. They have obligations to meet, and probably many of those who have been given employment under this scheme have to contribute to the maintenance of members of their families who are unemployed. The Government should, therefore, be expected'to give a definite direction in this matter.

If that could be done by the previous Government it can be done by this Government if it has a real desire to maintain the basic wage; but I do not think that it has such a desire. Many people in Australia must realize by this time that the process of cutting down the mean standards of living that now prevail in Australia can never restore prosperity to this country; but, unfortunately, there seems to be a single-track mind on this subject in the Government aud among its supporters. Their desire appears to be to reduce the toilers in industry to the lowest possible level.

Reference has been made in this debate to certain municipalities. 1 know from experience that the municipalities of South Australia, which will be granted a portion of this amount for expenditure, will pay award rates. The council with which I am connected has applied for. and obtained, some of this money, and in the spending of it will observe award rates. Personally, I am not favorable to the payment of wages below award rates; but I believe that this matter can be safely left to the Unemployment Council of South Australia.

Question resolved in the negative. ter and Treasurer) [4.25] I move That this bill be now read a second time. The object of this measure is to give effect to the announcement in the Speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General on the occasion of the opening of Parliament early this year that< J ii order to reduce parliamentary expenditure it is proposed to introduce legislation to suspend the operation of the Committee of Public Accounts Act and the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. If it should be thought desirable to have a parliamentary inquiry into any matters, it would be possible to constitute a select committee for that purpose. It is anticipated that the suspension of the operations of the Committee of ing of approximately £3,000 per annum. That estimate is based upon the actual expenditure of the committee during a normal year. In 1930-31, the last complete year that the committee operated, its expenditure amounted to £3,168.. The Government has introduced this bill because it realizes the urgent need for stringent economy in parliamentary and governmental expenditure. Since the Committee of Public Accounts was first constituted in 1913, it has rendered valuable service to the Common-' wealth and reported on many importantsubjects ; but its continuance is not justified under existing conditions. As was pointed out in the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General, should the necessity arise for a parliamentary inquiry into any matter, it would be possible under the Standing Orders for Parliament to constitute a select committee for the purpose; but such a committee would be a temporary, and not a permanent, body. This bill contains a provision to the effect that if the time should come when it is thought desirable to reconstitute the committee it can be done by both Houses of the Parliament",20,Unemployment Relief Formal Motion For Adjouenment

42,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime Minisresolving to l if t the suspension of the act. The introduction of another amending bill would not be necessary. As honourable members know, the Public Accounts Committee has not been operating for some time, but it is considered advisable that this bill should be passed in order definitely to suspend the operation of the act. operation as at present, it might be necessary to make certain appointments. If necessity arises for the reconstitution of the committee, the provision in this bill to enable that to be done could be brought into effect. I commend the bill to the House and trust that its provisions will be generally acceptable. The official Opposition is of the opinion that the introduction of this bill was unnecessary. Accounts has ""already been suspended, and as there was no protest from any party in the House at the non-election of a new committee, the position could well be left where it is. I wish to pay my tribute of appreciation to the various committees of Public Accounts which have operated since the original act was passed in 1913. Most valuable work has been performed through this committee, and many economies and considerable savings have resulted from its deliberations. valuable advice offered by various committees to different governments has, on many occasions, been accepted to the great benefit of the taxpayers generally. If the committee is reconstituted, think it would be advisable to amend the principal act to provide, as in the case of the Public Works Committee Act, that it may inquire only into matters definitely referred to it by the Parliament. In this connection I draw attention to the following quotation from the report of the Joint Select Committee on Public Accounts which was brought up on the 20th May, 1932:Tlie procedure followed in the case of the Works Committee of submitting a motion to Parliament referring a subject for investigation should be pursued i/ii regard to the Accounts Committee, as this formal sanction by Parliament strengthens the power of the committee, and also affords Parliament an opportunity of deciding on the advisability or otherwise of conducting an inquiry. I feel that such a committee as that with which we are now dealing could give valuable assistance to Parliament in connection with budgetary matters and recurring items of government expenditure generally, for it could devote more time to the consideration of such matters than can honourable members individually, and any advice which it offered would have a definite value. If such a committee were authorized to report upon these matters, it would be possible for us to obtain a more satisfactory explanation of various aspects of public accounts than can be had at present. The considered opinion of the official Opposition is that the passing of this bill is unnecessary from any point of view. The saving in expenditure to which the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has referred, is already being made through the nonappointment of the committee. So long The Committee of Public as Parliament chooses to refrain from the making of such appointments the committee must remain inactive, and the savings will continue to be made. issue is whether the proposal to suspend the operation of the Committee of Public Accounts will or will not effect economy. If it will, every honourable member should support the bill. We claim that we have balanced the budget. We have. But that is largely due to the fact that we have The enjoyed a moratorium suspending interest payments. We must grapple with and bring about a substantial reduction of parliamentary expenditure. We have piled up an immense internal debt, and I have a staggering floating loan that will be passed on to posterity. This is, however, the most convenient method of finance during a period of depression such as this. It is, therefore, for the Government to explore every probable avenue of economy. Those honourable members who suggest that this committee should remain in operation to inquire into parliamentary expenditure are rather going round in a circle; that would be inquiring about themselves. We have an Auditor-General to make the necessary investigations, but, unfortunately, his recommendations have been ignored for years. I have drawn attention to certain matters which need investigation, subsidies on air mail con-",21,Committee Of Public Accounts Bill Second Reading

The suspension of the operation of the Committee of Public Accounts will effect u saving; therefore, let us support this bill without any waste of time. -The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) referred to the work that was done by this committee in the past, and stated that although the committee is not now functioning and does not cost the country anything, it would be wise to suspend its operation.

Government. there must be some other reason for the bill. Perhaps the Government is simply indulging in kite-flying. Is this being done to enable it to substantiate its claim that it is making every endeavour to reduce parliamentary expenditure? Really, no economy is effected by the' suspension of the operation of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Public Works Committee; no alteration is being made, for things will be the same in the future as they have. been for the past twelve months. This committee will not function unless the Government desires it to do so. If the Government does not wish it to function there is no need for the bill, which merely seeks to delude the public into believing that economies are being effected when nothing of the sort is the case. The Government says that it is essential that the operation of this committee should be suspended and I supposethat it has good reason for doing so. There is no work for the Committee of Public Accounts to do, and I see no reason why it should be kept in operation. I admit that in the past it has been useful in recommending grants for South Australia and for Tasmania, but I see no need for its retention in the future. I cannot imagine that the Government would be foolish enough to ask honourable members to waste time in discussing a bill which was introduced without good tain a good deal of doubt as to the wisdom of suspending the operation of the Committee of Public Accounts, particularly for an indefinite period. Under this protion until each House of the Parliament resolves that it shall cease. I believe that there is scope for useful work to be done by a Finance Committee, apart from the Executive. I have not been a member of Parliament for long, but I understand that in the past excellent work has been done by the Committee of Public Accounts. There is certainly wide scope by a body representing all sections in the House, and not dominated by the ExecuOther Parliaments have their In those circumstances Finance Committees, and this proposal to abolish our Committee of Public Accounts is rather an innovation. The House of Commons has a permanent standing committee, and an additional committee to inquire into public accounts. It is admitted that, in recent years, there has been a tendency on the part of parliaments to lose control of public finance. Finance is the essence of government, and if this Parliament is to do its duty properly, it needs to maintain a body to exercise independent supervision of the country's finances. In practice, honourable members pay little concern tosuch matters. I remind honourable members of the way the Estimates for the current year were forced through by means of all-night sittings It saves a lot of unnecessary talk being indulged in merely for publicity purposes.",22,Committee Of Public Accounts Bill Second Reading

They prefer resorting to the forcing tactics of all-night sittings, rather than take the trouble of thoroughly investigating, these matters. However, I am inclined to agree with the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) that the ;public discussion of these problems does not achieve much. The proper method -is to have independent inquiry by a body -such as the Committee of Public -Accounts. We certainly have an Auditor<Gcneral, but the field that he has to cover of Representatives consists of 75 memis too comprehensive to allow him to give his attention to all. details.

It is customary when the Estimates are before the Committee for honourable members to indulgein a good deal of criticism, and then to forget about them for a year. I am not criticizing the Government. I am aware that Ministers have a tremendous amount of work to do, and cannot personally investigate all the details of their departments. The result is that departments are run by departmental heads. Promineuce is given to that trend in Great Britain by Lord He wart, in his book The New Despotism. There is a general demand for economy in government. The latest figures indicate that yearly, our Federal and State Governments are absorbing about £100,000,000 of the national wealth, which has shrunk from something likt£650,000.000 £400,000,000. How can any country revive under such conditions? The public demand economy in government expenditure, and we should see that it is practised on every possible occasion. member to connect his remarks with the bill. governments in themselves do not practise the economy about which we hear so much. .It is necessary that there should be some body, such as the Committee of Public Accounts, to exercise restraint on administrations by carefully observing governmental expenditure. Ministers probably have not, the time to do this work adequately themselves, and, in any case, they are not infallible. The House bers, while the Executive includes less than one-fifth of that number. Many members not on the Executive could be usefully employed on committees, whose duty it would be to make a special examination of various matters, including finance. Admittedly, the old accounts committee was too large, cumbrous, and costly; it should be reduced by one-half. The proposed suspension of the act would be a retrograde step. Members of Parliaam merely endeavourment have a definite duty to perform iu general control over expenditure. If we agree to this bill we, as private members, shall be handing over one of our most important privileges. I am not satisfied with the measure, and, if the bill is to be passed, I suggest that the period of suspension be limited to the present financial year. member move in that direction? mittee. should not have spoken to this bill had we not been told that its purpose is to effect economy.

I cannot understand why it. is now proposed to suspend the act. I know that, under the act, the committee has power to initiate inquiries, so that, to approximately had it been in existence now, it might have undertaken some investigation which would involve expense.

60,Mr Martens (Herbert) [4.53],"Ithe finance committee might be reconstituted for the purpose. It would then not bo necessary to re-enact the present legislation as will have to be done if this bill is passed. It might be stipulated that, only on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day, could matters be referred to a committee for inquiry. The Prime Minister has given no reason for the suspension of the aet. If it is proposed to wipe out the committee altogether, we might as well be told. I do not think that honourable members realize just what is involved in the suspension of the Ptiblic Accounts Committee, which is a most important adjunct to our parliamentary system of government. We should set the cost of the committee against the advantages which its existence confers. Last year, the cost for salaries, contingencies, &c, was only £832. The'committee came into existence following some pertinent remarks made in Parliament after the elections of 1913. Sir John Forrest, who was then Treasurer, introduced the bill authorizing the formation of the committee, and, in doing so, made this statementA l l parties and every member are interested House who would be prepared to sit on in having a careful scrutiny of the public expenditure. I think that in globo the House exercises supervision, but there is no such minute scrutiny that the committee w ill be capable of. Sometimes a very small amount is asked for at first for a work, the ultimate cost of which runs into nn immense amount of money which was not anticipated by the House at the time of ' agreeing to the first outlay. .Parliament is often unable to look closely into the directors to carry on from year to many matters which it would like to investigate. Honourable members will notice that those words were spoketi quite early in the life of the Federal Parliament. When the committee was established, the annual expenditure of the Commonwealth was £20,000,000; now it is, roughly, £70,000,000. At that time the Commonwealth public debt was £19,000,000; now it is very nearly £400,000,000. If it was necessary then that there should be in existence a body to supervise the expenditure of money and report to Parliament, it is even more necessary now. If we suspend this act we shall say, in effect, to the Cabinet, "" We have implicit faith in you; you may do exactly as you like."": I draw attention to the valuable report presented by the select committee on the presentation of public accounts to Parliament. Honourable members interested in these matters should study that report, which is a most valuable document. ThePublic Accounts Committee initiated the inquiry during the life of the last Parliament, and was practically ready to present its report when the elections were held. The select committee was then appointed from those old members of the Public Accounts Committee who survived the election. This committee completed the investigation and prepared and presented a report, which was considered to be so valuable that special mention of it was made by the Prime Minister in his budget speech, and it was said that several of its recommendations would be carried out. That select committee was, to all intents and purposes, the old Committee of Public Accounts. If the recommendations embodied in that report were given effect, the savings would more than defray the costs of the committee for years to come. Those who sat on the select committee did so without recompense, and I am sure that there are many honourable members in this similar committees without any financial reward. Committees of this sort do immensely valuable work, especially in regard to finance. Can honourable members imagine the shareholders of a company allowing year without any audit being made? The Public Accounts Committee, when functioning, exercises a continuous audit over public expenditure. It is true that we have an Auditor-General who examines public accounts, but his report is rendered late in the year. When his report is placed before Parliament, it is presented along with the Treasurer's financial statement, and no time is set aside for its discussion. The reports of the Public Accounts Committee are discussed by this Parliament as they are presented, and in this way their contents are brought forcibly before the notice of honourable members. In Great Britain the Public Accounts Committee was brought into existence as long ago as 1S60. Durell, writing on the subject of",24,Committee Of Public Accounts Bill Second Reading
61,Mr E. Green (Richmond) [4.55],"parliamentary grants, states on page 103 of his bookThe history of the origin of tiie Public Accounts Committee deserves more than a passing notice, for, as a vital and essential feature of our present financial system, it has largely provided the motive power by which that system has been carried to the position it has now obtained. The Public Accounts Committee in England is looked upon as an important, and even necessary, adjunct to Parliament. expenditure. statesFour years later, the passing of the Exchequer and Audit Act marked an all important and essential stage in the working out of this system, and provided the improved machinery by which the fullest benefit was enabled to be derived from the labours of the Public Accounts Committee. Tlie effect of the act, much disliked at first, or rather more feared than disliked I particularly draw honourable members' attention to the last phrase. The paragraph continueswas to introduce ""an obedience to regulation and a responsibility such as were not previously known."" It is to be observed, however, that the act only provides for tlie presentation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports to Parliament. The important question of their further consideration is a matter of House of Commons procedure. With a view to securing that permanent provision should be made for this essential link * in the chain, the Public Accounts Committee recommended in 1800, on the bill being referred to it, that "" it should be made a standing order of this honourable House, that all reports on appropriation and consolidated fund accounts, and the Treasury minutes prescribed in schedule B of the bill, be referred to the Committee of Public Accounts."" This act, which Lord Morley describes as a monument of the zeal and power of Gladstone in the direction of providing a good system of economy, and in converting the nominal control of Parliament into a real control, was, "" in its peculiar field, an epoch-making statute,"" as is shown by the striking contrast, from the point of view of financial regularity, in the public accounts before and after that date. Some of those remarks are applicable at the present time to conditions in Australia, when economy is so necessary. mittee has rendered valuable service to Parliament expenditure, and in drawing the attention of honourable members to various in the public accounts. The Government, pursuing economy, now proposes practically Mr R. Green. abolish this committee, which has been doing work that individual members are not able to do for themselves. One witness before the select committee on the presentation of public accounts saidIn its control of the purse lies Parliament's chief defence against the encroachments of the Executive. There are not wanting signs that some of its outposts are being surrendered. If tlie retreat continues, we may awake to find that the substance of popular government It is the watch-dog of public has been lost. On page 108, Durell To prevent that development, a public accounts committee is necessary. The personnel of this House underwent considerable changes in 1929 and 1931, and many of the present members of the House are not familiar with r.he work which the standing committees did. A return furnished to Parliament shows that from the 1st January, 1923, to the 30th June, 1929, 21 inquiries by royal commissions were held at a cost of £107,765, or an average of £5,132 each. In the same period, sixteen inquiries were conducted by the Public Accounts Committee at a total cost, including salaries, contingencies, & c , of £19,556, or an average of £1,222. sions and the Public Accounts Committee handled different subjects. quiries were into similar subjects. For instance, the royal commission on Western Australia's finances cost £5,681, whereas the Public Accounts Committee's inquiry into the disabilities of South Australia cost only £1,682. The Development and Migration Commission conducted an investigation into the economic condition of Tasmania at a cost of £14,973, whilst a similar inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee cost only £1,524. On the score of economy, I recommend to the House that the activiparticularly ties of the Public Accounts Committee be resumed. The Public Accounts Commember suggest that the committee's inquiries were as thorough as those by in preventing unnecessary royal commissions? items mony was given that the disabilities of South Australia and Tasmania were more a short-sighted policy of deeply probed by the Public Accounts to Committee than by the other bodies that",25,Committee Of Public Accounts Bill Second Reading

65,Mr R. Green,"Independen t testiinvestigated the same problems. In regard to Tasmanian affairs, constructive suggestions were made by the committee, to which the State Parliament gave effect by amending legislation. In its report on the method of presenting public accounts-practicall y completed at the end of the last Parliament, but formally completed and presented to this Parliament by a select committee with almost the same personnel-the committee dealt with (1) parliamentary control and procedure in relation to the public finances of the Commonwealth; (2) the form in which the Estimates, budget papers and other financial statements are presented to and dealt with by Parliament; and (3) the desirability of uniform methods of accounts for the Commonwealth and the States. nesses whom the committee heard on these subjects included Professors Eland, Brigden, Copland, Giblin, Hytten, and Melville, the Auditor-General of New Sonih Wales, the Auditor-General of Victoria, the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator ( Mr Westhoven), and Mr Barton, consulting accountant. All of these gentlemen testified that a regular oversight by a public accounts committee was essential to parliamentary control of public finance. The Auditor General's report is not presented until late in the year. In Great Britain the Auditor-General and a high senior official of the Treasury attend every meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, and the reports of the committee and the Auditor General are submitted to Parliament simultaneously. Until recent years, when the Commonwealth Public Accounts Committee undertook inquiries delegated to it by the government of the day, its activities were restricted. able to function as was intended when it was first brought into existence and as the British Public Accounts Committee functions. Instead of suspending indefinitely the operations of the committee, the Government should re-appoint it, and by regulation give to it the powers and status it should have. In the interests of economy, which is the watchword of the hour, the Government should withdraw this bill. If the committee be revived with adequate powers, it will act as the watchdog of Parliament, and either prevent or draw attention to improper expenditure. Investigation after improper expenditure has occurred may seem like locking the stable after the horse has been stolen, but the making public of an act of extravagance or maladministration will enable measures to be taken to prevent its repetition. After all, the Auditor-General's report,, too, is more or less a post-mortem pronouncement. The report presented by the Select Committee on Public Accounts drew attention to the fact that, in the last Parliament, supplementary estimates for three years, covering the expenditure of £1,746,687 from the Treasurer's Advance, were passed through this chamber in less than an hour. If the Public Accounts Committee had been functionThe witing under appropriate regulations, such expenditure would not have been approved without proper investigation. functioning during at least two of the years covered by those supplementary estimates. was hampered by the fact that it had not been given the powers and the status it was originally intended to enjoy. Its meetings had not been attended by the Auditor-General or a high official of the Treasury. In. addition, its time was occupied by inquiries into extraneous matters. committee and establish a new economic committee, on which the Auditor-General could serve? sary. A better course would be to withdraw this bill and give to the committee It was not power to function fully. Although the economies recommended by the committee have enabled immense savings to be effected, the total expenditure on its account last year was only £832. The Government does not seem to have any idea of the value of the Public Accounts Committee. It proposes to save nearly £1,000 by suspending its activities, thereby depriving honourable members of the services of an expert committee aided by the Auditor-General and a senior member of the Treasury.

Recently, it inquired into the finances of South Australia, and during its investigations it discovered that over a period of years, from 1906 to 1928, there had been a discrepancy of £11,000,000 in the public accounts of that State. Mi-. GABB --That fact had been previously pointed out to the Government of South Australia by the Auditor-General of that State. reports of the Public Accounts Committee and the Auditor-General were introduced into, and considered by, this House simultaneously, honourable members would have a better knowledge of the financial position of Australia generally. Colonel Durell, writing of the Public Accounts Committee of Great Britain, said--Such decisions moreover are accepted by tlie Comptroller and Auditor-General, though an officer entirely independent of the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury. The extent to Avhich the work of the Comptroller and the Auditor-General goes has been really defined by the various decisions of the Public Accounts Committee, and to those decisions he. as iu duty bound, would as an officer of Parliament submit. The Public Accounts Committee has now become a permanent feature iu our finance system. Comparatively early in its history testimony to its value was given by Disraeli, who declared that it was of immense u t i l it y in bringing the entire revenue and expenditure of the country under the control of the House of Commons.

Honourable members will recollect the dispute that arose between the Commonwealth Treasury and the Auditor General concerning certain trust funds. That dispute raged for some time, and finally was referred to His Excellency the Governor General who, acting on the advice of the Treasurer, decided in favour of the Treasury. The method of keeping trust' funds and of allocating trust moneys is a serious matter for this House, and had that dispute between the Treasurer and the Auditor-General been referred, in the first place, to the Public Accounts Committee, as could have been done under the then existing regulations, it would have been settled very much earlier and more satisfactorily. honourable member is making a rather long drawn-out illustration. Prime Minister that most honourable members will be quite prepared to serve on the Public Accounts Committee without fee, so that they might be given an opportunity to investigate public accounts and finance generally, and thus gain a knowledge that WOUld be of considerable value to them in the discussions in this House. The bill should be withdrawn and a regulation prescribed giving to the Public Accounts Committee powers which are held by similar committees in Great Britain, South Africa and Canada. I shall vote against the second reading of the bill. that the Government will not withdraw the bill, and I congratulate the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) on having moved its second reading. I am afraid that I cannot visualize a Public Accounts Committee with the powers which the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) wishes to confer upon it, and I do not think that I shall live to see such a committee in existence. I disagree D u r e l l conwith the statement of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) that the Public Accounts Committee would be of more value than the Government itself in bringing about economies. There is no likelihood of any report of a committee composed of members of this House being given serious consideration by tlie Government. The honourable member for Richmond said that the cost of this committee last year was £800, but I submit that that sum Avould barely meet the salary of its secretary.

The honourable member for Richmond said that as the expeivditure 0.1.1 royal commissions was much greater than that on the parliamentary committees, it would be more economical to continue the committees. In the main the reports of royal commissions are pigeonholed aud disregarded, like a recent report of the Accounts Committee regarding the presentation of the public accounts. It is unfortunate that the Government does not give the House an opportunity to discuss the report of the Auditor-General, because it contains some valuable information which should interest honourable members generally. I have no wish to say anything further about, the Public Accounts Committee, but if a fight takes place in respect of its suspension, I shall take the opportunity to say a few of the nasty things that can be said about it . Debate (on adjourned. BILL. ter for the Interior) [5.34] I move That the bill be now road a. second time. This bill provides-for the suspension of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. The intention of the Government was announced iu tbe Governor General's Speech delivered at the opening of this Parliament. The urgent necessity for n. reduction of parliamentary expenditure influenced the Ministryi n arriving at its decision to recommend to Parliament the suspension of the operations of the Public Works Committee. This body in the past proved itself a useful institution indeed. It did much good in the public interest, saved a good deal of money, aud was instrumental in preventing many inniierjcssary proposed works from, being undertaken. stamees have changed. There is not a great deal of public work on foot at present, so that there; is practically nothing for the committee to do. It is estimated that the savings through the suspension of the committee will amount to approximately £3,000 per annum. The expenditure for 1930-31, the last complete financial year during which the committee was i u operation, was £2,848, made up as follows:-Fees of members, £906; salaries of staff, £1,438; travelling expenses, £449; contingencies, £55. The expenditure has bseii a good deal heavier i i i some years when a considerable amount of travelling was necessary. The committee has not functioned since the dissolution of the last Parliament. Under the original act, the committee was empowered to investigate all Avorks of which the estimated cost of completion exceeded £25,000. A provision is included in this b ill that the suspension of the act may be lifted by a resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. If an inquiry is desired into any public work while the act is suspended, the Standing Orders of the Parliament promentary select committee which could make Hie necessary investigation. In submitting this bill, the Government has in mind a particular work whieli \vo:uld, ordinarily, have been .referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation, namely:-""'The construe;tion of a reservoir at Black Mountain, Canberra "". This work forms part of a larger scheme to improve the Canberra water supply. The original water supply scheme designed in 1912, Avas a progressive work, capable of development as the city extended. The main works, comprising the Cotter Dam and the Strom'lo and RedH ill reservoirs, Avere decided upon, before the first Public Works Committee Avas appointed.

We were told when this bill was introduced that it was both small and unimportant ; but we have seen, as the debate has progressed, that several important principles are involved, which, in my opinion, are much bigger than the merely illegal possession of military clothing. The most important provision of the bill is that which removes the onus of proof from the accuser to the accused. It has become a habit lately, particularly in connection with Commonwealth legislation, to make things easier for the Crown and more difficult for the defendant. In a number of cases, the onus of proof has been shifted from the accuser to the accused, as in this one. This fact makes it important that we should carefully consider this bill. In my opinion, it is a denial and a defiance of democratic thought, and an entire reversal of a principle of British jurisprudence, which has been honoured for the last 150 years, to place the onus of proof upon the accused. There might bo extenuating circumstances in this instance, which would make such an action entirely subversive of the principles of justice. introduction of this bill is paltry in the extreme. It appears that a certain individual who had left the military forces neglected to return a second-hand military overcoat. Neither the Minister who introduced the bill, nor honourable members opposite, who have supported it, have suggested that such action is frequent. instance of the kind we are being asked to over-ride an. accepted and cherished principle of law, that the onus of proof shall rest upon the accuser and not upon the accused. It appears that when the individual concerned did not return the military overcoat issued to him the department took legal proceedings against him on a charge of wrongful possession. Upon a decision adverse to the Government being given in the lower court, the matter was taken to the High Court. In fact, every legal instrument in the Commonwealth has been used in an endeavour to prove that this individual was wrongtary overcoat worth only a few shillings. At a time when we are casting about to effect economies, the Government of Australia is vindictively pursuing a person who gave voluntary service to the country, in an endeavour to prove that he is in possession of a second-hand overcoat, the intrinsic value of whicli would not be a couple of shillings. We must consider the matter in its proper perspective. I do not think that any honourable member will claim that trainees are adequately recompensed for their service. They receive a military education, which will, possibly, be of value to the nation on some future occasion. For the purposes of their training they are supplied with a uniform. Even from a hygienic point of view it is unwise to ask a trainee to wear a uniform that has been worn by others. Mr E. F. HARRISON -Only the greatcoat is involved. applies to all articles of clothing. Having been issued with the uniform, the trainee is held to be thereafter responsible for it. The bill provides thatIfi t is proved to the satisfaction of tlie court that any such article was in the possession of the defendant at any time prior to the The reason for the time at which he was required to deliver up tlie article, he shall be deemed, in the absence of proof by him of the lawful disposal of the article, to have continued in possession of the article up to the time when he was required to deliver up the article. The fact that he received a uniform, for which he signed, is deemed to be sufficient evidence that at all material subsequent Because of an isolated times he was in possession of that uniform. We know how easy it is to lose one of our personal belongings. It may be a hat; it may be an umbrella. Those are everyday occurrences. How much easier it is for a trainee to be dispossessed of part of his accoutrement. Somebody in camp might consider that his neighbour has a better-looking coat, and quietly acquire it. The possibilities of a trainee losing a garment are infinite. Yet it is expected that, in addition to giving voluntary service to the nation, he shall be a watchdog over his equipment. There is only one way of "" lawful disposal"" of military",30,Defence Bill Second Reading

78,Mr Rosevear,"My argumentequipment, and that is by handing it back to the military authorities. Mr E. F. HARBISON-No. tion submitted by me, the Attorney General( Mr Latham) said that there is only one way lawfully to dispose of equipment, and that is by handing it back to che military authorities. ¥ e know that there are scores of ways in. which a trainee may be dispossessed of these articles, yet he is deemed to be at all times in possession of them. It was suggested by the Attorney-General that one of the reasons for this amending bill is the difficulty of proving possession. I suggest that it is just as difficult for a trainee to prove that an article has been legitimately lost by him as it is to prove that it was lost by or stolen from' the authorities. unjust to throw the onus of proof on the trainee, when the possibilities of his losing an article are practically limitless. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr tion for failure to deliver up when lawfully E. F. Harrison) suggested that there is some .saving grace in the last lines of paragraph b of clause 2, which reads'Inability to deliver up tlie article shall not he a defence unless the defendant prove* to the satisfaction of the court that such inability did not arise from any negligence or wrongful act or omission on his part. That is not very helpful to the trainee, for it is just as difficult for him to prove lack of negligence as it is to prpve that the article was stolen or otherwise lost. Apparently, the whole trouble is that the Government has difficulty in tracing these articles. If losses were on a wholesale scale, there might be some excuse for this bill. I presume that, when a trainee hands hack his equipment, he receives a receipt. There is always a possibility that a portion of the equipment might be overlooked; still, the .onus of proof will be on the trainee to show that he was not .still in possession of that property. Asi have already said, the bill Ls founded on paltry premises. Whether we are dealing with Crown matters or private -litigation, it is not mir.easoiia.ble to expect thai the principles of British justice shall be observed. If we wish to protect the -little liberty that remains to the subject we should insist upon the retention of that important principle of British juris* orudence-that ' the onus of proof shall be on the accuser, and not on the defendant. Not one aspect of this amending bill commends itself to anybody who treasures the principle. The proposed provisions will undoubtedly inflict injustice on those who voluntarily serve the community. By hounding down such people and making it incumbent upon them to prove non-possession of a second-hand military uniform that should be put in the incinerator rather than on another volunteer's back, tlie Government is adopting a mean attitude, and placing an unfair responsibility on worthy citizens. Question resolved in the affirmative. In committee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause 2I t is Section seventy-nine of the principal act is amended by inserting, after sub-section (J..). the following sub-section:"" ( IA . ) In any prosecution under this secrequired sp to do any arms, accoutrements or other naval or military articles belonging to the Commonwealth or to any corps(w) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court tliat any such article was in the possession of the defendant at any timeiprior to the time at which lie was required to deliver up the article, he shall be deemed, in the absence of proof by him of the lawful disposal of the article, to have continued in possession of the article up to the time when lie was required to deliver up the article; and suggestion that I .should like to make is that, when surplus military clothing is distributed, it should be dyed a distinctive colour.

80,Mr Thorby (Calare) [6.3],"AI ask the Minister to accept an amendment to make paragraph a of proposed new sub-section IA read :-"" M it is proved to tlie satisfaction of the cular recently issued in the Newcastle court that any such article is in the possession of the defendant . . ."" If this amendment is accepted, it will meet many of our objections to the bill. Our principal objection is to the retrospective nature of the clause as it now stands. The onus should be on the department to prove that the accused person is actually in possession of the article at the time he is required to deliver it up. This would place a proper responsibility on the department, and would be in conformity with the usual legal practice. Health and Repatriation) [6.7] I cannot accept the honourable member's suggested amendment. The clothing and other equipment issued to trainees are inspected by the commanding officers from time to time when the trainees are on parade. It is necessary to protect the commanders of units, because they are responsible for the equipment issued. As one who commanded a unit for many years, I speak with knowledge of this subject. The officer commanding has to acknowledge the receipt by him of every article of clothing, and every piece of equipment issued to the men in his unit, and he is personally responsible'for that material. During the \var> when I relinquished command of my unit in the Citizen Forces in order to go to the front, I received a bill from the Defence Department for nineteen pairs of leggings which had been issued to my unit, and for which I had not accounted. It is most difficult for the officer commanding to keep track of every pair of boots, every shift, and every hat issued to the men under his command, yet he is held personally responsible by the department. This bill proposes to make the trainees themselves responsible for their equipment. Honourable members may rest assured that no commander of a unit would deal harshly with the men who had voluntarily enlisted, and placed themselves under his command. This provision is not aimed at the man who enlists in the forces in order to serve his country, but at those whose sole purpose in enlisting is to obtain possession of equipment. A man who enlists does so for one of two reasons, either to serve his country or, to obtain possession of military equipment. A cirdistrict exhorted men to join the forces, and get their hands on the things they wanted. The Minister's attempt to defend this clause of the bill is the poorest we have yet heard. Boiled' down, his statement means that those who join the forces do so either to serve their country, or to get a new Sunday suit. Half of what the Minister said was not appropriate to the proposed amendment at all. The amending clause does not relieve the unit commander of any responsibility, but places an additional responsibility on individual trainees. Honourable members will agree that practically all those who join the Citizen Forces do so for the purpose of voluntarily serving their country. It is a paltry thing for the department to seek this power to pursue a man for equipment issued to him perhaps ten years ago, if he has served so long. Even the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) will agree that the trainees are not generously rewarded for their services, and it is hardly fair to treat them as it is proposed to do. It is not right that the onus of proof should be placed on the trainee, and, in my opinion, the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) should be accepted. Sitting suspended fromG.15 to 8 p.m. members of the Lang group, who always profess much concern for the downtrodden, would have the committee believe that the purpose of this amendment is to enable the Government to hunt down some person who may be in possession of an overcoat, or some other article of clothing belonging to the Defence Department. The bill refers to "" armB, accoutrements, or other naval or military articles "". A military overcoat was mentioned by the Attorney-General last week only because a prosecution relating to an overcoat had disclosed the Government's lack of certain powers. Nobody but an evil-doer need fear the provisions of this measure. If a member of the forces has,",32,Defence Bill Second Reading

A board to inquire regarding the whereabouts of missing articles may be appointed by the commanding officer of any unit; in practice each unit has an annual audit from the Ordnance Department, and if any deficiency is disclosed, a board of inquiry is appointed immediately. At present the commanding officer may be called upon to make good or pay for any deficiency, and that has happened to many officers of the forces. A person who has bona fide lost equipment has nothing to fear. Under the compulsory training system, when every man was tabbed, the improper disposal of military goods was less likely than under the voluntary system. I know of men who have joined the forces under assumed names, declared on the attestation form that they had no convictions, received equipment, and then disappeared. This bill will enable offenders of that character to be dealt with. There is another aspect of this legislation: An organization with worldwide ramifications is trying to undermine the loyalty of members of the forces. does the honourable member refer? Imperialism, which, under date of the 11th February, 1932, issued a bulletin which sets out a series of "" tasks "", the first of which is to arouse the Australian people, especially workers, sailors and soldiers, and the youth, to the imperialist war danger; to win the transport and other industries, army, navy, and schools, away from the service of imperialism, and to mobilize an antiimperialist front in Australia. I quote from the Bed Road, a book which exposes the workings of 'Communism in Australia. If arms and accoutrements should find their way into the possession of this league or any other organization, the Government should have full power to recover them. Unless a man is an evildoer and is deliberately disposing of equipment wrongfully, he is not likely to be punished under this legislation. have always boasted of the principle of British jurisprudence, that a man is innocent until he has been proved guilty. But under this bill a member of the forces to whom equipment has been issued, and who cannot produce it when required to do so, will be adjudged guilty unless he can prove his innocence. In reply to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) the Minister made the significant statement that a man enlists for one of two reasons, either to serve his country or to get clothing. Probably the Minister knows that, because of the policy of his Government, the time is not far distant when thousands of men will be obliged to join the military forces in order to get clothing to cover their nakedness. I believe that this bill is intended to empower the Government to recover military clothing from such unfortunates. I shall support the amendment forecast by the honourable member for West Sydney. port the contention of the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) that military clothing before being issued to the unemployed should be dyed to distinguish it from uniforms worn by members of the forces. Certainly the regimental colours.should be removed from all garments before they are issued to relief organizations. Responsibility for military clothing issued to members of the forces should be placed on the recipient, and not on the officer who issues it. Otherwise carelessness will be encouraged, and men will not care for their uniforms as they should. Some will appear on parade with their uniform and equipment in a condition which will discredit the corps to which they belong. If the member of a football club goes to work in a jersey that has been issued to him, and later appears on the playing field with the jersey in a dirty and torn condition, surely he, not the secretary who issued the garment, should be held responsible. The provisions of this bill will not inflict hardship on men who are "" reasonably honest"" and recognize the responsibility they assume when they take delivery of military equipment.",33,Defence Bill Second Reading

101,40 Mr White (Balaclava) [8.28],"I was pointing out that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition was calculated to imperil the Ottawa .agreement, which has been entered into for the mutual benefit of Great Britain .and the dominions. It is undoubtedly a prudent commercial bargain as ""well as a step furthev to the attainment of a lofty and practical ideal. The criticism -of the Ottawa agreement, which has been political and mainly sectional, is certainly not helpful to our general progress .and development, and, therefore, is to be deplored. Some critics have suggested shat our customs duties are too high, and at the sarnie time that Australian Industries are being placed in jeopardy. They cannot have it .both ways. Their reasoning is immoderate and illogical, and -cowfirms fbe grammatical rule that two .negatives destroy one another and make an affirmative. If we remove from our awinds political prejudices, we must admit that tlie Ottawa agreement, compromise as it is .and imperfect as it may ibe, will certainly ibe of great benefit to Australia and the Empire generally. Thati t has obvious .advantages has been shown by various -speakers. These may be summarized in the statement that Britain, after -the advent of the Nationalist Government to office, imposed a 30 per cent, duty -on imports, but exempted dominion goods, .and that -that exemption, which -would 'have lapsed this month, has now -been extended for five years. That duty -covers almost everything that Australia -exports, except wool, .the greater paa-t of -canwool being .sold outside the Empire. The preferences that have been granted fal'l roughly into five main classes. Substantial and increased preferences have 'been obtained in respect of .butter, cheese, .apples, pears, canned fruits, dried raisins, eggs and wine. practically 95 per cent, of our .exports -of these commodities, and there is room on the British market for an expansion -of our -trade in these lines. Good preferences have also been obtained in respect of condensed milk, oranges, honey, and -other items. Au. honourable member asked -by interjection on Friday how it would 'be possible under this agreement, for .Australia to get better prices for her products. I point out to him that Britain has now terminated her trade agreement with Russia. This will mean that no more Russian goods will be dumped on the British market to the detriment of Australian products. This Russian competition was distinctly unfair. We know that Russian agents were instructed to sell their wheat for Is. per quarter less .than the price at which wheat from any other part of the world was offered. The elimination of this unfair Russian competition will undoubtedly be beneficial to Australia and Canada. member think that the British Government acted fairly in allowing foreign wheat to be dumped against Australian wheat ? not be done now. It has been stated that if the Ottawa agreement is ratified, our secondary indusitries will be jeopardized; but that statement cannot be substantiated, for our present duties will remain in operation, though they will be subject to review by the Tariff Boafd. I have discussed 'the Tariff Board in this House on a number of .occasions, and have made it clear that. I believe in the board. Most honourable members must .admit that an expert authority accustomed to take -evidence o,n commercial isubjects is much better equipped to deal with tariff matters tha-n is this Parliament. Ma-.

It has been said during this debate that if this agreement becomes operative, and another severe .depression overtakes Australia, it will 'be impossible for us .to remain solvent. That line of .criticism has been adopted both inside and outside of this Parliament, but 'in my opinion it indicates an unnecessary feeling of alarm.",36,Gullett

110,Mr Speaker,"The honorableber objects, I withdraw the statement. There was a slow realization by Great Britain of the need of Empire preferences. colonial conferences, as they were called, the idea was a nebulous one. Then followed an amiable tolerance for the national aspirations of Australia and the other dominions. Now, after Russia has repudiated her debt to Great Britain, an amount almost equal to Australia's national debt, when Argentine has refused to pay overseas interest, and when China is involved in the turmoil of a civil war, the Mother Country realizes that the idea of preferential trading within the Empire is right, and should be encouraged. Great Britain now understands that to trade within the family is better than to trade with the stranger, the alien, and the foreigner. That is why I made the statement to which honourable members opposite have taken undue exception. The Great War also taught Great Britain the lesson that in times of great crisis the dominions would rally to her aid. It is unnecessary for me to recapitulate the events of those times; their history is too recent. I merely remind honourable members how the co-operation of its various component parts saved the Empire, and that the part played by Great, Britain in the war probably saved civilization. It may be that the proper co-operation of the various units of the Empire will save the world from another such calamity. The late Alfred Deakiu, when referring to preference, declaredIt is scarcely possible to use a single word yesterday they made a demonstration in which could cover all that is associated with the greatest trade movement within the Umpire for the co-operation of all its parts. I have said sufficient regarding the last war to make it plain what co-operation means in such times. In spite of the League of Nations and agreements such as the Kellogg Pact, to which Russia and Japan were signatories, war has occurred between those two countries, without negotiation. Preference connotes defence. It is on Great Britain that we lean, Mother Country maintains. We pay an inadequate amount for our own defence. Imperial economic unity would also stimulate our trade, and cause additional ships to trade between Australia and England, so building up the greatest mercantile marine in the world, which During the earlier played such an important part during the war as an adjunct of the British navy. That would come with preferential trading, as well as the creation of a greater amount of business between the postal departments of this and the Old Country, and the development of the wireless and cable services, so that, through the British Empire, there will be a web of communications around the world. Nor must I omit the air service, which annihilates distance and which will, iu a comparatively short time, be carrying human freight from Australia to Great Britain in from ten to eleven days. Those matters are bound up in preference, and honourable members opposite should be big enough to realize that they are all covered by this agreement, which represents a further step towards the attainment of our ideal. Of course, this is a business bargain, but it concerns principles as well as money. The very existence of the units of the Empire depends on the existence of un agreement like this in times of peace as well as in times of war. For in times of peace we are fighting an economic war, and are unfairly handicapped. We know that Russia, which is trying an experiment in socialism upon a backward people, is flooding the world with propaganda, because it realizes that its system cannot survive unless the whole world adopts communism.. We have the agents of that nation in our midst. Only Melbourne, and a couple of days ago they were in evidence in Sydney. We have honourable members objecting to the banning of certain soviet films. Mr ""WHITE I submit that all this is apropos of preference. It concerns preference for our own people, and against even those who, born in our midst, are not proud of their British blood.

Honourable members opposite must, in fairness, admit that under a preferential tariff industries w ill migrate to this country and bring in their train the stock that we need-Britishers . I do not advocate any flood of migration, which would be unfair to our labour market; but I am in favour of attracting carefully-selected British people to our shores. Irish.

If we got the flood of British migration that we need in Australia, we should, because of our The Russian Soviet engreater population, be able to lessen our excessive overhead expenditure.

There is a league of nations mightier and more stable than that which has its head-quarters at G eneva, a league which has played its part -the British Empire.

125,Mr Hutchin,,42,Gullett
126,Dr. Earle Page,"That is true, in our own interests, is this exhibition of440 items in order to provide the agreed on margin of preference for British goods. Surely the idea of imperial economic unity, to which I thought every one in Australia with a grain of intelligence subagainst foreign imports in over 300 scribed, implies that the trade barriers between the various partners of the Empire should be as few as possible; that there should be the freest exchange of goods between Empire units, and that there should be that' measure of protection November, 1930, the present Minagainst foreign goods which would ensure the maximum degree of intra-Empire trade. With a properly worked-out plan of Empire development and industrial progress we could make the whole Empire practically a home market for the produce of the various Empire units. By rationalizing our industries, or parts of them, or if similar industries in different parts of the Empire were established, allotting to each special fields to exploit, we should be able to lessen the overhead costs of production to such an extent as to make more effective for our purpose even lower protective duties against outside countries than now exist. The magnitude of a task of this kind should have fired the imagination of the delegation which represented Australia, aud should have inspired the broadest possible policy resulting in the bringing back of an agreement worthwhile, rather than the paltry gains provided for in this agreement. There are four articles in the agreeparallel of latitude; that produces pracment which will make me vote for it, tically every commodity needed by man; but what they provide for is so obvious that has immense power-resources, both that it should never have been necessary of fuel and water; and that has, in for them to be imposed upon Australia respect of many commodities, practically by outside pressure. In article 9, for an absolute monopoly. The Empire proinstance, Australia undertakes to protect duces 44 per cent, of the world's wool, only those industries which are sound and practically all the fine wool. It proand which have a reasonable prospect duces 70 per cent, of the world's gold, 90 of success. Surely no country in the per cent, of the nickel, 65 per cent, of world would adopt any other policy. the rubber, 40 per cent, of the tin, and That should be an axiom of our national does one-third of the world's trade. policy; it should not be second nature Surely the proper development of such with us, but first nature. What Britain an empire requires something more than has really done in requiring us to agree the appearance before the Australian to this article looks like providing a Tariff Board of representatives of British padded cell for the protection of a people manufacturers. What is needed is a suffering from economic madness. Then there is the question of the scale along its own natural lines; that it will of preference. The agreed upon rate of foster its natural primary and secondary preference varies from 15 per cent, to industries in such a way as to permit of 20 per cent., according to the duty on various kinds of British goods. In order to apply this preference over the whole range of goods, the Government has increased the already high Scullin tariff instances, while leaving the tariff on British imports as it was before. Of what value this is to us, let the Minister for Trade and Customs explain. In a speech delivered on 14th ister for Trade aud Customs, when speaking in support of a motion for the adjournment of' the House, which I moved to protest against discrimination against British products in favour of those of the United States of America, saidThe Labour Government has gone through the farce of keeping up some 10 or 15 per cent, preference to Great Britain in the new tariff schedule, but it would not matter if the wall was 100 per cent, higher against the foreigner, because in innumerable cases in which the preferences stood in favour of Britain for many years, British imports are now impossible. Now, on top of that tariff, higher foreign rates are to be imposed. Surely this is a paltry policy to be pursued by Australia, which is a part of a mighty empire that possesses one-quarter of the land surface of the globe; which has within its borders one-quarter of the world's population; that is crossed by every meridian of longitude and every properly conceived plan that will ensure that each part of the Empire will develop the greatest possible co-operation between the various parts of the Empire, so as to effect a real rationalization of Empire production,, and a reduction of production costs. It should be possible by such action to reduce costs and lower tariff barriers as well. The other day there was a great deal of talk about a circular issued by one of the banks stating that production costs would be increased as the result of the Ottawa agreements. There would be no need to increase costs if we framed and put into operation a proper plan of imperial development. That plan would seek to use the resources of the Empire in the best possible way, and by scientific co-operation reduce the costs of production and the cost of living within the Empire, and make more effective and even lower tariff barriers than those at present raised against foreign competition. To evolve such a plan we should, before the politicians met at Ottawa, have had consultation, discussion, and research by business representatives from various parts of the Empire to decide upon a common business policy. I have advocated this step for some time past, and was, therefore, interested to read in the London Times, of the 10th September last, the following paragraph :There is little doubt that better results would have been achieved if the objectives of a,m definitely of the opinion that Australia's Empire policy could have been agreed on beforehand and definite lines of approach to them examined by business men.

Dr. Earle Page. frame of mind in which the British delegates entered the conference made it possible for tremendous advantages to be achieved by all parts of the Empire had the delegates the courage and vision to seize the opportunity. The results have been so poor largely because the hopeful atmosphere which at first prevailed was chilled by the cold wind of Canadian and Australian sectionalism. In regard to Australian sectionalism, it is worthwhile to review the attitude of members of the present Government, particularly our delegates to Ottawa. In March, 1930, I set out in a speech at Benalla the Country party policy for helping Great Britain and ourselves by the adoption of a system of reciprocal preference, and in the May following I moved in this House a motion which was seconded by the honourable member for Gippsland, advocating the encouragement of increased Empire trade, and indicating the manner in which that could be brought about. The present Minister for Trade and Customs ridiculed my proposal, and in an article which appeared"" in the Melbourne Herald of March, 1930, he wroteThe vital question now arises not only as to whether we in Australia are likely to be able to give more in the future, as under the Baldwin scheme we would he expected to do, but as towhether we are likely to find it possible to maintain the preference of recent years. I disposition and capacity to grant preference of substantial value to British manufactured goods are diminished rather than increased. Before Britain would entertain f u l l duties preference than we have been certainly she would not accept less. If there is one thing true about Australian dustries. A t no time since our tariff making long ago in the colonies has the disbrings .the end of appreciable preference to British manufactured goods within measurecloses on the face of it , such a depth of ignorance of Australian industrial aspirations To a large extent that attitude of the Minister for Trade and Customs has been maintained by the present Prime Minister, who has stated that he will do nothing in regard to British preference, or any other tariff matter, unless he is fortified by a prior recommendation of the Tariff Board. I desire to know what, then, is taking place in regard to the 250 requests which, according to the Minister'for Trade and Customs, were made to the Commonwealth Government by the British Government in February last. The Tariff Board had ample time to examine them before our delegates left for Ottawa. The agreements ratified in the House of Commons incorporated the actual fiscal details, and mentioned the treatment to be accorded to specific items. In the agreement now before us is incorporated merely a general formula, by which the rate of pivrercnce is to bo regulated. Surely it was possible for our delegates to go to Ottawa with definite concessions to offer to the United Kingdom in respect of a large proportion of those 250 items. I believe that had they done that, they would have been able to bring back much more than this agreement represents. I said on the eve of their departure that I wished them God Speed, and trusted that they would bring back the maximum concessions obtainable. In my opinion the development of Empire trade along lines that will permit trade barriers to be lowered, affects the rehabilitation of not only Australia, but also the whole world. If we are to stagger along for years before we reach a true basis, Australia and other countries must in the meantime suffer a great deal of distress. In bacteriological culture, if the micro organisms are placed in a sympathetic medium, the culture will grow very freely, but if the slightest trace of acid is introduced, all growth is inhibited. Similarly, we had a sympathetic atmosphere in Great Britain at the Ottawa Conference, and we could have obtained almost any concessions had we developed that atmosphere by signifying our willingness to give as well as to take; but selfish sectionalism and lack of courage have had an acid-like effect in preventing satisfactory development of the Empire plan. When we examine the concessions actually obtained at Ottawa, we find that those relating to butter, zinc, lead, &c, were really the result of action taken by the Country party, especially Senator B. D. Elliott, in February last, which was initiated primarily to obtain concessions in respect of the 20,000 tons of butter that was en route to Englaud when the Import .Duties Bill was introduced into the House of Commons. As a result of tbe representations then made, we secured not merely concessions for that quantity of butter, but also inclusion in the Import Duties Bill of 10 per cent, concessions on the articles named. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) may laugh, but we were able to tell the Dairy Produce fontrol Board 24 hours before the Government knew what was happening, that a concession was to be given in respect of these commodities. That concession covered only the period, February to November under the Import Duties Act, and the Ottawa agreement has done no more than put it on a five year basis. That extension is a definite gain, I admit, but we could have got much more if we had had greater vision, and the courage to declare that we recognized that the old policy, which has been so long dominant in Australia, was not suitable to cope with modern conditions. For many years, Australia has been like St. Simeon Stylites, who perched himself on a high pillar in the Syrian desert, and with his gaze focussed on his navel, sought to solve the problems of the world. Australia has been content to isolate itself and gaze at his own anatomy. But to see ourselves in proper perspective, let us compare what is happening to us, with connection with an ordinary . what is occurring in other parts of the world. The report of the Imperial Economic Committee, published in 1930, points out that in the years 1913 to 1928, whilst the export trade of the world increased by 18 per cent., that of Canada by 105 per cent., and that of New Zealand by 45 per cent, Australia's had grown by only 10 per cent. This young, undeveloped country with unlimited/resources, has enjoyed less than the average growth of world trade; surely that is significant. This failure to expand is largely due to the fact that in Australia during the last fifteen to twenty years there has been a tendency to tax very highly all the mechanical equipment for factory and farm, despite the fact that we were unable to manufacture such goods commercially. During those years the imports of machinery, rnetals and manufactures, ranged in value from £25,000,000 to £80,000,000 annually, notAvithstanding that the duties against the United Kingdom were from 35 to 50 per cent., and against foreigners, from 60 to 70 per cent. gentleman was Treasurer during the years to which he refers. them, and i u 1925, the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) introduced alterations and, in fact, a new item, 415, to the schedule to admit free of duty such British articles as could not be commercially made in Australia. He recognized the soundness of that principle, and the alteration he made was hailed by the London 'Times as a great advance on the previous fiscal policy of the Commonwealth. The Tariff Board, in its last annual report in reference to the admission of machinery and machine tools at lowest possible rates, saidThe board is convinced that no other one factor, excepting tlie rise of world's price levels, which is outside the control of the Comences, giving greater advantages to the monwealth, would go so far to increase demand nnd reduce unemployment as would a marked reduction in the prices of these and other commodities. Here was an obvious means of approaching the British Government with an offer of preferences that would be worthwhile. Probably, many of the 250 items suggested by Great Britain for concession duties affected machines and metals. The Bruce-Page Government designed by-laws to enable machinery to be admitted free of duty, but there was always somebody to suggest that these articles could be commercially made in Australia. That is happening at the present time, and only last week I received a letter from the Metal Manufacturers' Association asking me to fight for the enforcement of the principle of admitting duty free, machinery and other requirements of industry that are not commercially produced in Australia, that is to say, at a reasonable cost. I analysed the field of possible mutual help in Empire trade, and found in one year that of £4,500,000 worth of goods which would have come, under this by-law only £1,200,000, or 25 per cent., was admitted free; and the duty paid on the balance was roughly 50 per cent, of its total value. That indicates how these duties increase the cost to the consumer. Further examining the distribution of the trade, I found that of a total import trade of £43,000,000 in metals and machinery and certain other goods in 1928-29, foreign countries secured £22,400,000. Of this amount. £16,632,000 was severely competitive, and Great Britain secured only 21 per cent, of the total. I suppose that no product is better known throughout, the world than Diston's saws, yet £25,263 worth of saws was imported from Great Britain, and £39,5S7 worth from other countries.

The Ottawa agreement has been signed, and I welcome the signing of any binding contract of this nature as a definite cooperative advance. But already th» agreement has been modified in regard to meat, because new circumstances have arisen; and similarly, I suggest, that there should be continuous examination of this agreement with a view to devising new means of improving our trading relations with Great Britain. I should like the Government to declare what has happened in regard to the 250 items upon which Great Britain sought concessions. Have those concessions been granted? Was Mr Baldwin right when he statedIn Australia, the Tariff Board shall review the position so as to ensure that within a reasonable period the protective duties shall be reduced to a level that will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition in tlie dominion markets as the basis of the relative costs of economical and efficient production.",42,Gullett

134,Dr. Earle Page,"Thos e articlesof low-interest rates with an abundance of short-term loans. I suggest that this Government the recommendations of the currency conference, which stated that there were three main lines of procedure for the various governments of the Empire to follow. should try to reduce interest rates, and to use short-term money abundantly. During the last week or so, the present Government has resisted the attempt of the Premier of New South Wales to try to reduce the rate of interest in Australia to 3i per cent. The second line of policy suggested by the currency conference was that an attempt should be made to maintain exchange stabilization consistent with the objective of raising price levels. It will be remembered that for the last two or three months we have been tryingto secure a decision from the Government on this very question. The decision of the conference was reached early in August, and since then, despite the fact that prices of wheat and meat have fallen to an extent never previously experienced, and that the prices of butter and other produce have also fallen, the Government has done nothing to remedy the position, nor has it made a declaration regarding the stabilization of The third recommendation conference was that there should be a smooth and efficient working of the machinery of international trade. should think that the most unlikely thing to make the machinery of international trade work smoothly and efficiently is this Government's action in increasing foreign duties on 440 items. more like putting sand instead of oil into the workings of international trade. The Government should secure margins of preference, not by increasing foreign duties, but by reducing British duties, and I shall move to that effect later. We have enough enemies in the world without making any more by any tariff folly on our part. The door is not yet closed to discussion with on this matter. this agreement, if it does nothing but promote continuous consultation between the governments of the Empire, will have achieved something worthwhile. I urge the Government to use every Dr. Ea/rle Page. effort to secure lower duties and a reclassification of the whole of the tariff is not following schedule so as to make possible a wider range of benefits. The tariff schedule of the United States of America contains something like 10,000 items, while our tariff schedule Tho first was that they has only 600 or 700 items. The schedule of the United States of America' provides for the maximum number of absolutely free items, so as to ensure the efficient and continuous working of the manufacturing industries of that country and the supply of equipment and raw materials at lowest possible prices. I 'should like to see appointed a permanent Imperial economic committee, its personnel drawn from business men, manufacturers and producers of the various dominions, their duty being to ascertain ways and means of promoting Empire trade which will excite not the pity hut the admiration of the world. The Ottawa agreement, which has been said by tbe supporters of the Government to embody wonderful concessions to this country, does not indicate that a very great margin of preference has been given to Australian industry. The Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle exchange. Page), in the early part of his speech, of the condemned the agreement, and later said that it was his intention to support it. If the Country party stands for anything I at all, it should stand for the primary producers. I ask the right honourable member for Cowper what advantage the wheat-grower is likely to get from the agreement? Why were the producers of That is wool, which is the main exportable commodity in this country, so completely forgotten at Ottawa? Then, again, great things have been claimed by the supporters of the Government for the meat industry as a result of this agreement. In my opinion, the British delegation at Ottawa simply played with the Australian delegation, because the agreement provides for a great measure of preference Great Britain to Great Britain, and very little to AusI believe that tralia. The Australian secondary industries have been sacrificed in order to give some little benefit to the primary industries. In view of the Prime Minister's statement to-day regarding the concession on meat, we must conclude that",47,Gullett
135,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [9.42],"there is nothing very binding in the agreement in respect of meat. We are told that we are to obtain the advantage of a concession on meat after 1933, that from the beginning of next year there will be a restriction placed on the imports of foreign beef into Great Britain, and that up to the end of 1933 a preference of 5 per cent., reaching 35 per cent, in 1934, will be granted to Australia. The British Government can review the meat agreement in 1934 if it desires to do so. As the Prime Minister indicated this afternoon, there is likely to be a conference of the various meat producing countries with the object at arriving at a different agreement. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, representatives of Brazil and the Argentine have agreed to confer with representatives of the United Kingdom on the subject of British meat importations. If the Ottawa agreement is satisfactory to the Argentine it is quite evident that it cannot be satisfactory to Australia. Argentine, as we know, sells chilled meat, and we sell frozen meat, the price there, and this will be reflected on the Loudon market. No government can compel its people to buy frozen meat if they have acquired a taste for chilled meat. If it is argued that the agreement will force prices up in Great BritainI reply that no government is likely by parliamentary action to do anything to increase the cost of living. The'British Government is no more likely to tax the principal items of the food of the British people than this Government is likely to tax the principal items of food of the Australian people. The Country party has been trying for a long while to get the Commonwealth Government to agree to a sales tax on flour, but hitherto its efforts have been unsuccessful. Can they then hope that the British Government will impose a tax on the foodstuffs of the people ? One of the dangers that I see in this agreement is that it may lead to retaliation. The Leader of the Country party frequently argues in this House that our policy of high duties is likely to cause retaliation. We often see advertisements in the newspapers advocating that the people who reside in suburban areas should trade in their own suburbs. The Ottawa agreement is really designed to get the different parts of the Empire to trade within tlie Empire. But where will that policy lead us?Great Britain buys only 30 per cent, of our wool clip. We have to sell the other 70 per cent, elsewhere. What will the other customers for our wool think of this agreement? Will they not be likely to make similar agreements with other countries? We know that only 30 per cent, of our wheat goes into Great Britain. We are to be allowed a preference of 3d. a bushel over world parity on this quantity, but what is world parity ? We know that there is a London parity and an Eastern parity. When this agreement comes into force the London parity will disappear. It has been said that Russia will not now be able to sell her wheat in Great Britain. But she will sell it elsewhere. No one has suggested that she will go out of production. Wherever she sells it, the sale will affect world's parity price. If the wheat is dumped on foreign markets it will affect in London. The same remark might be made in regard to Australian beef, mutton and lamb. In the September quarter of last year we exported 26,000,000 lb. of lamb and mutton to Great Britain, but in the corresponding quarter of this year we placed only 4,000,000 lb. of lamb and mutton on that market. This falling off of 22,000,000 lb. is serious. [Quorum formed.] It appears to me that the primary producers in our chief exporting industries, such as the wool and wheat industries, will get little or no monetary benefit from this agreement. One of the Australian representatives at Ottawa was Mr Angliss, who is an exporter of meat. Are the cold stores of Great Britain chock full of meat? Is an effort being made to restrict exports to enable exporters to get rid of the surplus in cold storage? Is this why there has been such a restriction in our export trade during the last quarter? The Government should have made sure that the real primary producers of Australia were represented directly at Ottawa. The Country party claims to represent the man on the land, but did it make any protest against the personnel of the Ottawa delegation? We know very well that that delegation left Australia with an open cheque. The real interests of the primary producers and manufacturers of this country have been sacrificed to those of countries which exploit coloured labour. Our own people, who must find work for their boys and girls, have been left lamenting. The lift ing of the embargoes imposed by the Scullin Government has destroyed the home market for our primary producers. Every one interested in primary production knows that the home market is the best market. The Government acted against the best interests of this country when it virtually placed the fiscal policy of the nation in the hands of the Tariff Board. If such a tribunal is qualified to determine our fiscal policy, a commission of three persons would be just as well qualified to deal with the other problems of government which, properly, should be determined by this Parliament. As a matter of fact, there has been a complete "" sell out"" at Ottawa by tbe Australian representatives. The Minister for Trade and Customs told us that the case for the Australian meat producers was stated at Ottawa by the leader of the delegation, Mr Bruce; but this right honourable gentleman was advised by Mr Tout and Mr Angliss, who are not qualified to speak authoritatively for the real primary producers of this country. Mr Tout and Mr Angliss -represent not the cattle growers, but the meat exporters. In dealing with the meat agreement, the Minister in his speech saidCertainly, the case for dominion beef was not an impressive one. Of the total amount of 1,399,000 tons of beef of all kinds consumed in the United Kingdom in 1931, 800,000 tons was of home British origin. Four hundred and sixty-four thousand tons of chilled beef and 59,000 tons of frozen beef came from South America, chiefly from the Argentine, 57.000 tons of frozen beef came from Australia, and 19.000 tons of frozen beef came from New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand supplied only 5 i per cent, of tlie total consumption and 13 per cent, of the total beef import. Nor was that the real weakness of our case. As honourable members know, chilled beef is more attractive to butchers and consumers than frozen beef, and we in Australia are still awaiting on science for a process that will enable us to transport chilled beef over the long journey to Britain. The claim of the Minister that the meat agreement is a great concession to the man on the land cannot be substantiated, for it cannot have any effect until 1933, Mr Riordan. and may be reviewed by the British Government in 1934. The agreement is not binding on the United Kingdom for five years as are the concessions given by the Commonwealth Government to the United Kingdom. member say that the position of Australia is worse than it was? that even the honourable member will argue that it is any better. Clearly, the bottom has fallen out of the meat market. There is six months' supply of meat in cold storage in Great Britain. The Prime Minister read a statement this afternoon to the effect that the Government had agreed to a further restriction of imports into Great Britain. ber is in error in that statement. member for Barker( Mr Cameron) may think so; but that does not prove the correctness of his assertion. As a result of the restrictions which will operate during the years 1932, 1933 and 1934, there will be a falling off in our lamb and mutton trade with Great Britain, to the advantage of the Argentine, which is not restricted from sending chilled meat to the British market. Again, take the alleged preference of 15s. per cwt., or l£d. per lb., on butter. Denmark has been a heavy supplier of butter to Great Britain. Do honourable members seriously think that Danish producers will go off that market simply because of this negligible concession ? They will simply drop their price, and make our preference useless. Because of those things, I support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. Before any agreement was entered into, the producers of butter, meat, wheat and other Australian products should have been called into conference, and asked to submit recommendations. .Even now, it is not too late for the Government to consult those who are making these sacrifices. I object to an outside tribunal having the power to fix the policy of the Government in connection with the overseas marketing of our products. I think that our primary producers and our manufacturers should have been consulted before the conference was held. Article 11 provides that",48,Gullett

There is no organization representing the closer settlement men, with from 3,000 to 5,000 sheep each. Recently a committee was appointed to inquire into the wool industry. What representation does it give to the small men? There is Mr James Clark, who owns about 150,000 sheep, and who would be considered to be a big grower, but what about the small man ? And what concessions have the banana-growers, cotton growers, and tobacco-growers received? The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) claims that Queensland will get most advantage from this agreement. If that is a fact, I say, "" God help the other States! "" The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Abbott) said that wages are too high; that the cost of production must come down. In 1929, when fixing the basic wage, Chief Judge Dethridge said that if there were a general 10 per cent, reducduce rail freights. Where is the consistion in wages the pastoral, shearing, and all other industries would improve. Has that been borne out by results? Since then wages have fallen, in some cases, by 30 per cent., and the mass of the people have been deprived of their purchasing power. The vicious thing about it is that other charges have not fallen proportionately. Gwydir said that in 1928 the wages on a certain run in New England amounted to £5,000 per annum. They have since fallen to £3,000, or a drop of 36 per cent. On the other hand, the interest bill for the same property has increased during that time from £1,800 to £2,121 per annum, or an increase of 12 per cent. The honourable member has not fought for a reduction of interest charges. strenuous fight for the reduction of interest. ber certainly puts up a good scrap for his absent friend, but neither he nor his party has done anything to bring about a reduction of interest. only last week. ment was in power for two years, and did everything possible to effect a reduction Wool-growers in interest.

They had Sir Robert Gibson, the representative of the bankers, brought before the bar of the Senate in connection with the Central Reserve Bank Bill when the Labour party was fighting to secure for the people some relief from the banks. Is the same opportunity to be given to the interests affected by tha Ottawa agreement to state their case at the bar of this House? do that. as it stated their case in connection with the Central Reserve Bank Bill, the Wheat Bill, and cotton and tobacco matters, God help the primary producers. Neither this Government nor the Country party has done anything to retency of a Government, which continually cries for reduced costs of production and at the same time increases taxation?

I do not believe that anything we are likely to gain will compensate for the loss which the Australian growers of bananas will suffer. It is true that a limit has been placed upon the quantity of F i j i bananas which are to be admitted; but this concession is the thin end of the wedge. It has been said that F i j i I bananas will be admitted only to Sydney and Melbourne; but how is the agreement to be policed to prevent the bananas from going elsewhere as well ?
