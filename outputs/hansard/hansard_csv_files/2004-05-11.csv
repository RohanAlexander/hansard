Drugs: International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (Question No. 2208) upon notice, on 12 August 2003: (1) Does the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report identify suspicious international transactions. (2) Has that report reflected the increasing exploitation of electronic money routes and the development of cyber-laundering. (3) What steps are being taken by the Australian Government to combat those phenomena. the honourable member’s question: (1) No. The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) provides some information identified by the US but does not identify suspicious international transactions. Financial intelligence data is usually subject to strict privacy requirements and limited to law enforcement agencies within the country of origin. As is the case in Australia, financial intelligence is only exchanged with other countries on the basis of undertakings on the secure and discreet handling of the data. (2) No. The INCSR is the US Department of State’s annual report on illicit drug-control and money laundering activities in more than 140 countries. The INCSR is prepared in accordance with reporting requirements of the US Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and as such does not reflect on the increasing exploitation of electronic money routes or the development of cyber-laundering. (3) Steps being taken by the Australian Government to combat the exploitation of electronic money routes and the development of cyber-laundering are covered in submissions by Australian Government agencies to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission’s Inquiry into Cybercrime.

The Government allocated a further $4m in the 2002-03 Budget to be provided to legal aid commissions over 4 years as part of its ‘Keeping people out of courts’ initiative.

As a consequence there are variations between LACs in the level of detail provided in response to some parts of the question. The information provided relates to PDR services funded by LACs for family law matters. It does not include information on PDR type services which LACs may provide in relation to State or Territory law matters. (1) The Commonwealth priorities and guidelines for legal assistance require that, except in inappropriate circumstances, LACs try PDR services to resolve family law disputes before making a grant of legal assistance for court proceedings. PDR services for the resolution of Commonwealth funded family law matters have been established, or are currently in the process of being established, by LACs in all States and Territories. (2) (a) Expenditure information provided by LACs for PDR services is set out in the table below. The information does not cover all years for which LACs have been providing these services because LAC records of expenditure on family law matters have not always identified PDR costs separately. Only Legal Aid NSW was in a position to provide information on PDR expenditure prior to 2000-01.

It is based upon a combination of mediation, conciliation and evaluation, although the focus is on mediation. Applications for legal aid are considered for PDR in accordance with Commonwealth legal aid guidelines and Commission policy. The Commission has both in-house and external chairpersons and conferences are held throughout New South Wales. The chairpersons notify the parties and their solicitors of the role of the chairperson in making recommendations on future legal aid funding in a report at the completion of the conference. These recommendations may be taken into consideration by the grants officer in reviewing an application by a party for legal aid to commence or continue court proceedings. A party has the right to appeal any decision on legal aid funding to the Legal Aid Review Committee. The majority of services are provided at the early intervention stage, before court proceedings are instituted. Clients who are referred to conferencing are provided with a grant of legal aid. Clients can also be referred to litigation conferences at any stage in the court process. The grant of aid covers 2 hours of preparation by the lawyers, up to 4 hours pro rata attendance at the conference and 1 hour for filing of consent orders. Applications deemed unsuitable for conferencing are assessed in accordance with means, merit test and Commonwealth Guidelines and Priorities. If applicants are eligible, aid will then be granted for court proceedings. The Commission has also established the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Family Mediation service (ATSIFAM), a special dispute resolution scheme for Indigenous Australians. The Indigenous project aims to develop a mediation process especially tailored to meet the cultural and other needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The ATSIFAM project is currently operating in South West Sydney and Dubbo. Victoria: Before deciding to establish its own PDR service Victoria Legal Aid referred legal aid clients with family law disputes to PDR services provided by organisations such as the Family Court and Commonwealth funded PDR providers. In 2002, Victoria Legal Aid's Board decided to establish an in-house family law conferencing program for legally assisted clients called Roundtable Dispute Management. In addition to its main conferencing program, the service will also offer a small component of short-term conciliation counselling to clients of the program. The family law conference will form the core of the Roundtable Dispute Management program. The conference will be attended by the parties, their respective lawyers, a legal representative for the child (if one is allocated) and a family law conference chairperson. The conference will generally be a one-off session of up to four hours. The aim of the family law conference is to: provide a non-adversarial forum for parties in dispute to discuss and resolve a family law dispute formalise agreements into consent orders, if appropriate enable parties to have a better understanding, or narrow the issues in dispute, where a complete agreement has not been possible ensure that discussions regarding parenting matters are focussed on the best interests of the child ensure that agreements reached in a family law conference are fair, durable and child focussed equip parties with the strategies that will minimise future conflicts and prevent matters inappropriately re-entering the legal system minimise the need for further grants of legal assistance. Queensland: Legal Aid Queensland operates an in-house conferencing program for legal aid clients with family law disputes. The purpose is to facilitate the resolution of the parties’ family law issues by providing a forum where people in dispute can talk to each other in a supported environment and thereby have the opportunity to resolve their problems themselves. The focus is on early intervention conferences prior to the initiation of Family Court proceedings. The aims of the conferencing program are to assist the parties reach an early resolution of their dispute and, if a resolution is not achieved, to assist in the assessment of whether either or both of the parties should be funded for court. Legal Aid Queensland also operates a property arbitration program. This program is designed to assist married parties who have separated and have property law issues to attend to the division of their matrimonial property and financial resources. There are 3 methods by which a matter may enter the property arbitration program: direct application – clients may apply for funding for property arbitration or property settlement generally family law conference referral – clients may be referred for property arbitration where they have participated in a family law conference in relation to child matters and property settlement has been identified as an unresolved issue, and court ordered arbitration – the Court has the power to refer parties, who have property settlement proceedings before the Court, to the property arbitration program by consent. South Australia: During 2000-01 and 2001-02 the Legal Services Commission of South Australia provided a range of options to enable parties to have access, at all stages of a family law dispute, to a process which offers alternative resolution methods. The Commission provided a 3 stage PDR model: Stage1 – prior to the institution of proceedings (a counsellor or a lawyer to provide early intervention assistance); Stage2 – after the institution of proceedings (a counsellor, or a lawyer, to chair a conciliation conference involving both parties); and Stage3 – near the end of proceedings (a lawyer to chair a funding conference involving both parties and their lawyers). The Commission has subsequently decided to change the format of its PDR program. Services in 2003-04 will be provided with a greater emphasis on a family law conferencing model, the major focus being conferences held at an early stage of the family law dispute. A PDR coordinator has been appointed to oversee the delivery of these services in the current financial year. Western Australia: Legal Aid Western Australia operates a four tiered family law conference program (Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) 1 – 4): ADR1 – for very minor family law disputes; ADR2 – for contact disputes involving relatively simple issues; ADR3 – for more difficult contact issues, residence disputes and property matters (the greatest percentage of matters fall into this category and most involve child welfare issues); and ADR4 – a late intervention conference for serious family law disputes involving contact and/or residence and/or property issues that have failed to settle where there is ongoing litigation in the Family Court. Tasmania: The Legal Aid Commission of Tasmania operates an in-house PDR conferencing program. The conferencing model utilised is mediation within a legal framework, with the outcome of the conference determining whether or not legal aid is continued. Most conferences are held at the beginning of the case, before proceedings have commenced in the Family Court, although they may also occur later in the case. The aim of the program is to assist legally aided clients with their family law disputes at an early stage, before the issues become too entrenched to be resolved without litigation. The parties are granted aid to attend a conference with their solicitor. A Chair is appointed to conduct the conference and the parties are encouraged to participate and hopefully negotiate an agreement that both are happy with. This agreement is then incorporated into consent orders that are registered in the Family Court. The Chair provides a report to the Commission with recommendations as to future funding in the event that the matter does not settle. ACT: The Legal Aid Office (ACT) operates an in-house PDR conferencing program. The conferences are intended to test the merits of a case for ongoing aid, manage parties’ expectations and facilitate resolution. All conferences operated by the Office are shuttle conferences (where the parties are in separate rooms and the chairperson moves between them). The Legal Aid Office also plans to establish a property arbitration program which will be similar to that currently operated by Legal Aid Queensland. Northern Territory: The Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission provides grants of aids to clients, seeking to resolve family law disputes, for solicitor negotiations and referral of matters assessed as appropriate for mediation to relevant community organisations. The Commission commenced an in-house conferencing program similar to that provided by the Legal Aid Commission of Tasmania in February 2004. (4) The following information provided by legal aid commissions, where available, relates to the number of grants of legal aid which have been made for PDR and the average size of each grant. New South Wales: Total conferencing grants finalised Average Cost$ 1992-93 1 175.00 1993-94 44 332.39 1994-95 188 343.16 1995-96 214 328.54 1996-97 254 457.99 1997-98 272 588.13 1998-99 484 567.37 1999-00 1007 354.26 2000-01 1260 468.20 2001-02 2406 582.84 2002-03 3151 586.34 Victoria: Not applicable.

(3) In respect of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAP) website titled “A natural resource management overview” (www.napswq.gov.au/publications/nrm%20overview.html) which notes that “Governments will invest in regional plans based on clear targets and appropriate monitoring to ensure the best natural resource management outcomes”, (a) does this mean that the Government will only invest in actions directly linked to targets, (b) will the Government only invest in actions for which there are “appropriate” monitoring arrangements, and (c) what is meant by “appropriate” in the context of salinity and water quality monitoring. (4) In respect of the importance of water quality, acknowledged in both the NAP and the NHT, what are the Government’s minimum water quality monitoring requirements to be addressed in a regional NRM plan for it to invest in water quality improvements. (5) In respect of the NAP website titled “A natural resource management overview” which notes that “The extension includes a $350 million commitment to water quality issues.”, (a) what does “commitment to water quality issues” mean, and (b) is this different to the actual Government commitment to spending “directly on measures to improve our water quality”. (6) What are the specialist advisory bodies referred to on the NAP website titled “A natural resource management overview” which notes that for NHT regional NRM plans “there is an iterative process of feedback and advice from all levels of Government and specialist advisory bodies leading up to accreditation…”. (7) In respect of the NAP website titled “A natural resource management overview” which notes that “plans need to make a commitment within three years of signing the bilateral agreement, to have in place, or significant progress to, the establishment of a minimum set of regional resource condition targets”, is this minimum set the same minimum set of 10 resource condition matters for targets under the Standards and Targets Framework. (8) How will property rights and water pricing lead to improved water quality or dryland salinity as stated on the NAP website titled “A natural resource management overview” which notes that “clarification of property rights and appropriate pricing of water is fundamental in the management and remediation of water quality and salinity”. (9) Are there any NAP or NHT program areas that directly support institutional reform and capacity building, or the establishment of market-based instruments or economic-incentives, as an offset to the non-binding nature of the reform commitments made under the bilateral agreements. (1) The $12.7m announced in the media release of 19 June 2003 is for: $5.2m Foundation Funding $6.8m Regional Priority Actions $0.7m Statewide Projects Foundation Funding is to assist regional groups develop NRM plans. Summaries of the Regional Priority Actions and Statewide Projects were included in an attachment to the media release. (2) The percentage of funds spent on ambient environmental monitoring will vary between regions. The costs of monitoring will depend on the type of monitoring required and the degree to which existing monitoring infrastructure and programs can provide the required information. No benchmark has been set for investing in monitoring because variation between regions means nominating a fixed percentage is inappropriate. Use of a fixed percentage would be likely to result in either over or under investment depending on regional circumstances. (3) (a) In regard to the implementation of regional plans, the answer is yes. (3) (b) Yes (3) (c) Investment in monitoring will be considered appropriate provided it meets the following criteria: Investment proposals which address resource condition targets must include a monitoring evaluation and reporting component; The monitoring and reporting component must utilise existing monitoring wherever possible. Investment by the program could support new and additional monitoring requirements which,",96,Questions On Notice
146,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:following consideration of an appropriate cost/benefit analysis, would be fully funded as part of the investment proposal. Monitoring and reporting components of investment proposals must be consistent with the State/Territory requirements for the relevant core indicator; Each State/Territory would aim to have a medium to long term strategy for the maintenance and development of the indicators in the core set In the development or review of its strategy for the maintenance and development of the indicators in the core set, each State/Territory would consult with the NLWRA and make best endeavours to ensure that the proposed plan or strategy is consistent with the data requirements for reporting on the core set of natural resource management indicators Appropriate monitoring will also use the locally relevant indicators selected from the set of resource condition indicators that have been agreed by the Monitoring and Evaluation Working Group. These are available at www.deh.gov.au/nrm/monitoring. In relation to salinity and water quality, the locally appropriate indicators would be selected from: Depth to groundwater Groundwater salinity Location and size of salt affected areas Total Nitrogen+ flow leaving sub-catchment or whole catchment Total Phosphorus + flow leaving sub-catchment or whole catchment Turbidity OR Total Suspended Solids (TSS) + Flow Total dissolved solids (TDS) + Flow OR Electrical conductivity (EC) + Flow (4) Regional plans will be required to address the matters for target including those related to water quality. Where targets have been set and where investment occurs to meet these targets then monitoring will be required to measure progress in achieving the targets. The actual monitoring requirements will vary according to the level of investment occurring and the type of monitoring required. As these requirements will be determined regionally and be regionally specific, it is not possible to provide a universal definition of minimum water quality monitoring requirements. (5) (a) In the 2001 election, the Prime Minister committed to spend at least $350 million of the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust extension directly on measures to improve water quality. Operational guidelines against this commitment have been developed using the National Water Quality Management Strategy which provides a consistent approach to water quality management. Trust projects are assessed to determine whether or not the constituent activities (or parts thereof) contribute to: (i) directly improving one or more of the physical, chemical or biological attributes of the identified marine or aquatic ecosystem and/or waterbody; or (ii) establishing specific management plans and baseline data for, and/or monitoring of, marine or aquatic ecosystems and/or waterbodies.’ (5) (b) No. (6) The regional body seeks advice from a wide range of specialist advisory bodies, differing from region to region as appropriate to that community. These specialist advisory bodies are listed in the regional plan or supporting documentation. The Steering Committee and each government also have the capacity to seek specialist or external comment on draft plans. In the case of the Australian Government this may include the Bureau of Rural Sciences, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, and consultation with other portfolios or agencies (such as the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the Australian Greenhouse Office), or use of external providers. (7) Yes (8) The NAP website quoted refers to ‘water quality and salinity’ not ‘water quality and dryland salinity’. The clarification of property rights and water pricing will lead to improved water quality and salinity through providing an incentive for water use efficiency and encouraging the trade of water away from areas where salinity may be reducing the productivity of a property. Improved water use efficiency will result in less water entering the water tables and hence lower saline water tables, reducing salinity impacts in these areas. As a result less saline water will return to river systems improving water quality in these rivers. Dryland salinity will continue to be addressed through other initiatives under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. (9) Institutional reform and capacity building are integral components of both the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust extension. This is reflected in both the Intergovernmental agreements and the Bilateral agreements signed by the Australian Government and the States. Working Groups relating to Community Engagement and Capacity Building, and Market Based Instruments have been established under the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council. The Community Engagement and Capacity Building Working Group seeks to provide a common and consistent approach to capacity building across jurisdictions. In particular, the Working Group places emphasis on ensuring that capacity building investments are strategic and well targeted. It also focuses on ensuring that mechanisms for monitoring the impact of these investments on resource condition are developed and adopted by all jurisdictions. In addition, the Working Group is responsible for spearheading the development of multi-jurisdictional resources and guidelines to support regions in more effectively planning for their capacity building activities. The Australian Government is an active participant of the working group, and is a driving force behind many of its initiatives. The Australian Government NRM Team is also instigating and supporting the establishment of a pilot capacity building region in each jurisdiction. Through these pilots, innovative ways of planning for, implementing and monitoring capacity building investments will be road-tested, with the results informing planning processes in other regions within the jurisdiction. The Market Based Instruments (MBI) Working Group was established to support the NRM Ministerial Council in its consideration of market based instruments by: 1. advising on significant impediments to the effective and efficient operation of MBIs and on potential approaches for addressing those impediments; 2. providing advice to establish and guide joint Australian, State and Territory Government, and private sector investment in MBI pilots; 3. monitoring and reporting on the effectiveness of MBI pilot projects; 4. providing advice and support material concerning the education of Natural Resource Management managers, including landholders, on MBIs, including a best practice education kit; and 5. providing advice on engaging industry and other stakeholders in MBI pilot projects. Currently, the MBI Working Group's key responsibility is to oversee and report on the first round of MBI pilot projects. Membership of the MBI working group includes the Australian Government, each State and Territory Government, and CSIRO. Environment: Flora for Fauna Program (Question No. 2780) Mr Organ asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 24 November 2003: (1) Is he aware that many of the recommended plants included in the “Flora for Fauna” scheme administered by the Nursery and Garden Industry Australia under the Environment Australia Natural Heritage Trust are privately owned cultivars that do not occur in nature and are protected by plant breeders rights, and that authentic Australian plants are not the sole focus of “Flora for Fauna”. (2) Is he aware that the propagation of artificial hybrids and cultivars results in genetically identical clones that contribute nothing to biodiversity. (3) Is he aware of CSIRO findings that artificial hybrids hybridise with naturally occurring species, contaminating the local gene pool. (4) Is he aware that artificial hybrids with extended flowering seasons favour sedentary, territorial honeyeaters like the Noisy Minor, which are strongly implicated in the reduction of bird species diversity in urban areas. (5) Can he explain the basis of the claim that the “Flora for Fauna” program enhances biodiversity and environmental education. (1) Yes. The Australian Government provided funding for the initial development of the Flora for Fauna program in 2001 to encourage broader understanding by the horticultural industry and the community, of the importance of biodiversity and the planting of native species. The original list of recommended plants, of over 300 species, included hybrids, cultivars and selected forms. All plants on the list were assessed as having characteristics that would provide habitat benefits for fauna species. (2) No. Artificial hybrids and cultivars may provide food and shelter for fauna in areas where original native vegetation may be depleted. (3) Yes. In some circumstances artificial cultivars may hybridise with native endemic species. (4) No. Hybrid species may be important for food sources, shelter and habitat areas for birds and other fauna, especially in the urban environment. The Flora for Fauna website provides information for enhancing the habitat value of gardens to benefit a wide range of fauna. (5) The Flora for Fauna program focuses on enhancing biodiversity and environmental education by ensuring that: Australian plants are the sole focus of ‘Flora for Fauna’ Plants available through ‘Flora for Fauna’ must provide a genuine benefit to native fauna Plants available through ‘Flora for Fauna’ are commercially available and viable and will perform in gardens.

(4) In respect of the donors on the ABMDR, (a) how many are there, (b) is the number of donors considered to be adequate, and (c) has he, or his department, received any professional advice or recommendation on the number of donors that should be on the register; if so, what was the advice or recommendation. (5) In respect of donors of non-Anglo-Celtic ancestory, is he able to say (a) how many donors of nonAnglo-Celtic ancestry are on the ABMDR, (b) what proportion of the total number of donors they represent, and (c) whether they are present on the register in the same proportion as their representation in the community as a whole. (6) Are Australians of non-Anglo-Celtic ancestry disadvantaged by the size and composition of the (7) Is a patient of non-Anglo-Celtic ancestry as likely to find a donor match as a patient of AngloCeltic ancestry; if not, why not. (8) Does the ABMDR have a problem with the number and composition of its registered donors; if not, why not; if so, what is he doing to address the problem. (9) Is he aware of any overseas registry that has attempted to address a problem with the number and composition of its registered donors. (10) How many new donors have been added to the ABMDR in the financial years ending 30 June (a) 1999, (b) 2000, (c) 2001, (d) 2002, and (e) 2003. (11) What is the cost of adding new donors to the registry and has any additional funding been provided to increase the donor database.",105,Questions On Notice
149,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to(12) Is it the case that the ABMDR has been forced to delay donors’ registration because it does not have enough money to test and register volunteers. (13) For (a) the United Kingdom, (b) Cyprus, (c) the USA, (d) Israel, and (e) Germany, (i) how many bone marrow donors are registered, (ii) what proportion of the population are registered donors, and (iii) what has been the percentage increase in the number of registered donors over the last two years. (1) No. Prior to 1 July 2001, all jurisdictions contributed to the operational funding of the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Register (ABMDR) on a cost shared basis in accordance with a 1990 recommendation from the National Health and Medical Research Council. From1 July 2001, the Australian Government has been the sole provider of this funding. (2) A copy of the recommendation is being sought from the archives. (3) (a) and (b) See Question1 above.

(b) The ABMDR have advised the Department of Health and Ageing that the number of donors on the register is considered adequate. The vast majority of donors worldwide, are from a North West European background and the ABMDR does not actively pursue donors from this background. Since 2000, the ABMDR has been keen to increase the genetic diversity to cater for ethnic minority groups. (c) No. (5) (a), (b) and (c) The ABMDR does not collect donor ancestry information using the categories – Anglo-Celtic or non-Anglo-Celtic. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), in the 2001 Census, collected information on Australian ancestry using the Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups which recognises the self-defined and self-reported ancestries of all Australians. Anglo-Celtic is not a category identified by the ABS for ancestry. (6) No. The ABMDR is part of a worldwide network of donor registries of unrelated donors. It is currently the sixth largest register in the world and has access to over 8 million donor registrations globally which provides for a large base of ancestry mixes. (7) See answer to (5) above. (8) Since 2000, the ABMDR has had a policy of no active recruitment for North West European backgrounds however they are keen to increase the genetic diversity to cater for ethnic minority groups in Australia. The two ways the ABMDR approach any shortage of donors for a patient who is in an ethnic minority group in Australia are: 1. Search the Registry in the country of the patient’s origin; 2. Encourage friends and family of the individual to join the Australian registry not only for their family member/friends, but for anyone and in particular for those people from their own background not well represented on the ABMDR. Both of these methods are pursued on a case by case basis by the ABMDR.

(4) The table at number (3) above contains the reason codes for refusal decisions of applicants seeking to meet the secondary criteria. Some of the refusals for “ineligible”, “failed to satisfy several criteria”, or “other grounds” might have related to people in a same-sex relationship with the person who met the primary criteria but the statistical data does not break the reasons for refusal down further. (5) While there are records of complaints made to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs by individuals in same-sex relationships who have been unable to obtain subclass 457 Business (Long Stay) visas for their partners, there are no recorded complaints from Australian businesses about the difficulties in sponsoring skilled workers from overseas who happen to be in same-sex relationships. The issue has been raised from time to time with departmental officers on an informal basis. A Review of the Temporary Residence Program was conducted from 2000 to June 2002. In the context of that Review, two respondents (National Australia Bank and Arthur Anderson) drew attention to the inability for same-sex partners to be included in temporary residence visa applications, and the difficulties this causes for businesses wishing to sponsor temporary skilled employees from overseas. The Review’s Report, In Australia’s Interests, suggested that there is a need for some provisions for same sex partners for temporary resident applicants. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is currently investigating the options for implementing this suggestion. Justice: Periodic Detention (Question No. 2852) upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) Has the Minister seen a report that more than one third of Federal offenders who have been sentenced to periodic detention in NSW are not turning up to serve their time and that the NSW Justice Minister has described the situation as scandalous. (2) Is it a fact that under Commonwealth laws a person can indefinitely avoid attending periodic detention if he or she has what is termed a reasonable excuse. (3) How many people have been convicted and sentenced to periodic detention in each of the States and Territories under Commonwealth laws in the last 12 months. (4) How many have been reported to the Commonwealth as not meeting their detention obligations. (5) What action is the Government taking on this matter. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. As at 23 March 2004, out of a total of 48 federal prisoners sentenced to periodic detention in New South Wales, 12 are currently in breach of their orders. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) has commenced action against 11. The remaining case was only referred to the CDPP recently and is being assessed. Eight offenders are on leave of absence granted by the NSW Commissioner of Corrective Services. (2) No. The NSW Commissioner of Corrective Services has power under section 87 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) to grant leave of absence to a federal prisoner subject to a periodic detention order for health, compassionate and other reasons. If a prisoner is given leave of absence, then that prisoner is not in breach of his/her periodic detention order. Under section 20AC of the Crimes Act 1914, the CDPP may take action by way of summons or warrant to bring an offender before a Court to be dealt with on the breach of a periodic detention order. The Court is unable to take action against an offender who has a reasonable cause or excuse for not complying with the order. (3) There were 30 federal offenders sentenced to periodic detention in New South Wales during the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003. No federal offenders during that period were sentenced to periodic detention in the ACT, the only other jurisdiction where this sentencing disposition is available.

(5) The CDPP is actively seeking to achieve compliance with periodic detention orders by bringing those who fail to comply before the Courts for re-sentencing. The Government is also considering options for the revision of the system for the administration of periodic detention for federal offenders. Presidential Visit: Security Arrangements (Question No. 2876) Mr Brereton asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) What was the total cost to the Australian Government of security arrangements and measures put in place for the visit to Australia of the US President, Mr George W. Bush, in October 2003. (2) What was the cost to the Australian Government of operations by the Royal Australian Air Force to provide security during the US President’s visit. (1) I am advised that as at 22 December 2003 the total cost of security arrangements to the Australian Government for the visit by President Bush was $781,827.50. This amount is exclusive of ongoing salary costs and GST and includes the amount in (2) below. (2) The additional cost of support provided by the RAAF was $152,000. This represents the additional cost of undertaking the operation and recognises that the Australian Defence Force is already funded by the Australian Government to raise, train and maintain personnel and equipment in preparation for operational contingencies. Official Gifts (Question No. 2880) Mr Brereton asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 4 December 2003: (1) What is the value of the current three-year contract for the provision of official gifts by Jaymac Promotional Advertising Proprietary Limited in association with Beaver Galleries. (2) What services are provided to the Australian Government under this contract. (3) What company or organisation previously provided these services and at what cost. (1) I am advised that payment of this contract is upon receipt of services.

The report noted that, at that time, the national DNA database system was not fully operational because Ministerial arrangements had not yet been entered into to enable the comparison of DNA profiles across all jurisdictions. However, most jurisdictions have now made arrangements. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and Australian Health Ethics Committee have prepared a report titled ‘Essentially Yours: The Protection of Human Genetic Information in Australia’. This report was tabled in Parliament on 29 May 2003. It makes several recommendations pertaining to the national DNA database. The Government has referred the recommendations to the Standing Committee of Attorneys General/Australasian Police Ministers’ Council Joint Working Group on Crossborder Investigation Powers. Crime: National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (Question No. 2974) upon notice, on 10 February 2004: Has an evaluation been undertaken of the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System; if so, what did that evaluation reveal. the honourable member’s question: An evaluation has not been undertaken. However, a post implementation review was completed in November 2002. The review conducted by CrimTrac in consultation with all police jurisdictions was designed to: highlight issues encountered by the Project Team during system implementation detail lessons learned for any future replacement programme, and obtain jurisdictional comment on the functionality, capability and general user satisfaction with the new system. In brief the review identified the following: 1. A new National Automated Fingerprint Identification System, as specified in the Inter-Governmental Agreement that established the CrimTrac Agency, was successfully delivered and implemented in 2001, within the budget allocated by the Commonwealth. 2. Jurisdictions were highly satisfied with the functionality and capabilities of the new NAFIS delivered by CrimTrac and SAGEM SA (the vendor). 3. As a direct result of higher than expected transaction rates for crime scene and person identification processes a major capacity upgrade for NAFIS was required earlier than expected. (I am advised that the CrimTrac Board of Management approved the upgrade and that it was completed in March 2003, effectively doubling the processing capabilities of the system in Canberra.) 4. Livescan integration was highlighted as a priority by police agencies to enable ‘real time’ identification of persons of interest to police. A Livescan device located in a police station and connected to the of day or night and permits the identification of a person in custody to be completed within minutes, rather than hours, days or weeks. This means that persons of interest can be quickly identified if they are already recorded on the NAFIS and can then be charged or released, as the circumstances dictate.",119,Questions On Notice

(2) For each of the last five financial years, what sums have been recovered to cover the cost of removing stowaways whose applications for a protection visa failed, and from which supply companies were these sums recovered. (3) Does the Government attempt to recover the cost of detention and processing of ship jumpers who seek protection, including the cost of removing them from Australia if their applications for protection visas fail; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The increase in the average cost of detention is directly related to the changes in the detainee population at detention facilities and a loss of economies of scale. Also as a proportion of the current detainee population has been in detention for long periods of time the cost of intensively managing the individual cases results in further increases in cost. (2) Statistical reports on stowaways are not available prior to October 2000 when new procedures for the recording of stowaways were put in place. A total of 48 stowaways were reported at Australia’s sea border during the period 1 July 2001 to 29 February 2004. Of these 48, 31 have since departed, 2 are unlawfully in Australia, 1 was granted a visa and 14 have made applications for Protection Visas (PV). As of the end of February, of those 14 PV applicants, 8 have been granted PVs, 3 are in the process of review and 3 have had their applications refused and have been removed from Australia. For each of the 3 stowaways who have been removed from Australia, the shipping company responsible for bringing that stowaway to Australia has directly paid the costs of their removal. The companies are Zenith Shipping (2 stowaways) and Dorine Shipping (1 stowaway). (3) Yes. A deserter who arrives lawfully as a crewmember is individually liable for the costs of their detention and removal. Repayment of a debt to the Commonwealth is a criterion in respect of future visa applications.

175,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous AffairsEmployment: People with Disabilities (Question No. 3004) Ms George asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 11 February 2004: (1) Is the Minister aware that the Greenacres Association in the Illawarra, through its Work Wise Program, has been helping disabled people into open employment at award wages for 10 years. (2) Has the Government found that specialist organisations, such as Greenacres Work Wise, are effective in finding open employment at award wages for people with a disability. (3) Is the Minister able to say why the Department of Workplace Relations is undertaking a pilot project that is designed to find open employment for people with a disability and does this duplicate the function of specialist organisations that already perform this function. (4) Do Job Network providers have the level of experience and expertise of specialist organisations in finding open employment at award wages for people with a disability; if not, are they unlikely to have the same level of success in finding open employment for disabled job seekers. (5) What reasons would prevent the additional placement of disabled people in open employment at award wages by removing the “Cap” on the number of participants who are able to be funded by specialist organisations. (6) Will the Minister remove the “Cap” so that specialist organisations like Greenacres can extend their services to a greater number of people including those on their waiting lists; if not, why not. (7) Will the Minister ensure that responsibility for the pilot project is vested in his Department rather than the Department of Workplace Relations and the Job Network; if not, why not. (8) Will the Minister guarantee that disabled job seekers will not be breached and lose their benefits if Job Network providers become responsible for the pilot project; if not, why not. (9) Will the Minister guarantee that Job Network providers will comply with the twelve disability service standards in their dealings with jobseekers with a disability; if not, why not. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations pilot is targeting those people who can be assisted by the Job Network– primarily those who do not have ongoing support needs in work. The Pilot does not duplicate the Disability Employment Assistance and Vocational Rehabilitation services provided by FaCS for job seekers who have difficulty in gaining and retaining employment without rehabilitation or ongoing support. (4) The Job Network Providers undertaking the Pilot are specialist disability Job Network members. Half of these specialist Job Network providers are also funded to provide specialist employment services under the Disability Services Act, 1986. (5) The aim of the reforms to disability employment services is to address historical funding inequity and provide responsive, value for money services, deliver quality employment outcomes through consistent quality services, improve accountability and flexibility in meeting client needs, and to provide informed choice and better targeting of services. Further expansion of the disability employment funding beyond that already announced in past Budgets cannot be realistically considered until the reforms are implemented.

In accordance with the National Archives of Australia – Administrative Functions Disposal Authority, records documenting requests for public access to records and documents under the FOI Act for less complex requests are destroyed two years after action is completed. In addition, Defence does not maintain records of the specific information sought. Freedom of Information (Question No. 3166) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 1 March 2004: (1) Can the Minister indicate (a) whether the Minister’s department has a dedicated Freedom of Information (FOI) officer, and (b) how many officers are employed to deal with FOI requests, and (c) at what levels they are employed. (2) How many applications did the department have under the FOI Act in the 2002-2003 financial year and how did this figure compare to previous years. (3) How many internal reviews of applications occurred in the last financial year and how many internal reviews affirmed the original decision. (4) Can the information in (2) and (3) be broken down into applications requesting individual information and applications requesting information for other reasons (i.e. media, opposition MPs etc). (5) What proportion of cases go to external review and what proportion of these are upheld.

(8) In respect of refusals to grant requests, can the Minister provide details on (a) which exemption categories are used when information is refused, and (b) what proportion of refusals are in each category (i.e. commercial-in-confidence and other categories). (9) Will the Minister provide statistics over the last 5 years indicating whether the use of particular exemption categories is static, falling or increasing. (1) (a), (b) and (c) The Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) has a dedicated Freedom of Information (FOI) Officer. Receipt of FOI requests and processing advice is undertaken by 0.5 of an APS6 employee, and 0.4 of an APS3 employee. In addition, 0.4 of a Legal1 employee provides legal advice on processing of FOI requests to departmental decision makers. FOI requests, following their receipt, are forwarded to a delegated decision maker within the program area to which the request relates. There are no other staff in the Department employed to deal with FOI requests. However, there are a number of staff who, because of their official duties, become involved, from time to time, in particular FOI requests – such as the delegated decision maker in a program area to which the request relates. (2) In the 2002-2003 financial year, the Department had 132 FOI applications. A comparison of FOI applications for the previous three years reveals that: for 2001-2002, 97 applications were received; for 1999-2000, 74 applications were received; and for 1998-1999, 114 applications were received. (3) Five internal reviews of applications occurred in the last financial year. One internal review affirmed the original decision. (4) The information in questions (2) and (3) has been broken down as follows: In 2002 – 2003, four applications were received which requested access to documents containing personal information; and 128 applications were received requesting access to documents which contain information other than personal information. (5) For the 2002 – 2003 financial year, three applications were lodged for external review with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), of which, two applications are still before the AAT. The third application was withdrawn by the applicant, without concession by the Department. (6) (a), (b) and (c) The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) prescribes charges of a $30.00 application fee for an FOI request, and a $40.00 application fee for an internal review request. There are also processing charges, such as, for search and retrieval, decision making time, and photocopying of documents. Application fees charged for the 2002 – 2003 financial year, were $3,650.00 with the total amount being collected. Processing charges notified to applicants, for the 2002 – 2003 financial year, were $72,904.00, with the total amount collected being $9,905.00. Nine percent of application fees were waived in the 2002 – 2003 financial year. The FOI Act does not require agencies to collect information on waived processing charges. As such, the Department does not collect this information. For the Department to provide an accurate figure on the proportion of charges waived, would require an unreasonable diversion of resources. (7) The Department did not have any expenditure associated with defending FOI appeals. (8) (a), (b) The exemption provisions predominantly used by the Department, in the 2002 – 2003 financial year, and the amount of requests that applied these exemptions, are outlined in the table below.",153,Questions On Notice
204,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Exemption section Category Number of exemptions (FOI Act) in 2002-2003 43 documents relating to business affairs 48 45 documents containing material obtained in 24 confidence 22 deletion of exempt matter or irrelevant mate22 rial 36 internal working documents 18 40 documents concerning certain operations of 14 agencies 24A requests may be refused if documents cannot 14 be found or do not exist 38 documents to which secrecy provisions of 12 enactments apply 41 documents affecting personal privacy 11 37 documents affecting enforcement of law and 5 protection of public safety It should be noted, each FOI request may involve a number of documents, and more than one exemption may be claimed over each document. (9) The FOI Act does not require agencies to collect statistics on particular use of exemption categories. As such, the Department does not collect this information. For the Department to collate statistics on particular use of exemption categories, over a five-year period, would require an unreasonable diversion of resources. Freedom of Information (Question No. 3167) Ms Roxon asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 March 2004: (1) Can the Minister indicate (a) whether the Minister’s department has a dedicated Freedom of Information (FOI) officer, and (b) how many officers are employed to deal with FOI requests, and (c) at what levels they are employed? (2) How many applications did the department have under the FOI Act in the 2002-03 financial year and how did this figure compare to previous years? (3) How many internal reviews of applications occurred in the last financial year and how many times have internal reviews affirmed the original decision? (4) Can the information in (2) and (3) be broken into those requesting individual information and applications requesting information for other reasons (i.e. media, opposition MPs etc)? (5) What proportion of cases go to external review and what proportion of these are upheld? (6) In respect of fees for FOI applications, (a) how much was charged, (b) how much of this was actually collected, and what proportion of fees were waived? (7) How much did the Minister’s department spend in defending FOI appeals? (8) In respect of refusals to grant requests, can the Minister provide details on (a) which exemption categories are used when information is refused, and (b) what proportion of refusals are in each category (i.e. commercial-in-confidence ground other categories)? (9) Will the Minister provide statistics over the last five years indicating whether the use of particular exemption categories is static, falling or increasing? (1) The Attorney-General’s Department employs three full time officers who have the sole responsibility of processing all FOI requests made to the Department. These officers are employed at the following levels: APS 5, APS 6 and EL2. The EL2 officer and APS 6 officer are both qualified lawyers. (2) 74 applications were received by the Attorney-General’s Department during 2002-03. The figure of 74 represents an increase of ten requests on the previous financial year when 64 requests were received. (3) Three internal reviews of FOI decisions occurred during 2002-03. All internal reviews affirmed the decision made in the first instance. (4) The current categories in existence for annual reporting of FOI cases for the purposes of the FOI Annual Report allow for the distinction between requests for information that is purely personal and requests for other information. Of the 74 requests received during 2002-03, 31 were requests for personal information and 43 requests were for other information. (5) Assuming that ‘external review’ means review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), during 2002 – 03 there were three appeals against Departmental decisions made to the AAT (i.e. 4.05% of primary decisions made were reviewed by the AAT). All decisions reviewed by the AAT were upheld. (6) The total amount of fees charged for FOI requests during 2002-03 was $690.00. All fees charged were collected. During 2002 – 03 fees were waived in 19 requests (25.7 %). (7) The Department incurred no additional costs in defending the three AAT appeals made against the decisions during 2002-03. This was because the Director of the FOI Section, a qualified lawyer, represented the Department in the Tribunal– assisted by the APS 6 officer, also a qualified lawyer. (8) Such information is not readily available. No such statistics are kept by the Department and the FOI Act does not require that this information be collected. The statistics kept for quarterly and annual reporting purposes do not allow for such a breakdown. Retrieval of such information would necessitate an examination of individual files created in relation to each request made to the Department. Such retrieval would constitute an unreasonable diversion of the Department’s resources. (9) For the same reasons outlined in respect of question (8), it is not possible for the Department to provide such figures without creating an unreasonable diversion of the Department’s resources. Freedom of Information (Question No. 3168) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 1 March 2004: (1) Can the Minister indicate (a) whether the Minister’s department has a dedicated Freedom of Information Officer (FOI) officer, and (b) how many officers are employed to deal with FOI requests, and (c) at what levels they are employed.

It should be noted that more than one exemption category may have been used in any particular FOI request. (9) This information is not required to be collected by the FOI Act, and reviewing all FOI requests for the last five years to enable a comparison over that period would result in a substantial diversion of resources.

In State and Territory Offices, all officers at the APS 3 Level and above are delegated all powers under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act) except the power to conduct reviews and to make fresh decisions. In Central Office, these powers are delegated to all Legal Officers and above; all APS Level5 and above; two designated APS Level4 positions; and one designated APS Level3 position.

207,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs(2) The Department received 12,390 applications in the 2002-03 financial year. The numbers received in the preceding four years are as follows: 2001/02 10,567 2000/01 10,760 1999/00 8,173 1998/99 7,813 (3) During the 2002-03 financial year, 76 internal review decisions were made. The original decision was wholly affirmed in 28 instances. (4) While applications that pertain to personal information can be identified, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs’ (DIMIA’s) reporting systems do not facilitate the further breakdown of applications data. (5) Twenty-one FOI matters were filed in the AAT and one in the Federal Court during the 2002-03 financial year. This equates to approximately 0.18 percent of the total FOI applications lodged in the same financial year. Of 18 FOI-related external review outcomes in the 2002-03 financial year, 8 matters were upheld (44 percent of outcomes), and 10 were withdrawn by the applicant. (6) (a) and (b) Application fees charged and collected for initial processing and internal review purposes totalled $12,830 in 2002-03. The Department also notified applicants of charges for providing documents under FOI that totalled $55,506 in the 2002-03 financial year, of which $2,830 was collected. The reason for the significantly lower figure collected is that some applicants choose to withdraw their application when advised of the estimated charges. (c) While the Department has a statutory right to impose fees in respect of all FOI applications, it is the Department’s policy to waive application fees in the case of applications for a person’s own information. The majority of applications received by the Department fall into this category. The Department’s reporting systems do not have the facility to determine the percentage of application fees that are waived. (7) For the 2002-03 financial year, the total cost of related external legal advice was $81,639.76. (8) (a) and (b) In the financial year 2002-03, 677 applications for access were refused outright (ie, either the application was refused prior to processing, or the documents sought were exempted from release in whole). The number of exemptions exercised under each provision, and the percentage of refusals attributed to each, is as follows: Exemption section applied (including corresponding subsections) Number Percentage Refused prior to processing (ss. 7, 21, 24, and 25) 412 60.86 s.33 (Documents affecting national security, defence, or interna7 1.03 tional relations s.37 (Documents affecting enforcement of law and protection of 40 5.91 public safety s.40 (Documents concerning certain operations of agencies) 58 8.57 s.41 (Documents affecting personal privacy) 153 22.60 s.43 (Documents relating to business affairs etc) 3 0.44 s.45 (Documents containing material obtained in confidence) 4 0.59 Total: 677 100.00 (9) There are no existing statistics that demonstrate trends with respect to the grounds under which access to documents is exempted.

(3) How many internal reviews of applications occurred in the last financial year and how many internal reviews affirmed the original decision. (4) Can the information in (2) and (3) be broken down into applications requesting individual information and applications requesting information for other reasons (i.e. media, opposition MPs etc). (5) What proportion of cases go to external review and what proportion of these are upheld. (6) In respect of fees for FOI applications, (a) how much was charged, (b) how much was actually collected, and (c) what proportion of fees were waived. (7) How much did the Minister’s department spend in defending FOI appeals. (8) In respect of refusals to grant requests, can the Minister provide details on (a) which exemption categories are used when information is refused, and (b) what proportion of refusals are in each category (i.e. commercial-in-confidence and other categories). (9) Will the Minister provide statistics over the last 5 years indicating whether the use of particular exemption categories is static, falling or increasing. (1) (a) The Department has one designated Freedom of Information Coordinator who is located in the National Office in Canberra. (b} and (c) The Freedom of Information Coordinator is employed to deal with FOI requests and also performs other duties. This officer, who is at the APS 5 level, is not an authorised decision maker, but administers the processing of requests. The Secretary has granted authorisations to certain staff to make decisions under the FOI Act for the whole Department. These are the staff occupying the offices of Deputy Secretary (3) the Department’s Chief Lawyer (1) the Principal Government Lawyer who is Director of the Litigation and External Review Section (1) and the Senior Government Lawyer in the Litigation and External Review Section (1). (2) The information for the 2002-03 financial year is found in the 2002-2003 Annual Report by the Attorney-General to the Parliament on the Operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (“the FOI Annual Report”), Appendix A. Comparisons to previous years may be made by reference to information in previous FOI Annual Reports (3) This information is found in the FOI Annual Report, Appendix E. (4) This information is found in the FOI Annual Report, Appendix A, under the heading “Requests Received from Applicant”, where sub-heading ‘P’ represents applications principally relating to requests for access to documents containing personal information and sub-heading ‘O’ relates to other requests.",159,Questions On Notice
208,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) In 2002-2003, 27 applications were received. Two requests were submitted to the AAT for external review, a proportion of 7.4%. One appeal was withdrawn prior to hearing and one was rejected as not being within the AAT’s jurisdiction, so the proportion of appeals upheld was 0.0%. There were no review applications lodged with bodies other than the AAT. (6) (a) Charges: In the period, $783.00 in charges were collected. (b) Fees: In the period, $510.00 in application fees were collected. (c) Proportion of fees waived: In the period, an amount of $720 in application fees was potentially collectable. $210 in fees were remitted. Thus, approximately 29.17% of fees were remitted. The proportion of charges that was waived cannot be provided from existing records. In those cases where charges were waived, the decision to waive was made without a prior calculation or recording of a precise figure for the charges that might otherwise have been collected. (7) This information is found in the FOI Annual Report, Appendix L. In 2002-2003 the Department spent nothing defending FOI appeals. (8) (a) In the period, the following exemption categories were used. The number in brackets represents the number of cases in which it was claimed. Section Exemption 36 Internal working documents (1) 37 Documents affecting the enforcement of law and protection of public safety (1) 41 Documents affecting personal privacy (9) 43 Documents relating to business affairs etc (2) 45 Documents containing material obtained in confidence (2) (b) It is not possible to provide a meaningful answer to this, as most requests involved a number of documents and more than one exemption may be claimed over each document or in respect of each request. The number of exemptions referred to above does not equate to the total number of requests decided in the period because the annual total includes both requests where access was granted in full, as well as requests where access was refused under section 24A, which is not an exemption category. (9) It is not possible to provide a meaningful answer to this question, for the same reasons outlined in respect of question 8(b).

A recent study shows that it uses approximately 77 percent less energy per tonne-kilometre, on a full life-cycle basis, than articulated vehicles (Australian Transport Facts 2001, Appelbaum Consulting Group, 2002).

From time to time, there may be reluctance to accept back criminal deportees. Where this occurs, the government negotiates bilaterally to effect their return. (a) The number of countries that have refused to accept the forced return of their nationals in the circumstances referred to in part (1) is very low. In recent years only one country has refused to accept back a criminal deportee (Cuba) on one occasion. This individual is currently in the community on their existing visa and the case is under periodic review. (b) In a situation where DIMIA has pursued all avenues, but has been unable to effect return (such as the Cuban deportee) the case will continue to be monitored. If circumstances change, such as the situation in the individual's home country changes, DIMIA will reassess and pursue removal arrangements if appropriate. (3) The Department can find no record of any persons making such an application. Immigration: Visa Approvals (Question No. 3241) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 3 March 2004:",169,Questions On Notice
220,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs(1) In respect of the Minister’s media release of 12 January 2004 headed ‘Plan to attract more migrants to regional Australia’, how will the eligibility criteria and entitlements for the proposed new visa for self-funded retirees differ from the existing subclass 410 Temporary Retirement Visa. (2) What will be the definition of ‘regional Australia’ for the purposes of the proposed new visa. (3) How many such visas will be available in 2004-2005 and subsequent years. (4) What is the proposed role and contribution of state and territory governments as sponsors of the self-funded retirees concerned. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The proposed Investor (Retirement) visa will target retired business and professional people with significant assets. Consultations on the details of this visa with State/Territory Governments are currently proceeding. Preliminary proposals suggest a minimum investment of $500,000 in a State/Territory Treasury bond or project will be required. The proposed visa would increase the minimum amount of funds an applicant must have available for transfer to cover their investment commitment, establishment costs and provide an annual income. The proposed Investment (Retirement) visa is likely to have many characteristics in common with the current temporary retirement visa which will be closed to people not already holding that visa after 1 November 2004. The common elements are likely to be that all visa holders meet the same health and character criteria, maintain private health insurance for the duration of their visa and have limited work rights. Both visas will allow temporary residence only. All main applicants must be at least 55 years of age, have no other dependants except a spouse and sufficient assets to ensure self support in Australia. The major differences are likely to be that the proposed Investor (Retirement) visa would require mandatory State/Territory government sponsorship, investment in State/Territory bonds or projects and payment of a second visa application charge of an amount sufficient to offset the costs of any access to aged care facilities at a future time. The initial period of stay for the proposed Investor (Retirement) visa will be four years, renewable for further 4 year periods if applicants’ continue to satisfy streamlined health and character requirements. (2) It is envisaged that each State/Territory Government will set its regional boundaries for the Investor (Retirement) visa in order to ensure a settlement pattern that accords with the needs and wishes of each jurisdiction. (3) The number of visas available is dependent on the number of sponsorships approved by State/Territory Governments. A reasonable sponsorship take-up rate could see around 150 offshore applicants in 2004-05 with numbers increasing to 500 in each of 2005-06 and 2006-07. Onshore applicant numbers are likely to be initially small, about 10 in 2004-05 increasing to around 100 people in each of 2005-06 and 2006-07. Onshore applications are likely to increase from 2008-09 as initial Investor (Retirement) visas expire and further visas are sought onshore. (4) The sponsorship requirement will provide State/Territory governments with the power to link sponsorship to settlement in their regional/low growth areas and another avenue for attracting significant investment to their low growth/regional areas. The determination of specific sponsorship criteria to be met will be a decision for each State or Territory Government.",170,Questions On Notice

The Government’s approach with these schemes has been to tailor the definition of the areas of Australia to benefit to the specific features of each scheme. Where it has been possible to adopt a wider definition that would not impact negatively on areas of Australia that are clearly “regional” we have done so. As a result, for the Skilled Designated Area Sponsored scheme, for example, a very broad definition has been used which includes Melbourne. This is because giving an advantage to someone living in Melbourne sponsoring a skilled relative from overseas does not disadvantage any other area of Australia but it does meet the wishes of the Victorian Government for more overseas migration. There is, therefore, no single definition of the parts of Australia that benefit from the range of SSRM schemes. For some of these schemes the areas to benefit are determined entirely by state/territory governments. (2) See (1) above and (3) below. (3) Consultation on the areas to benefit from this scheme is nearing finalisation. At this stage, it is expected that the areas of Australia to benefit will be those statistical divisions with a population of less than 200,000 and those metropolitan centres which had a population growth rate between the last two censuses of less than 50% of the national average. (4) This is to be a demand driven category and will be managed within overall migration program planning levels. Immigration: Visa Approvals (Question No. 3243) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 3 March 2004: What number and proportion of all permanent visas issued in 2002-2003 under the (a) skilled, (b) family, and (c) humanitarian migration streams were issued to applicants who proposed to settle in (i) the metropolitan area, and (ii) the non-metropolitan area of each state and territory. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:",171,Questions On Notice

223,Mr Hardgrave,"The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs(a), (b), (c) The Australian Government collects data on intended residence for all migrants granted visas under the Migration and Humanitarian Programs. However, not all data is collected in exactly the way the honourable member has requested. Intended state or territory of residence is collected in the process of a migration application, but where exactly a migrant intends to live is not further defined at that stage. Once granted a visa, all migrants are asked to indicate where they intend to reside for settlement information data. Some aspects of this data rely on migrants volunteering their residential details after being granted a visa and not all choose to do so. Some may not know or may change their place of residence. The Settlement Database information provides an indicative picture of migrant settlement patterns: approximately 76 percent of family stream entrants settled in capital cities, 11 percent settled in the remainder of their state/territory and 13 percent did not identify where they intended to settle; 62 percent of skilled stream migrants settled in capital cities, 6 percent settled in the remainder of their state/territory and the remaining 32 percent did not identify where they intended to settle; and the vast majority of humanitarian entrants (91 percent) settled in capital cities, 7 percent settled in remaining areas and 2 percent did not identify where they intended to settle.

The Government issues specific visas under State-specific and regional migration schemes. Approximately 8,000 such visas were issued in 2002-03, equating to 12 per cent of the Skill Stream. This is a substantial 92% increase over visa grants for 2001-02. Demand for these schemes is growing steadily and visa grants are expected to reach approximately 12,000 for 2003-04. These schemes are managed on a demand-driven basis and they are designed to meet the needs of regional Australia and State/Territory governments. While some schemes have a specific regional focus, others are broadly designed for state/territory governments to sponsor skilled and business migrants to their jurisdictions. Jurisdictions’ participation in the schemes heavily influences overall visa grant numbers. Visa grants for state-specific and regional migration mechanisms in 2002-03 were: Table 2: State-specific and regional migration mechanisms Visa grants by State/Territory 2002-03 NSW 617 VIC 4,416 QLD 649 WA 584 TAS 197 SA 1,324 NT 132 ACT 292 Defence: Service Medal (Question No. 3256) Mr Murphy asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 3 March 2004: (1) Is the Minister aware that, at its September 2003 National Congress, the Returned and Services League (RSL) of Australia passed a resolution asking for the Federal Government to introduce a Defence Force Medal for all persons who have served in the Defence Force both past and present and this to include Reserve Forces with a qualifying period of two years service, not necessarily continuous, to be accepted as the minimum requirement. (2) Is the Minister aware that the National Servicemen’s Association of Australia supports the RSL’s resolution. (3) Will the Government reconsider this issue with a view to granting a Defence Force Medal consistent with the resolution of the National Congress of the RSL last September; if so, when, if not, why not. The Government has sought advice on whether the current form of volunteer service recognition is satisfactory from the Chief of the Defence Force, who is the principal adviser on the matter. I am also seeking further advice on a number of issues with a group of pre-eminent Australians with experience in this field. When that consideration is finalised, I will announce the Government’s decision publicly.

225,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 4 March 2004:",175,Questions On Notice
226,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) The AGCTC meets on the last Wednesday of each month. The AGCTC is scheduled to meet on 31 March, 28 April, 26 May, 30 June, 28 July, 25 August, 29 September, 27 October, 24 November and 15 December 2004 (*December meeting held earlier due to Christmas/New Year holidays.) (5) The AGCTC has the sole responsibility for determining the level of national counter-terrorism alert based on ASIO assessments of the threat environment. An extraordinary meeting of the full will review the level of national counter-terrorism alert. (6) No. (7) No. However, if an Extraordinary AGCTC is convened in response to a terrorist incident/situation and relevant intelligence and agency reports indicate that the level of counter-terrorism alert should be raised to High or Extreme, the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence would be consulted on both the approval and activation of appropriate response measures. National Security: Terrorism (Question No. 3263) (1) In respect of the discussion paper ‘Counter-Terrorism Powers: Reconciling Security and Liberty in an Open Society’ released by the UK Government in February 2004, is he aware that the UK Home Secretary stated at page ii of the discussion paper that, “I therefore hope that this document will begin a wider debate over the next months. It is important that this process should be inclusive and genuinely consultative. I am therefore proposing a far longer period of consultation–six months– than would normally be the case”. (2) Does he recall stating on 26 February 2004 that options canvassed in that discussion paper are also under consideration by the Australian Government. (3) Besides the current Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry which is limited to protecting classified and security sensitive information, will he commit to a similar process of consultation with the Australian people on any legislative proposals, including the publication of a discussion paper, as the British Government has done. (1) I am aware that the UK Home Secretary made this comment. (2) I recall stating that “While some of the measures referred to in the paper are already in effect in Australia or under consideration, the options will be examined to determine their relevance to Australia”. I made this comment in a press release on 26/2/04. (3) The Government is committed to combating terrorism and developing legislation that will assist us in achieving this. The Government continues to review legislative needs in relation to national security issues as they arise. In addition to this, the Government has regard to developments and practices adopted in like minded countries such as the United Kingdom. The Government will continue to consult with the appropriate agencies and bodies in relation to new legislative proposals. Such consultation is evidenced by the terms of reference given to the Australian Law Reform Commission regarding the protection of classified and security sensitive information.",175,Questions On Notice

Military Detention: Australian Citizens (Question No. 3274) Ms Roxon asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 8 March 2004: (1) Other than the Australians being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is he aware of any Australians being held in other countries that might be affected by the changed definition of ‘foreign country’ in the International Transfer of Prisoners Amendment Bill 2004; if so, (a) how may people are there, and (b) in which countries are they being held. (2) Has the Government of the United States of America indicated that it would agree to a request, after the Bill is enacted, for the transfer of any Australians convicted by the US military commission; if so, what undertakings, if any, have been given. (1) Statistics from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade indicate that at 31 December 2003 there were 214 Australians imprisoned overseas. It is not possible to provide an accurate number of Australians imprisoned overseas who would be covered by the expanded application of the International Transfer of Prisoners Act. The International Transfer of Prisoners Act was amended to allow the Act to apply to regions and not just countries. In essence the amendments allow regions controlled by a foreign country to be dealt with as part of that country, as well as allowing semi-autonomous regions to be declared a transfer country in their own right. Whether a region falls within the expanded application of the International Transfer of Prisoners Act would need to be considered on a case by case basis. (2) As a result of discussions held in July 2003, the United States agreed to work towards putting in place arrangements which would enable the transfer of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib to Australia, if convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment by a military commission sentence.

230,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:amendment of the International Transfer of Prisoners Act removes any doubt as to the application of the transfer scheme to Guantanamo Bay and a sentence imposed by a military commission. The Government will enter into negotiations in due course to establish a bilateral arrangement with the United States of America to transfer prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. Australian National Audit Office (Question No. 3279) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 2004: (1) In respect of the undertaking to the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) in response to Report No. 31 of 2000-2001, (a) has his department entered into a service level agreement with reporting, and (b) have his department and AUSTRADE agreed on funding for, and access to, his department’s Consular Management Information System (CMIS). (2) Have appropriate guidelines for evaluation and reporting following a crisis been developed in response to the ANAO’s Report No. 16 of 2003-2004. (3) In respect of the ANAO’s finding in Report No. 16 of 2003-2004 that many lists were out of date or deficient, has his department taken action to ensure that the lawyers’ lists maintained at overseas posts are kept up to date and that the court jurisdiction of all lawyers is included. (4) In respect of Recommendation 2(a) in the ANAO’s Report No. 31 of 2000-2001, has his department instituted procedures to ensure that the risk assessment processes undertaken by overseas posts in making decisions not to issue travel advisories are rigorously documented. (5) Has his department completed or made substantial progress towards the development of outstanding modules of the Consular Management Information system (CMIS).

231,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:deported non-citizens (s.199), and (c) the Minister’s decision to exercise discretionary power to order the deportation of non-citizens (s.200), are all privative clause decisions within the meaning of the Act. (2) Has the Minister considered the policy impacts of the foreshadowed amendments to section 198 and 199 of the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004 as it relates to the privative provisions of s. 474. (3) Does the Explanatory Memorandum for the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004 make any reference to policy or other impacts on the proposed amendments to the privative classification of decisions made under sections 198 or 199 of the Act. (4) Following the reported judgements in Al Masriv MIMIA [2002] FCA 1009, M276/200; Ex parte – Re Woolley& Anor and MIMIA v VFAD, Federal Court decision dated 9 December 2002, what is the policy rationale in maintaining that decisions under sections 198, 199 and 200 remain decisions which are statutorily deemed to be privative clause decisions within the meaning of section 474. (5) Will the Minister seek to amend subsection 474(4) so that decisions under sections 198, 199 and 200 are not privative clause decisions; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. Subsection 474(4) of the Migration Act 1958 does not apply to sections 198, 199 and 200. Decisions or actions made under those sections fall within the definition of privative clause decisions in section 474(2) of the Act. (2) The Migration (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004 did not propose amendments to sections 198 and 199 of the Migration Act 1958. (3) No. As there are no proposed amendments to sections 198 or 199 in the Migration (Duration of Detention) Bill 2004, the Explanatory Memorandum does not contain any reference to these sections. (4) The judgements referred to do not affect the objective of having consistent grounds of judicial review for matters arising under the Migration Act 1958. (5) For the reasons referred to in (4), no amendments have been introduced to exclude sections 198, 199 and 200 from the operation of the privative clause. Bankruptcies (Question No. 3282) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 March 2004: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2789 (Hansard, 11 February 2004, page 24561), is it the case that there can never be a compellable duty triggered in circumstances where the debtor demonstrably abuses the statutory intent of bankruptcy legislation for the sole or substantial purpose of taking the debtor’s assets out of the reach of creditors under the provisions of sections 55(3AA), 57(3AA), 55(3AB), and 57(3AB) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966; if so, when will he review this gap in the legislation and, if he will not, why not. (2) Is the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia’s Best Practice Statement enforceable, in particular, for the purpose of affording creditors relief against debtors who are demonstrably abusing the bankruptcy system by deliberately taking assets out of their creditors’ reach; if not, why not. (1) Yes. This does not amount to a gap in the legislation as the provisions intentionally apply to a limited set of circumstances. It would not be appropriate to require the Official Receiver to",182,Questions On Notice

Environment: Wetlands (Question No. 3309) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 11 March 2004: (1) Is he aware that the report published by his department in 2001, titled ‘Environmental water requirements to maintain wetlands of national and international importance’ noted that three of Australia’s Wetlands of International Importance, the Macquarie Marshes, the Narran Lakes and the Gwydir Wetlands, were under threat from over-abstraction of water upstream. (2) Is he also aware of the growing body of expert opinion that the ecological character of all three Wetlands of International Importance has been severely compromised, potentially placing Australia in contravention of its international obligations under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.",188,Questions On Notice
240,Mr Brough,"The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honour(3) What has he done in response to these concerns, in particular, how has he (a) endeavoured to use the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to address the specific water shortage issue, (b) responded to his obligation under the Act to ensure that “A person must not take an action that…has or will have a significant impact on the ecological character of a declared Ramsar wetland”, and (c) exercised the opportunities presented by Commonwealth accreditation of the appropriate regional investment strategies and plans under the Natural Heritage Trust and National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality to ensure that the matters of national environmental significance gain the water they require. (1) Yes (2) Based on the site-specific information provided to the Department of the Environment and Heritage, Australia has undertaken the necessary reporting to the Secretariat for the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar, Iran, 1971) on the ecological character of these sites, consistent with Article 3.2 of the Convention. (3) (a) The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) provides protection to Ramsar sites such as the Gwydir Wetlands, Narran Lakes and Macquarie Marshes by establishing an environment assessment and approval process for specific actions that are likely to have a significant impact on the ecological character of a Ramsar site. A decision by a government body to grant an authorisation for another person to take an action (which may include granting permits or licences for water abstraction), is not itself an action that requires approval under the Act. Nor does the EPBC Act apply to broader regional environmental planning issues such as water allocations. Such matters are primarily the responsibility of the State Government. (3) (b) ny case in which it is established that a person has taken an action that has had, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the ecological character of a declared Ramsar site, without the necessary approval, would be subject to the penalty provisions within the Act. (3) (c) The Macquarie Marshes are in the NSW Central West Catchment Management Authority (CMA) area, the Narran Lakes are in the Western CMA area, and the Gwydir Wetlands are in the Border Rivers/Gwydir CMA area (previously Gwydir Catchment Management Board area). The Australian and NSW Governments, through the Joint Steering Committee, are in the process of providing CMAs with guidelines for developing their 3-year investment strategies (2004-05 to 2006-07) which include a practical guide to the kinds of activities that the NSW and Australian Governments would support through regional investment strategies. Managing threats and preventing degradation to Ramsar wetlands is the first investor preference item listed. In addition an Independent Advisory Group (IAG) has been established to review and provide comment on the adequacy of recommended NAP and Trust investment, including investment in Ramsar-listed wetlands.

(2) What efforts has the Australian Government made to encourage the widest possible adherence to the CTBT? (3) Since November 2001, what representations has the Australian Government made to the Government of the United States of America and the US Congress seeking reconsideration of the United States’ failure to ratify the CTBT, in particular, when and to whom were any representations made. (1) As at 6 April 2004, 171 countries have signed the CTBT and 110 countries have ratified. Of the 44 countries whose ratification is required for the Treaty to enter into force, 32 have ratified. (2) The Government is pursuing a number of strategies to encourage further signatures and ratifications of the CTBT. We continue to take appropriate opportunities to encourage and assist other countries to advance national processes necessary for CTBT signature and ratification. Consistent with the approach developed by meetings of ratifiers, these efforts are focused mainly on countries in our region, as well as those whose ratification is required to trigger entry into force. Outreach efforts have been at ministerial and officials’ levels and have included, in some instances, technical assistance. We also continue to promote CTBT adherence in international forums. In the United Nations General Assembly, we are co-sponsor each year, and lead sponsor alternately with New Zealand and Mexico, of a First Committee resolution on the CTBT. Along with Japan and the Netherlands, Australia initiated a Joint Ministerial Statement on the CTBT adopted in September 2002, through which some 50 states reaffirmed their commitment to the CTBT and called upon all states that had not yet signed and ratified to do so as soon as possible. Australia has also been active at successive international conferences held under Article XIV of the CTBT on facilitating entry into force of the Treaty, most recently in September 2003. (3) Australia continues to take appropriate opportunities to urge all states that have not yet signed and ratified the CTBT – including the United States– to do so as soon as possible, and to urge all states to maintain existing moratoria on nuclear testing. Australia has registered, including in its statement to the Article XIV conference in September 2003, its disappointment with the United States’ continued inability to ratify the Treaty. Alice Springs Research Station (Question No. 3335) Mr Brereton asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 22 March 2004: (1) Does Geoscience Australia participate in the operation of the joint Australia-United States (US) Geological and Geophysical Research Station at Alice Springs. (2) Does the Alice Springs Research Station form part of the International Monitoring System for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. (3) Does the Alice Springs Research Station also continue to form part of the US Atomic Energy Detection System which serves US national objectives. (4) Is the cooperating US agency involved with the Alice Springs Research Station the US Air Force Technical Applications Centre (AFTAC). (5) Does the Alice Springs Research Station send data to the US National Data Centre operated by (6) How many staff currently employed at the Alice Springs Research Station are (a) Australian citizens, and (b) US citizens.",192,Questions On Notice
245,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) What seismic monitoring equipment is presently operated at the Alice Springs station. (8) Are there any plans to upgrade the equipment/capabilities of the Alice Springs Research Station; if so, what is the nature of any current or planned upgrade. (9) What are the current funding arrangements for the Alice Springs Research Station. (10) What proportion of the operating and capital costs is borne by the US and how long have the current funding arrangements been in place. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes, in a number of ways: (i) Receive a near-real time feed of seismic data from the station; (ii) Inform joint Australia-United States Geological and Geophysical Research Station personnel of any quality control issues with the data; (iii) Liaise with joint Australia-United States Geological and Geophysical Research Station personnel to ensure that any modifications/upgrades to the station met with Australian regulations; (iv) Liaise with joint Australia-United States Geological and Geophysical Research Station personnel with the planning of the upgrade of the station to Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty specifications; and (v) Provide administrative assistance for the general maintenance of the station. (2) Yes. It is one of the 50 stations in the primary seismic network of the International Monitoring System. (3) Yes. It is a key station of United States Atomic Energy Detection System particularly for detection, location and identification of events in the southern hemisphere. (4) Yes. (5) Yes. The United States National Data Centre receives a direct feed from the station in near real time. (6) (a) Zero Australian citizens (b) 5 United States citizens (7) 19 broadband seismometers, one 3 component short-period seismometer and one 3 component long-period seismometer. These seismometers are arranged strategically (over a 10km diameter) to optimise detection of events. (8) Yes. It is expected in 2005 that the station will be upgraded to Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty specifications. This will involve replacement of the existing seismometers (the type of seismometer is yet to be determined), upgrading of some of the underground cables and the installation of a new data acquisition system. (9) All funding for the operation and maintenance of Alice Springs Research Station is from the United States government. (10) An agreement was reached between the Australian and United States governments in February 1978 re the arrangements of joint Australia-United States Geological and Geophysical Research Station. The agreement requires the Australian government to provide administrative support for the facility. This includes financial administration, budgeting and assistance with procurement relating to the facility. The operating and capital costs of the facility are met wholly be the United States Air Force. Multicultural Affairs: Citizenship (Question No. 3341) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 22 March 2004: (1) Can he confirm comments attributed to him in the Maltese Herald on 20 January 2004 to the effect that those Maltese citizens who were formerly Australian, who wanted to reapply for Australian Citizenship should go to the office of the Australian High Commission in Malta and complete an application form. (2) Can he confirm that resumption of Australian citizenship is restricted to those under the age of 25 under the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment Act 2002. (3) How many requests have been received by the High Commission in Malta from former Australian citizens wishing to resume citizenship since the publication of this article. (1) I have not seen a copy of the article that appeared in the Maltese Herald on 20 January 2004 so I am not able to comment on the article. I conferred Australian citizenship upon 33 members of the Malta-born community in Sydney on 12 December 2003. Members of the Maltese community at the ceremony raised citizenship issues with me. Specifically they raised the issue of Australian-born Maltese citizens who migrated to Malta and were required by the Maltese Government to renounce their Australian citizenship before their 19th birthday in order to retain their Maltese citizenship, and who would now like to reacquire Australian citizenship. I made a general statement at the citizenship ceremony that anyone who had lost their Australian citizenship should seek advice from the Australian High Commission in Malta in relation to resumption. I did not advise those present at the citizenship ceremony that they would be able to get their Australian citizenship back. (2) A new resumption provision (s23AB) was introduced into the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (the Act), effective 1 July 2002, to enable former Australian citizens who renounced their Australian citizenship in order to retain another citizenship, to resume Australian citizenship up until their 25th birthday. The age threshold of 25 years brought this resumption provision into line with the age requirement by which a person can be registered as an Australian citizen by descent. Those who lost their Australian citizenship by acquiring another citizenship, usually under (the now repealed) s17 of the Act, are able to resume their Australian citizenship under s23AA of the Act. There is no age threshold by which to resume Australian citizenship under s23AA. (3) In the period 20 January– 31 March 2004, the Australian High Commission in Malta received 7 applications for resumption of Australian citizenship. Multicultural Affairs: Citizenship (Question No. 3342) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 22 March 2004: Has the Government previously recognised the situation of some Maltese citizens who were born in Australia and who spent the greater part of their childhood in Australia; if so, why does the Government not allow the resumption of Australian citizenship to a person who was born in Australia, who grew up and went to school in Australia, who left Australia as a minor in order to follow his or her parents, who was compelled to renounce previous citizenship as a requirement of Maltese law at the time, who maintains close and enduring family ties to Australia, and who is over the age of 25 years.",193,Questions On Notice
246,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Government has recognised the situation of former Australian citizens, who were born in Australia, subsequently returned to Malta and were required under Maltese law to renounce their Australian citizenship before their 19th birthday in order to retain their Maltese citizenship. Prior to 1 July 2002, a person who renounced their Australian citizenship in order to retain another citizenship could not reacquire Australian citizenship by using the resumption provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (the Act). They could only reacquire Australian citizenship by going through the migration process and applying for Australian citizenship by grant. They had to meet the eligibility requirements but were only required to reside in Australia for twelve months in the previous two years as a permanent resident. Australian citizenship matters were reviewed by the Australian Citizenship Council which was established by the Government in August 1998. The Council was chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen and its task was to examine major issues relevant to future citizenship policies and programs. The Citizenship Council issued a discussion paper and called for public submissions. The review was also widely advertised in all major newspapers in Australia and the discussion paper was distributed to a large number of individuals, community organisations and peak ethnic bodies both in Australia and overseas. Some two hundred submissions were received. Very few submissions to the Citizenship Council raised resumption as an issue. The issue in relation to Maltese citizens came to the attention of the Citizenship Council on the basis of one submission from a young Maltese woman in regard to the lack of resumption provisions for people in her situation. The Government agreed with the Council’s recommendation that young people who renounced their Australian citizenship at a relatively early age, and therefore before they were in a position to make a fully informed decision, should have an adequate period after reaching their majority to resume Australian citizenship. A new resumption provision (s23AB) was introduced into the Act, effective 1 July 2002, to enable former Australian citizens who renounced their Australian citizenship in order to retain another citizenship, to resume Australian citizenship up until their 25th birthday. The age threshold of 25 years brought this resumption provision into line with the age requirement for registering as an Australian citizen by descent. The option of reacquiring Australian citizenship by grant continues to be available for those people over 25 years of age. Since the introduction of the new resumption provision in the Act in 2002, the Maltese community in Australia and overseas has raised the issue of former Australian citizens who are over the age of 25 and are not able to resume Australian citizenship. This issue is under consideration. Foreign Affairs: Passports (Question No. 3350) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 2004: (1) Has the Output Purchasing Agreement between his department and the Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) for the production of passports been clarified to indicate that an allowance for spoilage is included in the production costs of passports. (2) Has his department’s performance information framework for passport services been expanded to include specific indicators of effectiveness, security and integrity as suggested by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). (3) Has the Passports Australia Client Service Charter been revised to ensure that it is fully consistent with the Passports Act 1938 and the advice contained on the passport form.",195,Questions On Notice
247,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Has the Service Charter been amended to indicate that the turnaround standard for the issue of passports excludes the time taken between handling by Australia Post outlets to receipt by his department. (5) Has his department revised its performance standard to commit to a certain proportion of applications being turned around within 10 days; if so, what is this proportion and has his department reported against this standard. (6) Does his department intend to include service standards in the Service Charter for Australia Post and the Australian Passport Information Service (APIS) operated by Centrelink, both of which are integral parts of the service to clients. (7) Does his department’s agreement with Centrelink in respect of APIS now (a) provide for information to be supplied on its performance against the standard for all calls rather than reporting the average waiting time for callers, and (b) specify standards for the weekend service. (8) Does his department distinguish between types of passport application when monitoring timeliness. (9) Has his department entered into a new contract with Note Printing Australia Ltd; if so, does this contract contain detailed specifications for all aspects of production including the quality of the paper and laminate and security features. (10) Has automated electronic validation of applicant data through checks of the databases of Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages now been extended to all States and Territories. (11) Has his department’s procedures for assessing minors’ passport applications been revised to include a requirement to contact the non-lodging parent to verify consent. (12) Have the rules for witnessing parental consent been tightened to eliminate any apparent conflicts of interest. (13) Does the agreement with the new supplier of passport booklets include physical security arrangements comparable with those for the production of currency, including camera surveillance of each phase of production and electronic tracking of supply materials. (14) Has his department changed its practice of transporting passport booklets and laminates together in a secure vehicle. (15) Were all passports delivered by registered mail in 2002-2003. (16) How many passports were reported lost in the post in 2002-2003. (17) Can he confirm that for 2002-2003 the estimated cost of passport services was $96 million and the fees revenue was $137 million; if so, was the surplus of $41 million available to his portfolio or was it returned to consolidated revenue. (1) The Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) have acknowledged that an allowance for spoilage is included in the production costs of passports within the Passports Output Purchasing Agreement. DOFA and DFAT have agreed to clarify the intent of the agreement regarding pricing of spoilage during the agreements next review. (2) Yes. The passport’s performance information framework has been strengthened to include additional specific indicators of effectiveness, security and integrity. (3) The Client Service Charter has been updated to ensure consistency with the Passports Act 1938 and the advice contained in the passport form. The new brochure will be printed and distributed in May 2004. (4) The Service Charter has been amended to better explain to applicants that the turnaround standard for the issue of passports excludes postage and handling by Australia Post.",196,Questions On Notice
248,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) The department has revised its performance standard to report the percentage of applications turned around within ten days. The standard target has been set at ninety-nine percent. The department intends to use this as the basis for reporting turnaround time performance. (6) The Service Charter has been amended to include service standards for Australia Post and the Australian Passport Information Service (APIS). The new brochure will be printed and distributed in May 2004 (7) (a) No. The option of reporting performance against the standard for all calls rather than the average waiting time for callers was taken up with Centrelink but a mid-contract change in reporting standards could not be justified on cost. (b) No specified standards have been set for the weekend given the small volume of calls received and the cost involved in implementing such a standard. (8) The merits of distinguishing between types of passport application when monitoring timeliness is programmed for review in 2004-05 and will be assessed against the cost of implementing this initiative. (9) Yes. The contract includes details of specifications of all aspects of production including the quality of paper and security features. A separate contract with 3M is now in place for supply of laminate, it covers all aspects of production and detailed specifications of laminate. (10) No. The Department is waiting on the Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages to finalise the technical links to allow this service to be extended to all States and Territories. (11) No. The department is still considering the merits of this suggestion. (12) Yes. The rules concerning who may witness a parent’s consent were tightened at the time the new minor’s passport application form was introduced in late 2003. (13) Yes. Physical security arrangements for the production of booklets is comparable with those for the production of currency and includes camera surveillance of each phase of production. Tracking of materials used in the production of booklets is undertaken at all stages of production. (14) Yes. New arrangements have been put in place. Booklets and laminates are now subject to separate contracts and bulk supplies are shipped separately to the centralised secure storage facility. In most cases laminates and booklets are shipped together by secure means from centralised storage facilities to issues offices. (15) Registered mail was introduced for passport delivery in Australia on 22 July 2002. (16) Passports reported missing in the mail during 2002-03 was 700 (out of 906,049 issued that year), with 252 of these being subsequently recovered to date. Over 38% (or 171) of the passports remaining unaccounted for in 2002-03 were reported lost in the month of July 2002 (registered mail was not introduced until 22 July 2002). Further options to improve the secure delivery of passports are being explored with Australia Post. (17) The Passport Output Purchasing Agreement 2002-2003 to 2004-05 estimated cost of passport services for 2002-03 to be $96 million. The agreement also estimated passport fee revenue for this period to be $137 million. Passport Revenue is paid into consolidated revenue and is not available to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Asia-Pacific Region: Death Penalty (Question No. 3354) Mr Melham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 2004: (1) Will he update the answer to question No. 2891 (Hansard, 18 September 2001, page 30928) in respect of the countries and territories in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans in which the death penalty can be imposed.

Defence: Retirements Benefits Scheme (Question No. 3401) Dr Emerson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 25 March 2004: Will the Government index Defence Force Retirements Benefits Scheme Pensions to Male Total Average Weekly Earnings in line with both Social Security Pensions and Veterans’ Affairs Service Pensions. No. Environment: Tarkine Wilderness (Question No. 3418) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 29 March 2004: Will he explain why the Government continues to allow destructive rainforest logging in the Tarkine Wilderness in North Western Tasmania when this practice has been discontinued in all other Australian States. Sustainable harvesting of rainforest timber is provided for in the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) based on the State’s commitment to deliver ecological sustainable forest management and in the context of the high level rainforest reservation achieved by the RFA. Over 569,000 hectares of rainforest is found in Tasmania, representing about ninety three percent of the pre-clearing distribution. These rainforests, along with all other forest communities, were assessed as part of the Tasmanian RFA, and further conservation reserves were created on the basis of the national forest reserve criteria. According to these criteria, fifteen percent of the pre-clearing distribution of each forest ecosystem should be protected in the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, rising to sixty percent of vulnerable communities and close to one hundred percent of endangered communities. Rainforest was already well represented in the reserve system in Tasmania, however due to the ecological importance and aesthetic significance, the RFA increased rainforest reservation to over sixty seven percent. Over seventy percent of public land in the Tarkine area is now protected. Rainforests are also highly valued for their fine quality timbers and the RFA recognised that some areas should continue to be available for harvesting due to the timber industry’s economic and social significance to the Tasmanian community. In response to the five year review of the RFA the Australian Government is seeking demonstration from Tasmania that any harvesting of rainforest is carried out in an ecologically sustainable manner, and in accordance with the RFA.",199,Questions On Notice

(2) Is he able to say whether (a) Syria currently supports terrorism or terrorist organisations, (b) Syria currently harbours terrorists or terrorist organisations, and (c) there are offices of (i) Islamic Jihad, (ii) Hamas, and (iii) Hezbollah in Syria. (3) Is he aware of the Washington Institute report to the effect that Syria’s active support for terrorist groups of ‘global reach’ has expanded, not shrunk, since 11 September 2001; if so, does the Australian government agree with this assessment. (4) Is he aware of the Brookings Institute report to the effect that Syria has developed weapons of mass destruction; if so, does the Australian government agree with this assessment. (5) Is he aware of the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Mr Jack Straw’s statement that “Syria has to take far tougher and less ambiguous action on terrorists” and does the Australian government share this view.

(1) Yes (2) According to the US State Department Patterns of Global Terrorism report released in 2003, the Syrian Government has continued to provide political and limited material support to a number of Palestinian groups, by allowing them to maintain headquarters or offices in Damascus. Some of these groups have committed terrorist acts, but the Syrian Government insists that their Damascus offices undertake only political and information activities. Groups with a presence in Syria include the Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and the Islamic Resistance Movement (HMS). Syria has also continued to permit Iranian resupply, via Damascus, of Hizbollah in Lebanon. The Syrian Government has not been implicated directly in an act of terrorism since 1986. The US State Department report notes that the Syrian Government has cooperated with the United States and other foreign governments against al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations and individuals. Syria has discouraged any signs of public support for al-Qaeda, including in the media and at mosques.
