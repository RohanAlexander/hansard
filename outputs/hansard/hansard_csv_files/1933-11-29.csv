Leader of the House state whether it is true that, the leading bakers of Australia have already purchased flour in sufficient quantities to supply their needs to the end of May, 1934? If they have, and taking into consideration other complications that are likely to arise, will the Government abandon its proposal to impose a sales tax on flour with the object of assisting the wheat-growers of Australia, and substitute for it a more equitable method of raising revenue? informed that efforts havo been made to avoid tbe payment of a threatened or promised sales tax by the purchase and delivery of flour in advance.

HUTCHIN -Has the attention of the Acting Leader of the House been drawn to the paragraph in this morning's Canberra Times, which is to the effect that France is secretly preparing air and naval bases in the Pacific, as u counter to Japanese warlike preparations? If the right honourable gentleman has any knowledge on the subject, will he give it to the House? port to which the honourable member has Deferred, and have made inquiries into the matter. Nosuch information is in the possession of the Government, and I may add that it is reasonably well informed upon such matters. The Government has previously had occasion to take special action to contradict alarmist and entirely untrue statements with respect to the Pacific and other Australian waters that have been sent to London by a gentleman describing himself as the Canberra correspondent of the Daily Herald. I understand that there is no such person, and that, in fact, tliese messages, several of which, I repent, have proved to be not only entirely inaccurate, but also dangerous in character, are generally sent from Brisbane. COAL. of the House seen the October report of the International Labour Office of the [29 NOVEMBER, 1933-1 from Coal. 5111 League of Nations in which reference is made to a scheme placed before the South Wales Industrial Development Council for the erection in South Wales of one hydrogenation plant, and ten 1,000-tou low-temperature carbonization plants, at an estimated cost of £7,000,000 ? Does he know that the combined plants will use to ascertain -whether annually approximately 4,000,000 tons of coal, and will produce 1,500,000 tons of Obviously, however, the liquid and gaseous fuel, and 2,500,000 tons of smokeless coal ? Is the right honourable gentleman further aware that the hydrogenation plant will provide permanent employment for 1,000 miners and 1,500 process workers, while its construction will give temporary employment to 1,500 men for one year? Does he also know that the ten low temperature carbonization plants will employ 4,000 miners and 1,400 process workers, and that 12,000 men will be engaged on the construction of these plants? In view of the fact that the expenditure of £7,000,000 would give permanent employment to 7,900 miners and process workers, as well as temporary work for 13,500 men, and would also make Australia independent of imported fuel, and that the New South Wales Government has made.

Mackay).","a member's speech wben that member is moving a motion to carry out a decision of the House. the community, and I refer particularly to the fruit-growers, are anxiously awaiting relief and benefits which will be available to them only when the Appropriation Bill passes both Houses of the Parliament, and I think that honourable members who have followed the course of the debate will not complain of the declaration of urgency. This motion i.s being proposed, not because members have become bored with the discussion of the Estimates, but simply because the business is really of an urgent nature. I therefore advise the House to agree to the motion as soon as possible. not complain that insufficient time has been allowed for the discussion of the Estimates. Compared with other years, the discussion has been a protracted one, but wo must remember that the Estimates are probably the most important business"" which comes before Parliament, and discussion should not be curtailed by means of the guillotine. Had we met earlierand we might have met two months earlier-ther e would havo been no necessity for a rush at the end of the session. I have'always, held the opinion that the judicious use of the closure is fairer to honourable members than the use of the guillotine. When' the Government, and honourable members generally, decide that they have heard enough discussion on a subject, the closure can be applied; but, by the use of the guillotine, a very grave injustice may be done. In this instance we have to dispose of three divisions, namely, the Postmaster-General's Department, Territories, and Payments to the States, in the time allotted. Not only must the discussion be completed; but the i teans must also be agreed to. It is .evident the Chairman of Committees and of Mr that the whole time will be taken up in discussing Department, so that honourable members will have no opportunity to move amendments in respect of either of the other divisions. The estimates for the Commonwealth Railways must be passed by 4.30 p.m., so that practically all the remaining estimates will have to be disposed of by 9.30 p.m. Whatever limitations are placed upon debate, honourable members should not be deprived of the opportunity to express their opinions upon the business before Parliament, or -to vote upon it . The unfairness of this motion is shown by the fact that three days were taken up in discussing Miscellaneous expenditure, while it is proposed to dispose of the Estimates for three divisions, including the all-important Postmaster-General's Department, in about five hours. If the Government proposed to apply the guillotine, it should have done so earlier, so that the time could have been better distributed. -When the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) moved this motion, he said that, if honourable members took up the time of the House discussing it, they would rob themselves of some of the time allotted under the declaration of urgency for the discussion of the Estimates. I think that we might just as well spend the time now discussing this motion, because tlie Government has made a farce of the proceedings by unduly limiting the time available. When the Government decides to limit the time for debate, it always seems to rush to ridiculous extremes. Members of the Government have complained that the discussion on the Estimates this year has been much longer than usual; but, if they think that too much time has been spent, let them point to some item which need not have been discussed. research, for example. member of this Parliament has a perfect right to advance the claims of his constituents when opportunity offers. of Parliament? the Postmaster-General's Speaker to see that the privileges of Parliament are not abused, and I am not prepared to cast reflections upon them by saying that they have failed in their duty.

The discussion on the Estimates provides an opportunity for mention of those matters, and honourable members avail themselves of it. The depressed condition of industry, and the inability of our primary producers to find markets for their products, are matters which call urgently for the attention of this Parliament, aud the discussion of the Estimates provides the opportunity to focus attention on their claims. I shall bo interested to see what attitude will be taken up by members of the Country party in regard to the application of fhe guillotine, particularly as it affects the time for discussing the post office estimates. This is practically the only opportunity which honourable members representing country areas have to bring before Parliament the claims of their constituents for improved postal facilities. I oppose this motion, because I believe that it is making a farce of parliamentary procedure. We, in this corner, would be prepared to sit late, if necessary, so that lated to put men out of employmenthonorable members may have time to discuss these important departments. Had the Government so desired, Parliament could have been called together at least two months earlier than it was. However, when the Government treats itself to a four months' recess, it cannot expect honourable members to submit tamely to this end-of-session rush. I support the motion for the application of the guillotine, because I believe that it is the fairest way to get the Estimates through Parliament. I regret, however, that this motion was not introduced earlier, so that, the time available for discussion might have been distributed more evenly over the various departments. I have a few suggestions to make which, .1 think, should meet with the approval of the Government. My first suggestion is that, as a definite time limit is to be imposed for the. termination of the debate, the Government should consider the advisableness of sitting throughout the dinner hour, so that honorahle members may discuss matters during an hour and a. half whicli will not otherwise be available to them. My second suggestion is that as tbere are many honourable members who wish to speak on the Estimates for the Territories, apart from the Postal Department, the debate upon that, particular section should be in the nature of a general discussion, and honourable members should be at liberty to traverse any part of those Estimates. the committee to determine. of the "" Miscellaneous"" items in. the Estimates been dealt with en bloc, so that lionorable members could have made their speeches ou any matter covered by that heading, a saving of probably a day or a day and a half would have been effected. The adoption of the suggestions I have made will enable the best possible use to be made of the limited time that is available for further discussion. In reply to the insulting suggestions of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), I merely wish to say that whilst I have been absent from the House endeavouring to create work for the people of this country, he has :been doing things and advocating policies which are calcu-Upon this occasion, I stand upon exceptionally solid ground. I have always held that there is considerable virtue in. a good stonewall, and at the time our Standing Orders were being amended to make provision for . the guillotine I uttered my protest against placing such plenary power in the ha.nds of the Government of the day. But who is responsible for vesting that power in the Government? Practically all jiarties iu this House, because all parties were represented on the Standing Orders committee. The House, therefore, is responsible for the creation of the guillotine, the machinery by means of which the Government is enabled to cut' short debate. In these circumstances, why should there be any complaint, against the procedure that is now proposed? WhilstI stand upon, particularly firm ground, other members who object to the whip . which is about to be applied to them, must blame only themselves for the position they now occupy. In the consideration of the Estimates this year, there has been an absolute waste of valuable time, which might have been profitably devoted to the discussion",19,Allotment Oi Time

I shall vote for the application of the guillotine, a.nd when the motion has heen decided I hope that we shall proceed with the transaction of the public business in a manner that will worthily uphold the highest parliamentary traditions. [3.36] I protest against the introduction of the guillotine. Under the conditions laid down in the motion submitted by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) only four hours will be available for the discussion of some of the most important parts of the Estimates. A considerable portion of that time will be absorbed by the dinner adjournment, and seeing that under our Standing Orders a. time limit, of an hour and a half is imposed upon the speeches of honourable members, obviously, about four speeches will occupy the whole period. I shall thus be precluded from dealing with matters of vital importance to the people of the Northern Territory. I shall not be able to criticize the Government's administration of land settlement there. I shall be debarred from dealing with the mining estimates, with the adequate protection of settlers in Northern Australia, and, indeed, with any of the matters that are essential to the development of that, area. When the Northern Territory was transferred by South Australia to the Oommonwealth, it suffered the greatest calamity that could possibly befall -it. This Parliament has done nothing to assist in its development. And now, when, after waiting patiently, and remaining through all-night sittings, X should be afforded an opportunity to put forward a constructive policy for the territory, I am denied that opportunity. The guillotine is to be used to suppress discussion merely because it would reflect discredit upon the Comm oiiwenl th Governmen t. able members opposite are not very sincere in their protests agaiust this motion. their hearts, honourable members opposite welcome this procedure. So great, has been the latitude allowed to honourable members in discussing tliese Estimates that there can be no charge of undue curtailment of the debate. I assure the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) and otlier honourable members opposite that many on this side have not enjoyed remaining silent during the discussion on the Estimates in order that others might have the opportunity to speak, and thereby have their remarks published in the press as party propaganda. That honourable members will be denied further opportunities to indulge in such propaganda if this motion is agreed to is the reason for the opposition to the proposal to limit the debate. Probably no department is so well administered as is that under the control of the Postmaster-General. AlthoughI represent over 70,000 electors, I would not think of occupying the time of the House by asking for additional postal facilities at various centres in my large electorate. Instead of occupying the time of Parliament by urging that additional postal facilities be provided at this and that outback centre, honourable members would do well to write to the department a nicely-worded letter setting out the arguments in support of their request. In my opinion, the standing order providing for limitation of discussion on such occasions as this, is a wise one. orable member practice what he preaches? honourable inember for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) would welcome the proposal to limit debate, because he has told us the same thing so many times. have repeated their arguments over and over again during the discussion of these Estimates.

85,Mr Scullin,"The only point madeI wish this amendment, if carried, to be regarded by the Government as an instruction to grant to Commonwealth railway employees a restoration of wages equal to that provided for in the budget in the case of members of the Commonwealth Public Service. General) 14.4J -Commonwealt h railway employees are working under an award of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, to which applications for a restoration of wages are to be made by a large number of organizations, including, I presume, the organization to which these employees belong. It is expected that those applications w ill be heard early in the new year. The fixation* of wages that are governed by awards is left entirely to the court, but additional provision has been made so that higher wages may be paid if that necessity should arise. I consider that the request of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) is the most reasonable that could be made. The right honourable gentleman has not suggested that the restoration of wages which he seeks is adequate. No one so regards it . But, in the circumstances, a precedent having been established, the least the Government could do is to extend to Commonwealth railway employees the same measure of consideration, that has already been given by the budget to all other public servants. It is argued that, as the wages of these employees are fixed by the Arbitration Court, the restoration, of tbe cut that they have suffered is a matter for the court. Dining the last three weeks an industrial tribunal in. New South Wales has reduced the basic wage in that State by 2s. a week. Many employers have refused to apply the cut, and in some cases the State Government is counterbalancing it by means of a rebate or othei"" payments, because it is considered that this reduction is by no means justified. Therefore, the argument that the court must deal with the matter, if examined closely, will be found not to hold water. There is nothing to prevent the restoration of at least a. portion of wealth Government it. Because of that fact, I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. Other employees of the Commonwealth, with respect to whom similar action ought to he taken, are those who arc engaged at Garden Island. If the way is being paved for this restoration, I suggest that it should'operate from the date from which the benefit has been enjoyed by the Public Service generally. Such action by the Government would convince us of its sincerity. first to compliment the Commissioner of Commonwealth Railways and his staff on the improved position disclosed in the last annual report. That losses have been substantially reduced without impairing the .efficiency of the organization is a matter for congratulation. . The complaint is made that the granting of extremely low freights on the transAust.ralian railway has the effect of discriminating against traders in Western Australia. Valuable trading opportunities are presented by the existing activity on the Kalgoorlie gold-fields. The coastal belt, of Western Australia, which, by reason of its geographical position, is entitled to derive the advantage, is deprived of that trade, because the freights charged by the Commonwealth Railways are no greater than those charged on the railways of Western Australia for a distance only a quarter as great. It may he argued that the Railway Department of the State can remedy the position by reducing its rates. I propose, however, to give comparative figures, which show that the freights charged by the Commonwealth Railways discriminate against Western Australia. The principal item involved is beer, of which about 1,000 tons are carried annually from eastern States to Kalgoorlie. Towards the end of 1931, an arrangement was made between the Richmond Brewery Company, of Melbourne, and the Railway Departments of Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth, under which beer is carried from Melbourne to Kalgoorliea distance of .1,800 miles-a t the extremely low rate the wages lost. by Commonof £7 10s. a ton, which is considerably railway employees if the below the rates that prevail in the States. is prepared to make It is difficult to see how it can be made to pay.

The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner controls railways in the Pederal Capital Territory, in Northern Australia and the Transcontinental railway. The reductions of wages of employees on the Northern Australian and Federal Capital Territory railways have been partially restored, but employees engaged on the East-West line and on the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs have not benefited by any restoration. Provision has been made in the Estimates for the payment of an additional amount if they should approach the court and the courtdecides in their favour. should not win the case? restore o per cent, instead of 2£ per cent, cost of living deduction in their case has of their wages, in which case the Governmeut would have to provide an additional amount. The Government must abide by the decision of the court. From time to time the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) and other honourable members have brought under my notice the freight charges on the Trans-Australian railway, which they contend are detrimental to Western Australian trading interests. Recently, Mr Federal Capital Territory? Why canSimms, the secretary of the Commonwealth Railways, visited Canberra and conferred with honourable members interested in this subject, when the whole matter was discussed. Practically every honourable inember, including the honor-' able member for Perth, left the meeting satisfied that the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner is not deliberately cutting the freights in order to interfere with the trade of any State. The existing rates have been iu force for manj* years and I do not think that there is any prospect of au alteration being made. The matter will, however, receive the careful consideration of the Government from time to time. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), that the amount of the vote be reduced by £1, which, if carried, is to be regarded as an instruction to the Government to grant Commonwealth railway employees the same restoration of wages granted to other Commonwealth employees on the cost of living adjustment. As mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, I have brought this matter before the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins) on previous occasions, and my request has been supported by the honourable inember for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) and other honourable members. I trust that the Government will reconsider its decision, and place the employees engaged on the Trans-Australian railway on the same basis as Commonwealth railways employees iu the Federal Capital Territory where the conditions of employment are much better. a different act. been restored but employees on the Trans-Australian line have not received the same consideration. The Government is determined to resist the claims of the men and is asking them to approach the court.

The position is so unfair that, I ask .the Minister to review the whole matter, and to treat these men in the same way as Commonwealth railway employees in the Eederal Capital Territory have been treated, because, being nearer to the Seat of Government, they are able to make their voices heard. The award applying to employees engaged on the Trans-Australian railway prescribes that their wages may be reduced by 10 per cent, until otherwise ordered by the court, which means that the basic wage paid to these men has been reduced from l is. 2d. to 9s. l i d . a day. Moreover, annual leave, which has never previously been contested in any other department, can be granted only at the discretion of the Commissioner. If the State Arbitration Court awarded certain rates of pay to the men engaged in the mining industry, but left it to the discretion of the mine-owners to say under what conditions their employees should .work, what would honourable members think of such a.u award? stances, I trust that the Government will not wait until these men are compelled to go to the court as the amount involved, and for which provision is already made in the Estimates, cannot be large. Meetings of protest have been held at Port Augusta and at Kalgoorlie, where the town councils have also strongly urged the Government to place these men on the same basis as other Commonwealth, employees. The Government should be an. ideal employer aud treat its employees fairly, and thus give a lead to Other employers who may be disposed to reduce wages or to impose unnecessarily harsh conditions. |'4.30] -The North Australia railway seems to be the most remarkable business undertaking conducted by any (Proposed government.

Part c, which was adopted on a subsequent date, provides that a motion may be submitted that a member who .is speaking be no longer heard. It seems to me that tbe portion of the Standing Order which states that the closure may not be applied when a time limit is in operation does not apply to a motion that an honourable member be no longer heard. I am therefore bound to accept the motiou. draAv it. Motion-by leave-withdrawn . have figures before me showing a financial improvement in the various branches of the Postal Department. During the first four months of the present financial year, the telephone revenue was approximately £44,000 more than that recorded in the corresponding period of last year, and it represents an increase of 2.5 per cent. during the same period shows an increase of £12,000, or 3.45 per cent.; while the revenue from the postal services has increased hy £100,110, or 5.7 per cent. listeners' licences issued also shows a substantial increase, the figures for the first four months of the year being 208,066, as against 169,000 for the corresponding period last year. The revenue retained by the department from this source increased from £77,401 to £94,626. Honourable members may ask whether, in view of that improvement, the Government proposes to reduce the eost of postal from l | d . to 2d. When that increase was made, the Postmaster-General of the day The justification for this measure is the urgent necessity to raise portion of the money that must be found under the budget proposals. In normal circumstances, we should not be submitting a bill to increase the postal rates, because we feel that the Postal Department should not be used as a taxing machine. But these are not normal times. It is absolutely essential that additional revenue he raised from the postal service if we are to avoid further collection by way of direct taxation. I subscribe entirely to the view that the post ofiice should not be a Britain and some other countries, much of the money received for postal services is paid into the Consolidated Revenue. The greater part of the revenue obtained from postage, of course, is paid, not by the masses of the people, but by the commercial interests; hut, in view of the concessions already made to those interests, the time is inopportune for further reductions of their rates. Representations have been made to me by practically every honourable member as to the necessity to grant free wireless I listeners' licences to the blind. In. recent years several progressive countries haAe recognized the exceptional r disabilities of the blind by granting to them free licences for the reception of broadcast programmes. In Australia, the position has been examined on several occasions, but, largely owing to administrative difficulties, and the embarrassing The revenue from telegraphs discrimination likely to arise in connection with other sufferers and aged, indigent persons, the concession of free licences for the blind has hitherto been withheld.

These new arrangements have been under consideration for some time, and will take effect from the 1st January next. The rates charged for residence telephone Services have also been under consideration. endeavouring for some time past to find the means for the introduction of a lower tariff in respect of telephone services con-, nocting private residences in. the capital cities. Such a plan has become more pressing as the result of the higher telephone charges imposed in these areas three years ago, and as a consequence of the reduced earning capacity of the community generally, and of the cancellations of service, with the contingent growth of idle plant. Unfortunately, largely owing to the heavy exchange payments on the interest, payable upon loan money, there is at present a. deficit on the telephone Recount, and consequently there has been hesitancy to embark onany plan for* reduced charges; but the detailed studies undertaken have resulted in the completion of a scheme whioh, while offering some relief to those wavering on. the question of retaining or cancelling their services, also affords an inducement to other potential small users to become regular subscribers to the system. It is proposed to offer residence users a reduction of the annual rental by f l , and in respect of the first 9G0 calls originated yearly to increase the foe from Ijrd. to l i d . per call. A f t e r that nnmber of calls has been made in any one year a charge of l i d . per call will be imposed for the remaining calls made during the year. There are approximately 95,000 residence services existing in the metropolitan networks, and 75 per cent, of these now make less than 960 calls each annually, consequently the revised arrangements will affect, 70,000 subscribers. It will be observed that the proposal makes it possible for a residence subscriber to have a telephone in his Limited in dwelling for f l per annum less than is of patent royalties is no the case at present, but that the advantage gradually diminishes u n t i l it disappears when the number of originating calls in .1 am pleased to be able any one year reaches a total of 960. Wherever the number of calls exceeds this figure, the charges are similar to those now current. The alteration will involve the department in an immediate loss of revenue of about £35,000 per annum, assuming it does not result in new services being ordered. It is believed, however, that the nature of the change w ill help considerably to popularize the use of the telephone, to stimulate development in The department has been residential areas, and thus lead to an expansion of business generally.

One of the main objects which the department, has in view in making these adjustments is to restore to use many telephone instruments which, in consequence of. the depression, have been disconnected from residences and placed in store.

I admit that to some extent the alteration is more of a readjustment than a reduction of charges, the main purpose being to encourage more people to connect with the telephone system, and so provide work in the reconditioning of equipment that has been out of use for some time. Buti t is also true that all subscribers who make less than 960 calls a year w ill reap an advantage. twenty calls a week w ill be neither better nor worse off. That is so. The Government has not, however, forgotten the subscribers connected with small telephone exchanges. During the last two years, the extension of hours of service at exchanges where business has increased has been held in abeyance because of the economic conditions. Meanwhile a comprehensive investigation has beeji undertaken to find ways and means of improving the facilities afforded to users in the areas of comparatively small population density. Hitherto, apart from the group of exchanges large enough to enjoy continuous service, there have been two main groups provided with service(a) Open from !) a an. to G p.m., with a one hour break for lunch, a weekly halfholiday, and with no service on Sundays or holidays; (6) Open from 0 a.m. to 8 p.m., with a one hour break for lunch, a weekly halfholiday, and with no service on Sundays or holidays. It is proposed to introduce an additional classification for adoption at those places where there is a reasonable amount of business, but not sufficient to warrant the expense incurred in giving continuous service. This classification w ill cover service from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. from Mondays to Saturdays, with a weekly half-hoiiday, and one hour's service on Sundays and holidays. tended to ease the restrictions imposed during the last two years so that, in all those cases where there is justification as a result of the volume of business offering, exchanges may be transferred from one classification to another in which the longer hours of service may be enjoyed. It is estimated that 200 exchanges will benefit at the outset under the revised conditions. The additional immediate cost to the department w ill be about £5,000 per annum. The innovation will, however, enhance the popularity of the service i u country districts, and inevitably lead to the increased use of the existing plant which has a margin for the carrying of additional traffic.

Tenders have been called for the supply of additional rural automatic telephone equipment, and it is hoped to proceed during the current financial year with approximately 30 installations. The precise number w ill depend largely on the result of the tenders. In the in it i a l stages, it is intended to install this automatic equipment at exchanges where the development is approaching the stage which normally justifies extended or continuous hours of service; that is, where approximately 40 subscribers are connected."" The number of installations to be undertaken this year w ill also be dependent upon the speed with which deliveries can be made after the tenders have been actually let. The approximate cost of the provision and installation of a 50-line unit is expected to be in the region of from £1,000 to £1,200. Representations have frequently been made to me to convert city manual exchanges into automatic exchanges, but to do so' involves an expenditure of from £40,000 to £60,000 in each case, and the department has been compelled to adhere to its policy of persevering with all manual exhanges capable of rendering several years more of reasonably effective It is also in service.

Usually, the office is placed in the charge of some one who is able to conduct it in conjunction with some business or calling which necessitates attendance at the premises in which the office is located. Payment to non-official postmasters is made on the basis of evaluated work units, with reasonable allowances for ineffective time, accommodation, lighting, cleaning, and so on, re-adjustmeuts being made annually, in accordance with any fluctuations in the volume of the work. The whole system was exhaustively reviewed in 1927, and re-adjustments then made in the conditions in favour of the non-official postmasters resulted in additional allowances being paid to the extent of £90,000 por annum. Unfortunately, in the last two or three years, owing to the falling off in business, many postmasters have suffered a reduction of their remuneration; but recently traffic has shown a decided upward tendency, and this will automatically restore some of the loss of income which they thus suffered. Following upon the passing of the Financial Emergency Act relating to the salaries of permanent public servants, the non-official postmasters were called upon to share in the sacrifices, but the reductions imposed were on a much lower scale than those applied to the permanent staff, and were arranged on a sliding scale commencing at the low rate of 2^ per cent. The restoration of a portion of the cut recently decided upon by the Government will immediately benefit the non-official postmasters to the extent of £20,000 per annum. made in the same ratio as the reduction wns made? a considerable extent. I come now to the subject of the remuneration of semi-official postmasters.

The department is fully alive to the desirability of establishing additional national broadcasting stations to provide a better service to areas hitherto not adequately catered for. Originally, the national stations were located in the various State capital cities, but some years ago, a policy of expansion was launched; the equipment at many of the then existing establishments was improved, and new stations were provided at Newcastle and Corowa, New South Wales; Roekhamptoit, Queensland; and Crystal Brook, South Australia. Owing, however, to the acute financial stringency in more recent years, this developmental scheme was, perforce, for the time being arrested; but within the last twelve mouths conditions hare improved sufficiently to permit of the national broadcasting service being further extended in accordance with a carefully-prepared plan, upon completion of which the populated areas of the Commonwealth will be provided with a good radio service. The department, has accordingly now embarked upon an extensive construction programme to the limit of present financial resources, embracing seven new stations, all in areas requiring urgent attention. The districts in which these stations will be located are Grafton and Dubbo, New South Wales; Sale ami Nbill-Murtoa, Victoria;",30,Parkhill Am Quite Prepared To Consider That Sug

Tenders, which have already been dealt with, indicate that the cost of the Grafton, Sale, Townsville and Launceston stations will he approximately £70,000. Tenders closed on the 14th instant for the remaining three Stations, the cost of which it is anticipated will be proportionately much the same as for the first four-£40,000 . It will, therefore, be seen that tlie seven new stations in question will cost something iu the neighbourhood of £110,000. These new stations will be erected and put into service as quickly as possible, and should not be regarded merely as relay or repeating stations, intended to. serve some particular town. powerful installations, the sites for which are chosen so that the service areas embrace many towns aud their surrounding districts. The only other matter to which I shall refer is the Tasmanian telephone cable. A recent careful estimate of the probable traffic shows that the following channels will be required :Broadcast programme line 1935. 1 1940. Trunk telephone line Telegraph channels) It is anticipated that the submarine cable will provide all the channels required for fifteen years after installation. The cost of the work was estimated at £.180,000 when the proposal received the concurrence of the Public Works Committee, but since that time the price of metals has fallen substantially, possibly more than sufficient to offset the exchange which would have to be paid for cable purchased overseas. The estimated revemio from the submarine cable scheme is £8,033 in the first year, rising to £13,267 in the fifth, £20,800 in the tenth, aud £26,4.60 in the fifteenth years. Although tbe project, cannot be expected to be financially self-supporting for a fewyears, the contribution may be a small price to pay considering the commercial and social benefits which should result, and the gratification with which such a federal gesture is being received by the people of Tasmania.

During the past seven or eight months, statements have appeared in the press that the Government contemplated handing over a portion of these huge areas to chartered companies, and offering substantial concessions to persons who are willing to embark upon settlement there. Three Ministers who have successively controlled the territory have made visits of inspection to it, and the permanent head of the Department of the Interior recently returned from a comprehensive tour there, yet we have not the slightest indication of what is to be done with Northern ancl Central Australia. The development of the Northern Territory is a very serious problem, indeed, and one which proved to be beyond the capacity of many governments of South Australia and of Great Britain. It also presents no inconsiderable problem to the Commonwealth. The Northern Territory is the only place that Great Britain definitely failed to colonize. She admitted failure, when she withdrew her outposts from it during the last century. EvenThe first, of tually the territory was taken over by South Australia, because the other colonies realized that its development would impose upon them an unduly heavy burden. However. South Australia glad to surrender the territory to the Commonwealth. The results which have followed Commonwealth administration have not been of a very encouraging nature. What the Northern Territory has lacked over a period of years has been a settled and continuous policy. Owing to the rapidity with which governments come and go. before a Minister controlling the territory has had time to become acquainted with its problems, he has been displaced from office, ancl thus his knowledge and experience have been lost to Australia. I believe that the future development of Northern and Central Australia depends almost entirely upon stock raising. The safest method of developing it is by concentrating upon cattle raising. The time has not yet arrived when settlers can embark on sheep raising, because owing to its sparsely watered areas, there is a very great danger that any money they invested in such an enterprise, would be lost. I rose chiefly to urge that consideration should be extended to the holders of large leases. Portions of",35,Parkhill Has Been Made I N That Direction The

One property iu that particular area did embark upon sheep raising, but after a comparatively brief period was compelled to abandon its operations. My own idea is that at present the country is suitable for settlement only in large areas, and that very liberal conditions in respect of stocking and improvements must, be extended to lessees if they are to achieve even moderate success. One of the greatest harriers to settletion of existing lessees is to be. ment in Northern Australia is the tremendous cost of transport. Honourable members will understand the disabilities to which settlers are subjected when I tell them that flour landed at Brunette Downs, costs £36 16s. a ton, sugar £60 a ton, petrol £1 13s. a case, and kerosene £1 10s. 6d. a case. Enormous sums have been sunk in the development of the Northern Territory by private enterprise. Since 192S, no less than £54,000 has been expended in developing Brunette Downs which comprises an area of between 8,000 and 10,000 square miles. North of that is the largest cattle station in the world, the Victoria River Downs, which has an area of 14,000 square miles, and carries 160,000 head of cattle. If those cattle are worth only £3 a head, obviously a very large sum has been invested in that property. Then, Vestey Brothers erected extensive meat works in the territoryworks in which they sank nearly £1,000,000. Yet. finally'they had to close them down. The only way in which the territory can be developed so as to enable settlers to reap the maximum of advantage, is by an improved method of communication, and the only form of communication worth considering is tliat of a railway linking it up with Queensland. I believe that if the strip of desert country between Camooweal and Cloncurry were bridged by a railway, it would mark the beginning of better times for the territory. Some of the lessees in the territory have told me that when this question of railway communication was put before a member of the present Government, he said that the best method of There is, for example, moving stock from that country was by means of motor transport. Seeing that, some stations are obliged to move as many as 40,000 beasts a year, and that a motor truck could not transport more than six beasts at a time, obviously the Minister did not know what he was talking about. Minister made the statement. from a very good authority. If the Government intends to allow chartered companies to operate in the territory, this House is entitled to know what the posiPractically all the grazing areas of fair quality in the territory are already subject to leases which will not expire until 1965 or thereabouts. I have no desire to labour this question, but I wish to impress the House with its importance, and with the necessity which exists for the Government doing something with the territory, thereby affording Australia a more adequate defence against possible aggression. representatives of countiy districts heard with pleasure the statement of the Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) this afternoon that the hours during which country telephone exchanges remain open will be extended. Owing to the depression, tbe number of subscribers to country telephone exchanges has dropped, and, in consequence of the lessened revenue, the hours during which the exchanges remain open have, in some instances, been reduced, even when the amount involved has been only a few pounds. In a matter so important as the provision of telephone facilities in country districts, the department should not follow a cheeseparing policy. In all probability, the number of subscribers will soon increase sufficiently to justify the exchanges being kept open longer. The action of the department is having a detrimental effect on its revenue, for many persons would become subscribers if a better service wore provided.

Owing to tbe rapidity at wbicb tbe Minister spoke, I found difficulty in following bim, but I understood bim to say that it is intended that country telephone exchanges shall remain open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. in future. If that is so, the action of the department will be greatly appreciated by country residents. I hope that there will not be too keen a desire on the part of the department to deprive country residents of telephone facilities merely because of a technical non-compliance with certain requirements. I trust that the department will realize that the greater the facilities provided, the greater the volume of business. I am not aware of the present position in regard to the provision of telephonic communications iu country districts, but I know that for several years it has been difficult for country residents to obtain telephones. When they have applied to the department for telephones they have been required to supply their own poles and wires. If those conditions still exist, I hope that they will be liberalized. Some of the official post office residences in my electorate are old and out of date. should at least be maintained in a condition equal to that of other residences for which similar rentals are paid. The postmaster's residence at Mount Gambier is particularly inconvenient, and I ask the Postmaster-General to see what can be done to improve it. The postmaster at Wolseley is in an unfortunate position, there being no suitable residence available for him. I have previously asked that money voted for the relief of unemployment at Wolseley should be devoted to the building of a residence for the postmaster there, but the department could not see its way to accede to my request. Something should be done to ease the position atthat important centre. ground that the business transacted by the I support the request of the honourable member for Angus( Mr Gabb) for better postal facilities at Edwardstown, South Australia. This rapidly developing district should have its own official post office. The Postmaster-General announced the intention of the department to establish a wireless broadcasting station at Nhill, Victoria. I had hoped that a station Mr Cameron. would be erected in the south-eastern portion of South Australia, which has now to rely chiefly on programmes from Melbourne. I hope that the station at Nhill will be of such a nature that the people in the south-eastern portion of South Australia will be better served than is now the case. I compliment the Postmaster General on the forward movement he proposes in connection with liberalizing the telephone services; and 1 urge him not to reduce the hours during which country telephone exchanges will remain open. I am pleased that he has been able to give further assistance to non-official postmasters and postmistresses, who are doing valuable work in the community. request of a number of municipal and shire councils in my electorate, I bring under the notice of the Postmaster General( Mr Parkhill) the need for telephone facilities at pleasure resorts and other places in the vicinity of Lake Macquarie. In the event of an accident to holiday-makers in the district, there is no telephone by which a doctor may be summoned When I These dwellings urged the provision of a telephone at the blacksmith's shop at Swansea, the department contended that there was not sufficient money available for the purpose, even if the provision of telephonic facilities were warranted. I understand that the revenue of the Post Office is increasing, and therefore the department cannot plead financial inability to provide this needed public utility. The residents of Wallsend have requested the restoration of postal facilities which they enjoyed before the Commonwealth took over postal matters from the States, but of which they have been deprived during recent years, on the post office or letter receivers there does not justify their continuance. It is deplorable that facilities which were enjoyed in pre-federation days should be denied to residents of that town merely because of a temporary depression.

This request is one which the department should grant without delay, because the golf club numbers among its members several local doctors, whose services may at any time bo urgently needed because of casualties in the mines. The risk of accidents in the coal-mining industry is much greater than in any other avocation, not excepting gold-mining, so it is essential that, if any of the local doctors are at the golf club, they should be in touch by telephone witli the local mine's or hospital, where their services may be required at short notice. Bellbird is another large town whicli came prominently under notice some years ago because of the explosion in the local mine, involving the loss of 21 lives. It has no official post office, and no letter the claim of ex-temporary employees, who or telegram delivery. ""When I visit other parts of tbe State and see splendid postal buildings, and kuow that all the necessary facilities are provided for towns much smaller than those in my district which I have mentioned, I wonder sometimes what influences have been at work.

The town of West Maitland, which is the centre of the largest subdivision in of installation, although the my electorate, has a decent post office, but Hinton and other adjacent towns have been unable to obtain from the department an improvement of their telephonic facilities.

The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), the leader of the party of which I am a member, has received tlie following letter from Mr J. T. Sweeney, M.L.A.:Some time ago, I presented a petition to the I'oatmaster-Gcnerai per I i r . McNicoll, mid the revenue that they are entitled to claim signed 'by over 400 residents of Uellambi and Eussell Vale, praying for a letter delivery in that area. The request was refused. There is a post ofiice at Bclla.mhi but no delivery, the reason given for the refusal being that the number of letters did not wurr.ant a letter delivery. Hut the fact is that the letters directed to Bel Iambi post ofiice does not represent the whole of the letters received in that area. Ad owing to the distance from Bellamhi, many residents get their letters directed to either Corrimal or Woonona and they are delivered by scliool children or tradesmen. This area, is a narrow strip of country extending from the beach, west to the foot of the range, and is about a quarter of a mile wide. lx>UeTS are delivered to within SO yards of the southern boundary of the area from Corrimal post ofiice. And to within the same distance from the northern boundary letters are delivered from the Woonona .post office. If you could do anything to help mc in this matter I would be very much obliged and you would earn the thuuks of the residents if this injustice was removed. Another factor is that the progress of the locality is retarded because of the inconvenient postal arrangements. T ask that particular attention be paid to these matters. Unlike the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), I do not propose to place before the Postmaster-General( Mr diture that may be debited to it are £50 Parkhill) the claims of my electorate. Such matters should, I think, be discussed with the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs. I know that the Minister has to contend with many administrative difficulties, and I sympathize with him, because of the impossibility of remedying what some honourable members regard as anomalies. An anomaly mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter is the boundary beyond which letters are not distributed. nsoi But some boundary must be fixed, and The wherever it is fixed we shall not satisfy I compliment the Postmaster-General upon having given to city telephone subscribers a concession in regard to rentals, and also upon the extension of the hours of service of 200 country offices, which will considerably benefit, country peoplo. While I was Postmaster-General, I did all that. I could for the country people. I poiut out to the Postmaster-General that country areas are not credited with tbey have earned. When the department speaks of the revenue of a country post office, it refers only to revenue for outward services. As it earns also revenue for inward services which would not be earned if the office did not exist, it is entitled to be credited with both. The departmental figures show a huge loss on the operation of country telephones because only the outward service is taken into consideration. I was pleased to hear the Postmaster General say that it. is proposed to install an additional 30 or 40 automatic telephone exchanges. I was really responsible for the installation of the first of the rural automatic exchanges, and I helieve that Australia adopted this system for rural districts before any otlier country. The experimental stage has long passed. About, twenty of these exchanges have been operating in the different States for four or five years, and have proved completely successful. The Postmaster General has stated that the cost of an automatic exchange of 40 subscribers is about £1,000. I point out that it costs nothing to operate an automatic exchange, and that the only items of annual expenper annum for interest, and £50 per annum for depreciation and maintenance. The cost of operating a manual exchange, however, is £5 for each subscriber. Therefore, the annual expenditure for the operation of a manual exchange of 40 subscribers would be £200. Thus the department would save £100 per annum on each automatic exchange installed. As an economy measure, therefore, its installation in , many more country districts is unquestionably warranted. With an",40,Parkhill Has Been Made I N That Direction The
147,Mr Gibson (Corangamite) [8.10],"exchange of 50 or 60 subscribers, the savwas placed. This automatic post office ing to the department would be very much greater, because the cost of installation would not be much higher, whilst, if an all-night service had to be given, the cost addressees, and .is available to them at of operating a manual exchange would be considerably increased. The benefit of an all-night service to country subscribers is immeasurable. The city subscriber is at his office or his home day and night, but many country subscribers have to work in the fields until 6 p.m. or 7 p.m., and consequently need continuous service. certain difficulties present themselves, one of which is that the installation of an partment, and would confer a great beneautomatic exchange is dependent upon the existence of a power system. The power is returned over the trunk line to the nearest point on the electric system from which the power is derived, which may be up to 25 miles from the exchange. The cost of the power is practically nil, because the electric energy required to operate a rural automatic telephone is not as much as is consumed by an ordinary electric globe. have to be converted ? only small. I. should like to refer briefly to the establishment of automatic post offices. 1 do not agree with the views expressed by those honourable members who have asked the Postmaster-General to make money available for the erection of additional post offices in country districts. Those who have travelled in the rural districts of Groat Britain will have noticed that there aro very few official post offices outside the large cities and towns. Most of the postal work in the rural districts of Great Britain is conducted on private business premises, and the service rendered to the people is quite satisfactory. I know that the Postmaster-General deavouring to render the best possible service to the people, and I ask him to take into consideration the establishment of automatic post offices. When I was Postmaster-General, I arranged for the system to be tried in my own electorate. Not far from my home boxes were installed in which -the mail matter for the residents in the locality has been successfully conducted for the last five years. The mail matter is delivered into the boxes of the respective any time of the day or night. I know of no complaints having been made concerning this economical and effective system. A person wishing to purchase postal notes, or postage stamps merely despatches a letter to the nearest post office asking for what is required, and it is sent to him by the department. TheI realize, of course, that establishment of such offices would result in a huge saving to the postal defit upon residents in country districts. charge of the office? matic postal system, it is only necessary to provide boxes for the reception of mail' matter. In the case I have mentioned, a small block of ground was leased from the municipal authorities free of rent, and the cost of installing the letter boxes was* about £50. I hope that the Postmaster-General will make an amount available for the extension of this system, whicb would be of benefit particularly to those who are usually away from home during the day. The development in the electorate which I represent has been rapid, and some post offices which had beeu taken over by the Commonwealth from the State authori<t.ies at the inception of federation, are in a most dilapidated condition. Some of them have been erected for over 50 years, and the accommodation is quite inadequate. Obviously, accommodation that was adequate twenty years ago when it was provided is not sufficient to-day in a district which has developed rapidly. I regret that provision was not made in the is enWorks and Buildings Estimates for a new post offiee at Thursday Island. I know that the works department is Opposed to money being expended on renovating the present building, which, according to the Director of Works in Queensland, is a sink for public money.

If the present post office at Bowen were offered at auction, it would not realize more than £150, yet machinery aud plant valued at £15,000 is installed in it. Quite' recently, a fire occurred in the building, and had the wind been unfavorable, the whole structure and the valuable machinery would have been destroyed. Similar conditions exist at Ayr, where the building, although in a better state of preservation than that at Bowen, is quite unsuitable. In a number of these offices, the banking business transacted is more extensive than the ordinary savings bank business undertaken at post offices, and, in some instances, thousands of pounds pass through the hands of postal officials every month. This increases their work, and renders necessary the erection of more suitable structures. Within the last few days, I made representations to the Postmaster General( Mr Parkhill) concerning the present post office building at Ingham, which is over 50 years old. It is practically impossible to perform efficient work in the limited space available in the building. It is useless to repair the building, which is too old, and I , trust that a new post office will be buill at an early date. The expenditure of money on renovating dilapidated buildings is uneconomic, and I trust that the Postmaster-General will authorize the construction of new buildings where they are most needed. The present Postmaster General has rendered valuable service to all sections, and the additional services provided in my electorate are very much appreciated. I believe that the honourable gentleman is a good and conscientious administrator, and, as a country representative, I know that the improvements made in country postal and telephonic services during the time he has been in office have been as extensive as the circumstances justify. It is unnecessary to incur heavy expenditure in constructing additional post offices when country residents require mail deliveries under the most modern methods. I have not any complaints to offer concerning the administration of this department, and -my only reason for bringing these matters under the notice of the Postmaster General to-night is that I believe that more effective representations can be made in this way than by correspondence. I trust that before long sufficient money .will be available to erect new post offices at. the places I have mentioned. like to know if the Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) cannot improve the conditions of letter-carriers who at. present are performing very important work at a salary of only £198 per annum. It will be admitted by honourable members that the men engaged in this work are of a fine type, and carry out their duties with entire satisfaction to the public. Many letter-carriers have been in the service of the department for twenty years or more, and although their wages and conditions are governed by Arbitration Court awardSj-some concession should be extended to them, perhaps by making an allowance for the wear aud tear 'on their clothing, which is unusually severe, owing to the fact that they have to work in all weathers. These men should be compensated in some way when compelled to be absent from duty owing to ill health. Persons who have been engaged in private employment for many years receive extra remuneration for long service, and automatic increases should be paid to letter-carriers or a bonus paid to those who have rendered loyal service to the department. Reference has been made to the large number of adults employed in the Postmaster-General's Department at juniors' wages. Some of these young men on reaching 21 years of age have married, and consequently find the remuneration insufficient to maintain a home. I know of one of these young men who has heavy financial responsibilities but is receiving less than the basic wage, and is, therefore, very dissatisfied. I also direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that at one post office over 700 pensioners attend on each pension pay day. Departmental officials conducted an investigation to ascertain whether some of the business eould be transferred to other post offices. At Hurstville there is a good deal of congestion, and I believe that the",42,Parkhill Has Been Made I N That Direction The

A general order should be issued to tbe postal officials that pensioners should not be subcosting from £2,000 to £3,000 is not jected to unkind remarks if they apply for their pensions on days other than the regular pay-day A considerable number of the pensioners object to being compelled ' to apply for their money at' a particular time, and to stand in a queue awaiting their turn. The fact that pensioners can obtain payment in other ways is not generally known to them: I was informed recently that a certain postmaster had told an individual who represented a number of pensioners that they must call for tbeir money every other Thursday, and on no other day. I hope that, on whatever day a pensioner applies for his money, it will be paid to him. have payment by cheque. find it inconvenient to cash cheques. The residents in the sparsely-populated suburb of Peakhurst consider that they should not have been deprived of their telephone service. The reason advanced hy the department for its removal was that it did not return sufficient revenue to warrant its maintenance. The post office is intended to give service to the people rather than to be a profit-making undertaking, and, once a telephone service is established in an outlying suburb, surely it is not so costly to maintain as is a service in a business area. The residents of South Hurstville and Allawah find it inconvenient to have to walk a mile or two to get money orders cashed at the Hurstville post office, and additional facilities should be provided for them. About 74,000 electors reside in that district. I hope that the telephone service at Kogarah will soon be changed from the manual to the automatic system. About 600 or 700 subscribers already have the benefit of the automatic system, and I trust that the remainder of the subscribers will have automatic telephones before the end of tbe present financial year. admire the telephone boxes which the department is placing in streets in good residential areas. I am now in communication with the department on this matter, and have suggested that a design which is not unsightly should be chosen. The action of the department in erecting ugly telephone boxes alongside houses creditable. I congratulate the Postmaster-General upon his announcement that, in response to requests from honourable members generally, he has decided to grant free broadcast listeners' licences to the blind. I am sure that this concession will be greatly appreciated by this unfortunate section of the community. I urge the Po3tmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) to. consider the desirability of restoring to hospitals tbe telephone charge concession which they formerly enjoyed. The honourable gentleman does not need to be reminded that these institutions are notoriously impecunious, and have to carry on their activities from year to year with the assistance of the local residents. The hospitals are deserving of every possible consideration at the hands of this Parliament. In some country districts, the business hours of adjacent telephone exchanges so vary that, at about midday subscribers in different exchanges are unable to com municate with one another for two hours. The office hours of one exchange are, say, from 9 a.m. to noon, and from 1 to 6 p.m. In a neighbouring exchange, the luncheon hour is between 1 and 2 p.m., and a subscriber connected with that exchange is unable to communicate with a subscriber on the other exchange between noon and 2 p.m. Will the Minister endeavour to bring about uniformity, in the hours of closing? I congratulate the Postmaster General( Mr Parkhill) and his department generally on the efficiency of its work. Most people consider that, excellent postal facilities are afforded.

160,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"tory-it Victoria-with an auriferous belt running through it for a distance of 1,100 miles, we realize the utter absurdity of the provision of £1,S00 for the development of the mining industry there. In Queenslaud, apart from the ordinary mining vote, the Mines Department has granted a sum of £25,000 afld under the unemployed vote, a further sum of £7,960, snaking a total of £37,960 for the assistance of prospectors and the provision of employment for 2,386 men, who are prepared to go out into the outback country of that State in an endeavour to make mother earth disgorge her bidden wealth. Tbere is no greater asset in Australia to-day than the mining industry, which has undoubtedly played a most prominent part in the development of this country. Had it not been for our mining activities, it is doubtful whether Australia would have progressed to the extent that it has. If ihe Government would assist prospectors with rations, there would be every prospect of tbe mining fields in the permanent employment. State Governments are assisting in the development of mining upon a £1 for £1 basis, and surely if we are sincere in our endeavour to develop the Northern Territory, we should not, hesitate to follow their example. ment has refused to benefit from the experience of some of the States. In WeStor-n Australia there are 23 State batteries which have won gold to the value of £6,000,000, and there is ne reason why that flue effort should not, be repeated, in the Northern Territory, provided that the Government gives the necessary assistance at the initial stage of the industry. It is the prospector, not the capitalist, who has developed the mining industry. The investor plays his part only after the prospector has proved the wealth of a field. Capital will not be attracted to the Northern Territory until the depths aud values of gold seams have been proved. This Government should be anxious to assist men to engage in this industry, particularly when by so doing it would give employment to men who would be only too glad to be free of the stigma of being on the dole. The Government is providing £1,800 for assistance to Mr Nelson. is about six times tbe size of mining; but I contend that an expenditure of £80,000 would be more commensurate to the possibilities of this huge tract of country. Despite tbe varied climate and fertile soils of the Northern Territory, the small sum of £600 has been placed on the Estimates to assist in its development. I cannot but express the utmost contempt for this meagre provision; but, when one realizes that the Government is making a frantic effort to drive men off the land, one can quite understand its action in making available the paltry sum of £600 for the development of the territory. Last year tbe vote was £750, but only £407 was expended. Despite that fact one settler in the Northern Territory who was in arrears to the extent of less than £50, was put to the inconvenience of having the whole of his machinery seized by the local constable. I protested, without avail, to the department, and when the wet season commenced this man, because of the loss of his implements, was unable to cultivate his land. Considering Northern Territory providing what is being done in Queensland and Some of the 3ome of the other States to assist the men on the land, by way of advances for machinery and other purposes, one marvels at the lack of pioneering instinct in this Government, which is supposed to be directing the destinies of the settlers in Unfortunately this Governthe Northern Territory. I have particulars of the cases of many men who have been driven off the land. ""When a man first settles on the land, the department takes a mortgage over it. Later the department forwards to the settler a mortgage on his home, that is, his town home apart from his farm, which he is instructed to sign; he is informed that, if he fails to return the mortgage signed within a specified time, the matter will be placed in the hands of the Crown Law office. Most impertinent official letters are forwarded by the department to the settlers, and, under such methods of administration, one can easily understand why little or no progress is being made in the development of the Northern Territory. Although the vote for assisting the development of primary production has been reduced from £750 to £600, I have no doubt that, at the end of the financial year, an amount of approximately £400 will still remain unexpended. The Commonwealth Government, when it took over ihe Northern Territory from the State of South Australia, accepted the obligation to develop it. To-night I have distributed among honourable members pamphlets and leaflets containing glowing pictures painted by the Federal Government in an effort to induce people to settle in the territory, and there is undoubtedly merit in that propaganda. But I know of instances of men who have cultivated ground on river banks and raised crops, but, because of lack of transport, have had to leave the crops standing for six or eight months, to be finally burnt off by bush fires. Is it any wonder that, under these conditions, men have failed to make good in that country? Agricultural Bank of Queensland advances moneys to settlers to enable them to effect improvements and to purchase stock, machinery and other farming necessities; yet, in the Northern Territory, because a settler was in arrears to the amount of £47, he was persecuted by the department and driven off the land.

Seeing that be treated as export flour, upon which a the Northern Territory is administered by this Parliament, it is the duty of all honourable members to acquaint themselves with what is happening there. The smaller stock-owners in Central and Northern Australia have many difficulties to contend with. It costs £750 for a special train to carry 250 head of cattle from Alice Springs to Adelaide. The train is brought up empty from Adelaide, and the stockholders have repeatedly asked that they be allowed to load fodder on it in South Australia with which to feed their stock before entraining them. The stock routes in Northern and Central Australia are generally eaten down by travelling stock, so that cattle, upon reaching the railway station, The may have been days without food. Having paid £750 for a train, the stockholders are surely entitled to have fodder brought on it. When their representations arc brought, before the Minister, he invariably says he will look into the matter to see what can be done, but it is then found that absolute power is vested in the Commonwealth Commissioner of Railways to administer the railways as he thinks fit, and the Minister himself is ThereAn honourable member has reminded rebate is allowed.",45,Parkhill Has Been Made I N That Direction The

Instead of wireless for the service to the Bankstown Olympic Pool is £5 10s. per annum, the radial distance from the connecting exchange being half a mile greater in the ease of the former. There is no doubt that this variation is exorbitant, and it is of cases of this nature that the council is making its complaint. The council is of opinion that if the higher charges at present being made were reduced to make a uniformity in the charges generally, it would eliminate tlie cause of complaints and would tend to increase the number of subscribers with u resultant lament to the Postal Department. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you would make every endeavour txi have the council's wishes, complied with. I havo also a chain letter from the town clerk at Canterbury requesting the Postmaster-General favourably to consider the proposal to allow members of municipal mid shire councils the privilege of free correspondence through the post. It is held that these bodies are engaged in seini-governmental activities, and that their members arc not paid for their services.

The holders of these licences are strongly of opinion that the fees they pay should be reduced. 1 do not like to indulge in parish pump politics, but there are many owners of wireless sets who have recently been thrown out of employment, and who would be greatly eonvenienced if they were permitted to pay their licence fee of 24s. annually, by quarterly instalments. is being introduced under which they will be able to pay it gradually by the use of stamps.

As other honourable members desire to address the committee, I shall conclude by expressing the hope that I may speedily receive from the Postmaster-General a communication informing me that everyrhing for which I have asked has been granted."" regrettable that the present session may close without any announcement by the Government, as to what, it intends to do with the Northern Territory. Up to date, the most important announcement was made by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), who said that the Constitution did not. bind the Commonwealth in respect of any concession it might, grant to Northern Australia. For more than 30 years, the Commonwealth has been spending enormous sums of money upon Utopian Holroyd, Canterbury, schemes there-scheme s which have dismally failed, seeing that there is a smaller population in the Northern Territory Finally, in comto-day than ever before. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Abbott) has stressed, not merely the great resources of the Territory, but the immense cost, of every requirement of the settler tliere. But, unfortunately, he suggested as the best method of developing this area, the construction of a railway to link up with the Queensland railway system. I submit that it would be nothing short of a scandal to ask people to invest their capital in the Territory under present economic, conditions.

I now wish to point to some of the diffiuntil this dual service has been properly culties placed in the way of development by tbe Commonwealth itself. In Western Australia, the State Government has expended £670,000 in building railways to open up new wheat country. At one of the sidings in this area, 90,000 bags of wheat were delivered last year, showing that that expenditure was abundantly warranted. We may fairly assume that the State also expended another £100,000 or £200,000 upon assistance to farmers within that area, and in providing them with a water supply and other public utilities. Recently, an application was made to the Commonwealth to erect a telephone line along one of these railway routes, but up to the present it has not been granted. Instead of the Government boasting of having reduced wireless licence-fees, it. sliould offer better facilities for communication to those persons who are develop these remote areas. Whilst it is a very good thing to grant concessions to city residents, a greater obligation rests on the Government, I hope that fhe Postmaster-General will investigate Mr Gregory. my request with a view to seeing whether proper facilities for communication cannot be extended to tbe settlers in these isolated regions. In the north-west of Western Australia, in the Kimberley district, ancl in the it is impossible for the owners of wireless sets to secure a satisfactory service from the broadcasting stations of the Commonwealth, because these stations are too far distant for a long-wave service. Experts outside the Postal Department recommend the installation Australia of a dual long wave ancl short wave service. This service was tried in Western Australia-with very marked success, station 6WF being worked on the dual wave system when it was privately owned. Along the north-west coast of that State, the owners of wireless sets have been obliged to install a short-wave conditions, and I hope that receiver in order that they may hear musical programmes broadcast from Saigon, in French Cochin-Chin a, Java, and Pennant Hills, Sydney.

186,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [10.2],"Inupon them. Any one who reads them to-day. especially one with a knowledge of farming, must agree that they contain grave misrepresentations. Some members of this Parliament at the timeI was one of them-proteste d against this misrepresentation. I believe that one of the cruellest actions ever taken in the history be employed for either six months or a of Australia has been the luring of thousands of persons from their homeland to Australia, where they have Ibecome stranded. -in the name of the 'Commonwealth and of some -of the States. Eor example, one of tbe pamphlets issued in 1923 pointed out that the average cost of laud and improvements, stock, housing, fencing, &c, for an area of land upon which a migrant could make a good living, would be from £900 to £1,500. Not a practical farmer in Australia, or, at least, in Victoria, believed that. in Queensland. applied in States wliere Crown land was available. In respect of Victoria, however, it was sheer misrepresentation, and any one who put his name to such a document must have known that. The promise that advances would be made up -to £500 has, in the main, been honoured. In the following year, another pamphlet was issued, with the title ""Victoria, Development and Migration Commission the Speedway to Rural Prosperity"". It pointed out that inexperienced men would be trained, and. conveyed the impression that the agricultural colleges could easily the cope with the demands of those who might need instruction, when, as everybody knew, there were vacancies for, at the most, only a dozen or so trainees at any time. The idea was promulgated that. 10,000 farmers were to be settled, and that inexperienced men would be trained, either in agricultural colleges or finished the men drifted back to the ou farms, and that they would, be paid for the work which they did. No provision was made to place on farms or in training colleges married men who were encouraged to come to Australia as settlers. Tliere were offers of employment on farms at wages ranging from 15s. to about 25s. a week, but nothing was done to meet the case of the wife or the family of a married migrant, with the result that he received no more than six or eight weeks' training, and was absolutely inexperienced when he took over his block. Any person who has a knowledge of farming operations realizes that an i'nexj)erienced man cannot succeed -on the land. A promise made by one of the pamphlets was that migrants would year, .under the supervision of skilled and sympathetic officials. In no case was that given practical effect. The guile of That was done the framer of the pamphlet is disclosed by the statement, "" We do not want to make promises wo cannot redeem "". The statement that 10,000 farms were to be provided gave the impression that there was no limit to the area of land available. The promises included the provision of living areas of all classes of land at. reasonable rates, and comfortable homes. Similar inducements were held out to other migrants to allow themselves to be assisted to come to Australia under this precious agreement that was entered into by the Commonwealth Government with the Government of the United Kingdom. The result of that policy was to land in Australia tens of thousands of the workers of other countries, to swell the ranks of the unemployed in this country. If ever humbug and hypocrisy were associated with any scheme, they were associated with that of assisted migration. The costly organization known as the was set up in Australia, and the obligation was entered into to provide employment, for migrants upon their arrival in Commonwealth, whether they came as land selectors or as ordinary labourers. But so soon as a man was found a job, the promoters of the scheme felt that their responsibility towards him ceased. In many cases the work that was provided lasted for only a few weeks, and when it was cities. It may be said that it is easy to be wise after the event. I never derive pleasure from saying "" I told you so "" ; but one is entitled to point to whatever foreknowledge he displayed. It can be said for, at least, the Australian Labour Party, that, it protested vigorously against this policy of mass migration. The members of that party knew what the consequences would be to the workers, as well as to the farmers, or the would-",53,Latham
187,Mr Patebson,It might have applied,54,Latham
188,Mr Scullin,"It, might havebe fanners, of Australia. Thousands of sons of Victorian fanners at that very time were unable to secure a f a r m at a reasonable price. Tbere were hundreds of applicants for every block of Crown land thrown open. I remember that, at the very time when this agreement was entered into, and this scheme was inaugurated in Victoria and other parts of Australia, a Minister in the Government of the day, Mr now Senator, Massy-Greene, made on another bill the hundreds block of land offered in Victoria in areas which had an assured rainfall, and were in close proximity to markets. That was perfectly true. The sons of farmers were wending their way to the cities. It was said that they preferred the lights of the cities. I know scores of them who would have been glad to take up blocks of land and carve out homes for themselves, but wore denied the opportunity to do so. To a very large extent the private lands throughout the western, district of Victoria were held as a monopoly. Grown lands which had the advantages .of rainfall, railways, and roads, had already been taken up, ancl only inaccessible blocks were left. The prices asked for private lauds were so high as to make their profitable development, absolutely impossible. One of the scandals connected with this migration scheme, as well as w i th the schemes of soldier settlement, -was that the so-called patriots, the flag-wavers, asked for the land they offered, double what it was worth. The from returned Australian soldiers, or froin of the world, rendered it impossible for the men tc make a living on the land. The Government of the State, and, in some eases, municipalities, were responsible for what happened. I remember a district being set body to deal with soldier settlement, on conditions similar to those of the agreement that we are now considering. One member of the council proved his honesty by declaring that the prices placed on the land were excessive, and stating, "" Not a man here would give much more than half the price that you are asking these inexperienced returned soldiers to pay"". A campaign was organized agaiust that man, ancl he was defeated at the next municipal elections. It was said that he was decrying the credit of his own district, ancl writin g down its values, merely because he wished to give to the Australiau soldier settlers a chance to succeed. Similar treatment was meted out to our own kith and k in from across the seas, who were strangers in a strange land. I have made many speeches, as have statement that there were my colleagues, on the subject of assisted of applicants for every migration, and shall quote from one of them to show the feeling that I entertained at the time against, the deception that was being practised. My opinions, have not since altered. If ever I have had sympathy with a body of men, I have had it with these migrants, who were brought to Australia under false pretences. Many of them gave up employment aud left their homeland to come here. I have met dozens of them in the city of Melbourne. They were given no more than a few weeks' work in the country, and were then left stranded. Yet the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States continued to flood Great, Britain with literature promising to m i grants blocks of land and employment. A t the invitation of the Bruce1'age Government, I witnessed the exhibition of a private cinematograph film to be released in Great Britain, which portrayed a migrant who had arrived in Australia four or five years previously with £30 in his pocket, and who was then prices which they received working on his own farm . It showed him at first engaged on the property soldiers fro m other parts of another farmer, then share-farming, and later, on his own block amidst bis own flocks and herds and waving wheat fields. It might have been true, but it was not a typical case. It, would he unusual for a migrant to amass, as municipality in the Gippsland was stated, £12,000 in such a short period. up as a local It was said that many had done better than that. ""When I came into the HouseI protested to members of the Country party who were then associated with the Government, and asked them if they believed it . I told them that if it were true all the complaints they had made about tbe hardships associated with farming in Australia were not true. They informed me that it was not true, and I said, "" Why support, a tissue of falsehoods, and bring it goes back further than 1926, but in men .12,000 miles from their homes under that year complaints were rolling in. false pretences?""

There is ample evidence to prove that some settlers did. not make any effort to meet their obligations. There is a case on record of one man who has paid only £31 to the State Government since 1925, while another paid £1,100. The latter was honestly trying to pay his way, while the former was not. attempting to do so. There were some shirkers, but I think we can say that they were in the minority. great bulk of them endeavoured to make good in face of serious disadvantages. However small the number of shirkers may be they are not deserving of much consideration, and should not receive the same flat rate as is to be paid to others. Those who have suffered most should receive more. A case was brought under my notice of a migrant-probabl y he was a sensible man-wh o remained on his' block for only three weeks, and who had refunded to him all his costs except £11 for survey fees. He went to Melbourne and obtained employment, aud is still there. What claim has he to £500? How can we say that he is entitled to anything unless it can be proved that he left a better position in Great Britain than he is occupying here ? As his present position is a good one it is unlikely that the job he held in Great Britain was better. So far as I can ascertain there are seven applicants for compensation from men who did not go on the land at all. They cannot say that they lost their money. They may be able to claim that (hey gave up lucrative positions, and, been made to estimate the amounts of consequently, are entitled to compensation. An effort should be made to deal with A member of the Victorian Parliament mentioned the case of one settler, who, it is said, is to receive compensation. Mr Old said that he had taken the facts from the departmental files. This man, it appears, took up a dairy farm, aud in 192y he bought the block of another migrant settler, paying a deposit but nothing subin regard to compensation. sequently. His son took up a block in 1927, putting down a small deposit on it, but paying nothing since. The father and son worked the three blocks in conjunction. The value of the holdings was £2,000, and the advances made on ihe improvements, stock, &c, . amounted to £937. In ten years the total amount paid back to the Government on the original block wa3 only £125; but on the other two, neither the father nor the son paid anything except the original deposits. The family worked together, and milked 73 cows. They had an income, according te the estimate that was given, of over £1,000 a year receiving so much as that. The that their activities are not confined to dairying, but they are not attempting to pay off the arrears. Mr Old, the honourable member for Swan Hill in the Victorian Parliament, referring to the dairying districts in the irrigated areas of Tongala and Stanhope, pointed out that in some instances the repayments amounted to sums such as £36, £41 and £48. One man, he said, had repaid £1,172, while his neighbour had paid only £100.

I point out also that migrants other than land settlers have been deceived, and have been stranded here. These men have just as great a moral claim to consideration as have land settlers. The only difference is that while one class brought money to Australia and lost it, the other class brought their only capitaltheir labour-and they iost months, and, in some instances, years of it. When I was Prime MinisterI received a deputation from the representatives of thousands -of migrants who were out of work, and all they asked was passage money home. My Government could not agree to grant their request. thoso migrants must take their place alongside Other Australians, aud that they were entitled only to the same treatment as Australians. cate the granting of compensation to them, because, if they wore to be compensated for being out of work, the unemployed who were Australian-born should receive similar consideration. least some of the unemployed migrants have a claim similar to that of the land settlers. I do not submit that as an argument that we sliould not meet our obligations under the agreement', but I regard the bill as a confession of the abject failure of any mass migration scheme. It shows the wisdom of the Labour party of the day which fought strongly against the scheme, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales. In other States a policy of migration was adopted because Crown lands on which to settle migrants, were available. I u Queensland and Western Australia migrant settlers have not similar grievances to those in Victoria. In Queensland, the Crown has the right to resume land from the large leaseholders, but in Victoria land monopoly is rife, and all the good land is in private hands. existed in that State amongst the sons of Victorian farmers. the scheme was a scandal, and its evils were pointed out at the time. We have now reached the closing chapter of Departure a sad and sordid story, aud I hope that it will be a lesson that will ing into such a conspiracy to deceive and delude large numbers of decent citizens living many thousands of miles from Australia. -The Lender of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) had been very critical regarding the land settlement scheme which comes under notice in connection with this bill, and no doubt he has a good deal of justification for his criticism; but I think that at least 90 per cent, of it would be more fittingly directed to the Yictorian State Government, which fathered the scheme, than to this or any other Commonwealth Government, which comas into tlie picture only by virtue of the fact that it provided the machinery for bringing to We said that this country such migrants as the States desired. The bill is designed to ratify an agreement entered into between the I did not advoCommonwealth and Victorian Governments with reference to compensation to British migrant settlers in Victoria, and the question of the Commonwealth Government's liability is to be submitted to Yet at the arbitrament of Mr Langer Owen, a former justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, whose decision is to be final. Under this bill the Commonwealth is to pay £100,000 by way of compensation to the settlers who leave or have left their blocks. It strikes me, as a layman, as being very unusual that payment of £100,000 should be made when the Commonwealth authorities admit no liability of any kind, and before the arbitrator has determined whether there is a liability, and, if so, the extent of it. In such circumstances the arbitrator must necessarily be influenced, to some extent, by the fact that one of the parties has already paid over a large sum of money; he would regard that, I should imagine, as a tacit admission of some liability.

201,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [10.37].,"Going back to tbe genesis of this case, we find that the Victorian Government, in 1922, adopted a scheme for the settlement of British migrants on about 2,000 farms. The scheme never came to complete fruition; but about 400 farms, some dry and some irrigable, were occupied by British migrants. was commenced, the Hughes Government was in power iu the federal arena, and the Lawson Ministry was in office in Victoria. The British Governmeut, under the 1922 agreement, had to make substantial interest, concessions on the amount borrowed from Britain for the purpose of this settlement. Later, when the £34,000,000 migration loan agreement between the Commonwealth and the British Government was formulated, the original 1922 agreement with the Victorian Government was merged into the larger agreement. The Victorian State Government then had the advantage of a still greater concession with respect to the why this project failed to a considerable interest to be charged ou the money borrowed by it. Tbe terms granted to the States were extraordinarily generous. The British and Qomm on wealth Governments had to pay by far the larger portion of the interest on the money borrowed for land settlement and other purposes. The fact that a State could not make a success of land settlement, despite the advantageous interest rates charged, shows how difficult it is to make such a project successful when it is handled by a government. The £34,000,000 agreement was remarkably favorable to the States. Any money borrowed by a State government from Great Britain in connection with projects which were considered satisfactory to the representative in Australia of the Government of Great Britain w'as obtained by the States for the first five years«at less than migrants themselves, but also, though 1 per cent, interest.

Yet, despite that extraordinary advantage, Victoria failed in its laud settlement scheme. It is true that, under the scheme that State was expected, for every £750,000 borrowed, to absorb a certain number of migrants in some sphere of life, not necessarily on farms; but the number that it was expected to absorb throughout the ten years under the agreement was no greater than the average number which had been successfully absorbed during several preceding years when prosperity was normal. I believe that one reason extent was that, while some good settlers came here from the Old Country, many others were quite unsuited to farm life; and it has always been a matter of great wonderment to me that many people overseas who have had no previous experience of rural matters-me n who have been, perhaps, tram conductors, clerks, hairdressers, or factory workers-thin k that they have only to go to one of the dominions, obtain land under a closer settlement scheme, and in some extraordinary way speedily become prosperous The same people would have no more dreamt of taking up farming in the Old Country than they would of taking up some other calling for which they were entirely unsuited. The view that men without much experience can succeed on the land was held, not only by the perhaps in a modified degree, by some of the State Governments. It is true that there have been many instances of men with little experience of rural affairs who grit and determination have succeeded; but, taking tbe matter as a whole, it takes longer as a rule to acquire the knowledge requisite to success in wresting a living from the soil, than it does to gain reasonable efficiency in repetition work in a factory. Tbat does not seem to be recognized by a great many people. much greater degree of physical fitness to gain a living from tlic soil than it does to eurn a wage in a more sheltered occupation.

The more immediate monetary compensation for those leaving their blocks must be met out of the £100,000 provided under the bill. The extent of the failure of the land settlement scheme can be gauged when we realize that out of 400 settlers, there were 311 complainants before the commission, and that the cash to be provided, and the writing off on the part of the Victorian Government, are estimated to amount to about £450,000. That sum is to be spread over the occupants of some 400 farms.

The Commonwealth has no voice whatever in connection with land settlement, and probably no State Government has been more insistent on that than the Victorian Government. The Commonwealth, therefore,cannot be held responsible for mines at Collie, and many came to the actual settlement of these men. While I cannot enthuse in any way over this bill, from the point of view, not of one connected with the Commonwealth or State Parliaments, but of an Australian, I am glad that some moral obligation towards the settlers is being recognized. Although it is said that they have no legal claim, for the sake of Australia's reputation I am glad that something is being done for them. Like the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), I trust that this agreement will bring to an end a very unhappy chapter in the history of Australian land settlement. is an important measure, and honourable members have really had insufficient time to consider it. It would be interesting to know whether auy similar agreements have been entered into with the other States, and what liability the British Government is shouldering in the matter. That Government was one of the parties to the scheme of settling British migrants in this country, and was equally responsible with the Commonwealth aud State Governments for the inauguration of the scheme to settle British migrants here; and as the Australian Government has spent a considerable sum of money in . this direction, it is only right that the British Government sliould be asked to bear its fair share of the compensation that is being paid to the settlers. I know that many thousands of British workmen, including labourers andminers, were attracted to Australia as a result of the propaganda distributed in the Old Country. Films were shown in picture theatres free, and throughout the country advertisements were displayeddepicting crops of wheat as high, probably, as the men who were reaping them. The people were told that they only had to go to Australia, the land of milk and honey, and they would quickly make their fortunes. As the result of that propaganda, British migrants came out, here to settle on the land, and some of them were placed on areas, particularly in Western Australia, that would not grow salt bush. They gradually left the country districts for the industrial areas in the capital cities. Many of them went direct from the settlement areas to work in the my electorate. In some of the coal towns most of the inhabitants are migrants, those from the same county being generally employed in the same mine. [Quorum formed.] Now, because of the depression in the coal-mining industry, many of these migrants, have lost their employment. They contracted obligations to buy homes, but have been unable to keep up the payments, with the result that hundreds of them are being evicted. This applies, not only to coal-miners, but also to those engaged in the iron and steel industry in Newcastle. Provision is made in this bill for compensating 311 settlers. These men were told before they came to Australia that they would be provided with farms valued at from £900 to £1,500. The most shameless propaganda was issued in order to lure people away from their friends and relatives. Now they are stranded in Australia with not sufficient money to take them back to their friends in Britain.",61,Latham

He approached me to see whether I could help him to return to his family, but eventually it was only by the courtesy of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, in permitting him to work his passage, that he was able to go. He is only one of thousands who have lost their employment in the same way. On last Sunday morning, after notices had appeared in the newspapers regarding this legislation, no fewer than 40 persons called on me to learn whether the Commonwealth Government was making provision for them to be sent back to Great Britain. In my opinion, those migrants have just as much right, to compensation as bave those who settled on the land in Victoria. come out here? Air. JAMES -They were nominated by the State Governments. At that time, the mining industry was booming, but now, in my electorate alone, there are 7,000 men out of work, the majority of whom are migrants. thing for the Government to do is to charter a ship, and send home all those who want to go. I also think that the Imperial Government should accept some responsibility for these migrants. Many of them are ex-soldiers, who, after several years, have broken down in health as a. result of their war experiences. However, because they made no claim within seven years of their disperial Government, therefore, accepted charge, the Imperial Government will not pay them a pension. In other cases, the men agreed to accept a lump sum in lieu of any pension to which they might become entitled, and they are now receiving assistance here under the invalid pensions scheme. do with the bill. migrants in. New South Wales and 7 other States are as much entitled to receive help as those in Victoria. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) is certainly looking after the interests of his own State, but he should also remember I kuow of one that he is representing Australia as a whole. Evidently a strong agitation on behalf of migraii't settlers was worked up in A ictoria, with the result that a royal T commission was appointed to inquire into their complaints. The Commonwealth Government has agreed to pay £100,000 by way of compensation, subject to certain matters being submitted to arbitration, aud subject to the State being required by the arbitrator to make refunds. However, if the arbitrator does not find that any refunds should be made, the Oommonwealth, presumably, will have to pay the whole of the money. The Imperial Government should not escape all responsibility. Australia agreed to accept a part of Britain's surplus population, Britain agreeing to find one-third of the interest on the money advanced for settlement purposes. In 1922, the Empire Settlement Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament', making it lawful for the Secretary of State, in association with persons or private organizations, either in the United Kingdom or any part of the Empire, to formulate, and co-operate in carrying out, schemes for affording joint assistance to suitable persons iu the United Kiiigdom who intended to settle in any part of His Majesty's overseas The only decent dominions.

I know that the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) always endeavours to deal with each case upon its merits, and I can tell him that, in respect of the matter we are now discussing, what I have just said is the experience of every public man associated with my party. We hold the view that there was something more in the migration scheme than merely a desire to settle people on the land in Australia. It was probably the forerunner of much bigger proposals which the gentlemen who were responsible for tbe migration scheme had in mind. I say without hesitation that its main purpose was to introduce into Australia a large body of unorganized labour, which could be exploited to the detriment of Australian workers, and for the purpose of breaking down the conditions in employment whicli then prevailed. bility upon the then Commonwealth Government, the Government of Victoria, and the Government of Great Britain. The Government of Great Britain was, I have no doubt, anxious to transfer a large proportion of its surplus population to its dominions with a view, possibly, to relieving the pressure oh its labour market. From its point of view, that was a legitimate way of solving its difficulties. From the inception of the scheme, it was bitterly opposed by the Australian Labour Party. The people who wero responsible for it committed this country to an expenditure of £1,600,000, 'and added greatly to the burden of taxation on the people of this country. Now we have to add another £.100,000 to the expenditure incurred in connection with this sorry business. more important than the total cost involved, because the distress caused to the migrants cannot be measured in pounds, shillings and pence. Mention has been made of the propaganda issued inGreat Britain in furtherance of the scheme. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) referred to the private screenings throughout Great Britain for the purpose of inducing intending migrants to come to Australia. J. was in Londoni n 1926, and was attracted by a notice'at Australia House of a continuous screening of pictures in the basement depicting life in Australia. I made it my business to obtain first-hand knowledge of the propaganda then being issued. All that the Leader of the Opposition has said was borne out by my own experience. I was amazed at the alluring pictures presented to prospective migrants, and I can well understand the anxiety of people with a few hundred pounds to come to Australia to enjoy the good things which they believed would be readily obtainable. As I had an intimate knowledge of working conditions in this country, having spent the early portion of my life in primary industries, I was amazed at, the pictures that were being shown, and the encouragement held out to intending migrants from Great Britain. There. was a ready response to the appeals then being made, and the stream of migration to Australia flowed fairly strongly for a year or two; but, as we know, the settlers were quickly disillusioned, and to-night we heard again the sorry story of their experiences in this country. But at this stage I am also concerned about the people who were responsible for the migration scheme. It has been stated that it was launched by the Lawson Government of Victoria.

I bave been associated with the matter throughout, and the honourable member has not. Mi-. WARD -Tb e Attorney-General has not stated how much of the £100,000 will actually come into the possession of the migrant settlers. On every conceivable occasion we are told that private enterprise is able to manage all the activities of the country, and that, there their properties are to be compensated for should be no government interference with it. Those who financed this scheme were not imbued with the desire to assist migrants to go on the land in Victoria. They thought that it would be a profitable investment; and to-day, having found that they misjudged the position and embarked upon an unprofitable venture, they are bringing pressure to bear on the Governments of Victoria and the Commonwealth to provide them with means to escape from their difficulties. Honourable members on this side can not accept the view put forward by the Government, that its one concern is to assist: a mere handful of settlers in Vicreal intention which is to assist its polititoria. Does the Government propose to assist the failures among the returned soldiers, who were induced by the Commonwealth and the States to go on the land and increase the production of Australia? At a conservative estimate, 30 per cent, of those who go on the land eventually fail. Is their right to seek assistance from this Government less than that of migrants, who were induced to come to Victoria by the false representations in the. propaganda distributed throughout Great, Britain? To justify my statement that this measure is submitted for the purpose of appropriating public money to assist organizations and private individuals out of their difficulties, I refer honourable members to clause 5 of annexure "" K "" which readsIn the case of any individual settler, the assessor, in consultation with the president of the settler's association to which such settler belongs, may recommend that a sum be provided over and. above any of the previous payments for the discharge of pressing personal debts, provided that the total of all amounts to be provided under this clause shall not exceed £8,000. Evidently there are some fairly substantial amounts owing by these settlers, but only a small proportion of the money to be appropriated is to be paid to the individuals directly concerned. It is fairly obvious that the Government intends to assist the creditors of the migrants, and not the migrants themselves. where the money is going before we vote on the second reading of the bill. agreement, settlers who have abandoned their losses whether they are resident in Australia or overseas.

Those who desire to remain on their holdings-if tbey decide to do that they must be making a success of their operations-ar e to have the capital value of their indebtedness written down, and also receive £100 in cash. I am satisfied that this measure, which is supposed to assist settlers, particularly those who are still in possession of their blocks, has been introduced by the Government, merely with the object of cloaking its cal friends. If the Government believes that it is fair to write down the capital indebtedness of those migrants who are still occupying their properties, and who",68,Latham

244,Mr Ward,"Exactly. Under theare to receive £100 in cash., why does it not write down the capital values of the war service homes concerning which a good deal has been said during the last day or two? siders it fair to compensate migrant's in this way, why should it uot assist the occupiers of war service homes ? The sum of £100,000 is to be expended in assisting 311 settlers, but the Government will not even provide a much smaller amount to assist thousands of persons who are purchasing war service homes. Moreover, the amount to be appropriated urider this bill could be more effectively employed iu assisting the hundreds of thousands of workless persons in this country. Further, the Government states that its sole purpose in making this money available is to assist 311 settlers, while under the obnoxious property sections of an amending Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act it inflicted hardship upon thousands of unfortunate pensioners. The amount returned to the Government under the property sections of 'that measure was only £9,000, yet the Government is spending £100,000 to assist principally money lenders who have no legal or moral claim upon the Commonwealth. Realizing that this measure, like many others of the Government's proposals, is framed in such a way as to hide chased at an economic price, because at the Government's real intention, the memthat time, there was a. definite land boom, ber's of the Labour party will oppose it. If the money to be appropriated were to be used in paying the passage money of migrants who desire to return to. their own country, to assist the unemployed, or to increase the payments to invalid and old-age pensioners, it would have our support; but as it is merely to assist still higher. In other instances, rich the banking institutions and others who have advanced money to migrant settlers, the members on the Opposition cross benches will strenuously oppose the measure. a.m.] I do not propose to refer to the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Government, or to the sum of money to be made available to assist migrants who have been unable to make a success of their undertakings. I roae more particularly to reply to the statement made by the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition { Mr Scullin), who said that those who had engaged in flag waving during the war, afterwards took the opportunity to charge If the Government conreturned soldier settlers double the market value of the land on which they were settled. I am familiar with closer settlement in Victoria, and I know that as the result of inquiries made into soldier land settlement in that State, it was disclosed that the land bought for that purpose was, on the whole, secured at a fair market value. A commission of inquiry reported that the average price paid for the land was, in sortie cases, under the current market value. I know that that was the case in the district in which I reside. Some properties were purchased for soldier laud settlement at more than their market value, but many others in the same district were purchased by persons who ouglit to have known their market value, at prices higher than those which the Government paid. ""Whatever may be said of the purchases made by the Closer Settlement Board, it must be admitted that most of the land secured for soldier settlement was uot obtained at an economic price. None of the land bought in Victoria during that period for the settlement of returned soldiers was purparticularly in the western district of Victoria. Although prices obtained for primary products were high, no purchaser could hope to obtain a fair return on the capital invested. Purchases were made by .certain optimists during the boom in the belief that prices would go land-owners in the Western District who wanted to settle their sons on the land in the same locality after they had returned from the war, paid more than the economic value of the land. Some of the men who returned from the war, and who were not desirous of continuing their pre-war occupations in the city, also decided to take up land in the Western District, which is regarded as one of the most congenial in the State, and paid uneconomic prices. These and other factors forced up prices, with the result that the Victorian Government, through the Closer Settlement Board, was compelled to pay uneconomic prices during",69,Latham
245,Mr Fairbairn (Flinders) [12.22,"the boom period, but the prices paid did not average more than market values. I suppose the Leader of the Opposition regards as ""flag wavers."" those who supported Australia's effort in the Great War, and who did everything possible to welcome the soldiers on their return to Australia. I know at least three men in Victoria, two of whom made, their land available to the Closer Settlement Board, who sold their land at approximately one-half its market value. One estate is near Caniperdown, and the other is in tbe Mortlake district. the vicinity of Berwick, whicli is in my electorate, a considerable area of land was actually given to the Closer 'Settlement Board by one of these gentlemen whom the Leader of the Opposition termed a ""flag waver."" The remarks of the right honourable gentleman were unfair to the Closer Settlement Board, aud also to many of those who sold land to it. General) [12.28 a.m.] I am sure that honourable members were interested in listening to the short, but relevant speech of the latest recruit to this House. We are glad to have with us a gentleman who has actual and precise knowledge of the subject-matter now under discussion. I can support what he bas said by citing from my own knowledge another instance in whicli land was made available by a public spirited gentleman at less than its market value, and on which settlers are now doing well. Although unfortunately, the matter before the House furnishes an example of failure, a great mistake would be made by suggesting that no migration to this country has been successful. white population of Australia is the result of migration of some kind, ""and no whito person in this country can say that migration generally has been of no beuefit without admitting that he and all his friends are failures. Let us remember that we all are migrants or the descendants of migrants. years, many efforts at migration have been, made, and some of them have proved decidedly successful. I regret that some of the speeches on this measure were of such a character as to suggest that everybody who has migrated to Australia in recent years has failed. That is not the case. Many honourable members know of numbers of migrants who have succeeded well. The enterprise to which this bill refers was founded upon such a basis that it was impossible for the settlers to cope with the effects of the depression, but I hope that their failure will not blind us to the wisdom of obtaining, upon proper terms and conditions, an increase of the population of Australia. I am still satisfied that our country needs more people for its safety and its full developIn ment. At the same time, I recognize the dangers of any form.of what may be called mass migration at the present time; therefore, I am not favourably disposed to the suggestion of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) that a ship should be chartered to convey unemployed migrants from Australia to EngLSnd. When any attempt is made to allocate the responsibility for the failure of migrant land settlers, . it should be remembered that the State of Victoria insisted upon sending its own ofiicers to recruit settlers in London, and it is much easier many years after the event than it was at the time to say that the Commonwealth authorities should have prevented Victoria from selecting migrants as intending settlers in such ways as it thought proper. Unfortunately, with much of what the Leader of the Oppositiou ( Mr 'Scullin) has said I can only agree, but, departing from the general tenor of his utterance, he concluded by declaring that the governments concerned had been engaged in a conspiracy to dupe and deceive intending settlers. That was an extravaA l l the gant statement. Not the slightest proof is available in support of the allegation made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who seems to live in an atmosphere of suspicion and sinister inferences. He appears to see something underhand, mean, ungenerous, indirect, and insincere In recent in connection with every matter brought before this House. The amazing suggestion, was made that this proposal to spend £100,000-and I say, on behalf of the Government, that this measure is Submitted most reluctantly-is due to the influence of",70,Latham

I stated in my second-reading speech that the Commonwealth Government had special reasons for its intervention. Statesi n a similar position to that of those who will benefit under this bill? the matter to arbitration, that this matter arose out of a special agreement between, the British, Commonwealth and Victorian Governments. The miners to whom the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has referred, who were mainly nominated migrants for whom assisted passages to Australia were provided, were not brought here pursuant to this or any similar agreement. The bill »is submitted to the House because of an agreement and the involvement of the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments, and for no other reason. Some honourable members have said that the McLachlan took my place British Government should bear part of the responsibility. The migrants have made their representations to the Governments concerned, and mainly to the Government of Victoria, because the Commonwealth Government has never dealt with the migrants themselves.

Olause3 (Payments to settlers). a.m.] -This clause which is the main provision of the bill, provides for payments to settlers not exceeding in the whole the sum of £100,000. Much of the discussion from this comer of the chamber on the second reading of the bill centered in the question as to who would ultimately receive this payment, and when we endeavoured to obtain that information from the Government we were told that we were seething with suspicion. Mr. LATHAM: -That was uot the point at, all, as the honourable member knows. led by the interjection of the Attorney General.

We are not yet satisfied that this money will be paid to the settlers. It is obvious that many of them have contracted debts which, no doubt, will have to be met out of moneys paid to them as the result of this legislation. They entered into obligations when money was free and interest rates high. Their creditors who, in many cases, have already received their pound of flesh, are again endeavouring to fleece the settlers still further. There is no equity in the transactions with the British migrants, because they were brought to this country as the result of false statements and misrepresentation by this Government. This Government, in bringing down this legislation, pretends that it, is actuated by high and lofty motives, yet the whole basis of this land settlement scheme is rotten to the core, and will not stand investigation. Tbe Attorney-General bas said that the Government regrets this unfortunate circumstance, hut surely that is a mild way of describing fhe position. We are entitled to know to whom this money is to be paid, and to have more evidence than the word of the Attorney-General.

There is extreme doubt whether the settlers will ever receive one-quarter of this sum. We are not prepared to allow this Government to expend willy-nilly the sum of £100,000, particularly at .a time when thousands cf our unemployed citizens are experiencing misery and want. The Attorney-General thinks that, because of the circumstances in which he is placed, his word must be accepted, and that we have no standing whatever; but we contend that we have just as inuch right as he to draw deductions. Up to the present no evidence has been adduced to disprove our statements.

The allegation of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), to which I replied, was that certain influence with him. Although it is impossible to had been brought to bear upon the Government. I w*as present at the negotiations, and the honourable member was not, and I informed him that no such influence had been brought to bear upon the Government; that I spoke of my own knowledge, and that he spoko necessarily, not out of any knowledge, but out of suspicion. The honourable member for West Sydney has taken an entirely different point, and has worked himself into a state of excited fury. He has asked who is to get this money. That is quite a different question from that with which I was dealing when I answered the honourable member for East Sydney. The annexure to the agreement sets out who is to receive the money. The settlers are to receive it. The honourable member for West Sydney says that the settlers may owe money, and that the creditors will claim upon any sum that they receive. be enlightened on the subject in the vigorous and furious manner adopted by the honourable member. Had the honourable member read the agreement, he would know that that aspect of the matter has not escaped attention. It is known that some settlers are in financial difficulties because they owe money. I apologize for referring honourable members who address themselves to this bill, to its text, and I hope that they will not regard it as cause for offence, but special provision is made in paragraph 5 for pressing debts. The paragraph statesIn the case of any individual settler, the assessor, in consultation with the president of the settlors' association to which such settler belongs, may recommend that a sum be provided over and above any of the previous payments for the discharge of pressing personal debts, provided that the total of all amounts to be provided under this clause shall not exceed £8,000. Other parts of the agreement provide that £100 is to be paid in cash to men who stay on their blocks, and that sums up to £500 are to be paid to those who do not stay. The sum of £8,000 is to be an additional distribution, over and above tbe other amounts, for the purpose of meeting pressing personal debts. I do not know the circumstances of individual settlers, but the representative of the British Government does, and this scheme was worked out in conjunction reach anything like mathematical certainty regarding the debts of the settlers, it was considered that the provision of this extra sum of £8,000, in addition to the other amounts, would go far to meet the requirements of the case.",73,Latham

282,Mr Latham,"Claus e 5 of the tennot in a position to obtain any considerable amount of credit, as honourable members must realize. The position is quite plain to anybody who desires to understand it. The explanation of the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) in regard to the allocation of this £100,000 is not satisfactory. Mr tunate settlers. Justice Owen, who is to be appointed assessor, will give consideration to all claims by creditors when allocating this amount. He may determine that the Federal Government must pay the whole of these claims. to be wrong, but it is idle to explain. provision for that. That is all. towards the end of the schedule, provision is made that the assessor shall determine the amounts which the States must repay to the Federal Government. Owen may determine that the States are to pay nothing. General says that there is no such provision in the measure, while the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) affirms that there is. Opposition made a slip. mine the amounts which the States must pay under the agreement, as well as the sums which individual settlers shall get in accordance with clause 5 of annexure K to the schedule. But the bulk of the money will go to the Imperial Government to repay the loan of £300 granted to settlers, and to meet other debts which they owe, and not to the settlers. . In the agreement with the Imperial Government, clauses 7 and 8 of annexure C provide7. No freehold title to the land or other property provided for a migrant (hereinafter called "" a settler"") under this agreement shall he given to the settler until lie has completely paid the debt with interest in respect of that land or other property and has also paid any loan made in respect of the cost of hia passage. 8. Where a settler in respect of whom the Secretary of State has made advances under this agreement dies or for any reason i i dispossessed of his farm the Commonwealth Govenimeivt shall make arrangements with the State Government to ensure that; . . . It is more than probable that some of the money will go in that direction, although we have been told that the object of tbe bill is to assist the unforThe Attorney-General( Mr Latham) says that we can accept his word, but his word will not suffice when the matter comes before the judge for determination. In my second-reading speech, 1 pointed out that certain of the States were not provided for, but my contention was lightly brushed aside by the Attorney-General. The right honourable gentleman will not deny that other States have entered into arrangements witli the Commonwealth and British Governments. It would appear that influential creditors of settlers in Victoria started an. agitation in their own interests, aud that, in consequence, a royal commission was appointed in that State. The Attorney-General accuses the party with which I am associated of imputing motives and entertaining unworthy thoughts, but we do not merit his accusation. Wo are merely fighting for justice for all. Surely But the Attorneyno honourable member will deny that migrants in tbe other States are as much entitled to fair treatment as are those in Victoria. Other migrants have entered into contracts for the purchase of homes, and some have lost them, even though they had paid large sums off their cost. That they have not been considered in this legislation is probably because they are not in debt to the big merchants. The bill should he withdrawn and redrafted to provide that migrants who were duped into coming to Australia shall be repatriated. It is unfair to extract £100,000 from the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to assist one section of migrants, and not to make provision for others similarly situated. a.m.] -Claus e 5 of annexure "" K "" to the schedule reads.Tu the case of any individual settler, the assessor, in consultation with the president of the settler's association to which suoh settler belongs, may recommend that a sum be provided over and above any of the previous payments for the discharge of pressing personal",76,Latham

292,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [1.26,"debts, provided tliat the total ef al! amounts to be provided under this clause sliall not exceed £8,000. This clause can be construed in a number of ways. It commences,.."" In the case of any individual settler "","" and proceeds to refer to amounts to be provided ""under this clause"". The clause deals with the individual settler, not with a number of settlers. total of all amounts to be provided under this clause shall not exceed £8,000 "". for the amount which may be paid to "" any individual settler "". Its interpretation will depend on the view of the person who administers it. Any person who has sufficient money to engage leading counsel could be sure of working up a big case on the point that I have mentioned. The use of the word "" individual"" in the first line gives to the whole clause an individual application. I have no desire to protract the discussion ; but, as the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has referred the committee to clause 5 of the schedule it is as well that I should read it In tlie case of any individual settler, the assessor, in consultation wit h the president of the settlers' association to which such settler belongs, may recommend that a sum be provided over and above any of the previous payments for the discharge of pressing personal debts, provided that the total of all amounts to be provided under this clause shall not exceed £8,000. Honourable members who are able to look at this matter without the violent prejudices of the honourable members for East Sydney and West Sydney must, I feel sure, agree that it is crystal clear. -The honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) has placed his interpratation upon the language of the clause. We on this side of the chamber have not at our command the galaxy of alleged legal talent to be found in the ranks of Government supporters, but we contend that the clause is so worded that it will be possible for the assessor, when considering the pressing personal debts of an individual settler, to recommend that the sum of £8,000 be allotted to him. We have had many instances of the intention of Parliament being entirely ignored by members of the legal fraternity when contesting claims before the courts of this country. They insist upon the strict legal interpretation of the provisions of any law passed by this Parliament. All that concerns them is the printed word. We, therefore, feel that we are justified in urging that the clause be amended in such a way as to avoid any possibility of misunderstanding in the future. [1.37 a.m.] I refrained from taking part in this discussion, because I thought that the issue was a very simple one. AnnexureK of the schedule gives effect to the recommendations of the royal commission which investigated complaints made by migrant settlers, and, in addition to providing for a scale of cash payments as compensation for losses incurred, stipulates, in clause 5, that a further sum, not to exceed £8,000, shall be set aside for the settlement of pressing personal debts which may have been incurred by migrant settlers. The intention of the clause is clearly stated, and allows of no misunderstanding. Question-That the clause be agreed to put. The committee divided. (OHAIKMAN-MB .

My colleagues and I are not prepared to consent to that appropriation, because it -will be made at the expense of thousands of tbe citizens of Australia who will either have to find the necessary revenue by direct or indirect taxation, or suffer hardships and the deprivation of benefits that they otherwise might have received.

Where an obligation exists, whether it be to unemployed, pensioners, Australian soldiers, or migrant settlers, a proposal designed to do a measure of justice to any section will have my support. If we oppose a measure of justice to those entitled to justice because others are not sharing in it, we shall never make any progress in matters of this kind. The obligation of the Commonwealth will be determined by the arbitrator, and whatever his decision may be. I feel sure that he will find that, although the Commonwealth has a moral liability to these migrants, that of the State concerned is even greater. orable gentleman apply the same principle with respect to the land-owners at Leeton, or to the tobacco-growers at Mareeba? they were entitled to similar treatment, I should assist them. If we decide that these migrants cannot get justice because an injustice has been done to the tobacco growers, how could we support the claims of the tobacco-growers knowing that the migrants had not received fair treatment?

Schedule. a.m.] -The most important portion of the schedule is contained in annexure K , but we have already been informed by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) that this agreement which is brought before this chamber for our consideration cannot be amended, and that it the Victorian Parliament. Although the agreement which has been adopted may contain many glaring anomalies which should be removed, we have not the right to amend it. Apparently we are here only, to fill in time, and are to be entirely subservient to the Victorian Parliament. It is interesting to have such a candid admission from the Attorney-General. It will be very enlightening to a large number of persons who are interested in the proceedings of this Parliament. he rejected, hut not amended. logical to ask for its rejection without stating grounds why it should be rejected. The members of my party consider that clause 5 of annexure K is not sufficiently clear to warrant acceptance of the schedule as a whole. To protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, and to ensure that certain settlers shall not receive more than the amount to which they arc entitled, we consider that after tbe word Lawson, George"" clause"" the words "" to all settlers"" Lawson, John should be inserted. As that alteration Marr, C. W. C. cannot be made unless the schedule as McBride, P. A. M. a whole be rejected, we urge the comNoek, H. K. mittee to reject it so that when presented Perkins, J.
