The item, as it stands, is quite definite enough.

On the other hand it is suggested by honourable members opposite that no rebate should be given upon beet sugar, and that it should pay the same rate of excise as must be paid upon cane sugar grown-by black labour. We do not think that is fair, and we ask the committee to support our view. amend the amendment by inserting the words ""and beet "" after the word ""cane."" Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN If the amendment is negatived, the honourable member will not be precluded from introducing words which will make the rebate apply specifically to beet sugar as well as to cane sugar, and if we are defeated upon the amendment now before the committee we shall raise no objection to such an amendment. this matter in my own way. WhilstI have raised no objection to the amendment of the honourable member, I fail to see the reason why it has been interpolated at this stage, because it could have been moved later on just as well. In proceeding as the honourable member has done, the question of beet sugar is merely understood, but it does not appear on the surface of the amendment. I think it is very much better that it should appear in that way, because then we shall know exactly what we are doing; otherwise it is quite possible that honourable members might not be fully seized of the scope of the discussion. I move That tlie amendment be amended by the insertion of the words ""and beet"" after the word ""cane."" The more one studies this sugar question and the problems connected with it , the see no necessity for more difficult does the whole position appear. It is more difficult to know what to do as regards the industry itself, and it is still more difficult to know what to do as regards the interests of the Commonwealth at large. I am entirely at one with the representatives of Queensland who desire the abolition of Kanakas as quickly as possible. A t the same time there is a doubt in my mind, after reading the literature on the subject, as to whether in the extreme north the industry will be carried on with the same facility as it has been. That, of course, remains to be proved ; it remains to be seen We believe that whether the bonus that will be given by the -committee for encouraging the use of and we desire to apply white labour in the north is going to be effective so far as regards the supply. There is no' doubt that the committee is entirely at one that we should use sugar grown by white men.

We are not growing enough sugar now for our own requirements. 1.30,000 tons a year, and in New South Wales some 15,000 tons. Roughly speaking the supply is 40,000 tons short of the normal requirements of the Commonwealth. That, of course, is a serious question which we have to face. Under the dislocated conditions of the cane-sugar industry, it is very problematical whether the Queensland supply, which is now short of our requirements, will be kept up in the immediate future. Wales the yield is about 23,000 tons. one year as a criterion. The growth of the plant varies from year to year. Early frosts may k ill the plant, and we may have the yield for New South Wales and Queensland fluctuating to the extent of 20,000, 30,000, or 40,000 tons in a season. But 145,000 tons is, I think, the normal yield of the two States. Not only have we to face the question of the probable shortage of the supply, but we have also to face this other very important question-that the sugar business in Australia is largely in the hands of one monopolistic company. MrL . E. GROOM -No; of the growers. hands of one monopolistic company, and whatever duty we may impose-sa y £G per ton-it is protected to that extent. I am not acquainted with any one connected with the company, but I know the position it holds with regard to the industry, and I know to a certain extent the arbitrary and domineering way in which it controls commerce in this particular article. It does almost entirely as it pleases, and if we are not very careful, any bonus we may give will not go to the growers, but will probably be mopped up by the company. In Australia the growth of sugar is very small compared with the growth of the other agricultural products : it is only a little over 2 per cent. Then there is another aspect in which we have to look at the question, and that is that sugar is the basis of a great number of our industries-jam-making , fruit preserving, canned milk. I suppose there is no article so generally used by mankind as sugar. We have to look at the matter not onl}' from the growers' point of view, but also from the consumers' point of view. If our fruit-growers have to pay an increased price for sugar it will come In Queensland we grow very hard on them. There is no comparison between the f r u it industry and the sugar industry. The inductio n of cane is only £619,000, while the production of f r u it is nearly £2,000,000. Therefore, we have to look to the in terests of these people and to see that sugar is available to them at a reasonable rate. While I intend to vote for the rebate, I also intend to vote that it shall be given to the users of sugar in manufactures. I had intended that it should be givenonlyon exported manuIn New South factures, but, on considering the matter more fully, I think that those people who are building up a great industry here on which so many persons are dependent, are fully entitled to a rebate on all their manufactures. should give a rebate to those who eat the articles. money for that ? point later on. I am only mentioning it incidentally now. ber is touching them on the raw. interject are not always concerned for the revenue. I put the question of the prosperity of the producers before the mere question of revenue. If we do not extend this concession to the growers of beet sugar, then we are not doing the right thing. I can see no reasonable excuse for not treating the two products alike. If we were confining the rebate simply to North Queensland I could quite understand honourable members desiring to limit it to the Mackay and Cairns districts, where black labour is used. But when it is being given to all growers of cane sugar throughout the Commonwealth, then we are bound in justice and honesty to give it to those who grow sugar from beet. grown from beet ? directly. We desire to encourage the growth of sugar, and the people who use it are not particular whether it is grown from cane or beet. What they want is to be able to get their sugar at a reasonable rate.

32,Mr Mccoll,"We shall see about thattheir value to the Commonwealth, there is no comparison between the cane-sugar industry and the beet industry. The latter is infinitely of more importance in every respect to the future of this country than is the former . In the first place, beet-sugar is a product that will assist and develop agriculture more than will any other product that can be named. It enriches the soil, whereas cane impoverishes it . Where beet has been grown, one can grow almost any other product, but where cane has been grown, one can grow very little. need in this country, above anything else, not only diversity in manufactures, but also diversity in products of the soil. Our honourable friends on the other side, who have been talking so long about the primary industries and their desire to help them ail they possibly can, will now have an opportunity of doing one of the best services to those industries that they could possibly have, by encouraging the growth of beetsugar. W it h the exception of perhaps very cold places, it is a commodity which can be grown almost over the whole Commonwealth. It provides a market for the farmer almost at the door. It means a very large increase in the employment of agricultural labour, because from the time the seed is sown, up to the reaping of the harvest, labour is employed constantly. It is probably the best handmaidwecould have toagriculture. W it h its refuse it provides a supply of fodder for cattle. It also provides very largely a means of manuring the ground. It means a great improvement in dairying. It is one of the most important features in connection with the dairying industry, with which it will work hand in hand. And, properly treated, it will yield just as much sugar as the cane. In America the growth of beet-sugar has increased enormously during the last twenty or 25 years. Of course we shall be told that the experiment has been tried in Victoria, and that it has failed. In Americai t was tried first in 1830, and then in 1838. Several spasmodic attempts were made to establish the industry, but they did not succeed until 1869. It is not an easy industry to establish, especially in a country such as ours, where people will not give to the tillage of land that close and continual labour and industry that is applied in other countries. That, of course, will remedy itself in time. They must learn to apply the labour required for the growth of other products beyond that of mere grain. 28 K Beet is different from grain. Wherever grain is grown it impoverishes the land, but' where beet is grown it improves the land. In America large estates which had been rendered almost worthless by the close cropping of sheep, and the continual growth of wheat, have been restored to abundant fertility by the production of beet, and the making of sugar. what other crop does it improve the soil 1 We the soil. America's experience has been very productive of lessons that we might learn. There they had great difficulties at first, but for the last twenty or twenty-five years the growth of beet-sugar has been a very great success. It is now running canesugar very closely indeed. I can quite understand that my honourable friends from the north may think that in encouraging the growth of beet-sugar we are raising a rival to the cane-sugar industry, but we have to consider the good of the Commonwealth as a whole, and while we may be raising a rival, at the same time we are raising a rival that will employ more labour, and do a great deal more good than if we allow the cane-sugar industry to stand by itself. Wouldi t be a fair thing to allow those who may be inclined to take in hand the growth of beet which is produced by white labour to go for the next five years without the bonus, whilst they knew that the growers of cane sugar in other parts of the Commonwealth were receiving this advantage, in order that they might be able to carry on their industry without the aid of black labour ? From whatever point of view we look at the subject, I think we are bound to give this rebate to encourage the growth of sugar from beet, and to give the industry the same chance as is given to those who produce sugar from cane. If we look at it from the point of view of the general good of the Commonwealth, we encourage an industry that will be manifold-indeed , almost illimitable-in its advantages. From the point of view of the consumers and the producers we are bound in honour to give this rebate. If it is given to any portion of the sugar industry, we are bound, I hold, to give it to the beet growers as well as to the producers of sugar from cane. worth),-We have all been delighted with tlie very interesting speech of the honourable member for Echuca, with a great deal of",17,Tariff

35,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"which many of us may agree. Honourable members know that the question of giving an advantage to the Queensland sugar growers, forms part and parcel of the legislation of this Parliament, in connection with the Kanakas. In the debates that took place upon that subject, reasons were given for the contention that in some parts of Queensland it was absolutely necessary to give every possible inducement to tlie encouragement of the employment of white labour. It was agreed that south of a certain line, white labour could very well be employed without any detriment to the health of the labourer, but above a certain line going north, it was a moot pointwhich I venture to think has scarcely been decided yet whether white labour is possible or not The rebate which is given by the Government is not given upon any principle whatever. It is purely a matter of political/expediency. I do not use those words in censure of the Government, but purely to designate what the real nature of the transaction was. cumstances in the case. to deal with the special circumstances, as the Minister says. Under those special circumstances, it might, perhaps, have been better policy to confine the rebate to a certain part of Queensland, north of the line below which we know white labour can be employed. But I quite recognise the difficulty of differentiating in that manner, especially as we have to deal not merely with the southern portion of Queensland, but also with the northern portion of New South Wales. Still, there would be nothing absolutely out of principle in doing that in the special circumstances of the case. But why is it proposed to give this rebate ? What is at the bottom of the whole question 1 It is not a matter of a commodity; it is essentially a matter of climatic conditions. We give a rebate not because the article happens to be sugar-cane or beet, or anything else, but because the cane-is a product which is grown essentially in tropical and sub-tropical climates, where it is difficult' without some inducement to prevail upon people to employ white labour; and because we have in the drastic legislation which I have mentioned agreed, within a certain number of years, to make black labour impossible. That is the whole question. Is there anything climatic connected with the production of beet sugar ? Is there I any difference between the production of beet and the production of potatoes 1 We know well enough that beet sugar is produced in Germany. Indeed, it is produced in many of the countries of Europe. It is not a tropical product; and if we introduce this alien element into the giving of the rebate we absolutely destroy the whole raison d'etre of the policy we are proposing to initiate. That policy will be reduced to an absurdity, and, furthermore, it will contravene one of the principles of our Constitution, which compels us to deal with equal fairness with all the products of Australia. In proposing this rebate at all, we are, to some extent, contravening the Constitution. But there is no Constitution, any more than there are rules of Parliament or laws, which should be our master and not our creature. Therefore, although what is proposed to be done may, to some extent, seem to run counter to the spirit of the Constitution, yet under the peculiarly exceptional conditions of Queensland, especially the tropical part of it, we desire to add to the other arrangements we have made, by giving a rebate to the planters who cease employing black We had labour. As a necessary corollary we have to include other sub-tropical parts, such as the north of New South Wales, where cane sugar is also grown. But why should we extend those conditions to beet sugar ? Is there any sense in doing BO?Is there any sense in it, if we look at it purely from the climatic aspect 1 Prom that point of view there is no reason why we should not give a bonus to every other product in Australia. I repeat that we have, to some extent, broken the compact of absolute equality throughout Australia; we have broken that compact intentionally, and for reasons of high policy. But we do not want to go further than is necessary in the breaking of it. This beet sugar has in its favour an import duty of £ 1 0 a ton, as against £ 6 per ton for cane sugar. member must not forget the bounty feeding of beet sugar by European countries. ference clearly shows that we have not forgotten the conditions of beet sugar production. I venture to say, and I challenge honourable members opposite to deny it although, of course, I have no absolute proof of the statement-that when the Government proposed this magnanimous way of dealing with the northern planters they",18,Tariff

Nevertheless I understood all along that whatever degree of encouragement was given to the white grower of cane-sugar would be extended to the white grower of beet-sugar. not tell us that when the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was before us. member understood that. If he did not it is remarkable that he did not make some allusion to the iniquity of the Tariff proposals of should not give one grower of sugar an the Government. If he calmly contemplated that men on land suitable for the growth of beet-sugar should invest their money in plant and labour to carry on the industry, .and then be compelled to be at a disadvantage of £ 2 per ton in the markets of Australia as against the grower of canesugar, I have not a high opinion of his sense -of justice. I contend that if we have land so suitable for the growth of beet-sugar that it -«an compete upon anything like fair terms with cane-sugar grown within the Commonwealth, those prepared to go into the in-dustry should have a chance of doing so. We do not know what alterations may take place iathe next year or two i u the methods .adopted for the manufacture of sugar from beet. We are making conditions which will -obtain for years to come under this Tariff, -and we should be prepared to meet all probable contingencies. I trust the committee will see the justice of putting all upon the same footing. The honourable member for Wentworth referred to the fact .that beet-sugar carries a higher customs -duty than does the cane-sugar, and ho spoke an though that made a difference in the price of beet and cane-sugar within the boundaries of the Commonwealth. Of course it makes no difference at all. Personally I am inclined to think that the customs duty on beet sugar is too high, but it makes no difference onoe both sugars are competing withih the boundaries of the Commonwealth. If it were admitted into the Commonwealth at as low a rate of duty as canesugar, the price of sugar all around might be a little' lower than it will be under the prodesire on the part of the committee to foster posals of the Government sugar is grown now 1 any beet is grown within the Commonwealth now for the purpose of manufacturing sugar. I do not put it forward that there is any likelihood under the present circumstances that much beet will be grown for the manufacture of sugar. I simply take up the position that the beet-sugar growers, if the industry is started in the Commonwealth, will have to compete with the cane-sugar growers in tbe same mai-ket, and they should not be placed at a disadvantage, roughly speaking, of £ 2 per ton. I do not say it is likely that a beetsugar industry will be created. I am inclined to the contrary opinion, but we advantage over another, and I trust the first suggestion of the honourable member for Echuca will be adopted. The honourable member's suggestion to make a rebate on sugar duties to the manufacturers is a different question, and one upon which I am not inclined to agree with him. But I trust the committee will see the justice of adopting his suggestion to remove the £ 2 a ton disability which the present proposal imposes upon the beet-sugar industry. The statements made by the honourable member for Bland must commend themselves to honourable members generally. Here is a contemplated industry that has not yet been established. The views of agriculturists throughout Victoria upon the subject were canvassed some time ago, and they asked for an increase of the import duty on sugar. That is conceded in this Tariff, and if the industry is established they will have all the}' desire. But the industry has not been established in any one of the States. Assuming that the industry were established, why should not those concerned in it be put upon the same footing as those engaged in the cane-sugar industry in Queensland? The proposal of the honourable member for Echuca seems to me to be a reasonable one, and I think he is to be commended for bringing it forward. The adoption of his proposal can do no possible harm, though I am afraid it will do no good, because the beet-sugar industry has not yet been established. I hope the proposal will be adopted, because its adoption will show a an industry which many agriculturists say",20,Tariff

So far from carrying out what were the proposals of the Ministry, the suggestion of the honourable member for Echuca is to depart from the very principle on which we gave the concession to the growers of canesugar. It was recognised that throughout the world cane-sugar is grown, almost without exception, by black labour, and that in depriving the northern plantersof black labour we were entering upon an experiment which might prove successful, but which might, on the other hand, prove to be ruinous to the industry. Parliament was therefore called upon to make some special concession, and even those whose principles are against such a tremendous difference between the excise and the import duties, yielded their principles in recognising tlie special and excepcome into competition with cane-sugar tional circumstances of the cane sugar growing industry in the north of Queensland.

It has been maintained in the past, as regards the competition between beet-sugar grown"" by white labour and cane-sugar grown by black, that, even with the protection given in Queensland, the beet-sugar from the continent was likely to injuriously affect the cane-sugar growing industry in Queensland. There have been attempts made to secure an increased duty upon this bounty-fed sugar, in addition to the -protection given by the Queensland duty upon sugar, previous to federation 1 owing to over-production. even in Queensland they were for years demanding that drastic treatment should be meted out to this bounty-fed sugar. We have to consider the fact that wherever beet-sugar grown by white labour has it has been able at any rate to hold its own. Now we are asked to give a considerable preference to beetsugar, under the suggestion of the honourable member for Echuca. As regards outside competition, we are asked to give locally grown beet-sugar a protection of £ 1 0 a ton, as against continental beet-sugar, and we are asked to give a protection of only £ 6 per ton to the locally grown cane-sugar. continental beet-sugar will affect the locally grown cane-sugar equally with the locally grown beet-sugar. we are asked to give this protection of £ 1 0 a ton to the white beet-sugar grower, as against a protection of only £ 6 per ton",21,Tariff

Cane is produced in"" very much the same way as maize. It does not require the high degree of culture that sugar beet demands. In order that it may be produced with success it is necessary for 'the sugar beet that the land should be worked into a fine tilth, and kept just as clean as an onion bed. That involves the employment of an enormous quantity of labour. A great deal of labour is required for the work of weeding and thinning out. sugar cannot compete with cane-sugar. it-ought to carry an additional handicap. MrA . M c LEAN , In any case it should not be placed in a worse position than the cane-sugar industry. I do not know whether it can compete with cane sugar on the same terms, but it employs a very great deal more labour, and unlike the cane-sugar industry, it assists a great many other, industries. The by-products of the beet are most valuable. The exhausted slices constitute one of the best kinds of food for stock that can be produced. A Royal commission sat in Scotland for several years, and after taking evidence as to the best possible kind of food for dairy stock, reported in favour of the sugar beet plant. The commission reported that it was better than any other kind of food upon which they had experimented. It is a most valuable adjunct to the dairying and fattening industry, and therefore it does far more good to the country in which it is established than cane-sugar can possibly do. success in Victoria1 MrA . McLEAN -Becaus e the company which entered upon the manufacture of beet sugar here did not obtain enough of the raw material to make it pay. I am not prepared to say that beet-sugar can compete on even terms with that produced from cane, but we should at least place it on an equal footing with cane-sugar. It appears to me that there are only two positions which we. can support logically. Either we are tb give this advantage as a bonus to those who have been growing cane with black labour in the past, or we are to extend it to those who produce sugar in the future from cane or any other plant. If cane-sugar grown in New South Wales, which has never employed black labour iu this industry, is to receive the benefit of £ 2 per ton, then the beet-sugar industry, if it should become established here, or in any other part of the Commonwealth, should be placed on the same footing. entirely a matter of climate 1 MrA . McLEAN -No. Beet-sugar can be produced in almost any climate. The best tests of sugar-beet that I have yet seen were obtained from beet grown at Tenterfield, near the borders of New South Wales> and Queensland. Sugar-beet grown there at Sydney, and gave a yield of 22 per cent. dustry was a failure there. MrA . McLEAN -No attempt was made to establish the industry there. The people sowed only trial plots, and waited to see whether the industry established in Victoria would be a success. No doubt the climate and soil of New South Wales are admirably suited for the production of beet, and the same remark will apply to a great deal of territory in Queensland. lands of New South Wales are best adapted for the cultivation of beet. MrA . McLEAN -Beet requires very rich land. Good soil is obtainable on tablelands as well as in the valleys and lowcountry. Tenterfield is during a portion of the year very much like that of an English winter 1 MrA . M c LEAN I do not know anything about the climate there, but I am was it not a aware that the experiments made in the cultivation of beet at Tenterfield were most satisfactory. My honourable friend must admit that the cane-growers of New South Wales, who have never employed black labour, should not be placed in an. exceptional position as compared with the sugar-beet growers in New South Wales, or in any other State. A t the present time there is no one interested in the beet-sugar industry here except, perhaps, the Govern-* ment of Victoria. The Government of this State have a thoroughly up-to-date beetsugar plant equipped with all the latest improvements, and probably equal to any of its size in any part of the world. It can treat from 400 to 420 tons per day. If we handicap that industry by £ 2 per ton as compared with the cane-sugar, the plant",23,Turner Beet Suga R Was Giving That Exceptional Treatment For All

When I was at the head of a Government in Victoria, I was in treaty with a proposed company for the sale of the plant, and it is quite possible that under the present conditions the Government will be able to sell it at its fair value for use either in this or some other State. If we go out of our way to impose an additional excise duty of £ 2 per ton on beet-sugar as compared with cane-sugar, we shall render it impossible for the industry to be established within the Commonwealth, and in that way the plant will become valueless. It would be impossible for the Government to sell the plant. That would not be just. Look at it as we may, it is not just to give to New South Wales, which has never employed black labour in the sugar-cane fields agree to the importation are there. MrA . McLEAN -The Queensland Government assisted the establishment of the cane-sugar industry in that State by means of black labour, and if we are not going to give this advantage to the growers of any product other than cane, from which sugar is obtained, we should confine any benefit we give to the cane grown by those who have been producing it by means of black labour and not give it to any future growers of cane with white labour. To do so would be most unjust. If we adopt this system as a national policy, as I think we should, we should extend it all round, whether the sugar is produced from cane, beet, sorghum, sugar-maple, which sugar is obtained, provided that the sugar is of the best and can be supplied on the same conditions, and for the same price as other sugar. [ should like honourable members to consider this matter. I have not the remotest interest in the sugar-beet industry. I was one of those who tried to establish it here. Whatever money I put into the venture is lost, and «1_ m i I do not regret it . The experiment was is the plant doing worthy of a trial, and I was prepared to go into it . I have not the slightest interest in It has been idle for the industry now, because the company of which I was a member transferred the plant and factory, and everything belonging to it , to the Government as mortgagees, and I have no intention of entering upon the industry in future. I speak in a thoroughly disinterested way. I believe the proposal is fair all round-for the Commonwealth as a whole. the honourable member for Wentworth has said, that probably the Government when introducing the proposals with reference to excise, had not in mind particularly the sugar-beet industry. Of course, the sugar-cane industry was in existence, whereas the beet-sugar industry was not; and no doubt our attention was more particularly directed to the former. But I can assure the honourable member that we never dreamt for a moment of dealing differently with the two industries-favor ing one at the expense of another; and when the honourable member comes to consider the matter he will see it is utterly impossible that a proposition of that sort can the Government be accepted by the committee. If we have of the labour'( protection against the foreigner, well and good; but what is proposed is that there should be protection of one industry against another-the sugar-cane industry as against the sugar-beet industry. beet industry. no doubt the suitability of our soil and climate has been proved, and it cannot be very long, I think, .before the beet-sugar industry will be established.

It is one thing to provide for protection against foreign sugar, whether cane or beet, and another and very different thing to suggest that we should utilize these provisions for the purpose of giving protection to the cane-grower as against the beet-grower. Such a proposition is utterly impracticable. What do we find ? The cane industry has, at least, been established, while attempts in connection with the beet industry have been failures. The honourable member for Parramatta doubts the possibility of the beet industry being successfully established here. light of past experience, we see that the difficulties which the cane-growers have overcome, have not been overcome by beetgrowers ; and, under the circumstances, is it tolerable to provide that one industry shall be subject to a disadvantage from which the other is free ? subject to a disadvantage from which the other is free. shall follow the subject a little further. The proposed legislation is not intended to be confined to the northern part of Queensland, but applies to the whole of Australia. It applies to those districts in New South Wales where sugar-cane is at present grown without coloured labour-wher e no necessity has been found for such labour-and yet those cane growers, who make no alteration in procedure as regards employment, are to have the full benefit of the rebate. of the rebate. £ 3 per ton, £ 1 chiefly for revenue purposes, and £ 2 as a sort of toll for the employment of black labour, which we do not wish to encourage. growers do not employ any black labour, can it be reasonably contended that they shall pay the toll which is exacted from those who do employ that class of labour? It seems to me simply preposterous to make a proposal of that sort. I carry the argument a little further. In New South Wales there is no necessity to employ coloured labour in connection with cane sugar-growing, or any other industry, and the soil and climate of that State are as favorable to beet-growing as are the soil and climate in any other part of Australia. If my friends on the other side attain their object, the position would be that the cane-grower of New South Wales will pay an excise of £ 1 per ton, while in the very next field the beetgrower, who is employing the same description of labour, will be subject to an excise of £ 3 . To state the effect is to show the utter absurdity of the proposal. It is suggested that the sugar-beet industry cannot be established here, and in regard to that there may be room for differences of opinion. I am inclined to think, and hope, that the industry will be established; but, arguing from present conditions, we find that the cane industry has been more easily established, and that it exists and flourishes, whereas the beet industry does not. How can we, when there is no question of black labour, insist on subjecting the industry, which may arise, and we hope will arise, to a disadvantage as compared with its competitor? Such a contention is neither fair nor reasonable, and the more we look into the matter, the more we come to the conclusion that the proposal cannot be defended from any point of view. The argument of the Minister for Trade and Customs would be ,quite right if there were two industries competing side by side, as he supposes. Honourable members on the other side assume in their arguments that there is a A'ery extensive beet-sugar industry in Australia. As a matter of fact, there is no beet industry, and the question is whether we are going to take steps to establish an industry such as may, at some future time, give us all the trouble and humbug that the cane sugar production is giving us to-day. MrA . McLEAN -Does the honourable member propose to extend this advantage to future cane-growers? able gentleman see how I voted the other night ? If so, he would not have asked the question. MrA .

I am not, and do not intend to. hope the position is now clear to the honourable member. The difference between the two industries is that the beet industry is not now in existence, whereas the cane sugar industry is, and is giving us all this trouble, discussion, and anxiety, as well as compelling the country to pay huge sums in order to extricate it from its present difficulty. The honourable member for Gippsland told us that beet sugar can never compete with cane sugar, and he gave his reason for that statement. The honourable member says that the beet industry requires better land and better tilth, and consequently much more labour must be employed. For these reasons, so far as tropical Australia is concerned-and , indeed, so far as the continent, as a whole, is concerned-bee t sugar can never hope to successfully compete with cane-sugar. in America. anything about America; I am talking about Australia. If the honourable member says that beet sugar is competing with cane sugar in America, I take his word; but I ask, at what price is that being done ? What duties and what bounties are there in America? seded for five years. the duties remaining ? sugar. these duties are prohibitive ? is an industry which, on the statements of honourable members on the other has black labour, or there is an alternative prohibitive duty. Is this an industry which we should rushout of ourway to try to bring into existence at the beginning of the Commonwealth? A t whose expense is it proposed we should establish an industry, Which honourable members on the other side show is not native to our soil, or native from the standpoint of our civilization and our labour conditions? These honourable members, in everv argument they use, explain that this industry must have prohibitive duties or it cannot thrive, as other industries thrive throughout the I length and breadth of the continent. They show that the sugar industry of Australia is altogether special, and more or less exotic. These are the facts with which they set out to consider the question, and in the light of all these admissions, we are asked to go out of our way to specially treat the cane sugar of Queensland, and at the same time, promote the establishment of another industry which will be even worse from a commercial standpoint. I , as representing people who use sugar largely-people who are engaged in fruit growing-a m not prepared to promote the establishment of an industry which shows that it cannot possibly live except in so far as it relies for assistance on the other industries of the continent. The honourable member for Gippsland talked about justice. Where is the justice in the proposal of the Government, as applied to the sugar industry of Australia, apart from the question of black or white labour ? The honourable member for Gippsland says that it would not be just to give this rebate in connection with cane sugar and not give it in connection with the beet sugar. But there is no beet sugar industry, and we do not desire to cultivate the latter until it can be shown that, after its cultivation has begun, it w i ll be able to exist by its own inherent qualities. I object altogether to the statement that beet-sugar growing is good for the farmer, or that it employs more labour. The industry can do these two things only at the cost of some of the other people in the State, who have to keep it going by huge prohibitive duties. When honourable members tell me that an industry employs a lot of labour, the question is-a t what cost ? Isi t remunerative labour, the employment of which is good for the State1 Or is it the employment of labour which could be more remuneratively utilized in side, cannot live except it some other occupation? These are questions which, in a just view of the matter, ought to be asked by honourable members. Buti t seems to be the fashion on the other side only to ask the question-Does the industry employ labour ? Can the article be produced or grown here ? When these questions have been answered, honourable members opposite think that the whole matter is settled, without any reference to cost, or to the relations which the particular",26,Turner Beet Suga R Was Giving That Exceptional Treatment For All

98,Mr Joseph Cook,"Exactly. Hereindustry will bear to other industrial occupations on the continent. I object to the establishment of the beet sugar industry at the cost of those who use sugar. There was another industry referred to by the honourable member for Echuca, namely, that of fruit-growing. I presume honourable members have had a statement put into their hands by the fruit-growers of Victoria as to the relative value of their industry, and that of sugar-growing. The fruit-growers, it appears, have a greater area under cultivation, and their crop is worth very much more than is the total crop of sugar. The fruit-growers employ more hands and no coloured labour ; and yet it is pz-oposed that these men who have been struggling for many years, shall put their hands in their pockets and pay for the obliteration of black labour in another part of the continent Honourable members sometimes argue as though there were a huge fund at the disposal of the Treasurer, out of which to make these adjustments from time to time throughout the Commonwealth. The money that we give to the growers of sugar-cane we take from those who are engaged in fruit-growing and in fruit-preserving, and from those who use sugar as an article of food. When honourable members talk of justice, it is time that some one asks for justice for those who use sugar as well as for those who produce it. I do not think that the cane-sugar and the beetsugar industries can be compared, because one is an industry which is now in existence while the other is not; and I have yet to learn that, in order to help the Victorian Government, which has somewhere a plant which is now useless, but which, under certain circumstances, might be used, we should penalize the sugar users of the continent. Let the Victorian Government put their plant into a museum as an evidence of their utter folly in trying to bring into existence an industry which cannot maintain itself against outside competition. Do not let them come whining to this Parliament, asking that the sugar users of the Commonwealth may be penalized in order to bring their now useless plant into use. I am surprised that the matter should have been mentioned by an honourable member who is noted for his hard-headedness. All that has been said upon the subject this afternoon goes to show that the beetsugar industry should not couraged by the granting to it of : T a r i ff 9887 special bounties. Honourable members say that beet cannot be grown except where the soil is rich, and that a great amount of labour must be employed in its cultivation and in the gathering of the product. That being so, the beet-sugar industry cannot compete with the cane-sugar industry. Sugar-cane is grown in the tropical parts of Australia, where it is more or less a native product, and if our cane-sugar cannot compete against that grown in other parts of the world, except with the aid of high protective duties or cheap imported labour, can the beetsugar be expected to do so 1 Let us make the best we can of the cane-sugar difficulty in Queensland. This Parliament has declared that sugar-cane must henceforth be grown with white labour, and has determined to give the producers within the Commonwealth an advantage over outside producers. Further than that, during the next five years those who employ white, labour only will obtain a rebate of £ 2 a ton upon their sugar. No doubt the bulk of that money will go into the pockets of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It seems to me that the New South Wales growers are somewhat at a disadvantage compared with the growers in tropical Queensland, where, the climate being hotter, the yield of sugar is probably greater; but, nevertheless, it was found that sugar could be grown profitably in New South Wales with white labour, paid at the rate of 7s. a day, under a duty of £ 3 a ton. Why then should we go out of our way to impose a duty of £ 1 0 a ton for the benefit of the beet-sugar industry, which we are told cannot compete upon even terms with the cane-sugar industry? Isi t not time that we gave some consideration to those who use sugar as an article of food, or as the raw material of the products which they manufacture? The value of the return from fruit-growing land is estimated at £11 Is. 5d. per acre, whilst the value of the return from sugar-cane is only £ 4 7s. 7d. per acre. The total value of the sugar-cane grown in 1899 was £619,000, while the value of the sugar refined in 1900 was £1,188,693, while the total value of the f r u it crop in 1899 was £1,783,400. The fruit-growers, however, are not asking for special consideration, but they may justly ask for a remission of the high duties upon sugar. I shall do nothing knowingly be ento assist in the building-up of an industry like the beet industry, until it can be shown that it is likely to be able to compete with the cane-sugar industry. According to the testimony which we have had this afternoon, however, from rabid advocates of the establishment of the beet industry in Victoria, beet-sugar cannot be produced as cheaply as cane,-sugar. MrA . McLEAJT -The bigger returns duction has diminished in New South Wales should compensate for the additional labour since the duty was reduced to £ 3 a ton. employed. There is a larger return from the by-products in the case of the beet industry. If it were not for the by-products, have gone in for dairy farming. the industry would have no chance of competing with the cane-sugar industry, but it in for dairy farming to any extent upon may possibly compete with it because of the land previously used for sugar growing, value of the by-products. into such an economic mess in regard to the New South Wales, in 1864, there were 22 cane-sugar industry, we should be careful acres under sugar cane; in 1871, 4,394 not to get into a similar mess in regard to acres; in 1881, 12,167 acres; in 1891, the beet sugar industry.

Sir honourable member know what the people of Europe ported statement. in the way of excise than she pays in tlie way of bounty. siderable experience of the bounties those nations are still paying them. If the results were not satisfactory to them they would not be doing s'o. But turning to the United States, I find that in an article dealing with the growth of beet sugar in Oregon, and with the conditions appertaining to a few particular factories, the Agricultural department reports in this way :It is estimated that if this season's expectations be fulfilled more than 1,000,000 tons of homegrown sugar will be consumed in the United States, or three times the figures of 189(5-97, the increase being almost entirely due to the expansion of sugar-beet production. In three years the production of sugar-beet has increased threefold. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Has in the United States1 ance in the shape of bonuses. say what they have at the present time, but they had bonuses at the outset. What has been a great factor in agricultural development in the United States is the splendid assistance given by experiments in different directions, not only by the State Legislature, but also by the Federal Legislature. to pay Paul. immense factor in the wealth production of the State, I do not see where the robbing comes in. Buti n the proposition before the committee there is not a request for any special consideration. It is merely a request not to place a special handicap on one class of sugar production, and seeing that it is a source of considerable wealth production to the growers, wherever it has been engaged in, and where the conditions were favorable, it shall have my hearty .support. Of course it is attempted to mix up that question with other issues--suc h for instance as to how it wil l 1 affect those engaged in the manufacture of garden produce, but that is a question which prepared to go the . whole way with those pay-£4,000,0001 who have a special knowledge of the condiT h a t is an unsuptions prevailing in Queensland, and give them what assistance they have asked. I I do not think that the Government in their proposals have been lenient with the sugar growers in Queensland. Up to 1907, when A f t e r a very conthey will, not be able to utilize black labour, will be the most critical period for sugar growers in that State. I shall give them all the support in my power. I am prepared to be guided to a very considerable extent by the opinions of their representatives. I trust that the committee will accept the amendment of the honourable member for Echuca. thinking that we have travelled far indeed from the considerations that were before the Chamber when we were dealing with the Kanaka question. A t that time. I paid considerable attention to all the speeches, and I think it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to find any reference to a rebate on sugar grown in, say Victoria, or in those it assistance districts in New South Wales where at no time black labour had been employed. WeI t has special assisthad undoubtedly before us the question as to how we could best relieve the planters in Queensland who were employing Kanakas, I am not prepared to from the inconvenience and the expense which they would inevitably have to face in the change from black labour to white labour. . But while I recognise that fact, and while I admit as a matter of principle that we ought not to concede anything to the growers of beet sugar, still for the sake of expediency, and in order to get on a little faster than we are doing, I am willing to vote for tbe proposition before the committee. And in doing so I feel sure that I am not giving away any proportion of the revenue to the growers of beet, for the simple reason that I believe that not a ton of beet sugar is likely to be produced in competition with cane sugar grown in Queensland. In Victoria, a great effort was made some years ago to make the beet sugar industry a live one. The attention of its statesmen was concentrated on the industry.

127,Mr Fowler (Perth),"I cannot helpexpended freely-in fact nothing was left undone to make the industry a success. To-day every one admits absolute failurefailure of so thorough a nature that I feel certain that even the temptation of £ 2 a ton rebate will be unlikely to resuscitate the industry. I shall vote for the proposal before the committee, not because I consider that the claim is a fair one, .but because I regard it as one of those things which are absolutely meaningless. We have heard a great deal about tlie advantages of growing beet, and if they were such as have been represented by the honourable member for Echuca, the farmers of Victoria should be only too glad to grow it without any assistance from the State. Tliey might utilize their beet on their farms ; but I feel sure that very little of it indeed 'would go into the manufacture of sugar. Under these circumstances, I have no hesitation in saying that I shall support the amendment, because it does not mean that the country will lose the slightest portion of excise upon sugar which it might fairly expect. bane) -On e argument that has been used in support of the amendment is that there is a possibility of the resuscitation of the beet-sugar industry. The last speaker intimated that he would support it on the ground of that possibility, and also gave as a reason that he was quite sure that it was merely a formal act on his part to vote for it, because no beet-sugar would ever be produced either in Victoria or elsewhere in the Commonwealth. While approving of the honourable member's determination on . the ground stated, I am going to vote in the opposite direction on principle. Beet-sugar production might become in the immediate future a menace to the successful production of cane-sugar by white labour. We know very well that if Germany or France had what the Commonwealth of Australia possesses, immense areas of splendid rich tropical country, with amagnificent rainfall of from 30 inches to 30 feet per annum, they would not grow a'single ton of beet. Those who are intimate with the history of the development of the beet industry on the continent of Europe know very well that it was established for the specific purpose of relieving the farmers, who have been an enormously increasing portion of the population during the past 30 or 50 years.. Something had to be done for them. The beet industry, once established, grew until it became a handle in the possession of the respective Governments of the countries to which I have referred for the purpose of annihilating the sugar-producing industry in the British West Indian possessions and elsewhere. Why was it that Sir Henry Norman was sent out the other day by the British Government to the West India Islands to report on the diminution of the sugar production and the stagnation of the industry, especially in Jamaica? It was because the matter is under the serious consideration of the British Government. A t present the war overwhelms every other question, and the position of the West India Islands has been hung up ; but once the war is over one of the first questions that will engage the attention of the Imperial authorities will be that of the production of sugar beet, to the detriment of cane-sugar as produced in British possessions and in other parts of the world. Are we to imagine that, if the production of sugar by white labour become a success in Queensland, that will be the only part of Australia where sugar will be grown? Not at all. I apprehend that if white labour establishes itself as a successful grower of sugar at a profit, and if the industry is able to pay the wages which white labour demands, the industry will enormously increase right around the whole of the eastern, northern, and western coasts of Australia north of the Tropio of Capricorn. Why should we, then, hold out the slightest inducement, even for five years, to the production of beet-sugar in any part of southern Australia, when in the immediate future cane-sugar grown by white labour will be so generally produced ? It is admitted on all .sides that cane-sugar produced in such regions as enjoy a plentif u l rainfall, and, as one honourable member has said, with abundant sunshine-thes e being the essentials for the growth of sugar cane-is a commodity with which beet sugar cannot compete, no matter where it ' is grown. We can grow sugar-beet most successfully in all parts of our coastal regions in Queensland as well as in northern New South Wales. We can gro w it abundantly and successfully on the Darling Downs, in the western waters. The production of beetsugar in Victoria was attempted while that State was a separate colony, and not as a part of the Commonwealth. It was a.domestic,not an Australian, question. We must look at the prospect of a revival of the sugar industry in",31,William Mcmillan Does The We Can Dispose Of At A Later Stage I Am

I cannot admit that from a national point of view we should desire to encourage the utilization of this plant in Victoria, under the belief that those who use it may possibly make a success of the industry in j i v e or six years, abandon, perforce, the employment of the if they are given the advantage which is asked for under the Tariff. Sir production of cane-sugar equal to the supply of all Australia 1 Very nearly. But if the revival of the production of beet-sugar in Victoria be successful after five or six years, what will happen ? A t once away goes the bonus which is to be given to Queensland, and up goes the claim of Victoria to a continuity of the bonus for the production of beet-sugar. We must look ahead, and that is a faildiagnosis of what are the circumstances today, and the prospects for to-morrow. If beet-root production in Victoria had been a success, and not an industrial failure as it has been, and if the industry were in existence, producing a reasonable quantity of sugar, employing a proportionate quantity of labour and capital, and paying interest on the advances which had been made by the State Government, there would be some ground for granting the concession; but at present there is not the strength of a cobweb upon which to hang the clai m that is made. It is said that New South Wales does not employ any coloured labour. I fancy from the best information I have obtained-apar t from personal knowledgethat a considerable portion of the New South Wales northern river growers employ free coloured labour that has come from Queensland or elsewhere. employed on the Tweed he wants his 7s. a day. I know that the Kanakas employed there receive good wages-receive , indeed, as much as the white men ; and they are very t h r if ty hard-working men, who do not squander their money needlessly either to the injury of their health, or otherwise, but put it in the Savings Bank to provide for a rainy day. Lastly, I would point out that the honourable memberf or Gippsland omitted to tell the committee that the principal condition which was agreed to by honourable members, in respect of the excise to be levied upon cane-sugar production, was founded upon a bargain, as it has been called, that the sugar planters and growers in Queensland should have the advantage of the £ 2 per ton rebate as a sort of recompense, in order to enable them to Kanaka. The honourable member for Gippsland should have told us that the labour were commenced here to-morrow, would be the same as they were before. MrA . McLEAN --Victori a does not ask for consideration ; she asks not to be placed in a worse position than the other States. She wants to be in a better position than that of the sugar-planters of Queensland now. Victoria is not, and never has been, in the position that Queensland is. Queensland has been attacked victoriously by those who have determined that black labour should cease, and the £ 2 a ton rebate was given as a solatium. Victoria has no right to raise the question at all. Queensland gets tlie solatium for an attack made upon her most successful industry-a n industry that has been carried on for years under State laws, which the people.there were led to believe would not be interfered with by the Commonwealth Government. That solatium was given for the express purpose of enabling those whose capital has been invested in the industry to tide over the period to the end of 1906. Queensland gets the rebate to enable her to maintain her position and her solvency. To enable her to overcome the disadvantages of the changed conditions forced upon her, she is to get this solatium for five-years. Victoria comes now and asks for the same concession upon no grounds whatever, be0 cause no beet-sugar industry exists. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN And there are no disadvantageous climatic conditions. There are no disadvantageous climatic conditions, and no black labour is to be abolished.

There is one very strong argument against the proposal. We have put an absolutely prohibitive duty upon the importation of beetsugar-£1 0 a ton-and even if we were to give away the whole of the excise of £ 3 a ton, and reduce the import duty to £ 7 per ton, it would still be a prohibitive duty. In the face of that fact, and of the fact that there are no disadvantageous climatic conditions against the establishment of the beet-sugar industry in Victoria, we are asked to treat people who may undertake that industiy in exactly the same way as people carrying on the cane-sugar industry in the tropical parts of Queensland, and for whom the whole scheme has been devised. MrA . McLEAX -Surely the honourable member does not mean to say that the high duty was imposed in the interests of the beet-sugar industry 1 not as I say, there would be no excuse for this scheme. We can only look upon it as a component part of the legislation dealing with the Kanaka system. It is that and nothing more ; and the idea of dragging in a product like beet-sugar, which does not exist at all at the present time, and the growth of which could be conducted under ordinary climatic conditions, and putting it upon a level with the cane-sugar industry in Queensland, is against common sense and reason. If this is going to be done it might be a reason why honourable members should reconsider their position with regard to the rebate scheme altogether. This concession to beet-sugar was not one of the Government proposals. It was never intended by the Government, and it is dragged in now in a senseless and useless way in regard to an industry which does not exist, and which we know ought not to 28 L exist, because the peculiarity of this beetsugar industry is that it is an entirely artificial industry. It has never been put upon a sound footing, except by a system of robbery of the great mass of the people. A t the present time Europe pays £4,000,000, chiefly out of the hard earnings of her working people, for the delightful position of being able to export a lotof beet-sugartootherparts of the world. If these bounties and this artificial assistance were taken away from the beet-sugar industry in Europe, it would go to pieces. Whether we are free-traders or protectionists, none of us will approve of the artificial establishment of an industry which requires enormous, even prohibitive, duties, or on the other hand extravagant bonuses to keep it alive from year to year. I therefore say that this beet-sugar industry should not come into this question at all. If it comes to a matter of being self-supporting, we know that at the present time we make almost as much sugar from cane in New South Wales and Queensland as will supply the whole of Australia. Are we going to bring into competition another product 1 Look at the futility of it ! We must face the fact that this artificial assistance ceases at the end of five years, during which time it will be impossible to establish the industry, or underneath it all there must be a determination that after five years this assistance shall be continued or even increased. The suggestion is absurd. On the one hand we refuse to continue the system of excise' and rebate beyond five years, and on tlie If it were other hand we give a concession to an industry which is not now established, which could not be established at all under ordinary conditions, and just at the moment when it would be established by this measure of assistance, we take away all the support from it . Viewed in the light of common sense, it is clear that the Government proposal is part and parcel of the treatment of the Kanaka question, and it is intended to alleviate, to some extent, the effects of the rather harsh measures which, as a matter of high State policy, we have had to take in view of the interests of the whole of Australia.

The honourable member knows them up I found that the amount of the that that special duty was put upon beetbounty paid upon the export of beet-sugar sugar to protect the cane-sugar, and not in was only a few hundred thousand pounds, the interests of a local beet-sugar industry whilst the amount received in excise duty which does not exist.

Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN had to do so. MrA . McLEAN -Ho w can the honourable gentleman, consistently with his principles as a free-trader, advocate putting a special impost of £ 2 per ton onbeet-sugar which heidoes notpropose to put upon his own cane-sugar ? Is that in accordance with the principles of free-trade? I admitted it . MrA . McLEAN -No special consideration is asked in the interests of beet sugar. All that we ask is that there shall be no special disability imposed upon it. We only ask that it shall be placed in the same category as cane-sugar. It is not proposed that it shall be given any special bonus, but that it shall pay the same rate of excise per lb. for sugar, which is sold in London duty to the State that cane-sugar has to pay. at l ^ d . per lb. thing ; it does not exist. MrA . M c LEAN the proposal can do no harm. All that we ask is that there shall be no special barrier placed in the way of the establishment of tlie industry. If it can be established on its merits, we should not go out of our way to prevent it being established. My honourable friends talk of the enormous injury to the people of Germany by reason of the bounties paid upon the export of beet-sugar. I think the German nation can be allowed to take care of itself. The honourable member for Wentworth is a student of history, and does he not know that it is he who is in a hopeless minority, and that his views are shared only by the isolated few? Does the honourable gentleman think the few free-traders of New South Wales are to sway the judgment of the teeming millions of the old world ? orable friend ought to know that the antiquated policy to which he is clinging has been discarded by all the enlightened nations of the earth, with only one notable exception. I have not looked at the returns from Germany for the last two or three years, but the last time. I did look income out of the beet-sugar industry. honourable member approve of that policyof the excise duty imposed there ? MrA . M c LEAN I do not know whether my honourable friend is familiar with the policy of Germany and France. Those continental nations are protectionist nations, and they put a high protective duty upon beet-sugar in favour of the local industry, and make it up by a considerable excise duty for revenue. It is found that this is a very useful industry^ and employs a large proportion of the peasantry of these continental countries, and to encourage that employment, tlie nation .pays a bounty on the surplus produced, and exports it to other countries. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The bounty is paid upon the beet-sugar produced. If it does not exist, MrA .

142,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay),"I hope thefor long j I hope it will not resolve itself into a general argument on free-trade and protection. What is involved,' as I understand it, is whether the bonus proposed to be given to the growers of cane sugar by white labour in Queenslanda rebate of £ 2 per ton of the excise duty-is also to be given to those who may grow beet-sugar in 'Victoria, or in any other State, by white labour. Although the proposal exhibits a good deal of the peculiar unselfishness of Victoria in all matters concerning that State particularly, it shows that honourable members representing Victoria are determined to exact the last concession they can get out of the Tariffi n every way. ThoughI represent a sugar-growing district, I do not see how I can consistently do otherwise than vote for the proposal. I think it is producing discord in the general understanding, but I must consistently vote for it. Eveni f I feared it I would still vote for it ; but I do not fear it . I do not for a moment believe that any growers of beet sugar in Victoria can compete with our white cane sugar growers in Queensland if they are given proper opportunities. I do not think the high import duty upon beet sugar makes any difference at all. The bonus paid upon beet sugar on the continent makes the customs duty of £ 1 0 per ton proposed here about equal to the customs duty of £ 6 per ton imposed upon imported cane sugar. To be consistent, the Government were, I think, bound to propose such duties as would bring about an equality in that respect, unless we are to go upon the free-trade principle of importing everything as cheaply as we can. Sir WILLIAM beet sugar to do with the Kanaka 1 been said in that respect by the honourable gentleman who is at present leading the Opposition, but the whole thing was a compromise at the general election. The honourable gentleman is voting for a revenue Tariff, and the Government are voting for a revenue Tariff, with a protective incidence. Seeing that the cane-sugar industry has been established in two of the States at least, some protection should be given to those -engaged in it, and especially in view of the special circumstances recited in connection with coloured labour in Queensland. There are, however, many reasons why we should follow a consistent course, even if to do so were to our disadvantage. The district I represent is largely a sugar-growing district, and despite the statements of people who think differently, I think that sugar will continue to be produced there to a great extent by white labour. I am prepared to meet competition with beet sugar grown in Victoria, but I make this request of members representing Victoria: that if we consistently vote for this proposal, they will admit that the white sugar-growers in Queensland, struggling against climatic and other disadvantageous conditions, are entitled to almost the f u ll rebate proposed by the Government with respect to sugar produced by white labour. That is quite fair. money down."" should be made only in tlie lobbies. bonorable members who are free-traders making these interjections, and I shall remind them of something which may be of interest.

I agree with what has matter fairly before the committee. I do not want to make points against the honourable member. ber cannot prove his statement as to that duty.

154,Mr Fisher,"The proposal of thekanaka-grown sugar 'of Queensland, namely, an operative duty of £ 3 per ton. An excise duty of £ 3 per ton has to be paid on sugar produced from Kanaka-grown cane, while the man who produces sugar from cane grown by white labour has to pay an excise duty of £ 1 per ton, so that he is allowed only a differential duty of £ 2 a ton. That is not sufficient. I say that if they are consistent, those who supported the State Government of New South Wales, to which I have referred, ought to give sugar produced by white labour an advantage of £ 3 per ton. Is that a bargain with the honourable members for Victoria? before. matter whether it has been stated before or .not?

We ask the committee to give 5s. instead of 4s. a ton on 10per cent. cane. If the Government yield to that request we . shall be pleased, and, on the arguments I have adduced, I think it would be fair, as well as beneficial to Australia, for them to do so. If that proposal is not agreed to, I can assure the committee that the white sugar-cane growers of Queensland will, not sit down and ask for Government aid. .They .are not built that way. They will set to -work and do their utmost. -they will fail in a glorious battle. -is contended that this rebate should he expended to beet-sugar, because a proposal has 'been been made to allow it to cane growers in parts of the Commonwealth in which white labour is being employed in the industry at the present time. That is the only argument which has been advanced with any force. But does it not show the hollowness of the whole scheme ? Doesi t not show, that to extend the rebate to beetsugar would be practically a breach of faith with the people of Queensland, or with the planters, from whom we have taken cheap black labour ? It was bad enough to place the growers of New South Wales, who have hitherto conducted operations by means of white labour, on the same footing as those of Queensland, where they are being compelled to introduce white labour in substitution for black. It is proposed now to go farther, and to introduce an entirely not stated new element. If it were not for the fact that we have compelled the sugar planters If it is a fact, does it of Queensland to substitute white for black labour, would there be any proposition for a rebate ? We are asked to give a rebate on beet sugar in order that a new industry may be established. B ut what concession will the sugar-cane growers of Queensland receive if the beet-sugar industry is placed on an equal footing ? None whatever. The more I think of this most recent proposal, the more strongly am I convinced that it would be a distinct breach of faith with the sugar-cane growers of Queensland, whom, we are agreed, should receive a bonus or rebate. If it is thought that an Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN We ought to have all the representatives of Queensland with us. nanimous spirit exhibited by the honourable member for Wide Bay in his desire for consistency; but I think that he exhibited a little of his feeling as to the selfishness of Victoriai n asking for this concession when it was absolutely wrung from the Government as a condition of the passing of the Pacific Island Labourers Bill. There was no suggestion that the rebate should be extended to beet sugar until some of the Government's followers got to work. It is not a Government proposal. If they fail, Government in .the matter. that the advantage'of £ 2 per ton proposed to be given to the Queensland sugar-cane growers, as compensation for the loss sustained by them in substituting white for black labour, will be anything like a fair equivalent ?",36,William Mcmillan Is Not The Conditions In Victoria If Beet Sugar Culture

The demand will not bear scrutiny. I should not have risen to address myself to this matter, but for the statement made by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that I was a member of a Government in New South Wales which considered that a duty of £ 3 per ton on sugar was a fair one, and therefore kept it on. When questioned on the subject, the honourable member challenged me to deny or to affirm the accuracy of his statement. This is a very old dodge. It is easy to make .statements, and then to challenge the person affected to deny them. I did not fall into the trap. May I tell the honourable member now that the duty of £ 3 per ton to which he has referred was kept on by the Government of which I was a member, not because it was a protective duty, but because we could not afford to take it off at the time. The state of our revenue would not permit us to do so. supporters of that Government threaten to go on the other side if the Government removed it? threatened to go on the other side because we refused to take it off ; the honourable member for Dalley was one.

If he believes honestly that I proposed to enter into a compact with Victorians, he is certainly under a misapprehension.

They reflect, far more discredit upon those who make them than they do upon those who were so unjustly charged with having entered into such a compact. A t the time that the proposal to grant a loan to those engaged in the industry was before the Victorian Parliament, I opposed it very strongly ; but it was a very different proposal from that placed before the committee by the honourable member for Echuca. There is no special concession asked for by the primary producer on this occasion. It has been shown that beet can be grown here of a quality equal to that grown in any part of the world, and those who grow it or intend to grow it, do not ask to be placed at an advantage as compared with those who grow cane-sugar; all they ask is that they shall have the same treatment as the canegrower. Sugar-beet producers do exist here, and others may if they receive any encouragement from this Parliament; and all the arguments which have been poured forth in an attempt to prove that a special concession is asked for, are absolutely without point. All that is desired, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Gippsland, is fair treatment; and the question of an import duty of £ 1 0 a ton on beetsugar does not touch the subjectof discussion. The honourable member for Gippsland is perfectly right when he says that that duty was imposed by the Government with a view to protecting the producers of sugar, whether from cane or beet; and no honourable member will contend for a moment that a duty of £ 1 0 on beet-sugar will advance the interests of the beet-sugar growers If the honourable memany more than those of the cane-growers, seeing that the finished article is practically the same, and is sold at virtually the same price. I have never Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The n why was this duty imposed 'f producers of sugar, whether beet or cane production. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The honourable I am glad that the member has done away with his own argument. I adopted, namely, that the duty was imposed by the Government, and will be assented to by this committee, with a view to protecting the producers of all kinds of sugar, and it is unfair to say that because the Government place a duty of £ 1 0 on beet-sugar they are doing so in order to specially protect and assist those who manufacture that sugar. would point out that honourable members on the Government side, by the arguments they have been using, might prolong the debate, if the Opposition chose to follow them j because we have had the whole question of free-trade and protection discussed together with other matters in connection with the proposed rebate of 6s.

If neither the canegrower nor the beet-grower is restricted in his operations, both are on the same footing exactly; and that was the position before the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was introduced. Both growers were absolutely unrestricted as to the labour tney employed. But a restriction was placed on the grower of cane, and the Government valued the restriction at not less than £ 2 a ton, while the honourable member for Wide .Bay estimates it at £ 3 . When the Government allow £ 2 a ton to the cane-grower, they are not giving him any concession as against the beet-grower, but are only putting him in the same position as if he used black labour; but by giving this £ 2 to the beet-grower the Government give the latter an advantage to that extent, because he has not been interfered with or restricted in any way with regard to the labour he employs. get the rebate if he uses black labour. not need to use black labour.

When that discussion took place I and others held that south of Mackay white labour could grow sugar, and for that reason I voted for the exclusion of black labour from that part of the State. The Government contended that sugar can be grown by white labour down as far .as New South Wales, but as tliey had to offer some inducement to people to employ white labour in the-extreme north, they decided to give a rebate of £ 2 in the excise. The Government still hold that white labour can be employed there, and it is pretty freely conceded that such labour can produce sugar in the region I have indicated. If the same system is not applied to both classes of growers, the beet-grower will have a protection of £ 3 per ton while the grower of canesugar in North Queensland will have a protection of £ 5 per ton, each using white labour. It seems a perfectly fair thing to say that if, they compete on equal lines in Australia honourable member say that even under those circumstances they compete on the same and in other parts where beet sugar is other things be grown as easily in New SouthI mention this point growers protection to the amount of £ 5 , and of £ 3 , seems to me absolutely unfair; and I shall adhere to the vote I gave on the previous occasion, assuming that the GoQuestion That the amendment be The committee divided.

The proposed rebate of 4s. a ton upon sugar cane grown solely with white labour, and containing 10 per cent, of sugar, is equivalent to a rebate of £ 2 a ton upon the sugar itself, and as the excise upon sugar is to be £ 3 a ton, the grower who employs white labour will still have to pay an excise duty of £ 1 a ton.

But if we do not succeed, I believe that those for whom we speak will not sit down to bewail the action of this Parliament, but will set to work and do their best under the circumstances. That is no reason, however, why we should make their task harder than is necessary. I ask the committee to give f u l l consideration to the matter, and if possible to allow a rebate of 5s. per ton in the interests of Queensland growers particularly, and, in my opinion, in the interests of Australia generally. bane) I have not the slightest intention of contributing to the debate on the amendment at any great length.. The question of using white labour for sugar production has been debated ad nauseam, and I respectfully suggest that we should get to a vote as early as practicable. Beingi n sympathy with the proposal for an additional payment, I had intended to propose that the rebate be Gs. per to n ; but from conversations I have had with other representatives of Queensland, I concur in the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay. would be fatuity.

Honourable members on the other side seem to be imbued with the idea that two-thirds of this rebate is goingto the white sugar-growers in North Queensland. That is a very great fallacy. Of the 4s. which the Government propose to give, not more than a fraction, I suppose, will go to the growers. According to an interview which I read in the Argus this morning, the Treasurer estimates that about 20,000 tons will be grown during the coming season by white labour. Suppose that 30,000 tons are grown by white labour, a rebate of 4s. a ton would mean £60.000 only. The Minister for Trade and Customs has already affirmed the principle that after this month there will be no possibility of its being increased to any great extent. He has said that those desiring to grow cane by white labour only must register this month, and that if they do not they will not be entitled to claim a rebate. t:iey start fresh. sion conveyed to me by the Minister, and I To debate the matter at any length am pleased to hear that he does not adhere to that opinion.

We are sanguine that the inducements we now propose to the establishmenb of the white sugar industry in Australia are sufficient. And under these circumstances we cannot agree to extend them. Experience, however, may show other results. I am inclined to think that experience will show that we proposed all that was desirable.

Sir the honourable member mean by a liberal administration ? that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has considerable power in connection with sugar production, both in respect to the cultivation of land itself and the control over many growers. WhatI for one desire is that the Government should provide the analysts who will analyse the cane and ascertain the amount of sugar contained therein. This will insure the payment of the rebate to the growers. The expense would not amount to a large sum, and if these officers are appointed by the Govern' ment and are under Commonwealth control, they will be entirely free from influence on the part of the Sugar Refining Company or any other concern I think that the honourable member for Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN putting the rebate on the cane itself is that the money shall go to the growers. leader of the Opposition is with me in regard to the proposal. The inspectors and analysts would see that the payment of the money was really made to the growers, and that in this way the will of Parliament was efficiently carried out. I for one should hesitate to pass any legislation of this character were I in doubt that the money of the tax-payers of Australia would go to the people to whom the committee desires it to go. For these reasons I hope that the Government will not be what is called "" penny saving"" in this matter, but will be careful to see that the people whom honourable members desire to receive the money will get it , and that no one else gets it . I also want to draw the attention of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, to some considerations with regard tb his statements in connection with rebate.

236,Mr Fisher,"I admit the statement ofcommittee intended. that the provision in question was made a part of the Tariff. It would have been far better to put the excise at £3 a ton, and then introduce a separate enactment to deal with the rebate to growers of sugar employing white labour. Up to the present I have not heard or seen any very definite and conclusive statement on the part of the Government, as to how the payment of the rebate is to be carried out. The committee has been in a quandary all through to secure what is certainly in its mind-that should reach the growers of sugar-cane who are employing white labour. A considerable amount of doubt exists as to how it will turn out, and as to whether the rebate will reach companies like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and other organizations of the kind, instead of reaching the grower. I hold that if we have, not what the honourable member for Wide Bay calls liberal administration, but what I prefer to call a rigid and just administration, so that the money reaches the real growers of the sugar, we shall accomplish more than by increasing the rebate. Personally, I should prefer to have no excise at all-and port duty for the matter of that; but as has been said before, we agreed in considering a very vital question, that of Kanaka labour, that we would vote for a protective duty on sugar, and would also grant for a certain time a rebate on the excise duty to those who would grow sugar-cane by means of white We did that in order to soften the blow which it was considered would be struck at Queensland by the abolition of black labour. stick to my guns, and vote for duties and rebate in the interest of the Queensland growers, although I say again that it means a considerable sacrifice on the part of Australia generally. rifice is, Australia is prepared to make it, and this committee will be united in wishing to carry it out. not think it is right to introduce a proposal to alter this arrangement, and increase the rate. I am also in doubt as to how this rebate is to be arranged so that it will really reach the grower. If the honourable member for Wide Bay and those who are acting with him would take steps to induce the Government to bring.in some legislation or to take some action which would insure the rebate reaching the growers Mr G. B. Edwards. It is almost a pitythey will do more good than by increasing the amount. Minister for Trade and Customs said a few minutes ago that the Government had dealt liberally with the planters in this connection, but that if it were found that some more generous treatment were required they would give consideration to it later on. The time when the planters are likely to feel the change most is when it is first being initiated Many of this rebate them are now complaining that the rebate has already been wil hheld too long. It is not necessary for me to say that I favour the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and shall give it my support. Vested interests have been created in Queensland under certain conditions, and the Commonwealth in the interests of the people are about to disturb those conditions. It is only right that in doing so the utmost consideration that can be given shall be extended to those who have expended their money and their energy in building up the sugar industry. A good deal has been said about the sacrifice the Commonwealth no imis making. I do not for a moment depreciate that sacrifice; but, at the same time, we must remember the sacrifices other people had to make in consequence of their not having dealt with similar problems in their earlier stages. We should remember the millions of treasure and the thousands of lives that America had to sacrifice in labour. dealing with the coloured labour problem. We ought to think lightly of the sacrifices we are called upon to make in the beginning to free Australia from the possibility So that I am prepared to of tlie dangers that America had to face in the early sixties. W it h the last speaker I think that the committee should have been made acquainted with the arrangements which the Government propose to make for Considerable as the sacthe payment of the rebate. There has been a good deal of anxiety in Queensland to find out how the arrangements for carrying But I do out this system are to be conducted. Tlie excise is being collected, but the rebate will not be payable until July, and, in the meantime, those who are to obtain the rebate have to accommodate themselves to the altered circumstances. Some of them are loyally trying to do so. I hold in my baud letters on this subject from some of my own constituents. My electorate comprises part of the Queensland sugar districts. These electors are full of",44,William Mcmillan Wha T Does Mania 6s Per Cwt
237,Mr Wilkinson (Moreton),"Thecomplaint upon the subject, and say that there is a condition of unrest and uneasiness as to how the business is to be eonducted. They do not know what to do to qualify themselves to receive the bonus. W it h the honourable member for Wide Bay, I believe that whatever decision the committee may come to upon this proposal, the planters of Queensland will do their best to accommodate themselves to the altered circumstances. But I also agree with him that we should make the transition as easy for them as possible. I admit that there should be some excise duty imposed, even if it were to cover only the cost of inspection and administration under this part of the Bill, but I think that 10s. per ton, which will be left if the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay is adopted, will be ample to cover those expenses. I hope that, notwithstanding the Government have declared against the amendment, the committee will carry it . wish to express my entire sympathy with the honourable member for Wide Bay on the question of the administration of these proposals. A t the same time, I express my doubt whether conditions can be enforced by any Government that will bring about the results the honourable member looks for. The companies who have such power in this industry can practically fix the price they will pay for cane. Queensland we shall establish a State refinery. gest that the only solution of the difficulty will be the establishment of a State refinery or the nationalisation of the industry, because I believe that these large companies will be able to regulate the price of cane, and as the price paid for cane is lowered, so will the price paid for labour be lowered. I cannot agree with the honourable member'sproposal to increase the rebate, as I have pledged myself to the Government proposal which goes quite as far as I can go. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I desire to endorse all that has been said as to the desirability ' of the Government making some special provision to secure that this bonus to be given for the cultivation of sugar by white labour shall only go not to the planter but to the workmen engaged in the industry. difficult matter. MrM c DONALD I realise the difficulty as fullyasdpes the right honorable gentleman, but I have risen to put in a word for the unfortunate men who will have to work on the plantations, knowing that in particular districts in Queensland, and other honourable members can bear me out in what I say, 7s. 6d. a week has been offered for white men to work on the plantations, 12s. a week being quite a common wage to offer. I hope that in carrying out these proposals, while getting rid of the Kanaka at the earliest possible moment, as we all desire to do, the Government will see that those who have to work in the cane-fields"" are not brought down to the level of the Kanakas. A good deal has been said about the monopoly of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that at perhaps no distant date we shall have a State sugar refinery in Queensland. I believe that is the only solution of the difficulty. We must not overlook the fact that the world's production of cane-sugar is -very small, and that we are really giving the planters a protective duty to the extent of £ 1 0 a ton, because the only competition we need expect is that of beetsugar, and not of cane-sugar grown outside the Commonwealth. great deal of cane-sugar imported from a majority in Mauritius. MrM c DONALD I admit that it is imported to some extent, but the honourable member knows that the only competition we have any need to fear at the present time is from imported beet, and not from imported cane-sugar. MrM c DONALD I admit that the bonus is the real cause of it. I believe that the Continental nations are very stupid in paying four millions of their people's money to put cheap sugar upon the London market, and to capture the other, outside markets. That, in my opinion, was a very stupid thing to do, but honourable members must not forget that we are now proposing to do exactly the same thing here with reference to beet-sugar. I desire to point out that we are really giving the sugar-planters a protective duty of £ 1 0 per ton, and I hope they will reciprocate the generous treatment being extended to I them by this House by fair treatment",45,William Mcmillan Wha T Does Mania 6s Per Cwt

I fear with other honourable members that there is likely to be some difficulty in securing that, but I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Government that everything will be done on their part to frame regulations which will prevent the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from intercepting the amount of the rebate, and putting it into their pockets, instead of allowing it to go to the planters, and possibly from them on to the workers. bourne) I have a very great deal of sympathy with the honourable member who has moved this amendment, and also with some of the speakers who intend to vote with him on tliis occasion.

StillI will vote with them, seeing that they have turned round, and because I feel that Queensland has been very hardly dealt with in this matter. member for Wide Bay has said that careful and liberal administration is necessary in this connection. The Government have always recognised that one of the difficult problems they have to face is how to secure to the grower the benefit of this rebate, because it is undoubtedly the intention of Parliament that the grower should have the benefit ,of it , and that it should not pass into the hands of the manufacturers and refiners. We have given much care to the consideration of the matter, and have devised something which we think will meet the case. We have decided that the rebate is to be paid to the grower, and also that it is to be paid on the delivery of the cane or beet for manufacture, so that there would not be much time for it to get into the hands of the manufacturer. Our idea is that on the delivery of the cane or beet the sugar contents should be ascertained, and the grower should receive a liebate note, which will be as good as cash for customs purposes. I believe that will effectually do what is required. We recognise that there may be a struggle between the manufacturer and the grower, and that, if we are not careful, what we intend for the benefit of the grower may be diverted into other hands. 'We therefore ask that, whatever Government may have charge of the matter, the House will deal liberally with them by giving them large powers to carry out the proposal. Of course with that they w ill have the increased responsibility of carrying out the intention of Parliament to give this rebate for the benefit of the grower and the grower only. To meet the various devices which we may expect to have to meet for the purpose of defeating the intention of Parliament we ask to be armed with very large authority in this respect. I am disposed to think that the committee, recognising the difficulty, will do what is necessary to enable the Government of the day to effectually deal with the matter. .

326,Mr Macdonald,"PATERSON -Th esugar, except the pure juice of the cane, is more or less refined, and the question that must be determined is what is the degree of refinement. In England, I believe, the duty is paid upon the saccharine contents of the sugar, and varies according to the degree of polarization. I think it would be wise for the Government to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Kennedy, and postpone this matter until they can consult with experts as to what is the proper wording for the conditions which we are now considering. How we are to get over the difficulty of the amount of rebate which the Government should pay to the growers' I do not know. The first thing that we should do is to establish what the duty on sugar shall be, and define the standard of strength. Then the rebate must be paid upon the same lines, according to the contents of the cane. must be clear to honourable members that we are to some extent wasting our time ; because it seems impossible for this committee to define the term ""manufactured sugar."" The Minister, perhaps, will inform us if it is possible to formulate a definition by regulation 1 The operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are very large. A t its refineries in Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Adelaide, and Brisbane, it refines most of the sugar that is used within the Commonwealth. All the sugar that is refined in New South Wales is refined by them. As a result, the value of the by-products, the loss of weight, and the cost of refining, are, in a sense, trade secrets. fair margin in his report. members have sufficient information before them. Therefore we have no basis' upon which to found a definition. I am inclined to think that if we trust the Minister to have a definition formulated, it will be satisfactory to honourable members. We want to provide for the payment of excise and the giving of rebate upon the same scale, but »ve wish the rebate to be given on the cane before it has undergone any process by which its sugar-giving contents may be discovered. In order to secure the benefit of the rebate to the grower, it is highly desirable that upon the delivery of the cane, he shall obtain his rebate note, and that thereupon his interest in it shall cease. 28 M 2 A t ' the sametime, for the safety of the revenue, we must provide that the rebate shall not be in excess of the scale upon which the excise is fixed. MrA . McLEAN A standard could be fixed approximately by getting returns from two or three mills as to what they pay according to analysis, and what is tlie waste in manufacture. sorts of cane. I think we are thoroughly agreed as to what.we want-to give the growers the full benefit of what they are entitled to, and at the same time to reserve to the Government the right to get what they are entitled to. I think if we put in a provision of this sort it will meet the caseAll rebates to be allowed at tbe time of delivery of the cane or beet on the ascertainment in the manner prescribed of the sugar-giving contents. We have had a lot of expert advice, and will look into the matter further, and, if necessaiy, bring it bef ore the committee again. I take it that it is possible to ascertain when certain cane is submitted what are its sugar giving contents. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN W h a t it w ill give when manufactured. bought on that basis. to provide in so many words how I am going to do it on account of the difficulties which are patent to honourable members at this very moment. I wish to have the power of dealing with the matter as it arises. I do not think we can put a hard-and-fast rule in the Act. A matter of this sort I do not think honourable ought to be subject to parliamentary control and supervision, and if we take the power to deal with it by regulation we shall do all that is right, and I shall be very glad if honourable members will let us have that power. We tax on the sugar it gives and we ought to allow on the sugar it gives. We ought to get the necessary information as quickly as possible, so as to let the grower have his rebate and go away happy. only pushing the difficulty further back fullest power to deal with any difficulty. not see that the Minister's proposal differs to any appreciable extent from what is proposed here* Although the Minister",51,George Turner The Honourable Sir G Eorge Turner Tha T Is The Trouble

381,Sir William Mcmillan ( W E N T,"agreed to these items when we were discussing the customs and import duties on tobacco. I believe there were some divisions on the subject, and I do not know that they went altogether in favour of the Opposition contention. I do not think any definite agreement was arrived at, nor, as far as I recollect, was there any compact between the two sides. I have never looked upon this as a question between free-traders and protectionists, and I feel that the excise, as it stands here, is not on a sufficiently high scale in the interests of the revenue. But I do not want, at this stage, as other honourable members may wish to address themselves to the subject, to commit myself to any definite proposal. my honourable friend does not recollect what occurred when this discussion took place. We discussed this matter with regard to tobacco for several days, and there was a distinct feeling in the committee, with which I concurred, that the margin of difference of Is. per lb., which we were proposing, was too great. I recollect saying that I had not been able to satisfy myself that the manufacturers were entitled to that. We agreed then that the margin should be 9d. There was considerable difference of opinion, and grave doubt in my own mind, as to the wisest plan by which to fix the differencewhether it should be by increasing the amount of the excise, by putting something extra upon the leaf, by dividing it between the two, or by reducing the duty of 3s. 6d., which had been proposed, to 3s. 3d. U l t i mately it was decided that the import duty should be reduced to 3s. 3d., leaving the duty upon the manufactured leaf imported at Is. 6d., and the excise at Is., thus making the difference of 9d., which it was the feeling of the committee was sufficient. We practically adopted the margin which had been in operation in New South Wales, and I do hope we are not now going to re-open that question, as I am certain the committee came to that decision after fully considering the matter. The Treasurer has just stated that there was an arrangement made, or an agreement come to, for the time at any rate, that the margin should be 9d.; but he will probably recollect that in speaking upon the subject. I and other honourable members said that that would be quite insufficient. gard to twist. with regard to twist. I asked the right honourable gentleman bo look into the question, and see whether he could not agree to differentiate between strand and plug or flat tobacco. the notice I have given, I move That after the words "" Manufactured, per lb. Is.,"" the following words be inserted:"" Manufactured strand, per l b . Is-, and on and after 12th February, 1902, per Jb= 9d."" "" Strand"" tobacco is the term used in the trade to describe what is generI am afraid ally known as twist tobacco. It was pointed out in previous discussions that the margin then fixed would be a severe blow to the tobacco-twisting industry, and might have the effect of abolishing it altogether. It has not had quite that result so far, but it has had the effect of producing a reduction of wages. The action of the committee in cutting down the margin to 9d. per lb. has had the effect in South Australia of bringing about a reduction of wages equal in the average to about 5s. per week per man. What do they get per lb. 1 piece-work, and, roughly, the average isabout 3^d. per lb. Mr BA TC H ELO R I am speaking of South Australia, where there has been a reduction. The rate of pay there used to be 4d. per lb. all round. The pay now varies according to the number of plugs that go to a pound. In the' case of the lighter tobacco the wages paid are at the rate of 4d. per lb., and, in the case of other tobaccos, at the rate of 3^-d. and 3d. per lb., the average being 3Jd. per lb., as against 4d. per lb. previously paid. The margin in South Australia was previously Is: l ^ d. per lb., and the reduction of the margin to 9d. per lb. has had the effect of reducing the wages from 4d. to 3Jd. per lb., and that applied to the average output of a workman amounts to about 5s. per week. As Ministers know, the men engaged in the industry have not been working f u l l time, and a reduction of wages to the extent of 5s. per week is, under the circumstances, considerable.

392,Mr Batchelor,"States that is not the case. I put it to the Government that one of the strong points in favour of this differentiation is that it is very easy to distinguish between the two classes. It is possible for anyone to distinguish between a piece of twist tobacco and a cake of plug tobacco. The former can be separated readily and the different rolls can be seen at a,glance. That applies to both large and small twists, but no amount of twisting would make an opening in a plug of flat tobacco. It is simply pressed into a solid block, and there is no special run of the leaf in it . If the differentiation in treatment for which I ask is allowed it will prevent the annihilation of the twist tobacco-making industry, while the men engaged in the work will receive an advantage. male tobacco workers are employed in making will be thrown out of employment if the twist tobacco. Plug tobacco requires very concession for which the honourable member little labour. Therefore, the manufacturers asks is not conceded 1 do not favour this proposal very strongly. Indeed, I do not know that any of them favour it . the system would not work very easily. the majority of them hold quite the opposite view. facturer who did not care for this proposal, whether there was anything in the contention, placed before me by another manufacturer, that difficulties with the excise officers would constantly arise in regard to distinguishing between twist and plug tobacco. He replied that it was impossible to imagine any difficulty that could arise. He did not agree with the proposal because he preferred to employ as few men as possible. He thought that the fewer men he employed the better it would be for his business. likelihood of strikesthe few girls and unskilled labourers required would be less likely to demand price of twist tobacco be raised 1 higher wages than would skilled workmen belonging to an organization.

This is not a case in which tobacco. are employed in the manufacture of this tobacco 1 alone the industry employs about 300 men. because strand tobacco is made by hand that the honourable member asks for this concession t could not ask for it on that ground, because it is useless to kick against the employment of machinery. I have explained already that I ask for this concession on other grounds. There is always a certain demand for twist tobacco, but owing to the greater expense involved in its manufacture, as compared with plug tobacco, the margin of 9d. which we allow will knock it out.

I hope the Treasurer will do me the justice of not basing his objection to what I propose on the ground that I ask him to differentiate between machine work and hand work. I never put such a case, though that is partially incidental to the position. WhatI ask the Treasurer to do is to prevent, as much in the interests of consumers as of the workers, the annihilation of the strand tobacco industry. I am afraid that if the Government will not support the amendment I have no chance of carrying it ; but if, as they have always contended, the beginning and the end of their protectionist principles is to provide work and insure the manufacture of articles of a good quality, they should support it .

I am sorry that nothing is to be done to help them. regret that the amendment has not received more sympathy from the Government.

The other day a distinction was made between two kinds of beer, upon the ground that one was more costly to make, and was better when made, than the other. fact that more labour is employed in connection with the manufacture of twist, than in connection with the manufacture of plug tobacco, and that twist tobacco is superior to plug tobacco, because it is not so much adulterated. To make twist tobacco, it is necessary to use the best leaf. The amendment is proposed by a supporter of the Government who advocates a distinction between import duty and excise duty for one reason only, not for the sake of revenue, but for the purpose of encouraging labour within the States; and although it affords a chance to give employment to six times as much labour, yet the only sympathy and support he gets from the Ministry is"" We appreciate your efforts; we think you have made out an admirable case, but we cannot help you."" I listened with very great interest to the explanation of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor. If it were possible to make out a case for twist tobacco he would have done so, but he utterly failed at the outset, when he made the admission through the honourable member for Yarra that the men are paid 4d. a lb. at piece work, and turn, out about 100 lbs. weight of this tobacco per week. He says further I am sorry to hear the that they are suffering a reduction equal to 10 per cent, of their wages; and he asks the committee to allow the manufacturers 75 per cent, rebate in this excise. And then we hear from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, once more, who says he does not speak in the interests of the manufacturer, but in the interests of the poor working man.

A'ery good authority that 40 or 50 is the f u l l number of men exclusively devoted to this Avork, but that there are a large number of men who do this Avork at times, and other work at other times. It all proves the unreliability of such information. A number of honourable members seem to look on Parliament as a sort of charitable institutionAvhich is to be used for the purpose of imposing duties because certain classes happen to benefit by one course or the other which it may adopt. My view of Parliament-it may be a wrong one, and a very cold-blooded one-is that we have nothing to do Avith indiA'iduals at all. 'look after the community as a Avhole. The motion means that the customs or excise duty Avhich is to be imposed with regard to at least 2,000,000 people is to be affected one Avay or the other by the consideration for some 200 men Avho happen to follow an occupation which, it is generally admitted, is becoming obsolete. We all heard of twist tobacco Avhen we Avere children, and it is quite clear, I think, that the desire for it is altogether declining. If the making of twist tobacco is an occupation which is gradually dying out, Ave are simply putting this commodity -on the same footing as exists betAveen the steam-engine and the old-fashioned coach, between the sewing machine and hand-seAvn garments. It means that Ave are appealed to to differentiate from the general principle which we are laying down, because a certain -number of men are going to suffer by the effect it may haA'e upon them. I submit -that Ave ought not to listen to such a suggestion. It may be very unfortunate for the men, but it must be clear to every sensible observer that if 200 men are qualified to make this very superfine tobacco they must a for t i o r i be qualified to make inferior tobaccos. posed for a moment that the men will be completely throAvn out of employment be-cause they have a proficiency in some' more skilful method of manufacturing this article than have some of their fellow Avorkmen.

But there is no evidence before the committee that these men cannot follow the occupation of making up tobacco of other qualities. I submit that the appeal made to us is oneAvhich we should, on broad principles, refuse to entertain, because, as the honourable member for North Sydney has pointed out, if a differential treatment Avere adopted in regard to twist tobacco, it would lead us into all sorts of other discriminating considerations with regard to other qualities of tobacco. I shall heartily support the Government . in their refusal to entertain the application which has been made to them. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney) It is quite a mistake to impose a differential duty on any of these manufactured commodities. If Ave did it in the case of tobacco, Ave should have to do it in the case of many other articles, in the manufacture of which more expensive labour is employed. One assumption runs all through this argument, and it is that twist tobacco is better than plug tobacco. An y honourable member Avho is a smoker must knoAv-that tlie three or four best brands of American tobacco knoAvn to him are plug tobaccos. There is no need for making any difference between tAvist tobacco and plug tobacco, because, although the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, says that plug tobacco is stuffed up with stalks and fillings, the same thing can be done Avith twist tobacco. It can be put inside the leaf and tAvistedi n Avithi t . The only difference between tlie two tobaccos is just a fancy difference in having it twisted. I feel certain that if Ave were to make this difference of 3d. per lb. in favour of twist tobacco, Avithin eighteen months from its imposition there Avould be no such thing as plug tobacco in the land. The difference in duty would And it cannot be supbe quite sufficient to compel every manufacturer in Australia to make up nothing but twist tobacco. It is no part of the policy of this Parliament to enforce the payment of more expensive labour in the preparation of any commodity. If tobacco fit for consumption can be made in plug form, as it is, Avhat policy is it Avhich Avould dictate a differential duty to enforce the making of all tobacco in twist form 1 It would pay the",62,Turner We Have Protection No Matter How We Arrange

I think honourable members may reasonably be startled when they are told that, in the thrashing out of the principles of the Tariff, we agreed that there should be a difference of 9d. in an article valued at 3s. 3d., and that now we are asked to have a difference of about 3s. or more in an article valued at 6s. The difference between the two positions is enormous. There is no reason in it . We are also dealing with luxuries. I understood that one of the principles which should guide us when we have to get revenue is that those things which are undoubtedly luxuries should bear a large proportion of the charges in the way of taxation. The Government might reasonably review the position. From their point of view they are making a Tariff which, I presume, they consider will last for many years. That may not be our point of view, but they want to fix something now which will to a large extent determine prices without those continual changes which are so detrimental to business interests. The Government should therefore propose something in respect of this particular item which will be more reasonable and more in line with their proposals upon other items. my honourable friend the acting leader of the Opposition is hardly treating us fairly. He opens the debate upon these items, but does not take the responsibility of moving anything in connection with them. It would be fairer if he were to make some direct proposal, and let us have an opportunity of discussing it . I am not going to say that in this case, as in the case of tobacco, there was a distinct understanding with regard to the difference between the customs duty and the excise, but I will say that the whole question was taken into consideration, and I believe the committee voted with regard to the cigar duty being fixed in relation to the particular amount of 14,000,000 cigars in 1890 from black-labour excise being imposed, believing that there would be no attempt to change that excise. We fixed upon this amount after a comparison of the various rates prevailing in the States. We found that the difference between the customs duty and the excise in Victoria was 4s. 3d. The difference we now Have we propose is 3s. 3d. In New South Wales, with the reduced excise that that State had, there was also a difference of 4s. 3d. In Queensland the difference was only 2s. In South Australia it was 4s. 7£d. In Western Australia 4s. l^d., and in Tasmania 4s. Our proposal in regard to the ordinary kind of cigars is 3s. 3d., which is certainly not excessive. We find that in New South Wales and Queensland, at the old rate there was practically no manufacture of cigars. In Queensland there was none whatever, and in New South Wales practically none. New South Wales had an excise duty of 2s. 6d., which was brought down to 9d. The difference of only 2s. in Queensland absolutely killed, the industry. New South Wales now has a large number of cigarmakers working in Sydney. They have been brought out from Germany, and cigars are now being made in that State to a much larger extent than they were before. I do not propose to go into all the details, because we had them explained when we were dealing with the customs duties. I have no hesita tion in saying that the duties of customs were fixed having in view that the duties of excise which the committee would agree to would be those we now propose. in the Tariff which evoked a keener debate or that was discussed at greater length than this item of cigars, and, as the Treasurer I think that states, there was practically an agreement amongst honourable members that the excise should bear the relation to the customs duties that is now proposed by the Government. Under the old rate although Victoria, with a 4s. 3d. margin, manufactured about two out of every five cigars consumed, the State of New South Wales, with the margin that there prevailed, only manufactured about one forty-fifth part of the cigars consumed. We have provided in this Tariff that when Queensland planters employ white labour in the manufacture of their sugar they shall receive special treatment.

I believe the Government see some difficulty in deciding whether cigarettes have been made by machine or by hand, but as they will be made under Government supervision there should be no difficulty in are hand-made should be so marked. I point out that in one factory alone in Viccoria there are 300 persons employed in making cigarettes by hand, and the wages paid by one firm here amounts to £10,000 a year. That is a matter which deserves consideration by the committee. The details of the matter have practically been discussed in connection with the amendment moved upon the excise upon twist tobacco, and I shall therefore not weary the committee by a long speech in support of it . circumstances could I agree to the amendment, which would mean a considerable loss of revenue. The honourable member might have put the proposal in another form-to increase the excise duty upon machine-made cigarettes to 3s. There would have been more sense in that proposal. Honourable members know the position we have taken up with regard to hand-made and machinemade tobacco, and I fail to see how we could justify what might be called penalizing the latest improved machinery.

494,Sir George Turner,"Unde r noc oppose the amendment in whatever form it is proposed.' Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) -It is a remarkable circumstance that the difference between the excise and customs duties in the case of tobacco and cigarettes should be so great. The difference in the case of tobacco is 9d in favour, of the locally-manufactured article, and the difference in the case of cigarettes amounts to 3s in favour of the locally-manufactured article. Sir makers have to use imported tobacco, while the tobacco manufacturers may use locally grown leaf or mix it with imported leaf, and that makes a considerable difference. account for the difference to which my attention has been drawn. It seems to me, however, that some proposition in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne ought to be favourably considered. I am informed on the authority of a circular distributed by the hand-made cigarette manufacturers that the difference in the cost of production between hand-made cigarettes and machine-made cigarettes amounts to Is. 3d. per lb. That would sustain the contention that machine made cigarettes should bear a heavier excise duty. sooner or later machine-made cigarettes will altogether displace hand-made cigarettes. Sir JOHN QUICK would have been better if the honourable member for Melbourne had moved that the excise duty upon machine-made cigarettes be increased rather than that the excise on hand-made be reduced. The right honourable the Treasurer suggested that there were some difficulties in the way of differentiating between hand-made and machine-made cigarettes, but I find that there is a precedent in favour of such a differentiation. In the New Zealand Tariff there is an excise duty of 2s. 6d. per lb. imposed upon cigarettes made by machinery, while handmade cigarettes carry an excise duty of only Is. per lb. There the principle of differentiation is recognised and given effect to, and there should be no objection to the recognition of the same principle in this country. The foundation of the distinction made is that hand-made cigarettes bear an additional cost of Is.. 3d. per lb. for production. Why should an article which costs an increased price of Is. 3d. per lb. to produce be taxed at the same rate as an article involving a lower cost of -production 1 body doubted whether humour had departed entirely from our parliamentary proceedings he might well be instructed by listening to this debate. I never heard of rational men. The honourable member for Bendigo must be talking with his tongue in his cheek when he advocates such a proposal. Because an old-fashioned method of manufacturing a particular article is still carried on by some antedeluvian manufacturers, Parliament is to deliberately encourage them by giving them something equivalent to the difference in the cost of production. It means that if one manufacturer chooses to adopt modern machinery to turn out an article for the public welfare at a much less cost than that at which it has hitherto been turned out by obsolete machinery, the owner of the obsolete machinery may ask Parliament to differentiate between the article made by the obsolete machinery and that made by the modern machinery. There is no difference in this case, because here the machine is the human hand in the one case, It only shows that anda piece of mechanism on the other. I have too much respect for the mental powers of the honourable member for Melbourne to believe that he makes this proposal seriously, I submit that it and I cannot believe that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is serious in supporting it . To give a better illustration of what this proposal means I take the case of ready-made cotton goods which are imported Very largely into New South Wales, though not so largely into Victoria. We know that, to this day certain people prefer hand-made cotton goods and we might just as well be. asked to differentiate between manufactured cotton goods made up by a sewing machine and the same class of goods made by hand. the honourable and learned member get his clothes made 1 I am sure he takes care to stick to the old-fashioned way. provided that things are equal in their general results, I go where I get them cheapest.",66,Mceacharn Melare A Curse To The Community However

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -^I have done my best to protect the interests of the hand-made cigarette makers, and having failed, I shall certainly support an increase in the excise I believe that the result of the Tariff as it stands will be the extinction of the hand-made cigarette industry, and that the manufacture of these articles will become a thing-of the post.. The difference between the customs duty and the excise is too much. In the year 1900 there were 258,196 lbs. of cigarettes mode in ""Victoria, and that, with a difference of 3s., represents £38,729 in favour of the manufacturers, the wjiole of these cigarettes being consumed in Australia. The inevitable result of the Government proposal, will be to wipe out the hand-mode cigarette makers. cigarette manufacturers have issued a circular, stating that, they are now selling their cigarettes at a loss, and, assuming their contention to be correct, their extinction is a matter of absolute certainty. I fail to see why the machine-wade cigarette manufacturers should have the advantage of 3s. per lb., when, according to the returns, they had a benefit to the extent of £38,279 in the year 1900. The Treasurer suggested that the difference was justified by the fact that manufacturers hod to buy imported leaf. But the import duty on cigarettes, according to the Tariff, amounts. to 6s. 6d.; the import duty on leaf to Is. 6d., and the excise to 2s., so that the difference of 3s. exists after accounting for the import duty on the leaf and the excise. which has been afforded from different parts of the Chamber ought to have its effect on the Treasurer; and one of the most ardent supporters of the Government, in the person of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, supports an increase in the excise. If the amendment be not agreed to it will mean a loss of revenue, and an increase in the overgrown profits of a very large company, to the extent of £25,000 per annum, The revenue is coming i u beyond expectation, but this is an item to which we should look for returns in order to remit imposts on the necessaries of life. In New South Walesi n 1900 there were 350,000 lbs. of cigarettes manufactured, and the import duty amounted to £21,000, while the revenue from the locally-made cigarettes, inclusive"" of the tax on leaf, was £61,800, or a total of £83,800. In Victoriai n the same yeor, 240,000 lbs. of material was made up, and the income from imports was £5,600, while the revenue from the' locally-made article, inclusive of the tax on the leaf, was £30,000, or a total of £35,600. By increasing the excise by Is., as moved, the Treasurer will have at his command a large revenue easily obtained, and be able to remove some of the imposts on necessaries. worth) I only desire to say a word, in reiteration to a certain extent, in order to prove the very serious position the Treasurer wil l have to face in the future. Many of the articles on which we have excise, or on which. we may have excise, will be increasing year by year, while the imported articles will be decreasing year by year. If we are to have an elastic revenue we must, be very careful not to starve it on particular items, the production of which may be increasing, by putting higher duties on those which are decreasing. shall have to increase the excise. there were imported 251,000 lbs. of cigarettes, but we manufactured 623,000 lbs. I believe that these figures are short of the reality, and that probably 800,000 lbs. of cigarettes were manufactured in Australia. Here we have a rapidly diminishing quantity of imports, and a rapidly-increasing quantity of colonial manufacture. We ore simply throwing away revenue, and the Treasurer ought, 'as a matter of finance, to accept the proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, because, I take it , the Treasurer is making aTariff not for one year, but for several years. cigarettes which are made by machinery, and which employ very little labour, we have given a large amount of protection, by means of a small excise.

If the 'hand-made cigarette industry is extinguished, then I we shall not deal with them to-morrow. shall be prepared to go with the Government or any honourable member, in increasing the excise on machine-made cigarettes, and I believe such a proposal would be received by the committee with practical unanimity. Sir then be a difference of 2s. at least. would not give, merely for the sake of the company which practically controls the market. I shall be prepared to increase the excise still further if the hand-made cigarette industry is wiped out, but I cannot consent' to k ill that branch of the trade by increasing the excise right away. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I intend to vote for an increase in the excise, because I am thoroughly satisfied that the smoking of cigarettes is detrimental to the intelligence of Australians, who, 1 notice, now are beginning to look sickly,,pale, and intellectually destitute. If we could have hand labour, I should give this industry any amount of protection, but as protection now would only increase gigantic monopolies, I shall vote: for the amendment. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). I venture to think that an excise of 3s. per lb. is not enough. Terrific profits are made in this particular industry, and to have the excise so low is simply giving away revenue, while we refuse the remission of taxation on the necessaries of life. Cigarettes are a luxury which some contend is positive damnation to our young people, and yet an excise is proposed, which simply means immense profits to one or two manufacturing companies.' I am' very much inclined to move that the excise be 4s; Sir WILLIAM use; such an amendment would not be carried. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. pose to go on with Division VIA .
