I hope that these are the last significant changes to am talking about medical expenditure. AllI am the national health scheme for many years. I say arguing is that people should rationally look at that for two reasons. One is that people are conthe proposition. The majority of people in fused with the changes introduced in the last four Australia take out unnecessary insurance cover. I years by both governments. The second is that am sure that it applies to other types of insurance the new arrangements, to my way of thinking, also, but I am not speaking today on other inmeet the criteria of what Australians want in a surance. If the honourable member for Hotham national health scheme. I will detail the criteria. is an insurance salesman, good luck to him. The first criterion is that any scheme be simple There is a $ 100 excess payment on car insurance and understandable, and the scheme which is claims. Honourable members opposite are sugcoming in is certainly an improvement on the gesting that people ought to be taking out inone it is replacing with regard to simplicity and surance at a cost of $200-plus a year in order to being understood, but because of the confusion get a very, very small return. On top of all that, in in the general public's mind with all the changes the case of persons like ourselves who are relait is most important that the Government has an tively well off, the actual expenditure on medical educational advertising scheme so that people service becomes a tax deduction and the Governare aware of what the new scheme is, what they ment subsidises it by another 33V4 per cent. Howmay have to do, what their rights are and so on. I ever, payments to the health insurance industry know that the Government has embarked on are not tax deductible. So it becomes even more this. unnecessary, unprofitable and more irrational The second criterion is that it continues the for people to take out medical insurance cover. universality of the national health scheme. There May I finish on one final point. If people beis the 40 per cent universal rebate with the $20 have rationally, as I would advise them to do, gap as the maximum payment, free hospital acand if the young people and the people who do commodation in standard wards and the 75 per not have chronic conditions pull out of the medicent and 85 per cent billing arrangements.

Paragraph (2) of the wrong-w e certainly feel strongly on this issueamendment refers to bulk billing for eligible that the private funds should become the paying pensioners at 85 per cent of the common fee in authority. This gives them access to the details of full payment.

So that the position ' fund. They wUl be able to advertise selectively to would not be misunderstood, we included that non-contributors-the people who are registered point in the amendment also.
