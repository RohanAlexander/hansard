0,"The Assurance Of An Honourable Member On Such Matters As This. Have Very Much Pleasure In Accepting The . Assurance Of The Honourable Member For Batman That He Does Not Applaud The Sentiments Of The Honourable Member For Bourke In That Respect. Drawn Is The Statement That I Applauded The Stealing Of Public Documents. Statement To Have Been Withdrawn. Issue Now Before The House Was Put At Great Length By The Honourable Member For Fawkner ( Mr Maxwell) In An Endeavour To Justify A Letter He Wrote To The Press, And At The Same Time To Justify The Vote He Is About To Give. All I Wish To Say In Reply To The Honourable Member For Fawkner Is That I Hope That I Shall Never Be In A Position Which Would Require Me To Turn Myself Inside Out, As He Has Had To Do In Trying To Justify Both His Letter And His Vote. I T Is For The House Now To Decide Whether There Was Any Real Sub","version of the course of justice as a result of the Government's action. The Government had decided, after the most complete inquiry, to launch a prosecution against Mr John Brown on a charge of having instituted a lockout. As the Attorney General has pointed out, there was much difference of opinion among counsel as to whether a verdict would be given in favour of the Government. did not say that there was any difference of opinion among counsel. He did say so. He said that the case was, in the opinion of counsel, weak in some respects, and that there was great doubt as to whether the "" charge against John Brown, could be sustained in the courts of the country. Nevertheless, a prosecution had been launched, and the Government was going through with it. Then the Government was approached, not by the owners, but by the representatives of the miners, and asked to take steps to have a conference of the parties called. The miners' representatives brought with them their accountant, Miller, whom they had put forward as a man who knew all the intricate and intimate details of the I mining industry, a man upon whom they are relying almost exclusively for his knowledge regarding deductions, and the profits of the collieries. They came to the Prime Minister of their own volition and informed him that, in their belief, they had a solution of the difficulty. They believed that they had a plan which would be acceptable to the owners if only they could meet them-in conference. It was necessary for the Prime Minister to make a decision in view of the urgent need for bringing about a settlement of the trouble, which was causing such great loss and distress, not only to the miners and their families on the coalfields, but to workers and their families in other areas also, including the constituency of the honourable member for Lang( Mr Long), my own constituency, and those of practically all the other honourable members in this House. The Prime Minister had before him the pressing need of getting the mines open again, thus providing employment for 12,000 miners who were out of work. Of course, the members of the Opposition had no responsibility in a matter of this kind. Their duty, judging by the attitude of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is to make reflections and imputations against the Government, and generally to criticize it. The Prime Minister, however, had a grave responsibility to bear. He had to decide whether he would go on with the prosecution, thus declining to consider the miners' proposal for settlement, or whether he would take such steps as were necessary to ensure the holding of the conference. The honourable member for Fawkner said that he would never have considered for one moment any proposal to re-open the mines on the condition of dropping the prosecution. He would have insisted upon John Brown being prosecuted. He said that he would not have agreed to the holding of a conference on the conditions stipulated, but would have gone straight forward, allowing nothing to deflect him from his determination to prosecute, notwithstanding the misery and suffering that was taking place. The Prime Minister conferred with the Attorney' General) and after they had discussed the",21,Setup

After all, what would the prosecution have meant? John Brown would have carried the matter to the Privy Council, the proceedings would have been protracted to an inordinate length, and in the end the most that could have been done to him would have been to fine him Â£1,000. That would have gone nowhere towards opening the mines. ber is undermining the case made out by the Attorney-General. am not. There have been persistent rumours of a disagreement between the Prime Minister and the Attorney General over this question. Both the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister have denied that there was any disagreement. Therefore, I am justified in saying that the statements, which are still appearing in certain newspapers to the effect that the disagreement took place opportunity at that stage to enter a proare simply a tissue of lies. Eor the reasons which I have outlined, the Prime Minister arrived at a certain decision, and contrary to the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr would insist upon the prosecution, or Maxwell), I believe that the great majority of the people of this country realize ference. that he decided rightly. able member know that? have more right to assert that than the honourable member has to assert the contrary. AndI may add that I have more and better opportunities of judging public opinion than has the honourable member. should be misunderstood in making that statement, let me hasten to say that I have not in mind anything relating to the honourable member's affliction. I refer only to the methods by which honourable members acquaint themselves of the nature of public feeling on such subjects. I maintain that the great majority of the people of Australia are of the opinion that the Government did the right thing in regard to this prosecution. Let me refer to the printed proceedings of the . coal conference. I have here the report of proceedings for Monday, the 8th April, in which the Prime Minister sets out quite clearly the reasons which actuated him in withdrawing the prosecution. When those reasons were placed before the conference no objection was offered by the representatives of the miners to the withdrawal of the prosecution against John Brown. opportunity. There was plenty of opportunity as the official report of the proceedings shows. After the Prime Minister's statement, the following discussion occurredsuggestion with the owners' representatives. order to discuss the proposal with my colleagues. Tins CHAIRMAN -Shal l wo, therefore, resume at 4 o'clock? Sitting suspended from S.SO to Jf p.m. It is clear that the miners had ample test against the withdrawal of the prosecution had they desired to do so. During the half-hour adjournment they could have made up their minds whether they whether they would proceed with the conSitting suspended from 12.1f5 to 2.15 p.m. I representatives of the miners had ample time during the 30-minute interval to determine whether they should raise any objection to the withdrawal of the prosecution against Brown. They raised no such objection. On reI n case I turning to the conference they made no reference to the withdrawal of the prosecution; they merely stated that it should state the case for the owners, and that Mr Rees should do the same on . behalf of the miners. At that time the prosecution against Brown had not actually been withdrawn, so that the representatives of the miners were afforded the opportunity to raise any objection against its withdrawal, if they so desired. The report of the conference indicates that the whole of the second day was occupied by the speeches of McDonald",21,Setup

18,Had Been Arranged That Mr Mcdonald,"and Eees. Further, and I wish to emphasize this, the report of the proceedings states that only four transcripts of what had taken place on the final day of the conference were in existence, and that these had heen supplied to the leading members of the delegation on each side. Therefore, on the second day the miners' representatives had a copy of the verbatim report of the proceedings, and of what the Prime Minister said when he intimated that the prosecution against Brown would be withdrawn. The conference lasted for several days, and not a word was heard during its course against the withdrawal of the prosecution or the a ttitude of the Government. It is evident that the leaders of the industrial section of the Labour movement endorsed the action of the Government, in contradistinction to the attitude later adopted by the political section of that movement. It is apparent that the industrial section regarded that conference as likely to be of much greater importauce in affording a solution of the trouble in the industry than a mere prosecution of Brown. Further, I do not think that that section had the faintest idea of making any political capital out of the action of the Government in withdrawing the prosecution. It was only when the political section of the movement got to work that anything was said about the Government's action, and this attack is merely a part of the political programme which the Opposition thinks it should follow. Everybody must admit that the Government, by its action, left itself open to the criticism that has been heard in this chamber yesterday and to-day; but all fair-minded individuals must realize that the Prime Minister and the Attorney General were actuated by the highest of motives, and took what they considered to be the right course in the interests, not of their party, but of the nation. I am confident that, upon mature reflection, that will be the general opinion of the man in the street. From a merely tactical point of view, it may have suited the Nationalist party to prosecute Brown; that might have been a good political move. But the Prime Minister and his colleague were not moved by party political considerations. members opposite believe that it is imperative that John Brown should be prosecuted for creating a lockout, I remind them there is no obstacle in the way of proceedings being taken against him by either the unions or themselves. It is mere political hypocrisy to abuse the Government for the course they followed, when it is competent for those who abuse to take the very action which they claim should have been taken by the Government. I challenge honourable members opposite, if they are sincere and feel strongly upon the subject, to take that action. There is another point. The prosecution was launched against John Brown because he owned the Pelaw Main and Richmond Main collieries, which are considered to be the two collieries that are obviously paying their way. If the Government was insincere in its attitude, why did it institute proceedings against the owner of those two collieries, and not against tbe owners of some 'of the remaining 63 in New South Wales, which are now inoperative? They selected those two in preference to dozens of other cases where it could be established, in a few minutes, that they were not paying their way on the rates in existence when the stoppage took place. To the impartial student of affairs it is evident that the Government acted in a bona fide manner, with but one idea in view-the welfare of the whole of the people, irrespective of political consequences. And that is what a government should do. This country needs such men-me n of courage, who will do something .in the interests of the nation, and not always be seeking avenues through which they may disseminate their party propaganda. I repeat .that the Government, in doing what it did, even though it ran the risk of criticism by friend and opponent alike, took the right course. During the course of this debate we have heard a good deal about justice having been subverted. It has occurred to me that justice is usually delineated as a woman, with a bandage over her' eyes, holding a pair of evenly balanced scales, symbolizing the idea that justice is impartial. If a statue of justice were If honourable enthroned in this chamber and could hear the statements that have been made in this matter, hilarity would assuredly be its principal attribute. astounding statements, allegedly in the cause of justice, have been uttered during the debate. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) was the author of some. His speeches generally are "" as a tale that is told ""; one hears them, knows that the honourable member has been speaking, but when he has finished can recall nothing of importance in what has been said. The honourable member never says anything that is worthy of repetition. One may peruse Hansard after Hansard, but rarely will one find that succeeding speakers have made any reference to the utterances of the honourable member. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) said that justice should be done, though the heavens fall. Much the same statement emanated from the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr tion and Mr Holloway in that respect Curtin). consider in what way honourable members opposite are assisting the course of justice. In what way did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Theodore) assist the ends of justice, when he addressed the timber workers in the basement of the town hall and incited his listeners to continue to break the law? what way did the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Scullin) assist the course of justice, when he told the timber Workers that if they considered that their award was an outrageous and calamitous one they were not entitled to observe it ? That was the considered advice given to the workers by the leaders of honourable members opposite. Yet in this chamber they talk about justice having been subverted, by the withdrawal of a prosecution which could only be punitive in its effects, and which would have no value in effecting that which the community desires, the re-opening of the coal-mines. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin) spoke about the law being like a spider's web, catching only the small flies, and allowing the big ones to break through. I venture the opinion that many an honourable member immediately visualized the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as one of the big flies which tear their way through tbe legal entanglements that surround them, for the honourable member has got through the web, scot Mr Archdale Parkhill. free. It appears to me that the only party which is to-day standing for the Some most principle of unprejudiced administration and dispensation of justice is the Nationalist party. Honourable members opposite prate about the withdrawal of the prosecution against John Brown and of the prosecution of unionists. What did the prosecution of the timber workers amount to ? A law providing for penalties, which had been in force since 1904, was put into operation. Labour Governments were in power more than once after the passing of the act providing for such penalties, but they did not alter the penalties. This Government merely put the law into effect and the timber workers' organization was fined Â£1,000, and Mr Holloway Â£50. Neither party has paid the fines, and after all, that is the important point to consider in this connection. The Timber Workers AssociaI ask honourable members to are as well off as Mr John Brown, against whom a prosecution was withdrawn, so that all this talk of discrimination against miners and other unionists is so much "" guff,"" indulged in for assimilation by the supporters of the Labour party. I remind honourable members that last In session we spent a considerable time i r discussing the proposal of the Government to make provision in the Arbitration Act for the imposition of certain penalties, one of which related to disrespectful references to any member of the judiciary. The act was also amended to make provision for the taking of a secret , ballot among members of trade unions. What course did the trade unionists of this country adopt to show their contempt for its laws? They deliberately burnt publicly a number of ballot-papers, and with equal deliberation carried through the streets of. the principal city of the Commonwealth an effigy of the judge who had made an award governing hours and conditions in the timber industry, and subsequently burnt it in Hyde Park, the principal and most historic park in Sydney. Proceedings were not instituted against those men by the New South Wales State Government, upon whom the responsibility rested. Yet, my friends who sit opposite allege that discrimination is exercised against trade unionists and that favour is shown to the moneyed classes. [ contend that those who were guilty of the actions to which I have referred should have been proceeded against. If a judge who makes an award in one of our courts is to be traduced and abused in the fashion that Judge Lukin has been traduced and abused from one end of the land to the other, by legislators, agitators, and other classes of persons, our James) will assure honourable members, system of justice will be destroyed, because eventually the only men who will agree to occupy those positions will be those who are either prepared to put up with that sort of thing or are willing to give decisions that will be viewed favourably by unworthy sections of the community. In those circumstances justice will be dispensed as it is in the courts of asked what he thought of the position, the western States of the United States of America, and will be a byword to Â» everybody. undermine justice in this country than have honourable members of the Opposition in this chamber, led by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and supported by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley). They and others are far more culpable than the dupes whom they attempt to lead. They should have been proceeded against, instead of Mr Holloway and the Timber Workers Union. They are the big flies that burst through the web. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr of consequences to settle the trouble, but Ourtin) asked what had the Government done. He said that one conference had been called, but that it had proved abortive. The only persons who have done, or who have attempted to do anything to settle the coal trouble are the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), the Premier of New South Wales( Mr Bavin), and other Nationalists. been very successful. could they have been, in view of the action taken by the honourable member and his friends at the Town Hall, Sydney, and elsewhere, when the men were incited not to return to work? I repeat that the only persons who have attempted to settle this trouble are those who sit on this side of the House. The Leader of the Opposition paid a visit to Newcastle, and everybody thought that his object was to endeavour to settle the trouble. The Sydney Labor Daily, however, told a different story. It said, "" This visit will be a further move of the most important character in the alignment of the political and industrial wings of the Labour movement."" While, as the honourable member for Hunter( Mr women and children were starving all round him, the Leader of the Opposition was merely attempting to adjust certain political differences that existed between two contending and conflicting sections of his own party, over some petty, piffling, local matter. When he returned, the honourable gentleman was and replied that the only contribution he could make to the settlement of the None have done more to trouble was that a heavy bounty should be given on the export of coal; that the miners should continue to receive high wages and the owners large profits, and that the general public should continue to pay for their coal the high price they had been charged for years. That suggestion may have commended itself to the contending parties, but it certainly would not have the approval of the public as a whole. I have shown that not only have the Government done their best, irrespective also that in their administration of the law they have treated with the utmost consideration the trade unionists of this country. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who at the last election was returned to this Parliament as a Nationalist, delivered yesterday a speech that was received with the wildest enthusiasm by our friends who sit opposite. Probablyi t was in their opinion the best contribution to the opposition side of the debate to which they had listened. During the course of his speech, the right honourable gentleman said that the withdrawal of the prosecution was unprecedented, and that the explanation of the Prime Minister had shown a most extraordinary and inordinate incapacity. He went on to say that for ten years he had been Attorney General of the Commonwealth, and that nothing of this character had occurred",22,Setup

He is entitled to put his case in his own way, and it is for him to decide what matter he shall place before the House. merely intended to place before the House, for its calm and dispassionate consideration and judgment, certain views expressed by the late. Mr Justice Higgins, the first President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I shall refer to another incident that is more or less in the minds of honourable members, in connection with an increase in the hewing rate that was given to the miners, and an increase in the selling price of coal that was given to the owners in 1917, at a time when the right honourable member for North Sydney was in charge of the affairs of this country. Honourable members interjecting orable members to desist immediately. If they do not do so I shall be obliged to miners and the mine-owners to be granted name them. It is almost impossible to hear the honourable member who is addressing the Chair. The right honourable member for North Sydney said last night that there might be some parallel between this action of the Government and that which was taken in the Campbell prosecution in Great Britain, but there had been no parallel to it during the. ten years that he was Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. I shall now give the views of Mr Justice Higgins upon the manner in which the Arbitration Act was administered, even manipulated, during the period that the right honourable member was Prime Minister of Australia. In "" A New Province for Law and Order"" published by Mr Justice Higgins, he saidI n 1917, Mr Hughes, us Prime Minister, secured a regulation under the War Precautions Act to enable him to cancel registration of the Waterside Union then on strike. He then caused an application to be made to the President of the Federal Court for a rule nisi for the Waterside Union to show cause why its registration should not be cancelled. This seemed to me "" Y o u must cancel, for if you do not cancel I shall cancel myself "". Sucli attitude recalls the efforts of the Tudor and Stuart sovereigns to interfere w it h judges in the execution of their duty. It turned out that the Prime Minister thought that, by cancellation of the union's registration, he destroyed the award also. This was a mistake. The court discharged the rule on the grounds that the powers were not to be used as an instrument of fruitless vengeance, &c. I A further extract from the same work readsThe court refused to proceed-with the arbitration in the coal dispute at the end of October, 1910, until the men resumed the former hours. The matter was complicated . . . . by an extraordinary antipathy to the Prime But first, Minister, Mr Hughes. The Prime Minister held a series of conferences, in which he found that the miners were firm in their refusal to work unless they got eight hours from bank to bank, and the employers insisted that if this concession wore granted, they would have to raise the price of coal. Tho Prime Minister asked the President of the Court to deal with the case under a recent War Precautions Act (of doubtful v a l i d it y ), and, as incidental to the concession as to hours, to find what additional price the mine-owners might charge for coal. All such proceedings were outside my special functions. I stipulated that my hands must be free either to grant or to refuse the eight hours as should seem just. The Prime Minister then caused the claims of the without evidence and without argument as to eight hours, the union undertaking that there should be no further stoppage during the war. The consequences were disastrous. The union failed in its undertaking; there wenfrequent local stoppages; and in 1917 the men struck in sympathy with the railway employees. I also wish to quote one reason adduced by the late Mr Justice Higgins for resigning his position as President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In announcing his resignation on the 25th October, 1920, he saidThe chairman of the recent coal tribunal spoke sense when he said: "" It is clearly an impossible situation if you should come before",25,Setup

I do not wish to comment upon that statement; but I remind honourable members that the late Mr Justice Higgins refused to carry out the instructions of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), then Prime Minister, to give the minersthese favoured sons of fortune who have always done well in the industry at the expense of the public-increase d wages, and the owners the right to increase their prices. When the late Mr Justice Higgins refused to accede to the ex-Prime Minister's demand, Mr Justice Edmunds was brought from New South Wales, and he did what the right honourable gentleman desired without hearing a vestige of evidence one way or the other. truth in that. am quoting from records, the accuracy of which cannot be impugned. Let us compare the action of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), and the Attorney-General( Mr Latham), on this occasion, with that of the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). Their only object was to bring about peace in industry, and to insure the opening of the coal mines, whereas, on the other hand, the right honourable member for North Sydney interfered with an award of the Arbitration Court. In these circumstances the right honourable member for North Sydney had no right to attack the Government as he did last night, or to make the allegations he did against the Prime Minister and his Ministers. right honourable member for North Sydney was during the war period. That is its only justification; but, even then, his action was not right. Other increases were given by him to those employed in the coal industry; but with these I shall not deal, as tbey are not cognate to the motion. It has already been shown by honourable members on this side of the the nation. I am firmly of the opinion that a great majority of the people of Australia are prepared to support the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General in the action they have taken, and to place their integrity against that of any of their detractors in the public life of Australia. [2.49] -Having suffered by being compelled to listen, and to listen in silence, to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill), one can but come to the conclusion that the speech just delivered by him was after all such as might have been expected from such a quarter. The honourable member, as a good party hack, dared not speak other than he has to-day. the Nationalist Consultative Council. We may dismiss practically everything he has said as being of very little value, and I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), who said that the longer the honourable member for Warringah spoke, the more he undermined the case put by the Attorney General( Mr Latham). The case was a very weak one, and the honourable member left it even worse than it was when he found it. A portion of his address was directed to a criticism of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). If the honourable member had to meet either of these two honourable members in open debate in the public arena, he would cut a very sorry figure; but to-day he attacked them under the protection of the Standing Orders, secure in the knowledge that, as both had spoken during this debate, they could not reply to him. He attacked not only honourable members on this side of the chamber, but the actions and utterances of certain honourable members on the ministerial side who dare to be other than party hacks.

The honourable member criticized the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) freely expressed his opinions in condemnation of the action of the Government in connection with the prosecution of Mr John Brown. The honourable member occupied a good deal of time in quoting from a certain document which was placed in his hands by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), who evidently is not prepared to use it himself. He proceeded to point out that the course followed by the Prime Minister in this instance was also adopfed by the right honourable member for North Sydney in 1916, in order to ensure the re-opening of the coalhonorable member for Batman is not mines, which according to the honourable member was a very reprehensible act. I remind the honourable member that the action taken by the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was during the war period, and that it had the effect of causing the mines to be re-opened. Apparently, the course he then pursued had the approval of the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) at the time, because, shortly after that, we read in the press that he had waived his right to stand for the North Sydney seat in favour of Mr Hughes. more than that. connection with compensation and other matters, which I shall not discuss at this juncture.

Listening to the first part of the speech of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), a newcomer would have been disposed to say that at all events, there was one honourable, member opposite who was prepared to break away from the Government, and to stand by the opinions he had previously expressed. That honourable gentleman, however, could not deceive any of us who have been in Parliament for any length of time. I have been a member of this Parliament for something like twenty years been a member of this Parliament suffibecause he ciently long to know the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell). His remarks did not deceive me, although they may have deceived some honourable members who are new to the chamber, and had not the opportunity to hear the honourable gentleman in the Ministerial party room.

He wrote a letter to the Argus condemning the Government's action, and he has stated to-day that he stands by every word in that communication. that so long as the motive is good itmatters not how serious a crime or grave a blunder is committed. bonorable member wrote to the Argus that the Government made a very grave mistake when it withdrew the prosecution -of Mr John Brown, and that nothing -could be more serious than the weakening of public confidence in the administration ber ia completely misrepresenting what of the law. On iiis own testimony no J said. motive, however worthy, would warrant such an offence. The honourable gentleman has told us that when he wrote to the Argus he did not know the motive which had actuated the Prime Minister. That motive, as the Prime Minister explained, was to facilitate the opening of the mines. The honourable member, in his letter to the Argus, saidIn view of the foregoing, the announcement of the Prime Minister reported yesterday that in order to promote peace in the coal industry proceedings against John Brown had been withdrawn, comes as a painful shock, I have no hesitation in saying, to every supporter of the Ministry. Clearly the honourable member was aware of the Prime Minister's motive when he wrote that letter. ing that the honourable member did not ^ understand the Prime Minister's motive, his attitude is no less remarkable. He has condemned the Government for having committed a capital political offence, and, having led the leader of the Government to the gallows and confronted him with the hangman, he suddenly remembers to ask the motive He attended with a of the crime. In effect, he says to the convicted murderer, "" What was your motive in sand-bagging the man in the street?"" Having received an assurance that the motive was a worthy one, that the sand-bagging was intended for the victim's own good, the honourable member says, "" Y o u are reprieved; step down."" TheI f tactics of this sort are acceptable'to the electors of Fawkner, they deserve to have their present representative for ever. But I have a higher opinion of their intelligence, and I am convinced that the honourable member will not be allowed to back and fill in this fashion much longer. A few days ago he received a deputation upon another matter, and, imitating the American politician who said that "" Those are my views; but if you do not like them. I will change them,"" the honourable member said, "" I have told you my views for the present; but if anything else happens later, I shall call you together again.""",28,Setup

If he is being misrepresented he may make a persona] explanation later. the honourable member to the judgment of his constituents. We await with interest the statement of their attitude by the honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for Wannon, who placed their opinions on record some months agoa most dangerous thing to do before a party meeting is held, as the honourable member for Eawkner will admit. The honourable member for Angas saidBut this I will say: If it is true that thero nately, the proposals miscarried. The is a lockout iii the industry, the Government should prosecute the offenders with the utmost rigour of tlie law. I invite him to tell the House whether he considers that the Government has prosecuted the mine-owners with the utmost rigour of the law. The honourable member for Wannon saidI appeal to the Prime Minister to set his inquiry afoot. We in this chamber stand for the peopio of the nation, and not for a privileged few. If the coal-owners have closed their minus merely to put their businesses on a better profit-earning basis they are doing an injustice to the nation, for coal is an essential daily commodity. This is not a chamber to be moved merely by sentiment. We must weigh the facts and hold the scales of justice evenly. I hope that the Prime Minister will take action to have this matter cleared up. Will the honourable gentleman express the same sentiment on this motion? After the speech by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, honourable members opposite anxiously awaited the reply of the Attorney-General. But I have never in my political career seen a responsible Minister require so much prompting and propping. One could read on his face that he had a bad case. Before he could be induced to speak, the Prime Minister whispered in his ear, and then the Treasurer felt his pulse. After much persuasion the Attorney-General rose last night to take part in the debate, and T say candidly that I have never listened to a more unconvincing statement than that which the honourable gentleman made. He recited a great deal of the Prime Minister's speech. The right honourable tbe Leader of the Government told us, and the Attorney-General repeated, that they were in communication by telephone, that they talked the matter over, discussing it from every angle, and giving particular attention to the political significance which would attach to the withdrawal of the prosecution. 'He assured us that their only concern was to bring about a resumption of work at the mines, and it was for this reason, he said, that they decided to withdraw the prosecution against Mr Brown. I assume that they were actuated by the best of motives; that they were anxious to have the mines re-opened. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) also took this view, and said he was prepared to forgive them. TJnforunderlying motive, in withdrawing the prosecution was, we are assured, to get the wheels of industry going again. That purpose has not been achieved. The mines have not been re-opened, and the men are not at work. It appears to me, therefore, that the action of the Government having been ineffective, the Attorney-General should have taken steps immediately to reinstitute the prosecution. That, I suggest, is a complete answer to the statement of the honourable gentleman yesterday. In failing to take this course, the Minister has been guilty of a grave dereliction of duty. Mr Brown now snaps his fingers at the head of this Government. for a withdrawal of the summons; he defied the Government. Brown completely ignored the Government. Probably he feels quite safe because he belongs to the class which provides the sinews of war for this Government and its party. He, and men of his kidney, helped the Ministry to office, and have kept them on the Treasury bench for many years. In the circumstances, the Ministry does not wish to offend Mr John Brown, because he represents the people who support the Government. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) takes the stand that the Government should have enforced the payment of fines imposed upon Mr Holloway and other union leaders. He",29,Setup

At the same time he believes that the Government did the right thing in withdrawing the prosecution against Mr it has been doing ever since it came into Brown. The honourable member, as we all know, is the secretary of the Nationaltwo of its outstanding administrative acts ist Union in New South Wales, and his party obtains its financial support from men like Mr Brown. What is the use of indulging in all this hypocrisy? able member knows that he must not use that expression, and I ask him to withdraw it -wit h the interests of those who supplied well, Mr Speaker, I withdraw it. But what is the use of honourable members opposite adopting this complacent attitude concerning the action of the Government in withdrawing the prosecution against Mr Brown? Equally unconvincing were the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General when they referred to the ""stolen Cabinet document""I am using their own words. for Dalley( Mr Theodore) mentioned the memorandum prepared by the Attorney-General for the consideration of Cabinet, the right honourable the Prime Minister was apparently bewildered at the disclosure, and appeared to be not too sure that the honourable member for Dalley did not have the original document in his pocket. The right honourable gentleman raised his hands in holy horror at the thought of any one stealing a document of this kind. First of all he said it was not an accurate transcript of the memorandum. were not accurate, then I fail to see how quotations from it could have perturbed the Prime Minister. We all know, of course, that the document referred to by the honourable member for Dalley contained a good deal of accurate information as to the views of the Attorney General, and the quotations from the Sydney Sun made by the Deputy Leader of my party were a cause of considerable perplexity to the Attorney-General. Speaking for myself, I can only say that I am not surprised at the action of the Government in this matter, because for seven years we have had experience of its administrative policy, and the withdrawal of the prosecution against Mr Brown is only one of many similar administrative acts. It is part and parcel of the Government's policy and in keeping with what office. We have only to recall one or to bear out what I am saying. There was the sale of the woollen mills some little time ago. Those mills were being operated in the interests of the people, but had to be sold because the profiteers in Flinderslane, Melbourne, represented that they were interfering with private enterprise funds to keep this Government in office. Again, the Commonwealth Line of Steamers had to be sold for the same reason. Lord Kylsant is now the proud possessor of the Commonwealth Government steamers, which are being operated as part of an enterprise capitalized at Â£86,000,000. Those vessels were sold at the dictation of the shipping combine. Some years ago I was a member of a committee appointed by the then Prime Minister to inquire into the conWhen the honourable member tract for certain "" coffin "" ships, as they were called. That was a contract in which a well-known citizen of this country joined with two American interests in the construction of a number of vessels for the Commonwealth Government. The inquiry disclosed that the contractors had used dummy bolts for the riveting of the plates, and the committee recommended that the whole of the money paid on account of those ships, amounting to Â£126,000, should be refunded to the Treasury. Experts who were called to give evidence declared that the lives of If it all who ventured to sea on those vessels would be endangered-that the ships would founder before they got outside Sydney Heads. Several years elapsed before any action was taken to give effect to the recommendations of the committee of inquiry, and finally the present Attorney-General accepted Â£76,000 instead of Â£126,000 in f u l l settlement. In other words, he made a present of Â£50,000 to men who should have been placed in the dock for trial.

When the House was debating that subject on a motion moved by the present Leader of my party ( Mr Scullin), we cited the parallel case of a farmer at Werribee who, in seven years, had paid fines amounting to Â£400, not for refusing to pay taxation, but for having been late in furnishing income tax returns. Again, we see on all sides further samples of the Government's discrimination arising out of its financial difficulties. During its term of office an accumulated surplus of Â£7,400,000 has been turned into a deficit of nearly Â£5,000,000. In view of the seriousness of the position the Government has dismissed large numbers of its lower-paid men, but it still retains its highly-paid officials. I am not in favour of a reduction in salaries; but I do object to the discrimination shown by the Government. Men on low salaries, some of whom have been employed for many years, are thrown into the streets, while at the same time numbers of useless boards and commissions, such as the Development and Migration Commission, with their enormous expenses, are retained. The discrimination shown by the Government in withdrawing the prosecution instituted against John Brown is typical of its administration. We have come to expect these things at its hands, but that does not mean that we are content to sit idly by.

A circular has recently been issued by the department notifying that the charges for the use of hangars for privately-owned machines have been increased by 100 per cent.
