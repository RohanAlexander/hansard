Sir PHILIPFYSH The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows :The reasons given in the departmental reports of the New South Wales inspector for closing the post and telegraph offices at Erskineville and Darlington are as follows:-Erskineville-As Erskineville office is only about 35 chains from Newtown office on the west, and about 44 chains from Alexandria on the east, it could be closed without any serious inconvenience to the public. A letterbox might be erected in the locality of the present post-office, and a licensed stamp vendor appointed. Darlington-As the Darlington office is only 30 chains from the C4eorge-street west post office, and as the maintenance of the two offices so close together is unjustifiable, and seeing that the whole extent of the Darlington borough is within three-quarters of a mileof the George-street west post office, I am of opinion that theDarlington post-office is unnecessary. asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice(I) Whetheri t is true that the Government(a) refuse to undertake to refund to importers the difference in case the duties collected are higher than the duties finally imposed by Parliament ? (6) oblige contractors for Government supplies to undertake to lower their prices to the extent of the difference between the duties collected and the duties finally imposed ? (2) If the answer to [a) he in theaffirmative, what is the reason for the policy ? honourable member's questions are as 1. The Government cannot give any undertakings in this matter on account of the difficulty I have taken steps of securing the benefit of any rebate to the person really affected by the duty. 2. I have no knowledge of this matter, but it will be further inquired into. representing the Postmaster-General, upon noticeWhat is the cause of the delay in erecting tlie Post-office at Woodville, in the State to South Australia ? Sir PHILIPFYSH The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s : A sum of money is included' in the loan expenditure to cover the cost of erecting a building for the post and telegraph office at Woodville in the State of South Australia.

That is what I wish to be. Seeing that Queenslanders at the general elections of 1883, and again in I88S, declared in favour of the stoppage of the Kanaka traffic, what am I to say to them 1 I understand that the worse of all systems of plural voting is in vogue in Queensland. Buti t could not be brought into play a t the recent federal election. The explanation of the fact that the State Parliament of Queensland appears to return a majority in favour of the retention of Kanaka labour is simple enough.

I feel quite certain that they will do anything in their power to see that justice is done to the aborigines of this continent. paradox. which is true. I have heard of people who affect a hyper-religious tone in regard to this question, and who urge that we should consider the stranger within our gates. To me the point is whether we should allow these strangers to come within our gates. I quite recognise that we should consider them in a Christian spirit when once they are here. But the question which faces us is, is Northern Australia to be peopled by white or by coloured races'? You cannot have both. There is a Gresham law as to human beings, as well as to moneythe bad money drives out the good, the inferior race displaces the superior.

Mr 'MACDONALD-PATERSON -What date is that? missionary further saysThe mortality among the Kanakas in Queensland is simply appalling. But the evil does not end there. The fresh young blood is sucked out of the islands by these labour vessels. Family supports are taken away, and the families rapidly decay. I know villages which have gone to pieces through this cause. This labour traffic, stained with the hearts' blood of the people, has done more than all other causes to depopulate these islands, and it has been aided in its dire work by their trade in firearms, a trade which has lined the pockets of British as well as French destroyed in Southern or Central Queensland, and other traders with ill-gotten gains. A third prolific cause has been the introduction of European diseases among the natives by it. Our hearts cry out, "" Oh, Lord, How Long?"" Then he says further onSince this Kanaka labour traffic began, it and its evils have swept away more than the half of the once large population of the New Hebrides, and other groups. He also saysThe arguments for its continuance in Queensland are just the same that American planters used there for the continuance of slavery, but America flourished and prospered more than ever after the curse of its slavery was swept away, and no doubt so will Queensland after the dark blot of its Kanaka labour traffic has been suppressed. had the black population left. worse for America. I have seen a little of America, and I can say that that country, more especially the Southern States, would have been ten times better off if the negroes had not been left there. There are no conditions under which degeneracy of race is so great as those which exist when a superior race and an inferior race are brought into close contact. would have been better for Queensland if she had never had the blacks. that up to the present there is not such a large proportion of blacks in Queensland as in America, and it is our business to stop any large numbers from entering that State. But the sole argument used against the Bill is that it will destroy the sugar industry. As to that I do not quite know whether honourable members who advocate Kanaka labour appreciate the position which most of us take up. I am one who would go so far as to urge the abolition of the Kanaka traffic, even if it meant the absolute loss of tlie sugar industry. Of course, if we approach the question from that point of view, the argument that the Bil l will destroy the sugar industry has not much force; but, no matter how strong our opinions may be, it is our duty to endeavour to see whether it be correct that the sugar industry will be destroyed. I have watched the debate, and ! find that the ""destruction"" is gradually reduced until it at last seems to come to a question whether there shall or shall not be trashing. It is not contended, I understand, that the sugar industry will be but that that argument now applies to only the northern part of the State. I understand that white labour can do everything except trashing, and if I rightly followed the honourable member for Herberti t is questionable whether trashing is worth the expense. This work, I am informed, is done in the off season when the Kanakas have not enough other work to do, and the Colonial Sugar Company, who have the biggest in terest in the industry in Queensland, do not do trashing on their own account, but insist on its being done by those who take land from them. Company do not grow cane. the honourable member for Melbourne. TheA n d so much Ihe Colonial Sugar Company, although they have plantations of their own, lease a quantity of their land, and the trashing is done by the leaseholders. A t all events, I cannot conceive that the resources of invention are so exhausted as that there should be absolutely no device found to achieve the same results that accrue from trashing. My experience is that, the more legislation takes the burden off human beings, the more invention and enterprise are stimulated, and the greater increase there is in the number and improveI am very glad to say ments of appliances. stimulated by the planter. sugar grown and brought to market by cheap labour-that lazy method-w e may be sure they will never apply their minds to",17,Second Reading

I am glad the Ministry have taken a statesmanlike view of this measure, and, by means of the Tariff, are going to give those who grow sugar by white labour a great advantage. If I am not wrong, those who grow by white labour are to have the advantage of a rebate which will mean £ 5 per ton. learned member speaking of sugar cane? £ 3 is to £ 1 . Colonial Sugar Company, I understand that owing to the Tariff they will be able to give better prices to the growers than before. The proposal in the measure is to have the recruiting of Kanakas stopped after the 31st March, 1904, and to enable the Government to deport any Kanakas after the 31st December, 1906 ; and I understand that this will not cause any violent breach of present conditions. There was a very analogous change made in the early part of last century in connection with the slave trade. I do not mean the abolition of slavery, but the abolition of the recruiting of slaves. An A ct was passed at the end of March, 1807, stopping the recruiting of slaves. There was no compensation provided, and the Act came into force on the 1st January, the slave trade had been going on much longer than has the Kanaka trade, and that there were hosts of vested interests. But the British Parliament did not suggest that any compensation should be given, nor did it make any trouble about the alteration. It is argued by some that there should be a commission of inquiry. I can conceive of cases in which it would be well to have a commission of inquiry, but what would be the result of a commission in this case? What could it do? Couldi t give us any more information than has been given so well already ? honourable members who have spoken in favour of the retention of the Kanaka trade of failing to give us all the information in their possession. I should be veiy glad indeed if they were to give us more. I have listened to their speeches, and if there were a good reason for the retention of the Kanaka, one might reasonably expect that they would have advanced it . only for 40 minutes instead of 40 hours. learned member could say more in 40 minutes than most honourable members could say in 40 hours. I am assuming in his favour that his speech on the second reading of this B ill contained the most I s the honourable and salient points in favour of the retention of the Kanaka. To my mind it is almost I am speaking of cane. revolting to allow the Kanaka trade to go on for two years longer. It means that Kanaka labourers who have never been in Queensland before will be brought from the islands and subjected to the evil influences which arise from that trade in the tropics. It means a continuance of the injustice for two years more. When we look at the history of this question in Queensland we find that the Kanaka traders had notice to quit long ago. They had notice to quit at the elections of 1883, and again at the elections of 188S. There was an Act passed, which became law, forbidding the importation of Kanakas after 1890. There have been commissions of inquiry, and investigations, as well as debates ad infinitum in the Queensland Parliament, and still the people of that State are convinced that this traffic should be stopped. of the commission of inquiry was that it 1808. I have no doubt was considered inadvisable to do away with the trade. elections was that it was decided that the Kanaka should go. Of the three members of the commission of inquiry there were two who were strong pro-Kanakas. The third, who was the late honourable member for Darling Downs, reported against the retention of the trade. Any one who has read the commission's report will see how much more energy and care were given to the consideration of the subject by the late honourable member for Darling Downs than by the other members of the commission. The others actually copied his words, but altered his conclusions. I hope we shall strike while the iron is hot. I must remind honourable members who are strongly in favour of this Bill that although there appears to be a large majority in this House who hold that view-and I think there will be in another place-thos e who are interested in the retention of Kanaka labour",18,Second Reading

66,Mr Higgins,"I was going to suggestThat reminds me that, in August last, a Kanaka stood for election as governor of Hawaii, and that the chief plank in his platform was the introduction each year of no less than 10,000,000 of Chinese. I have seen the picture of the man. He was a grand fellow, and had a large following. His proposal was to introduce no less than 10,000,000 Chinese every year in order to develop the country. Standard Oil Trust. Chinese would be so disorderly that the Americans would have to send ships of war there, and that that, inasmuch as he was a boatman, would mean more work for the boatmen. A t all events he was not elected. that I regard this Bill as the most vitally important measure on the programme which the Government has put before us. I shall watch its course through both Houses with the deepest anxiety, and I feel sure that there is no Bil l which will have so deep and far reaching an effect, if we can succeed in carrying it as it stands. view of the very great importance of this question, I crave the. indulgence of the House to say a few words upon it . Recognising its importance I determined to gain as much information as possible by paying a visit to the centres in which these sugar plantations are situated. I should like at the outset to thank the Queensland Government for the facilities they afforded in connection with that personal investigation. Erom the time. I landed in Brisbane to the time. I left, the Queensland Government afforded me every facility for gaining information, and for making a thorough investigation. Not only were the Queensland Government officials kind and helpful, but the owners and managers of the plantations afforded a very great amount of useful information. I notice that a number of clergymen who criticise this proposal have visited Queensland, and have gone as far as Bundaberg, but I was assured when I reached Brisbane that unless we went as far as Cairns in the north, we should not be seized of the information it was necessary to gain in order to speak intelligently upon this question. I quite agree with those who make that assertion. than Bundaberg, with its semi tropical climate, one gets no idea of the difficulties, troubles, and anxieties which must be endured by those who are developing the northern districts. I quite agree that in order to gain anything like reliable and complete information it is necessary to go as far north, at any rate, as Cairns. W it h that object in view, and in order that we might gain the fullest information, I went as far as Cairns with my friend Colonel Reay, who has written some veiy excellent articles on this question. I may say, at the outset, that almost every Government official, and certainly every planter and every man interested in sugar growing, asserted that sugar growing was absolutely impossible without the aid of Kanaka labour. That was the chorus rung in our ears from the time we I have to say, in conclusion, entered Queensland until we left it, and we almost began to think that that was really the case, until we came in contact with another class of people. The labourers themselves, the ploughmen on the plantations, and the working men's representatives, were just as emphatic that sugar growing was possible by means of white labour, that it could be carried on successfully, and that this great industry would not by any means suffer should Kanaka labour be abolished. I am prepared to admit that what are known as the sugar farmers in North Queensland, who are developing that remarkable country-for it is a remarkable country, and one needs to visit it to gain the faintest idea of its character-tli e men who are developing that countiy are deserving of every thought and every consideration we can give them.

There are two striking instances of tlie way in which the conditions are being broken, and will continue to be broken I was assured by another planter whose name I can give, if necessary, that he had protested time after time against Kanakas being thrust upon him who, for many., reasons, were physically incapable. This statement was made to me in the presence of Col. Reay, who took a shorthand note of it . This planter said that the examining officer had time after time sent to him men, pictures of whom he shewed to us, who were disabled in limb or wind, or otherwise physically, and had forced these men upon him, contrary to his own wish and request.

I am not going to waste the time of the House by reading that letter again, as it appears in Hansard, but I may point out that it was a letter of a man who had been in Queensland the greater part of his life. I want now to call another clergyman to witness a clergyman who cannot be charged with paying a flying visit, and who speaks of what he knows and testifies to what he has seen. Listen to the burning words of this reverend gentleman, Canon Pyke. Here, however, I would say that he unjustly alludes to the labour party as considering only the economic side of the case. ThatI deny. To my mind, the economic aspect is very important. It is important wherever issues affecting labour are involved. Buti t is not the most important aspect of this question by any means. If I have any quarrel with leading reformers, it is that they dwell too much on the economic side of the reforms they advocate. able member has too much faith in clergymen ! there is an economic side to this question, but there is also a moral side to it , and I do not agree with Canon Pyke that the party with whom I usually concur think that the economic side is more important than the moral.

A petition was presented to the municipal council. The council, after long discussion, decided by the casting vote of the mayor to leave things alone. One of tlie local papers defended this decision on the grounds that the Japanese women were a I was assured by the necessary protection to the white women, who but for them would be liableto molestation. Anj'one knowing the whole circumstances would understand that such an argument represented the feelings, not only of the majority of the council, but of the major part of the population. There you liave the alien question in its naked state. What will remain when the economist and the politician have done their work ? Reduced to the first principles, it is a question of morals and religion-exactl y the things which are deliberately and wilfully ignored by the political parties. The writer has lived in North Queensland many years, and has personally studied this question from its alphabet. He affirms deliberately that the Cairns incident is a reduction to the lowest common denominator of the facts concerning every sugar district in the State. The alien races come here from social and moral conditions essentially different from our own. Their customs, their instincts, their laws of thought and life have been developed under circumstances which cannot be compared with those existing here. The}' cannot understand us, nor readily adapt themselves to our ideas. 'We have imported into the country thousands of men who know nothing of self-control, whose passions have been undisciplined by socialcustom, religious authority, or moral consideration, and to whom sexual morality, particularly, is almost unknown. 'We have put them to live under conditions that would strain the moral forces of the most cultivated and best disciplined Europeans. Can we wonder at the facts that lie behind the argument of the Cairns press? The marvel is that the country has not been horrified by some wholesale outrage. The present winter has witnessed unnameable things in broad daylight in the main street of Cairns. Then, in juxtaposition to this, we have the presence of women from Japan whose ideas of virtue do not include modesty and chastity. No one reading between the lines of the address delivered by the Bishop of South Tokyo in the Sydney Town-hall, on the last night of the missionary jubilee of 1900, will be surprised to hear that the Japanese women ply their disgusting trade in full blaze of day. I quite agree that Lastly, there is the moral degradation implied in the argument that this state of things is necessary. We fear the argument is unanswerable if the alien is to remain in our midst? but the contemplation of such a necessity sends a shiver through our moral nature. Can any system be for the welfare of the nation which demands the existence of these abominations ? Can the moral life of any community be secure when these immoralities are regarded complacently ? Can any economist may have to say, surely the church can find only one verdict, a verdict which is summed up in two words"" White Australia.""",23,Malcolm Mceacharn I T Is The Crimes Or Vices Of White Men But I Am

He saysI f ' you bring the white man into contact with the-black you too often suspend the very process of a.natural-selection on which the evolution of a higher type depends. You get superior and inferior races living, on the same soil and that co-existence is demoralizing to both. They naturally sink into the position of master and servant, if not admittedly into that of slaveowner and slave. Even in the coso of Eurasians whom I have met, mentally and physically, fine specimens, I have felt how much better they would bave been had they been pure Asiatics or pure Europeans.

124,Mr Mauger,"I do not admit for adrunken and unreliable-is without foundation. hearing in Northern Queensland that the Kanaka is necessary, because he is reliable and docile. I admit that he is reliable and docile, but not that he has freedom. He is a semi-slave, and is compelled to do as his master dictates ; and that being the case, his presence is a menace to the Commonwealth and to free labour. The petitioners go on to say that the withdrawal of the Kanaka labour would not be sufficiently counteracted by the imposition of any protective duty, that European labour is not available to replace the Pacific Islanders, and that the Immigration Restriction Bill will not permit either European or any other labour to be imported under contract. We sincerely hope that it will not be possible to import any labour under contract, because we hold that there could he no greater menace to free labour than the importation of any kind of workmen under contract, and that contract labour under any conditions or circumstances is undesirable. I am quite prepared to admit that the sugar industry is a great one, and that its existence is of the greatest possible importance to white labour. I acknowledge, further, that when I visited North Queensland I did not witness any acts of personal cruelty,or anything approaching to it , and that the Kanakas appeared to be well fed. When I have said all that, however, I am brought face to face with the fact that there are social and class distinctions between the whites and blacks that must be a direct menace to this Commonwealth. We can go into the beaut if u l mansion of the planter-because , compared to the ""humpies"" orhuts of the Kanakas the planters' houses are mansions-and see the different safeguards with which he surrounds his own children or family; we can then contrast these safeguards with the dangers to which the working men's children are subject, and understand how it is that the working classes are anxious that the evils arising from the employment of Kanakas should he removed from their midst. It is easy to realize that the planter has no fear because ho and those belonging to him are isolated and kept apart from the black labourers, ' b u t it is the daughter of the ploughman or. the mill hand who is liable to contamination through this evil, and it is the working men, . who, on social, moral, and economic grounds, unitedly and determinedly pray that they may be relieved of We are continually the presence of the Kanaka. The other day I was asked by a minister of religion how I could possibly justify my action with regard to black labour. Ho said-Has not God"" made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth."" I admitted that, hut pointed out that the reverend gentleman, like many others, had quoted only a part of the verse, because it continues"" And hath determined the times before appointed, and bounds of tlieir habitation."" I hold that the bounds of the habitation of the Kanakas are to be found in the Polynesian Islands. Apart from this, there is no justification for our taking them from their own islands for the purpose of making richer a number of our own people. Further, I hold that in the interest of the Kanaka himself, it is wrong to carry on this traffic. We know of the fearful mortality that takes place amongst these natives, and that in many cases they are dying off like sheep. If the sugar industry depends upon the labour of the Kanakas, they ought to be better housed, and better fed, and better paid. Instead, however, of their receiving the highest pay, they receive the lowest pay it is possible to give them;. their clothing is unworthy of men, and their habitations are semi-barbarous in character I hold that it is the duty of this House to support the Government in its determination to give to succeeding generations a white Australia, unpolluted by this black evil, and free from all the troubles that follow in its train. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. speaking during the debate on the second reading of the Bill, I intimated that it was my intention at a later stage to move that this Bill be referred to a Royal commission, with the object of obtaining more information upon the Kanaka question and upon the sugar industry in Northern Queensland. I think honourable members of this House are very much in need of more information with regard to the sugar industry, which has been flourishing for a good number of labourer or the years past in Northern Queensland, and I cannot understand why the Government should be afraid to grant the request for an inquiry.",25,Mceacharn Ho W Long There Is No Getting Away From The Fact That

127,Mr R. Edwards (Oxley),"WhenMrB . EDWARDS -They are afraid thai they will not find things as bad as they have tried to make out. able member for Maranoa is in error in stating that things are worse than they have been represented. The only objection that could possibly be urged against granting an inquiry is that a few months delay would be involved, but there would be no danger in that, and it would be much better to incur the delay of a few months than to run the risk of destroying, or even injuring, one of the most important industries that Queensland possesses. I am only asking what is reasonable, and what the sugar planters have a right to expect from the Commonwealth Government. It is a principle of British law that no criminal con be convicted without an inquiry being held into the charge against him, but apparently Queensland is not to be allowed the same rights and privileges as the greatest criminal in the land. Queensland has already been convicted in the minds of honourable members, who have come to the conclusion that that State has been guilty of something very serious indeed. member fight the question on the platform at the last election 1 justify the attitude I am taking up. As I say, Queensland has already been convicted, and now this Parliament is about to pronounce sentence, without extending British fair play and common justice. If this Bill is carried it will inflict a great injustice on Queensland, and will create a bitter feeling against federation and the Commonwealth Government for a generation to come. I am personally very anxious to avoid any cause of irritation. acting in the right way to cause irritation. vernment to appoint a commission before any decisive steps are taken with regard to the Kanaka question in Queensland. I am quite sure that the Queensland Government will undertake that the number of Kanakas shall not be increased during the time that the inquiry is proceeding. Honourable members know very well that provision has already been made in the Immigration. Restriction Bill to prevent the admission of any other alien races to our shores. By forcing this B ill through, against the wishes of Queensland, we shall be exhibiting a most unfriendly attitude toI think the honorwards a sister State, and doing a serious injury to many industrious settlers. Had the Kanakas been as numerous, or had they belonged to a country as powerful as is Japan, the Prime Minister would have hesitated before displaying such an unfriendly attitude towards them. Personally, I am inclined to think--and I have heard a good deal about this matter during the past two or three weeks-that the Government have been forced to introduce this drastic measure by a section of this House. To my mind, the provisions contained in the Bill were dictated by the Queensland labour party. In support of this view, I may mention that in other States there is reason for thinking and saying this. In one of the Tasmanian papers, published at the beginning of last month, I find the following:Some members of the labour party were anxious to insist that the traffic should cease in three years, and not in fivo years, as the Ministry proposed. But in view of the fact that the deportation was to begin practically at once, a general agreement was arrived at that the party did the honourable should give its united support to the central provisions of the Bill, with the reservation that the alterations of detail and not of moment, which I shall be able to might suggest themselves, should be considered later on.

151,,"Mr BARTON I altogether disown 'thethrown out of employment because of the legislation he had introduced and passed through the Queensland Parliament, Sir Samuel Griffith decided on changing his policy, and issued the manifesto which I shall, have the pleasure of refeiTing. to later on. The result was that Kanakas were again allowed to come into Queensland, and planters were supplied with all the labour they required. The industry then went forward by leaps and. bounds until the manifesto issued by the Prime Minister at Maitland : and now the planters are getting into difficulties similar to those they experienced about 1890. Financial institutions and banks will have nothing to say now to any sugar securities, and planters are beginning to seriously think not of putting in any more cane, but of getting rid of their properties as quickly as they can. changed hands since the Maitland speech? none as yet have changed hands. I said I would justify myself in the stand I have taken in reference to the sugar industry of the State from which I come. I shall do so by reading what I said at public meetings when I was before tlie electors in March last. I was reported as follows :The lust sentence brought him to the question of a white Australia, a question which was just now so veiy prominently before Queenslanders, although he did not think there was much more in the cry than to catch votes. (Applause.) But this question was closely related to the well-being of an industry in Queensland-that of the growing and manufacture of sugar. (Applause.) Queensland could not afford to sacrifice an industry such us this. (Applause.) This industry was the means of providing employment to over 20,000 white people, and lie was prepared to support any measure having for its object the gradual abolition of coloured labour. There were 50,000 men, women, and children who derived u benefit from or were interested in the sugar industry, and he would be no party to agree to any hasty or reckless legislation that would bring vnin and disaster to an industry which provided directly or otherwise a living for such a large number of persons. (Applause.) Bather than destroy he would build np and establish other industries, so that they might have abundant and regular work, for all their people. He would urge that a Royal Commission of independent men be appointed to take evidence as to conditions of labour on sugar plantations before he would imperil this important industry. There were in our midst Chinese, Syrians, and Japanese, who were a far greater danger to Queensland, together with the Hindoos, than the few thousand Kanakas who were entirely employed, on the sugar plantations. He had not known during his 32 yearsin Queensland the Kanaka to become a tradesman or a storekeeper. A VOICE -Hav e yon known them to become coachmen ? coachman. (Applause.) He objected to Kanakas being emploj'ed at anything outside of the sugar industry, and did not want them to be in Queensland permanently, but only until the planters could do without them. A number of years at any rate must be given them. As to Chinese, Syrians, Japanese, and Hindoos, they were or became here expert tradesmen, or they opened shops, and were keen competitors with all the white workers throughout the State. Those were the people who became a great danger to Queensland! They had increased in Australia something like 100 per cent, during the last ten years. There had been some 7,000 or 8,000, and now there ware between 15,000 and 16,000. Something ought to be done to restrict those people in particular. (Hear, hear.) He only wished them to use their common sense in the matter. Those whose cry was the loudest for doing away with the Kanakas were the people who were quite prepared to consume sugar grown in other countries by people who were, it might be said, nothing else but slaves. It was said at one time that the planters employed I am afraid that Kanakas because of their cheapness, but a white man had told him the previous night that a white man could do as much work as that of four Kanakas. If that' was the case, it could not be for the sake of cheapness that Kanakas were employed, and they might depend upon it that if the planters could get reliable white labour they would be only too glad to do awaj' with the Kanaka. Let ""them not, however, ruin the industry which had done so much for the colony. If they did so then 20,000 white workers would, become unemployed, and nobody wanted that. (Applause.) I am rather afraidthat if this Bill becomes law there will be a much larger number than 20,000 white workers thrown out of work, because the industry is much more extensive now than it was ten years ago. WhatI have quoted is what I said to the electors of Oxleyi n March last, and I think I said something to the same effect at nearly every meeting I held during that month. The electorate of Oxley is one of considerable extent, comprising.no fewer than half-a-dozen State electorates, which return seven members to the Queensland Parliament. All classesare represented in the electorate, including working, men, shopkeepers, merchants, manufacturers, and a veiy large number of farmers, none of whom are directly, but all of whom, are indirectly, and largely interested in the sugar industry. As I explained in the House a. few months ago, the farmers are interested in the industry indirectly, because it gives them a more extensive market and better prices for",28,Mceacharn Ho W Long There Is No Getting Away From The Fact That

154,Mr Edwards Said He Never Had One For A,"their dairy and farm produce. I should like to give honourable members as much information as I can upon this question, which I feel is one of very great importance-of very much more importance than the Eederal Tariff-to Queensland. I have had conversations with honourable members of this House, some of whom have readily admitted that they know nothing about the Kanaka question or much about the sugar industry, and who, under the circumstances, are under the impression that the safest course for them is to follow the Government. Other honourable members who do not know anything about Kanakas, whose colour they hardly know except by hearsay and who know nothing about the sugar industry, regard themselves as occupying a judicial position. They listen to the arguments for and against the Bill, in the sincere hope of being able to arrive at a right conclusion before the division takes place. latter honourable members. I have some hope, but as to the honourable members who are as much in the dark as the Government themselves, 'and yet are ready to follow whatever course tlie Government may take, I have very little hope of converting them. I should now like to read the opinion of the people of Townsville as expressed soon after the provisions of this Bil l were made knownThe opinion at Townsville is that the Bill is simply a means to ruin the industiy earlier than was expected. The assurance that the Tariff proposals will compensate planters impresses nobody, as the conviction is strongly held that the correct opinions. industry cannot be conducted in the tropics withoutcgpecidl labour, and that the labour market is incapable of providing white labour, even if it were suitable. That report is taken from the Argus of October 7. meeting censured the council for passing the resolution. that at the elections. ber any report of public meetings of citizens in Queensland which have condemned this Bill? meeting has been held. reports of such meetings before the House before I have concluded. I shall be able to put before the House reports of public meetings held in various parts of Queensland to consider this Bill. The following report is taken also from tlie Argus of 7th ult.:A feeling of utmost dismay prevails amongst planters, shippers, and merchants in the Cairns district in regard to the Pacific Island Labourers Bill. In the event of the measure becoming law there will, it is said, be an absolute depreciation of property. No hope is entertained of palliating the effect by any remedial provisions*>f the Tariff. A feeling of insecurity predominates, and the collapse of the whole industry is foretold, because other aliens may be treated in tbe same way as is proposed to be done with the Kanaka. I quote again from the Argus of the 7th ult., an extract giving the opinions voiced by the Brisbane Courier -The Brisbane Courier, of Thursday, says'' Mi-. Barton asks that the Kanaka BiU be read along with the Budget and Tariff presently to be introduced. His faith apparently is that the sugar duty about to be proposed, will enable the Of the planter to carry on the industiy with white labour. This faith rests on the assumption that the difficulty in the utilisation of white labour is a difficulty of wages only. It is nothing short of astounding that, after all the representations made by those who know, after the reiterated illustrations to the contrary, produced by this and other journals, after the report of Dr. Maxwell himself, which, if it proved anything, proved that the desideratum was racial adaptation rather than wages, the Government of the Commonwealth should cling to this assumption, and make it the basis of legislation."" expressed every possible opinion in regard to the question of black labour. correct ? report Dr. Maxwell sets forth that in 1885 there were 38,557 acres of cane crushed, 55,796 tons of sugar made, and 10,755 Pacific Islanders employed in the industry in Queensland. In 1899, however, there were 79,435 acres of cane crushed and 123,289 tons of sugar made, yet the number of Kanakas had been reduced to 8,826. That is, in proportion to the whole of the Queensland sugar industry, the employment of Kanaka labour had been reduced by about 60 per cent, during that period. A t the date of the making I shall place some of tlie report the average area under sugar cane, per grower, was 42-6 acres. It has been pointed out that this indicates that as the number of small growers has increased Kanaka labour has decreased,",29,Mceacharn Ho W Long There Is No Getting Away From The Fact That

167,Mr J. Reid Moved,"""That in the opinion ofby the Commonwealth? With one or two good seasons they should be in the position of the requirements of the Commonwealth. If white labour was used entirely then they would be in a serious position. As soon as they had a surplus-above Australian requirements they would come into contact with sugar grown by tlie very cheapest labour, aud the Commonwealth would be paying a high price for local requirements in order that they might be able to send away their surplus at a veiy great loss. He considered that no better means could be obtained to ascertain the facts regarding tlie industry than a Royal commission. Mr ArcEROKOAi BIB seconded tlie motion.*i He said the state of the country by the drought was very disastrous, and the proposal of the Federal Premier with regard to the sugar industry would be equally far-reaching in its-effects. The matter was of great importance, almost of primary importance as far as-the agricultural interests of the north were concerned, and in tbe south of Queensland their prosperity had been to a large degree dependent ou tlie demand in the north for the produce grown in the south. He held that the people concerned in the industiy, whose opinions they had obtained, were in a better position than the ordinary voter, who was supposed to have given a verdict against the retention of the Kanaka, to give an opinion on sncli a question. The matter could be viewed from a religious, moral, commercial, or political toirsiiction, no matter from what> stand-point it wus viewed. When Mr Barton and. his confreres induced them to join in becoming, one Commonwealth, he said no action would, be taken without having the matter well sifted; but when he found it necessary to placate the Labour party to help him pass other measures, Queensland's interests were made subservient. The}' had been sacrificed so that he could obtain place and power. Some clergymen were inclined to say that there were objectionsto the Kanaka being employed, from a religious stand-point, but those gentlemen were false to tlieir Christianity. They would cast the Kanaka out of their midst, but did. they Eorget that he was created by the Almighty just us much as the}' were? They had seen the result of the few demands made in the north by the white people to do the work. In every case it had. been u disastrousfailure. If they tookaway from the planters in the north the only labour they had suitable for the worli, they were ruining their industry. It meant they must give up sugar-growing, and in a few years it would be wiped out. The Kanaka was harmless, and in no way contaminated the whites. They were not in this respect like the Hindoo or other Asiatics. From the commercial stand-point it was necessary that the kana ka be retained. In the tropics, rice, coffee, & a , as well as sugar, would, require black labour for their cultivation. If they were going to make anyuse of their northern territory, they would have to do it with black labour, otherwise the land would have to remain waste. Unfortunately they had sent a majority of members to the Federal Parliament opposed to black labour. white men will have Mr It. Edwards. Mi-. R. EDWARDS being able to supply more than It was n matter of selfishness. The Labour party feared that with blacks iu the country some portion of labour might be taken from them, and they did not see that by doing certain work the blacks created work for the whites. Sending-those men down had given Mr Barton a certain right to say he was acting in accordance with the views Queensland had expressed at the federal election ; but they were not returned by the votes of the majority of the right-thinking people in the State. A large portion of those who voted knew nothing of the conditions of the industry. Had a majority of men favorable to the retention of the Kanakas been sent down, no doubt the Bill would have been altered. If black labour was taken away they would have to utilize the products of other places where sugar was grown by black labour or by Continental cheap labour. Malpracticesmight have been resorted to in the past in connection with the Kanaka, but that had been altered, and now the Kanaka was better cored for than a. great many white men cared for their wives and children in this city. The motion was-carried-unanimously. Now, we shall go f a r t h e r n o r t h to get the opinion of the leading k in d r ed agricultural societies. This is the opinion of tli e Townsville Pastoral, A g r i c u l t u r a l , and In d u s t r i a l Association of QueenslandResolved(1) That the Townsville Pastoral, Agricultural, and Industrial Association views with alarm, based on first-hand knowledge of the conditions surrounding the sugar industry in Queensland, the legislative interference with its present labour supply proposed in tlie measure before the Parliament of the Commonwealth; (2) That, while putting to one side the untried problem of whetheiEuropeans can labour in the cane-field without physical deterioration, it appears to the association to be certain that a sufficient supply of Europeans to supply the vacancy caused by the departing Kanakas will not be available within five years; (3) That, consequently, in Spite of the higher wages made practical by the fiscal proposals of the Commonwealth Government; the areas of cane under cultivation will decrease considerably, and this will increase the cost of manufacture so greatly that the mills will cease operation, and the industry be extinguished ; (4.)

206,Mr R. Edwards,"The report prothat if the Bill passed the northern pin liters at least industries in that town so largely depended to must go. It was only by coloured labour that they could maintain their position. So great would be the ruin of property, and the misery of thousands, that it was difficult to realize that a serious attempt was about to be made by persons presuming to be statesmen to pass a measure that would produce such direful results. There were legislators who were going to vote for the Bill who admitted that they knew nothing about the industry. It was scandalous the way this thing was being rushed through in a state of complete ignorance. Australia"" at any price was a fallacious one, and would never be fulfilled. Thej' were making the harmless Kanaka tlie scape-goat for the time being, but if the Kanaka went to-morrow Australia would remain almost as black as ever, and would continue so the end of time. No country in the world of the size of Australia, and so much of it in the tropics, was of one colour. The belief that white men would supplant the Kanaka was utterly fallacious, and the bonus on cane grown by white labour would at best be but a temporary benefit to the grower. The grower must have a full supply of labour to' keep the mills supplied, for unless the mills saw a sufficient supply of cane forthcoming for the season they would not crush at all. The effect of the Bill would be that the supply of cane would fall off, the mills would gradually drop out of operation, and tlie production of sugar would be so diminished that the people of Australia would no longer submit to the high duty and bonus to support it. There seemed little hope of impressing the southern people with these facts, and it seemed that they would have to go to the Throne for justice. Mr Chamberlain was u sterling man where oppression was concerned, and he would not see tlie planters driven out and ruined. Captain Mackellar supported the resolution, and endorsed all that had been said by the previous speakers. The resolution embodied what the planters had asked for when Mr Barton first arrived in Queensland on his Ministerial tour, namely, that a full inquiry be made into the conditions of the sugar industry in Queensland before legislation was passed. He referred to the terrible depression that followed the State anti-Kanaka legislation prior to 1893, and said the effect of the present Bil l would be infinitely worse. In the north the outlook was regarded as utterly hopeless, and it was hard to realize how very disastrous the effect of the Bil l was going to be. Old residents would remember what Maryborough was in the busy clays of the sugar industiy on the Mary River, when from sixteen to twenty sugar mills, large and small, including Yengarie, were in ful l swing. It was Sir S. W. Griffiths' antikanaka legislation that had crippled the industry in the Maryborough district, and it had never recovered its former position again. Most of the sugar lands were now lying idle, and where thousands were settled there were now but hundreds. In taking away Kanaka labour the Federal Government should find a satisfactory substitute, and this should be clone before restrictive legislation was resorted to. Mr nine millions would be worth not seven Barton had declared in Maryborough that, in any legislation that was brought forward, he would not allow such a ereat industiy upon which Walkers Limited, the saw-mills, and other splendid Mr P. Edwards. be injured ; but he had, nevertheless, struck a blow greater than they could yet realize. The Isis and Bauple districts would never have gone in for sugar but for the repeal of the restrictions on Kanaka labour, and the assurance of the continuance of reliable labour that was given with it. He and many others had gone in for sugar-growing solely on the understanding that reliable labour was to continue. He hoped that the southern growers, who might secure a few profitable years with the aid of the bonusandthe surplus white laThe cry of ""Whit e bourof Brisbane, would notthrowover the northern planters, but all stick together. Even tlie Nerang Central mill farmers, though so close to Brisbane, were unable to take off their crop without black labour. How, then, were the Mossman, Mulgrave, and other northern districts to get white labour to replace the Kanaka ? The southern farmer, who imagined that he would get along all right with the bonus, should remember that, if the industry went out in the north, the people of Australia would not go on paying a bonus to keep up a high duty for the benefit of a handful of southern farmers producing a few thousand tons of sugar. Mi-. G. H . Reid, who would probably succeed Mr Burton, had declared that, when the Kanaka went, free-trade would be resorted to. Dr. Maxwell had told them that in New South Wales and Southern Queensland many growers were possessed with the idea that if the industiy died out in the north it would be all the better for them ; but it was a selfish and foolish notion, for it was only the great magnitude of the industiy that induced the Federal Government to offer concessions and protection, and it was the north that gave the industiy its great magnitude. He then referred to some of the arguments of the supporters of the Bill, such as the moral aspect of Kanaka labour, and warmly denounced the slanderous and untruthful statements that were made under this head. Then there was the ""shivery"" cry, and he ridiculed the statement that the "" b o y s "" did not understand their agreements. It was strange that so many ""boys"" should return again and again to the plantations and work under them. In the great majority of cases every attention was paid to the moral, spiritual, and temporal welfare of the "" boj'S."" -Thej' could scarcely wonder at the attitude of the southern people when the Federal Premier made the wild and unfounded statements about the Kanaka that were to bo found in his speeches. He( Mr Mackellar) thoroughly believed in majority rule, but it was surely only right that the majority should understand what they were doing. For that reason he appealed for the fullest inquiry, and that the matter should be thrashed out on the facts. If that were done, and the matter put before the public by impartial judges, he would then be prepared to bow to the decision of the majority. But if the majority still decided to deprive them of the labour which had been assured to them when thej' had invested their all in the industiy, then fair compensation should be made for the losses they would suffer, because the present asset of from seven to hundred thousand if there was no reliable labour to carry it on with. Those who had mortgaged their properties to the Government for central mills, and who relied on the promises of the State Government to continue Kanaka labour, -would have a special claim for compensation. The planters did not wish to clear out of the industry if they could help it, but it would be A hard job :for the industries and businesses of the towns to kucp going if they did, and they, therefore, had a claim on the townspeople to help them to fight this drastic measure. It was not a question of retaining the Kanaka for an indefinite period, but of postponing the commencement of the restrictive process for a reasonable time to enable tbem, if possible, to face the situation and overcome the problem of reliable labour. As the Bill stood, the withdrawal of the reliable labour set in immediately, without giving them any time to look about. Mr Atlee Hunt, the Federal Premier's private secretary, hud strongly advised him after the visit to Bundaberg that Queensland should send down several good lecturers to educate the south on the question. If casual visitors from the south were so impressed with what they saw, what might they not expect from a Royal commission composed of southerners ? When the Bauple mill started, the majority of the growers -decided to try und grow the cane without coloured labour, but now all but three were employing Kanakas. He hoped that by united and strenuous effort they would at least succeed in gaining an extension of time. The motion was put and carried unanimously. honourable member quoting ? Mackellar, a sugar planter in the Wide Bay district. Chamber of Commerce passed the following resolutionThat this chamber in a most emphatic manner S-carried i-otests against the Pacific Island Labourers ill, now Eefcre the Federal Parliament, as, if into law, a cruel injustice will be inflicted on the sugar industry, and irreparable loss sustained by those engaged therein.

Failing the appointment of a Royal commission, this cliamber urges un extension of the recruiting of islanders for at least seven years. The Bundaberg Chamber of Commerce, I understand, has despatched the following telegram to the Prime Minister :Bundaberg Chamber of Commerce humbly pray that in the opinion of this chamber, proposed Pacific Islands Labourers Bill will have paralysing effect on sugar industry and trades and commerce. This State generally would respectfully suggest that the Bill bo altered as follows :That recruiting be permitted until 31st December, 1007; that Kanakas in Queensland not to exceed 10,000 at any time, and to be employed as specified under present Queensland laws and regulations. Reasons for suggestions are that, owing to the large amount capital involved in the 20 A industry, if proposed Bill be passed much capital invested will be absolutely lost, und many worthy colonists ruined. Ten thousand Kanakas cannot possibly menace Australia in cither racial or moral way. Health officer states there is not a Kanaka halfcaste in this district; that Kanaka preferable to any other alien labourer; wages earned by him spent in Commonwealth; that Kanaka does nob compete with labourer, but creates higher-grade work for him ; that immigration of Kanakas has done very much to civilize and christianize South Sea Islanders ; that during harvesting season it would be impossible to get sufficient white labourers to do the work. An additional ten hundred men would ho required in this district, and to maintain that staff, a floating reserve of at least six thousand white men would have to be available, ami that reserve does not exist here ; that the rebate of excise on sugar-cane grown exclusively by white labour be six shillings per ton, ten per cont., cane beginning 1st January next, for if sugar cun be produced by white labour, every inducement should be given at earliest date possible to those farmers and planters who would endeavour to grow cane under these conditions, so as to prove conclusively whether sugar-cane can be so grown or not.

We therefore would respectfully suggest that to encourage the growth of cane by white labour, the Federal Government at mice make the rebate to cane-growers using white labour only, Os. per ton instead of 4s. per ton, also that the largo plantations be allowed to divide their plantations into portions, and elect to grow certain of these portions with white labour only, and thuM earn the rebate which would at tlie same time have the effect of gradually doing away with black labour, without placing too great a strain on the white labour available. This will induce and encourage both the small farmers and the large growers to endeavour to grow cane by white labour, which is the desire of all parties. To enable the above to gradually come into operation without imperilling the industry, we trust you will agree to allow tlie present Queensland Polynesian Act to remain unrestricted for at least four years, except that the number must not be increased beyond the present total. The above wo consider will both give large and small growers an opportunity to gradually change present methods, and will also induce all to give a fair trial to growintr cane by white labour. This board fears that if the Kanaka is hurriedly deported before other alien labour, the Asiatic aliens from the southern colonies, will be attracted to Queensland during tlie crushing season, while in the slack season they would he idle and in relatively large numbers would form a menace to the white population of the sugar districts. I have now to put before honourable members ducted in this way it will not be very an account of a meeting held by the Chamber creditable to us. of Commerce, Bundaberg [ITouse counted]. friend allow me ? I think that the House has done its duty to-night. The State Parliament of Victoria has not sat to-day. We have got through as much business as was possible in the circumstances, and I will not accuse the honourable member for Oxley of endeavouring to obstruct the passage of the Bill. desire. the honourable member of that, and he knows me well enough to understand what that means. So long as I liave the assurance of the honourable member that there is no intention of obstructing the Bil l Minister that I have no such intention. to allow him to continue his speech at the next sitting of the House. honourable member moves for leave to continue his remarks to-morrow, I shall agree to that course. Motion proposedThat the honourable member for Oxley have leave to continue his remarks at the next sitting of tbe House. MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) I have no objection to the motion, hut it appears to me that the only purpose which the honourable member for Oxley can serve in continuing his speech is to carry out the desire of certain politicians in Queensland, that certain opinions which have been expressed should appear in Hansardi n order that they may be sent to England and used as a protest against the passing of this B ill and the giving of the Royal assent to it . It appears to me that it will lead only to a considerable waste of time. It can serve no other purpose. We have listened very patiently this evening to a great deal of matter read by the honourable member, which has no weight or value whatever. It has sprung entirely from one particular source. I certainly should have given the honourable member credit for declining to allow himself to be pulled in this way. However, he has been pulled, and I am not going to raise any further objection to leave being given to tlie honourable member to continue his speech to-morrow. Nevertheless, if wo allow the business of the House to be conW ill my honourable Motion agreed to. House adjourned at 10.34 p.m. If the",39,Results Of Meeting Held At Brisbane Os
