REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS. seen the statement of the Secretary of tbe Victorian Property Owners Association, MrH . P. Iligginson, that while a good pre-war home was held down to its 1.942 valuation, an inferior one built in 1946-can be sold at its cost, which is no less than 50 per cent, above that of the pre-war house? If so, does the Prime Minister consider', this an equitable state of affairs, and can he say whether the Government proposes to take any immediate action in regard to real estate controls, some considerable time having elapsed since the war ended ? ber comments on tbe fact that houses built perhaps ten or twenty years ago can he sold at no more than-the prices i-jiling in 1940 or 1942 as the case may be. That is true, but a small margin is allowed to ensure that the owner shall not lose hy the sale. Notwithstanding the Rc-ntrol, the owner, in many instances, stands to make a substantial profit on his investment. A similar kind of housebuilt during the last few months would probably cost much more than did the house built ten or twenty years ago.",13,Enemy Origin Interrupted I Shall Obtain A Reply For Him

The control of sales of real estate and property and l -ind transfers presents a very difficult problem, as honourable members will realize. Every effort is being made to keep prices ofproperty down to a reasonable level, but there has been some inflation, despite ' all the consols that have been imposed. This, has been unavoidable, because there are nl! sorts of reasons why additional amounts should be added to sale prices. At the moment, I can see no solution for the problem raised-by the liotforable member, hut the control of property transaction;;, in common with other controls, i> examined from time to time.

Externa] Affairs make a statement soon regarding the Russo-Persian difficulty and Australia's attitude towards it, particularly in connection with the recent vote of Australia's delegate at the meetings of the Security Council? make,any general statement no\v. With regard to the vote, on a matter of procedure before the Security Council, subsequent events showed that the vote of the Australian delegate was correct because, two days later, tbe council did what he suggested. I have already promised the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) to make a general statement, but I do not believe that it would be of ary assistance at present while the council is actually dealing with the matter. Our view is that this dispute should be investigated and all the facts relevant to it obtained, and that no country has the right to take away from the Council's jurisdiction any matter once it has jurisdiction over it. We are carrying out that policy. That is the only policy on which the Security Council, in our view, can be successful. Minister for External Affairs whether he has seen cabled reports from New York to the effect that the Australian delegate at the meeting of the Security Council clashed vigorously with both the British and American delegates in regard to the Russian ""walk-out""? Will the right honourable gentleman say on whose initiative Colonel Hodgson spoke? Did be speak on instructions from the Government or on his own initiative? If he spoke on instructions from the Government, was the Government fully aware of the British and American view on the subject? to our delegate was to keep the Persian dispute on the agenda; not to allow it to disappear, merely because it had been memorandums have been said that an agreement had been made, but to press for an investigation of it, and to see that the investigation was conducted according to proper procedure, so that cases would be filed by both sides, and a proper hearing would be given to the matter. In all that he has done, the Australian delegate has acted strictly in accordance with that principle, which incidentally was followed in London by my colleague, the Minister for the Navy( Mr Makin). Not only has this general instruction been carried out excellently by the Australian delegate, but in addition the advice that he gave at an earlier stage was followed by tbe Council two -days later. One cannot anticipate every turn that a debate may take at a meeting of a body of this character. The fact that, on one matter, the Australian delegate happened to vote against the delegate of the United Kingdom or the United States of America,, has no bearing on the point. He has to do his duty honestly to Australia, and as a member of the Security Council. He cannot be expected to ascertain how other countries intend to vote before he makes up his mind how he will vote.",14,Property Values

AVill the Minister inform ,the House why lie failed to honour bis promise to these men, and whether tliere are still in the islands other men who were promised by him that they would be home by the end of January, February or Marchi . What does he .propose to do about it? ber had mentioned this matter to me or placed the question on the notice-paper, 1 could have given h i m the exact dates of the sailings of ships. When I visited Lae and other centres,, questions were . asked about the expected departure of the troops, and the local commanding officer, having a f u l l knowledge of the failings of ships, was able to supply the information. The arrival of the W-mshester VicI s the Minister tory at Lae was delayed, because 5,000 Japanese had been shipped from Faroe Island, leaving a large number of Australian troops there in what is considered to be an Unhealthy area. The Winchester Victory was diverted by the Director of -Movements at Army Head-quarters, Melbourne, to go first to Faroe Island and l if t tbe Australian troops there before proceeding to Lae. Having before him tbe over-all picture, he considered that that instruction was advisable in the interests of Australian troops generally. The Winchester Victory was then sent to Lae,' where it lifted the troops, and it arrived in Sydney early this week. 1 have not broken any promise that I made. I believe it is true to the troops at Lae. B y order of the Director of Movements, who has before him a chart showing the position of all these ships, some alteration has been made in their running. The Director of Movements is a highly trusted officer, who possesses all the necessary information, and I am confident that every decision which he makes is in the best'interests of the troops generally. The position is not always known to individuals who, because of a lack of complete information, someH as the Ministerf o r times criticize particular decisions. I assure the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) that I am just as anxious as he or any other member of the community is to get all the troops back from the islands.

I am sure that tbe Prime Minister( Mr nant reason why caucus has decided to 'Chifley) will agree that there should be no enforcement of any ruling against granting extensions of time to honourable members speaking during the debate, be-cause, to deal simultaneously with the three bills, which cover so much ground, may require more than the time normally allotted for speeches on a motion 'for. the .second reading of a bill. ter has already given such an assurance to enable honourable members to deal exhaustively with the three bills in one debate. Debate resumed from the 27th March, (vide page 649), on motion by Dr. Tliut the bill be now read a second time. the Opposition) [3.52] -In 1944, the, -Government, put forward a number of proposed amendments to the Constitutiona very substantial number which finally reached about seventeen-and the people, were given one vote in relation to :all of these amendments, because they were included iu one bill. As honourable members know, the proposals were rejected. At that time, the AttorneyOeneral (Dr. Evatt) pressed very .strongly, not once but many times, for a non-party approach to the problem, and he consistently emphasized that questions -of constitutional power should hot be -determined along party lines. It cannot be said that that ambition was entirely realized; nevertheless, there were honourable members on rhis side of the House who gave support to the Government's proposals. The Government has now -changed its mind on both points. As to the first, I have no regret. It is a good -thing that questions should come before us in threebills instead of in one. That removes one of the difficulties which .arose on a former occasion. However, the ' Government proposes to hold a referendum on these proposals on the iame day as the general elections! That involves at once the abandonment of a non-party approach to them. have the referendum on polling day is that it desires to confuse people into believing that a vote for constitutional amendment necessarily will involve a vote for the Government, and that a vote against the Government will in some way be regarded as against one or other of tbe referendum proposals. After all, honourable members opposite must not think that we are children in these matters. When a government decides to have a referendum concurrently with a general election, the inference is quite obvious. Mr Bun ICE The right . honourable gentleman is battling very hard for points. ber for Perth( Mr Burke) will not even be able to battle for points at the general election; it. will be a clean knock-out. However, I am quite unmoved because junior members on the Government side of the House resist my suggestion. I do not observe that any experienced member would care to deny it . In 1944, the Opposition put forward a reasoned amendment to the proposals then made by the Government, and the last paragraph of this amendment was as follows:That provision should be made for tlie setting' up, within a period of two years after the termination of actual hostilities, of an elective popular convention for the review of tlie structure and working of the Constitution. We still believe that such a convention is essential. Indeed, it might be a very good thing if we adopted the practice of holding such conventions periodicallyI do not mean at short periods, but at substantially long periods-in . order that the working of tbe Constitution might bo reviewed in a proper atmosphere and in an objective way. Our belief that then ought to be a convention is strengthened by the character of the amendments now before us, some portions of which are good, whilst others are open to very serious criticism. The total character of them, taken together, is that they are hurriedly nssembled and piecemeal. I propose to deal in turn with each of the",20,Constitutio N Alteration

74,Mr Menzies,"The honourable memthree proposals-socia l services, marketing, and employment-and I propose to examine them in a critical, but constructive way. ""WhereI take exception to something I shall make positive suggestions in relation to it. The second reading debate on bills designed to amend tbe Constitution should present a great opportunity to the House for a pooling of ideas, and therefore, whilst I shall be critical on some matters, I shall not make a merely blank, negative approachto them. I turn first to the social services amendment. This is a proposal to alter the Constitution by including power in relation to maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and .dental' services, benefits to students, and family allowances. Tbe Pharmaceutical Benefits case, which was recently decided by the High Court, has undoubtedly produced some real questions as to the validity of social services other than invalid and old-age pensions. This matter of the power of the Commonwealth to make appropriations at. large or for. purposes not to be found elsewhere in section 51 of the Constitution, was debated to some extent in this House on a former occasion. Up to the time of the decision of the High Court, apart from some obversations in an earlier case, the Commonwealth practice bad uniformly been over a long term of years to rely upon a wide interpretation of section SI of the Constitution. It readsA l l revenues or moneys raised or received by of any State Parliament would refuse the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Kimd, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth. The question that has existed since the words were written into the Constitution might be put in this way: when section 81 authorizes this Parliament to appropriate money for tbe purposes of tbe Commonwealth, are those purposes to be found in the legislative and executive powers specifically conferred by the Constitution, or does "" the purposes of the Commonwealth "" mean any purposes that the Commonwealth Parliament may think proper? The first is a narrow interpretation and the second a wide interpretation of the words. Quite plainly, if the. narilr. Menzies. row interpretation applies, there are many appropriations made by this Parliament that are either invalid or .doubtful. For 40 years the Commonwealth Parliament acted on the wide view. I think that can be said about governments of all political complexions that have occupied the treasury bench. The High Court did not, in precise terms, decide that question in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case. I think the Attorney General will agree that, in some of the judgments, one doe's not find that neat question neatly determined ; but, at the same time, I think that perusal of the judgments indicates a real doubt as to whether, if a challenge were made, the wide power of appropriation would be upheld. I say, "" if challenge were made "", because there are some matters within the scope of this proposition that have never been challenged. Maternity allowances, for example, have always been subject to this question, but have never been challenged, and, I daresay, would never be challenged; but, in tbe event of a challenge, there are doubts, aud, therefore, it is proper that those doubts should be resolved in relation to social services, to which, this Parliament attaches importance. These doubts might have been resolved in one of three ways. They might, have been resolved by a reference of power from the States under Section 51, paragraph (xxxvii.). I know that the experience in seeking references of power from the States of late has not been an entirely happy one, but -I greatly doubt whether either Housea reference of power that would validate such matters as, by way of example, child endowment, and widows' pensions. That is one method that might have been pursued. It is the method that we believe should have been' pursued. The second method is to have a referendum taken separately from tbe general elections, so that genuine election issues shall not be confused by questions of constitutional power. After all, in general elections, the prime conflict is between political programmes and policy, and the moment that is confused by arguments on constitutional power there might be produced entirely strange results; results not expected' by either side in the political conflict. The third method is one that the Government has adopted., a referendum taken concurrently with the general elections. I say quite plainly that, in the circumstances, the way will he open to a great mass of skilful propaganda, in which the merits of the constitutional issue may entirely disappear. The Government has adopted the third method, unwisely, in my view, and has taken the occasion to include new items. The proposed amendment, the terms of which I have just read to the House, specify certain matters about which there is no argument at all. Widows pensions, maternity allowances, -child endowment and family allowances are common ground to all parties in the House, and we all support the removal of any doubt as to their validity. Unemployment and sickness benefits, hospital services and medical and dental services are, in their turn, most desirable, but we believe, as honourable gentlemen opposite know, because for some time we have made no secret of our views on this matter, that those things should all come within the scope of some form of national insurance, and, therefore, would have been much better dealt with by expanding or clarifying, as the case may be, the Commonwealth's insurance power under section 51, paragraph (xiv.) of the Constitution. Having stated those general views,' I add a few words about some of the expressions employed. Take the phrase ""medical and dental .services "", as a separate head of power, because it is .so stated. The expression is very curious. Tbe learned Attorney-General was . questioned ' about this during his second-reading speech. "" provision of "" and-then the other words follow later. The Attorney-General was questioned about this during hi» second reading speech. I agree that it was as the result of the question that he said what he did, and I do not desire to tie him to anything he said without having weighed, what he was saying. But the right honourable gentleman was asked by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) whether this power woulcl enable the Commonwealth to nationalize the medical and dental professions. The Attorney-General saidThe Commonwealth could obtain the services of medical and dental practitioners, nurses and the like for that purpose; but tlie proposed alteration would not enable the Commonwealth to say, "" We shall make all members of the medical and dental professions part of the service of the Commonwealth "". Dr. 15VATX -W c shall be able to do everything necessary and incidental to providing these services. That is a very wide power. trol fhe registration of doctors and dentists? ''. he right to practise in tliose .professions is o<>v-«Yi'-d' by State law. This proposal would not affect that, nor would it affect the right of a doctor or a dentist as an individual to practise his profession. State laws? wealth to make use of the services of doctors and dentists to provide national medical and dental services. With very great, respect, I believe that explanation to be inadequate. I am rather disposed to think that on reflection the right honourable gentleman will agree with me. Recently, in the High Court, the Airlines case was decided. It was a case that attracted great atention, and in it the High Court decided unanimously that a power to make laws with respect to trade and commerce among the States included a power to set up a government airline, under a government corporation, though, by reason , of section 92 of ; the Constitution, that airline could not be given a monopoly. In other words, . the Commonwealth Government could not prevent another company from engaging in the business of interstate flying, but it could, under the trade and commerce power, set up a government service. That was not an obvious decision. As the Attorney General knows, that finally disposed of a problem that had arisen once or twice in the past in the court and very many times outside the court, because there was one view that the trade and commerce power is a power to regulate trade and commerce in the hands of those who carry it on, and not a power enabling the Government to engage in it.

82,Mr Ealstkin,"In any case, there isspecial leave to appeal has -been announced. What will happen I do not know. AllI can do is to discuss the matter on the unanimous finding of the High Court, and its view was that the trade and commerce power enables the Government itself to set up an airline and does not confine the Commonwealth Parliament to regulation of airlines in the bands of other people. Apply that to the power to provide medical and dental services. There is no real question of interstate trade and commerce in the provision of medical or dental services, and so it is not likely that section 9!a will be brought into this .argument. In those cirthis. . I have no doubt that many cumstances, very little doubt exists that not only the words of the proposed amendment but also the decision of the High Court will mean that under those words, the medical and dental professions could be nationalized by making all doctors and dentists members of one government service which had a monopoly of medical an<] dental treatment. In that sense, this power includes a power to nationalize medicine and dentistry. wrong with that? objection to nationalizing the medical profession, but that is a matter of practical politics which, perhaps, we can discuss more fruitfully on another occasion. I am pointing out ,at present what the power will do. As there is no immediate urgency about this problem, it is a great pity that the Government does not defer it, pending consideration of the whole Constitution by a convention'along the lines that have been suggested from this -=ide of the House. After all, a national convention, duly elected, might come to' the conclusion that it would be better to give to the Commonwealth Parliament full power over public health as such than to deal with the problem piecemeal. Similar comment upon piecemeal and rather ambiguous treatment arises in relation to the reference to sickness and hospital benefits. After all, these are matters which deal with results rather than causes, and, if I may say so, experidum of 1944. Marketing was included ence of the last few months under the legislation -that has been passed shows that the proposed powers are much more likely to be exercised largely for industrial ends than in a real attempt to deal with the problem of health. In this country or in any other country, the problem of health isdealt with not merely by looking at certain results and trying to deal with them, but by seeking causes and trying to deal with them. In the long run, social preventive action may prove to be much more important than medical treatment. The other phrase about which I desire to say a few words is the expression, "" benefits to students"". I am a little uncertain as to the scope of benefits to students-benefit s which are very liberal, and I have a warm appreciation of what has been done in that regard-ar e being provided under the repatriation powers of the Commonwealth. As far as it goes, the expression is quite all right, but again, it deals with only a fraction of the total problem-the total problem being the assistance of education generally. Grants to the States in aid of education, I agree, can in any event be safely made under section 96; of the Constitution, and they should be made, because for reasons' which I discussed at some length on an earlier occasion, it seems, to me that, as time passes, the Commonwealth is bound to accept increasing responsibility for education. Therefore, my reference to "" benefits to students "" is made, not with a viewto condemning government action for the purpose of benefiting studentsI support it-bu t to point out that it represents only one small fraction of a total problem, ' and, consequently, represents what. I describe, as a piecemeal treatment of a large problem. I turn from that matter to the second bill, upon which I desire, to make somesuggestions for the consideration of the House. The. second measure deals with marketing, and I make two preliminary observations about it. This problem, so far as it deals with section 92 of the Constitution-freedom of interstatetrade-was omitted from the referenin the referendum, but there was nothing: about qualifying the effect of section 92:",23,Honourable Members Why
83,Mr Menzies,A h application for,24,Honourable Members Why
84,Mr Chambers,I s there anything,24,Honourable Members Why
85,Mr Menzies,"I have a very greatNow. it is stated to be a matter of such urgency that it must be put before tbe people at the forthcoming election. My second preliminary observation is that this proposed amendment is entirely different from the one put forward by the Lyons Government in 1936-37. I want to explain that with some care, because there is a disposition in some quarters to believe that this particular proposal merely takes up a proposal with which a number of us on this side of the House were very actively associated in the referendum of 1937, and which agitated parties in such a way that a great number of people found themselves in opposition to it , who will undoubtedly find themselves supporting this one. On that occasion the proposal was that a new section-sectio n 92A-shoul d be inserted in the Constitution in these terms'.I lie provisions of the last preceding section shall not apply to laws with respect to marketing made by or under the autliority of the Parliament in the exercise of any powers vested in the Parliament by this Constitution. The whole idea of that proposed amendment, which would have prevented section 92 from invalidating a marketing law, was that validity should be given to joint Commonwealth and State marketing schemes. Honourable members will recall that before the war we had a great deal of experience-som e of it very painfulcf these matters. The Commonwealth and the States went into joint schemes in relation to wheat and dried fruits.' Each State passed a bill which dealt with trade in that commodity within its own boundaries, and the Commonwealth then put tbe coping stone on the structure by passing legislation which dealt with interstate trade in the same commodity, and it was hoped that between the two sets of legislation, the whole field of transactions in that commodity would be dealt with. out of the scheme? concerned with the production of that particular commodity, there were occasionally ways and means of overcoming the. problem. The real difficulty arose, not from the abstention 'of any one State, hut because section 92 cropped up and invalidated attempts which were made to restrict the interstate movement of goods. In that condition of affairs, we had certain good elements and one very bad element. Tbe good elements were these: It is a very good thing to have joint Commonwealth and State action on marketing matters. After all, the States control a great number of factors which tbe Commonwealth does not touch. The States are in charge of land settlement, agriculture, water supply, and production policies generally, whilst the Commonwealth had power to deal w it h interstate trade which enabled it to come to the lescue, provided section 92 did not operate to destroy the scheme. Another «dvantage was that Commonwealth and State schemes were invariably the subject matter of discussion between the governments. They became well known to the producers who were affected, and there was a general opinion developed, and a very wide representation of producer opinion at all relevant times. What the proposed amendment contemplated in 1936-37 was simply to prevent section 92 fro m invalidating joint Commonwealth and State marketing schemes. The proposed amendment in the bill sets out to do something quite different. It is designed to give to the Commonwealth power to deal with the organized marketing of primary products. That is a new power to be conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament, and. as the Attorney-General pointed out in his second-reading -speech, it is a power which will operate upon intrastate trade just as much as upon interstate trade. In other words it is a power which will enable the Commonwealth to deal with marketing transactions which begin and end in one State, and, consequently, it proceeds upon the footing that all that isneeded is a single Commonwealth control and not joint Commonwealth-State control. That, of course, means that there is a very sharp distinction between this amendment and the one with which some If that State was not of us were associated some years ago. amendment of 1944. now proposed to transfer the whole field of the organized marketing of primary products to the Commonwealth, and te-",24,Honourable Members Why

87,Mr Menzies,,25,Honourable Members Why
88,Mr Holt,And also the proposed,25,Honourable Members Why
89,Mr Menzies,"Yes. In brief, it isrender co-operation with the States unnecessary. That would produce a state of affairs in which the problems of production, which would still remain primarily problems for the States, and the problems of marketing, which would become, in effect, exclusively the problems of the Commonwealth, would be dealt with entirely separately, subject to this qualification., that the Commonwealth, by marketing legislation, might very well be able to exercise an indirect control over production without having any real responsibility for it. That would be a -bad business. It would be very unwise to deal with the problem of production and the problem of marketing in entirely separate compartments, each under tbe authority of a different legislature. It was for that reason that before the war we saw merit of joint Commonwealth and State action. I would have thought that k would be clear to most pf us that, if the organized marketing power were to be used in order to stabilize prices, the volume of production would probably liave a direct relation to the stabilized prices. Yet, under these proposals the volume of production, except for the indirect pressure which 1 have described, would remain a matter for the six State Parliaments, whereas tbe problem of the stabilized price would be under tbe jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament. To put it in another way, volume of production may be determined by the policies of six State governments and the price stabilization scheme would be under the exclusive control of the seventh Parliament, the Commonwealth Parliament. In using the word "" exclusive"" I do not desire the Attorney-General to take me as saying that it is not a concurrent power, but the exercise of it will make it, in effect, an exclusive power, because it will invalidate all State schemes inconsistent with it. The second comment I wish to make on cheese; yet we are told that a commodity tbe proposed amendment turns upon tbe like cheese must be regarded as a primary expression "" primary products "". That product. expression is not defined. The Attorney General brushed this problem aside by tration would probably be butter and sayingIn the ordinary popular sense primary products are understood to include not only the immediate products of such occupations as the could be developed in respect of those agricultural, dairying and pastoral Mr MensAes. but also certain processed goods derived directly from tliose products. All Australians, for instance, would immediately recognize butter, cheese, flour and dried fruits as' primary products, though not cakes or bread. I do not desire to use toostrong an expression, but it seems to me that that Statement is rather astray and somewhat misleading, if I may use that term inoffensively. . The expression "" primary products"" is not a technical one, and, indeed, so far as I have been able to discover, it is almost peculiar to Australia. My search through the Oxford Dictionary recently indicated that apparently the editor of that work bad not. met the. expression at all. Where an expression is used in a constitution, and that expression is not one of technical law, the. meaning of it must be ascertained so clearly the great by the courts by .evidence, the perusal of books, records and statutes, and by other means. By reference to contemporary sources, the courts inust determine whether there is an accepted and popular meaning for it .Soi f this amendment be accepted by tbe people, the High Court will be called upon, from time to time, to decide whether, as these words are understood, butter, cheese, coal, sugar, iron ore or anything else, is a primary product. said to be a secondary product. honourable member for Yarra and I would have a little difficulty, I venture to say, in regarding butter produced from a factory as a primary product; yet the Attorney-General says that under this legislation butter would be deemed to be a primary product. I should think it a novel use of language to say that a flour miller is a primary producer, yet we are assured that flour would be regarded as a primary product.

Let me say at once that I do not contend that that definition would bind any court, but it would be one source of information available to a court to determine what these words mean, because, as the Attorney-General knows, it has been the common practice of tbe H i g h Court, in determining the meaning of word's in a constitution which are not terms of art, to consult contemporary sources including contemporary "" p r i m a r y production"" are defined in ' the Income Tax Assessment Act as follows:Production resulting directly from the cultivation of land or the maintenance of animals or poultry for tlie purpose of selling them or their bodily produce, including natural increase, and includes the manufacture of dairy products by the person who produces the raw material used in that manufacture. The production of farm butter would come within that definition, but the production of butter in a factory in tlie ordinary course would not come within it , nor would the flour produced by a flour-miller or the cheese made by a cheese-maker come within the definition. It should be clearly understood by the public that the expression "" primary products"", ithough it will unquestionaibly include wool, wheat and live stock, may, and probably will, turn out not to include articles which result from processing certain goods. wool ? instance. In fact, the whole subject of processed products in a for m which is not the form in which they come from the farm would have .to be considered. able members will not invite me to say now what I think does and what does not f a l l within the definition. That question w ill have to be determined one fine day by tbe H i g h Court and. not by us. It w ill be determined in the light of such material as the court can get together. If there is to be a power to deal with primary products as distinct from others, then I suggest to the Attorney-General that, with all its difficulties, some definition should be undertaken; otherwise, many people who believe that they are to have the benefit of organized marketing will never obtain it . Tbe more I consider the terms of this amendment, the more remarkable it seems to me that tbe Government should have departed from the substantial terms of tbe 1936-37 amendment. Tbe very point that I have just been raising is another confirmation of that. The final point that I want to make on this amendment is this: The statutes. The words word "" organized"" also is one of uncertain meaning. All marketing conducted, under tbe authority or by direction of the law may be said to be in one sense "" organized "", since the law may be said to put such marketing into working order. friend should think that a contribution of this kind is mere "" straw-splitting"". It is not designed to be "" straw-splitting "". Everybody, and most of all tbe Attorney General, will agree that the more thought, we give to the words that wd write into a constitution-word s that arp not altered so easily as are those of an ordinary statute-tb e better. If the honourable member is quite satisfied to have his constitution-making done in a. slapdash, indifferent way, and regards every careful examination of the language used as mere "" straw-splitting "", the Constitution will turn out to be a very bitter disappointment to him. If this view as to the meaning of the word "" organized "" preT b a t is another vails, then the whole of the law relating to the sale of primary products, including the setting-up of boards, the licensing of those engaged in transactions, and the prices and terms and conditions of sales W h a t 'about tinned fish? will pass into the hands of the I hope that honorCommonwealth'.

103,Mr Menzies,"a full operation, notwithstanding the normal implications that may have been made in other paragraphs. But for the existence of paragraph (xxxvi.), it might have been said that the exercise of any one of a dozen powers in section 51 would have authorized Parliament to pass a law taking someone's property, and on that taking there would be no limitation whatever. with tbem all. therefore, been given a universal operation. It is the code on the subject of the acquisition of property. If there is in the Constitution specific reference to legislation on conciliation ard arbitration that provision becomes the code of such power on that point. My second comment is this: It may be said that the States have always had power to make laws .directly dealing with wages and hours of work, and that, in spite of this fact, no disaster has followed. It is an argument which I can almost hear the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) using in the most disarming fashion. Our industrial history shows that after the Parliament of New South Wales enacted the 44 hours week, the High Court decided in the Cowb'wrn case that the State act had no application to any case governed by an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Dp to that time there had existed a pleasirg belief that there was never any inconsistency between a Commonwealth and State law, provided a person was hopeful enough or rich enough to obey both. By the High Court's decision, the New South Wales act was so limited in its application that it became, to a very large degree, useless, and, in any event, gravely anomalous; because, if there are two authorities dealing with hours of work, one by statute and one by awards, the anomalies to which such a situation would give rise must produce many industrial l roubles. Consequently, ever since there has been a Commonwealth Arbitration Court, the scope of State legislation on such matters as .1 have mentioned has been restricted. But the moment the Commonwealth assumes power to legislate directly Kgarding wages and hours of work, pegging of wages, &c -eve n assuming that my earlier argument about the Arbitration Court is wrong-the functions of the court become so shrivelled that the court falls into a position of secondary importance. It becomes little more than a. board of reference to deal with some minor adjustmer<ts outside the major rules laid down by Parliament. The last phrase of the new power isand I can almost bear the discussion which preceded its framingbut not so as to authorize any form of industrial conscription. that? echo-of the last referendum campaign. I can imagine the honourable member for Griffith saying, "" This is no good. I have just beer studying the referendum figures. For heaven's sake let us get away from any suggestion of industrial conscription "". No doubt it is a very shrewd move. an act passed while the Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister. inserted in the act in recognition of a strong demand from the Labour party. If industrial conscription connotes industrial compulsion by the authority of law, will the amendment exclude compulsory unionism ? It is a matter upon which I should like some' enlightenment. If the -High Court decides that the new paragraph contains a full and express statement of the industrial law. I should like some assurance that the defence power will be available in tbe event of another war to uphold man-power controls, which, on the Government's own showing, were vitally necessary during this war. My last word is this: I have studied these three bills. I have pointed out various aspects of them which, in my opinion, deserve criticism, and other aspects in which improvement might be made by applying different methods; but all this leads to the conclusion that the proper course would have been to take steps to validate those social service measures which command general support, while putting all these other questions before a convention which might",29,Honourable Members Why

The Leader of tbe Opposition, in a manner that did him little credit, castigated the Government for having included in clause 2 the provision that alteration of the Constitution in the way proposed shall not "" authorize any form of industrial conscription "". How the "" boys"" would smile when they read that, he said. Yet it was he who first found it necessary to incorporate in legislation the words "" industrial conscription"", for, in moving the second reading of the National SecurityB ill 1939, he saidSub-clause 7 contains a new provision which was not in the war precautions legislation. It reads"" Nothing in tliis section shall authorize(a) the imposition of any form of compulsory naval, military, or air force '[8.7] -This is not the first occasion on service, or any form of industrial conscription."" I wonder whether tbe "" boys "" smiled on that occasion. As the Menzies Government realized the need for a provision against industrial conscription in tbe National Security Act, so this Government desires .to make it clear in concise terms that, in giving power to this Parliament to control terms and conditions of employment ""in industry, the people would not be giving it power to impose industrial conscription. The Government desires when the referendum is held to protect the people from being hoodwinked by misrepresentation of the sort that tbe Opposition indulged in at the last referendum. What objection can there be to power over employment being given to the Commonwealth Parliament? Given that power this Parliament will be able to regulate wages, working hours, and holidays, on a uniform basis for the whole of Australia. The time is' ripe for an end to be brought to interstate jealousies and the difficulties arising from varying wages and hours in the different States. My own State, South Australia, has profited in the last twelve months as the result of tbe operation of certain conditions in another State, but I speak nationally and have no regard for State boundaries, those imaginary lines that have .retarded this country's progress. This is the National Parliament, and it should have the right to dictate a uniform set of industrial conditions for the nation. I think the people will agree with' me. Tb'ey will realize that they must ensure that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have the power to legislate for social services, orderly, marketing, and terms and conditions of employment in industry. Given those powers, whatever party be in power will be able to legislate in the best interests of the people. I do not spea'k politically. If the Menzies Government were still in power and asked the electors to vote "" Yes"" on the three questions that this Government intends to put before them, I would support it. Hence, I hope that the Opposition will forget party issues 'and ask the electors to carry these three, bills unanimously on election day. which the Parliament has been asked to agree to certain bills having for their .object the amendment of the Constitution by way of an appeal to the people of Australia. There is no need to go over the ancient history of these matters, except to say that the Constitution of the Commonwealth is a peculiar document. By its very nature it must be one of the outstanding acts of any federated country. Tbe TJnited States of America, Canada, South Africa, Switzerland and Australia are examples of democracy operating under federal constitutions.

130,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"contained in the Constitution are not always the methods that are the most acceptable to the people who have to give consent. The method incorporated in tbe Australian Constitution, I think, is one of the most cumbersome, lopsided methods in any Constitution. Government after government has attempted over a long period of years to secure alteration of the Commonwealth Constitution, but I think only two of the many attempts have been successful. One was in 1905 or 1906, when the people consented to an alteration of tbe method of electing the Senate. The other gave the Commonwealth certain authority over, and infinitely more responsibility for, the debts of the six States. SinceI came to this. Parliament, about twelve years ago, two other attempts have been made to alter the Constitution. side in 1937, when we tried for two amendments, one to surmount what were believed at that time to be, but have since proved to be not quite what we thought they were, the difficulties arising out of -the adverse decision of the* Privy Council in the James case relating to dried fruits.' The other was a simple matter concerning aviation. down overwhelmingly by the people. Less tban two years ago, the present Government believed that the people, having returned it with overwhelming numbers, would agree to any alteration of the Constitution it cared to submit to tbem. A very interesting bill was passed through this Parliament. It had every bit of trimming and icing from a wedding gown down to a birthday cake, but it was not acceptable to the people. It didnot receive the support of a majority of the voters or a majority of the Sta tes.. Only two States out pf the six voted for it. Tbe Attorney-General is an able lawyer, and, no doubt, a persistent man. I have no doubt that if some day he came to the table and told us exactly what bis ambitions were when he entered this Parliament, we should learn that one of the foremost was that he should be able to. say, "" I got the people of Australia to alter the Constitution in the way I said it should be altered "".. Now he is having a second stab at altering the Constitution, but this time he is submitMr Archie Cameron. ting his proposals in three separate parts. I thought that, having regard to the importance of the proposed changes he was asking the Parliament to submit to the people, the right honourable gentleman's three speeches w.ere extremely short. I also thought them remarkable, not for what they said, but for what they did not say. I think the bills remarkable, too, not for what they ask the people to agree to, but for what the right honourable gentleman hopes they will agree to, which is not plainly stated in them. I intend to deal first with tbe three speeches. He talked about the all-Australian purposes for which money is raised by the Parliament. He said that the Parliament ought to be able to spend for any Australian purpose the money it raised. Exactly what does that mean? He gave u= two interpretations of section 81 of I was on the "" Yes"" the Constitution. It is clear that section 81 has been interpreted by the High Court in the way in which, perhaps, any common-sense man would interpret it, namely, the only purpose for which the Commonwealth Parliament can spend federal revenue is a. purpose permitted by the Constitution. Any other construction of section 81 is Both were turned unthinkable. In my view, any other construction would produce a ntatp of affairs in which no State parliament would have the right to exist, let alone govern, if the Commonwealth Parliament decided to trespass on its preserves. This bill is framed in a most alluring way. The right honourable gentleman put down a list of the things over which he wants power. I shall deal with them one by one. Maternity allowances were introduced into tbe Commonwealth by a Labour government in 1912 and have been in operation ever since. There has been no attempt by any one to upset them. There has been no question in party politics of their being invalid or opposed. No party has threatened to remove tbem from the statute-book. No personhas appealed to any court challenging the constitutional validity of those payments. That being so, why does the Attorney-General, after the lapse of 35 years, discover some vague doubt, some probability of challenge, or some vague intangible reason why these payments, may no longer be deemed to be constitutional? He cannot sustain any argument there, and obviously the reference to maternity allowances has been included for some political purpose. Widows' pensions have not been challenged from either side of the House. Nobody has appealed to tbe High Court or to any other court, claiming that the Commonwealth did not possess constitutional power to make those payments. T remember perfectly well, and the Prime Minister will also remember, that ii? 1941 the Child Endowment Bill was introduced in this chamber by a government formed by the parties who now form the Opposition. orable members opposite quarrelled among themselves and it was the Labour parly which, in fact, passed tbe bill. honourable member for Griffith( Mr adopt is to take the country into its conConelan) wants a little dissertation on the subject of members of parties quarrelling among themselves, 1 can give it to h im. ber is qualified to do so. want to pursue that matter to-night, but if we ever discuss the history of quarrels in this chamber, I shall be able to portray the honourable member'sdifficulties with the Labour party, and that will not, suit bim. -Order!

I remember when the National Insurance Bill was passed in this Parliament, with great difficulty I admit, and with not very much support from honourable .members opposite. No question was raised then regarding the constitutionality of the bill and the payments which might have been made under it. Mr Conelan interjecting, member of the Government which introduced the National Insurance Bill, and 1 know a good deal about its history. However, this is not the time for me to deal with that aspect. It may suit the honourable member's book because, I am well aware that he will have some difficulty in explaining to his constituents his attitude towards some of these matters. the Chairi f the honorable member for Barker will return to the bill. to be mentioned are sickness and hospital benefits, and accompanying them are medical and dental services. The Attorney-General is not seeking two separate powers. He is asking for one power divided under two heads, and the objective of the present Government, if it were stated clearly and openly, would be to nationalize tbe medical and health services of Australia. I have no objection to the Labour party adopting that as a political plank and as a goal that it desires to attain, but if that be its aim, the proper course for the Government to fidence aud announce frankly what it proposes to do under this provision. The real reason why maternity allowances, widow's pensions, child endowment and unemployment benefits, have been included in the Government's referendum proposals is to give to tbe pill a coating of sugar-medica l and dental services and hospital benefits-becaus e some doubt exists as to whether this will be acceptable to the community. If the Prime Minister desires this Parliament to have power over medical and dental services and hospital benefits, there, is no need to include in the bill any reference to the other items, but he desires to . create iu tbe minds of the people the belief that, if they do not endorse the. Government's proposals, they will lose maternity allowances, widow's pensions and child endowment. In my opinion, that, is not the proper approach to these matters. It 'would be better, in what is reputed to be a democratic community, if the objectives of tbe Government were stated openly and clearly, and without equivocation and any attempt at camouflage. In addition, the bill provides for ""benefits to students"". I do not know what that expression means. Tbe Attorney-General did not define it. Therefore, the electorate is asked to vote for something which has not been explained and which may not be clarified later. Again, that is so much window",33,Honourable Members Why

Not one of those conditions has been complied with, and, therefore, I contend that the electorate will need to be extremely careful about accepting the provisionsof the bill. 1 come now to the second bill, which provides for the alteration of the Constitution by empowering the Parliament to make laws providing for the oi'ganized' marketing of primary products, unrestricted by section 92 of tbe Constitution. I do not wish to repeat the comments which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) uttered this afternoon, but I desire ' to examine closely the Attorney-General's speech.. He said, firstThe object of tliis bill is to alter the Conland:, tbe producer received a circular sitution so that this National Parliament can deal effectively with what has become one of Australia's most urgent national problems-the organized marketingof primary products.' The Commonwealth has done so during the war. My comment, on that is that during, the war, there has been a! lot of disorganized marketing of. primary products. was, inevitable.. It beganwith the outbreak of war, _ because Australia's, export markets were cut off. I was Minister for Commerce for a few months in 1940 reflection on the country. see how that was a shocking reflection on the country, but I say, as a statement of fact, that we were not able to export certain surplus primary products, including, apples; That, compelled the Government to establish a board to handle the apple surplus. That board, however it was constituted, must have offended some interests, because we had several I do not know of any million bushels of fresh apples which no other country could acquire from us; not because it did not want them, but because it could not provide the requisite shipping. Our inability to exportour surplus primary products gave rise to serious problems. The Attorney General, in his speech also said. Many primary producers are apprehensive of the future if the Parliament cannot continue to do so during the years of peace, and particularly during the difficult years that lie immediately ahead. In particular I instance organizations of growers of wheat, barley and potatoes. One of the primary industries in my electorate is potato-growing: Last year, under Commonwealth control, a potatogrower was compelled to enter into a contract with the Commonwealth before he was permitted to grow potatoes for marketing. One grower was told to prepare a certain acreage for seeding, and was notified in writing what the acreage was to be. The preparation of tbe land for a potato crop is not completed when it has been ploughed once with a team or tractor.. The operation requires five or six workings of the soil, according to the district in which the grower has his property. After he had prepared the instructing him to reduce tbe acreage by 25per cent. Other .operations of that board were equally fantasticand foolish. Producers Were not permitted to harvest and market their crops when they were ready. Many were told to leave their potatoes in the ground until an officer That, of the Potato Control Board telephoned them or notified them in writing how many tons of potatoes they should dig, and when they should market them. The price, of course, was fixed by the Commonwealth Government. In my opinion, the producers of Australia do not want a shocking a continuation of that kind of control. In his speech the Attorney-General instanced in particular the organizations of wheat, barley, and potato-growers. To begin with, potatoes are never exported from Australia. I put, it to the right honourable gentleman that there is a vitaldistinction, between the orderly marketing of export commodities like wheat and barley, and the marketing of potatoes and onions, which, are not export commodities.",35,Honourable Members Why

I do not know of many people who like them raw, hut some people w ill get a raw deal under this bill. must be drawn from rhe speech of the honourable member is that tbe H i g h Court judges are half-wits. not said or suggested anything of the sort. The job of the judges is to interpret the law. It is not their job to put their thoughts into the minds of legislators. If ihe Government desires to use the term "" primary products "" it should define it . Unless the term be defined there will be many disagreements on the H i gh Court -Bench as there are in this House about the meaning of the term. We should not itake. that risk. We must remember, too, ithat some of the members of the High Court Bench have been members of this iHouse, and it may be that in tbe not distant future their number will be increased. 'The Attorney-General said, in bis speechThe general object has always been to bring about price stability in the primary industries, to assist them to bear the heavy burdens of .climatic uncertainty and world competition, and to ensure for primary producers a reasonable standard of living and adequate economic security. The methods used have included "".pooling'', compulsory or voluntary; ""orderly marketing"" by means of zoning, quotas and the like; and arrangements to ensure better grading, packing, advertising and so forth. I contend that the Government already has the power referred to by the right honourable gentleman. It has exercised such power when the country has been at peace and when it has been, at war. I have administered certain legislation as a Minister of the Crown, and I know what has been done in this regard. Action has been taken already by Commonwealth Governments to grade, pack and advertise our primary products. The Attorney-General cannot expect to be able to sustain in this House the argument that if , the Government be given the powers which are being sought in prices af.which Australian produce w ill be sold in overseas markets; yet unless he can do that very thing the case he has stated must f a l l to the ground. I do not know much about overseas trading conditions at present, but I have a strong suspicion that when peace finally arrives -and it looks like being much delayed -ther e will be less trading between merchant and merchant and very much more trading between government and government. Some honourable gentlemen opposite are indicating by interjections their approval of that state of affairs, but I do not approve of it . May I point out that recently the United Kingdom Government, which honourable gentlemen opposite no doubt are happy to follow, appointed a cotton purchasing board which was charged with the responsibility of purchasing all tbe cotton requirements of the United Kingdom. There is to be only one purchasing authority for the United Kingdom, and it is to be a government authority. The cotton organization may be enlarged, and if it be ' enlarged it may also cover wool. Anyway, an agreement with a currency of fourteen years has recently been made between this Government and the United Kingdom Government for tbe pur. chase of Australianwool. Tbat procedure may be followed in regard to wheat and other commodities. If that kind of dealing is to go on what will be our position if our Constitution be altered? Undoubtedly some kind of a bargaining agreement will be made between the Commonwealth of Australia and the United Kingdom. What could be the effect of such an agreement? This Government already has power, which was used without hesitation even before the war, under which certain prices and standards were fixed. If the local price of an articlp involved in such an arrangement did-not appear to be satisfactory, the Government exercised constitutional power which it already possesses to provide bounties to enhance the local price. There, is an important provision in relation tobounties, however, to the effect that they must be distributed equally ' among all producers in all States. If the constitution amendment which the Government is now proposing be accepted bounties may not be payable on an equal basis.",37,Honourable Members Why

If this proposed amendment of the Constitution be accepted, does the Labour party intend to provide differential rates for produce in different States of Australia? ferential rates are justified. the answer I wanted.

ARCHIE CAMERON -What I wish to know .is how the producers of Australia will stand if this proposed amendment of the Constitution be accepted. Tbe honourable member for Ballarat, can speak with a certain amount of immediateexperience on this matter, and I have been extremely interested in b-is comments. I shall also be interested to hear him speak on these bills. Tbe producers of Australiado not desire an alteration of the Constitution under which any Government may fix conditions. I d'o' not believe that the producers desire discriminatory variations in payments for the same commodity in various parts of Australia. The producershave become sick of Government controls during the WBT. They do not desire war-time controls to be carried into peace-time. They remember some of the objectionable things that have been done during the war. In Western Australia, for example, wheat growers atone stage were paid 1'2-s. 6d. an acre not to grow wheat. Nevertheless wheat stocks accumulated there. B i the Wimmeradistrict a distillery was constructed' to turn wheat into power alcohol , and' when the factory was 5 ready wheat was not available for the purpose. Another huge distillery was erected at Wallaroo, in the electorate of Grey. I believe there is one in New South Wales, and maybe there is also one in Western Australia. Wherever one looks at industry to-day, one finds that there is dissatisfaction with the existing controls. That applies in respect of the production of applets, wheat, barley, potatoes and' onions. Wherever one goes among primary producers, the continuing exercise of authority under war-time regulations is questioned-. What the Labour party asks, to-day is that there shall .be carried intoa time of peace tlieauthority to dothose things that have""been done under the stress of -war. I do not believe that the producers will agree to that.. Let us consider for a moment the production of wheat,, whichmay becomea political issue before long. There, is no necessity for an alteration of the Constitution to enable 'he Government, to do what it is doing under the present wheat plan. It proposes to carry on that plan for a period of five years,, and under it to pay a guaranteed price. It does not ask for an alteration of the Constitution in order that it may do that. The Attorney General appeared in a somewhat new role recently when he argued this matter in the wheat-growing areas. He did not tell tbe wheat-growers that the Constitution bad to be altered in order that they might, receive a guaranteed payment of 5s. 2d. a bushel for five years. I ask the rigbt honourable gentleman, when replying io the debate, to say whether it is necessary to alter the Constitution in order to give effect to tlie payment of a guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel. I do not think that he will say that it is.. He has been rather vocal lately in regard to the producers being so much better off than they were under certain other conditions. A table has been produced to show theincreases of their incomes. The income of any farmer has a direct relationshipto two factors, seasons and ' prices. Given reasonable -seasons, and good prices, whether those prices happen to be-the-normal prices obtainable for a product in the markets of the world or prices fixed by the Government under war-time conditions, or otherwise, the conditions are not altogether normal. From 1942 to 1946 there have been acts of tbe Commonwealth Parliament which have fi xed prices for certain primary products. ; In some instances, these have been record prices. There have been record prices in the dairying industry, for a period of years in the potato industry, for onions, and in some instances for fruits. I have 1 never known stone fruits to be dearer than they have been this year. A record price was paid for apples in South Australia last year. I had to pay l is . a casefor "" Statesman "". I could not buy a "" Democrat"" for any price; that variety",39,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The
164,Mr Archie Cameron,But a,40,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The
165,"Mr Speaker,","Order! I shalljust would not grow. While such prices exist, it stands to reason that a table such as that produced by the Attorney-General will reflect the conditions of the industry. .But those increases of average in comes have been brought about, not by reason of any particular political virtue in the Government, but because the Go-_ vernment decided, as an act of policy, that it would make certain bounty payments, or fixed price payments, for commodities. So long as it is .prepared to continue along those lines it w ill be able to produce a table of the type cited by the A t torn ey-Gen er al. The other point which the right honourable gentleman made was in regard to the way in which mortgages had been paid off. It stands to reason that if you have conditions operating such as have operated during the last few years, under which men received record money incomes but were not able to spend very much on replacements, repairs, new buildings, machinery, top-dressing and that sort of thing, there should be heavy reductions of the indebtedness of tbe farming community. But I put it to the Attorney General that as soon as certain controls liavebeen lifted and the farming community can purchase machinery, wire netting, piping, galvanized iron, and everything else that is required for repairs and construction, the reverse side of the picture w ill be revealed, and, whatever my be tbe income, a much higher proportion of it w ill be used, not to reduce mortgages, but to overtake the very great leeway which occurred in primary production during tbe war years. Therefore, from my point of view these tables do not mean very much. I come now to the third bill, which maintain that, nobody else is .entitled to deals with industrial control. The immine coal. They -may go on strike portant feature of it is that it refers to whenever, they like, for no reason, or ""industrial conscription"". I do not for any excuse that they can think of on know what party the .Attorney-General the spur of the moment, notwithstanding had in mind when be mentioned the that they may dislocate the services of a possibility of industrial conscription in whole city, as they did last Christmas. time of peace. [Extension of time No industrial arrangements can be cargranted.} The conditions which ought ried on satisfactorily under such con to produce industrial peace in any comditions. Whatever the Attorney-General munity are constant work, good wages, may say about establishing in Australia and opportunities for a man to improve conditions which will attract immigrants bis position. Those conditions cannot to this country and improve the prospects prevail under the present control, and I do of new businesses being started, the first not see how they are going to improvein prospect, at any rate-by the alteration of tbe Constitution proposed by tbe right honourable gentleman. What he is really aiming at is to put into effect the generation-old policy of the Labour j-arty, that all control of industry in regard to rates of wages, hours of work, conditions of labour and everything else shall be determined by statute, or by some other means in this Parliament. no question as to where the honourable members opposite stand.' in respect of wheat, it is also good in respect of wages. matter is not one which can be determined very easily in this Parliament. Not many of us would essay to establish ourselves as judges on such a matter. It can be determined only by properly constituted tribunals which are vested with f u l l authority to make an investigation of tbe different factors concerned, and of tbe effect of certain judgments on industrv generally, if given effect. The Attorney-General also saidYou cannot secure and sustain increased production unless yo.u can secure terms and conditions upon which employers and employees alike are willing to work. Broadly, this is what the war-time national powers achieved. A willingness to work is one of the outstanding deficiencies in Australian industry to-day. There is a distinct unwillingness on the part of many persons to engage in the occupation which they seem to contend is theirs by some special right. The coal-miners, for example, :",40,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The

169,Mr Archie Cameron,"Th eessential is a real approach to industrial peace; and I consider that that will not be attainable until there is a distinct exhibition of willingness on the part of those engaged in industry, whether employees or employers, to abide by the decisions of the Arbitration Courts. There is to-day too much of a tendency to depart from those decisions. I cannot see how we shall improve the prospects of industrial peace by getting farther away from the arbitration courts, as this proposed alteration must take us, and making rates of wages-for example, the basic wagea political issue in the Commonwealth Parliament. I have heard honourable members opposite, as well as on my own side, deplore quite sincerely on more tban one occasion that certain industries bad become, to use their own expression, a "" political football"" in the Parliament. If you make the basic wage and the conditions of industry generally a "" political football "" for all time, I shudder to think what will be the industrial conditions under which our economic life will have to be carried on. The time has arrived for a thorough overhaul of the Australian Constitution. I am not one of those who say that the Constitution as drafted in 1S99 is sacrosanct and must not be questioned or altered. But I do believe, from the experience of referendums that have been submitted, that the general temper of the people demands that any proposed alterations shall be agreed upon at a properly constituted national convention, at which each of the six States will be equally represented. in' the Constitution for another convention. no provision in the Constitution, or in any law, for conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers, yet they are held in this chamber time and again, and are among the most useful gatherings that take place in the Commonwealth. Consequently, it does not follow that what I have suggested should not be done. That is a most reactionary view for any Minister to take. honourable gentleman believed in governing by the law. tainly believe in government by the law. But this is a question not of the law but of making the law, of devising means under which a properly constituted body may calmly and dispassionately consider what are the defects of the Australian , Constitution' as it stands to-day, and what alterations of it have been made necessary by tbe lapse of the time and the new conditions that have arisen, partly as the result of our growth, partly as the result of the disparity of increase in the three big States compared with the three small States, and partly as the result of the impact of two great wars on the economic and social life of Australia. Those are matters which require calm, dispassionate consideration by men who, perhaps, are not very closely connected with politics, but have a fair knowledge and experience which will enable them to say how the Constitution ought to be framed in order to allow the political and economic life of the country to be restored to that healthy condition which I believe to be necessary, but which most certainly will not be achieved even if these proposed alterations are agreed to by the people. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) said a great deal, but very little of what be said was to the point. This debate is a. forerunner of the confusion that is likely to arise when the referendum proposals are before the people. It will be necessary for the Government to state its case very clearly and very simply, because there will then be many persons who, like the honourable member for Barker, will set out to confuse the minds of tbe people. A referendum was held in 1944 in which . tbe Government asked tbe people to grant to the Commonwealth Parliament fourteen additional powers. This request was refused, and in October last,, the High Court had before it a, case in which the Attorney-General of Victoria brought an action against the Commonwealth of Australia in respect of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act. In that ease it was decided that the Attorney General of a State was entitled to bring an action for a declaration",41,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The

The Commonwealth Parliament had passed the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act, a fine piece of legislation, designed to provide free medicines for the people of Australia through the agency of approved chemists. Victoria, when the Dunstan Government was in power, asked the H i g h Court to declare this act invalid. The High Court gave the matter deep consideration, and after hearing argument, reserved its decision. Then, on the 19th November, it declared that the Pharmaceutical Benefits.Act was invalid ; that, in fact, the Commonwealth Parliament . had no power under the Constitution to pass an act of that kind. The judges were at great pains to state their reasons for the decision, and it is evident from those reasons that other Commonwealth legislation, providing for social services, some of which have , been in operation for many years, w ill most probably also beinvalid. The provision of such social pcrvices as maternity allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, widows' pensions, and child endowment may be outside the power of the Commonwealth. !it expected that the Government shall stand idly by without taking action to place beyond question. the power of the Commonwealth in respect to these -matters, when it is open to the Attorney General of any State, at any time, to move the H i g h Court for a declaration that tbe legislation is invalid? If such a declaration were made by the H i g h Court in respect of other social services there might be no child endowment., no unemployment and sickness benefits, no widows' pensions and no maternity allowances. admit that maternity allowances represent a magnificent social benefit by which a woman may draw a certain sum of money before the birth of ber child, a fprthcr sum upon its birth, and receive rtill further payment later on. member think that tbe power of the Commonwealth to legislate in respect to such matters should be written clearly into tbe Constitution? be no going to the H i g h Court for rulings regarding tbe validity of Commonwealth legislation ? member for New England reads the Tbe Attorney-General of judgment delivered by the justices of the High Court .in tbe Pharmaceutical Benefits case, he w ill see that it is almost certain that if some other phases of Commonwealth social service legislation were challenged they would be declared invalid. After the decision to which I have referred, the Government bad the advice of five eminent lawyers regarding the validity of Commonwealth social service legislation. All of them, including Mr. Barwick, KC., of New South Wales, said that the powers of the Commonwealth were doubtful in respect of unemployment and. sickness benefits, maternity allowances, widows' pensions and child endowment. Commonwealth power was valid in regard to old-age and invalid pensions, because it was expressly written into the Constitution. When we read the judgment of the H i g h Court, and study tbe Constitution itself, it is difficult to understand how any one could have advised the Commonwealth Government that Parliament had power to pass legislation in respect to the social service.* referred to. Those who gave that advice were obviously relying on section S'J. of the Constitution, which r e a d s All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to-be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. Sections 51 and 52 clearly set out Honourable members w ill what, powers the Commonwealth Government possesses, and some of the adviser!"" of the Commonwealth Government havt bared their advice upon flimsy arguments indeed. The High Court did not seem to have much difficulty in arriving at tbe conclusion that there was no legal power in tbe Commonwealth Parliament' to legislate in regard to certain social Nowi t is proposed to ask tbe people for authority to have tbe powers now in doubt",42,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The

The people will be asked to vote in respect of three powers only--social legislation, organized marketing and the, terms and conditions of employment. I regard the last as the provision of a 40-hours week. It is proposed that the people sball vote on these three proposals separately, in contra-distinction io the method followed at the last referendum, when, they were required to accept or reject the Government's proposals an bloc. This time it will be competent for the electors to accept or reject any one of the powers. The referendum i* to be' held on the same day as the general elections. This is a very wise decision. For one thing, it will save tlie country the expenditure of at least C30,000, and it will enable the issue to lie put more clearly. At the last referendum the people were asked to grant so many powers that they were confused, and State representatives were frightened that if tbe powers were granted State parliaments would be reduced to the ;tatas of shire councils. Therefore, they were naturally opposed to the granting of the powers. Another advantage of holding tbe referendum on election day is ihat the entire Labour organization will iv> mobilized to put the case before the people. The Labour candidate in every ' Icctorate will be -the advocate for the Government's referendum proposal. Let :\\f emphasize that the Government is not asking for new powers in regard to social services. It is only asking the people to confirm the Commonwealth Parliament in the use ofpowers which it has long exercised. A doubt has been ihrown on the validity of those powers, and the Government is asking""that that doubt be removed. This disposes of the old argument that the people should not. i rust the Labour party with more power. Those who attempt to employ that argument during the forthcoming 'campaign will, in effect, be confessing their belief that the Labour party is going to win the elections, whereas no one who votes on election day can be sure who will win. It would be a disaster for the country if the Government's proposals for the alteration of the Constitution were to be rejected. The people are demanding social and. Mr Williams. 'economic security. They are demanding the four freedoms, including freedom -from want. Therefore, it is imperative that the powers which have, in fact, been .exercised by the Commonwealth for many years, should be written into the Constitution for ever. The High Court' has -declared that certain-social security legislation is of doubtful validity. The Government has published the opinion of -eminent barristers to the same effect. What will be the position if the powers sought by the Government be refused? It is open to the Attorney-General of -any State to go to the High Court and challenge the social service acts. If that happens, these acts' that we have regarded in tbe past as being valid may be held to be invalid. What will be the position then? The people will be without this excellent legislation which was passed for the relief of the oppressed. It has been contended by honourable members opposite that the States can pass the appropriate legislation. But the States might not do so, and, even if the lower Houses in the 'State legislatures did agree to such laws, it is probable that the Legislative Councils would reject them. Tbe people of Australia should know that this excellent 'legislation is on our statute book and that : by voting for it at the referendum they keep it there for all time. I now come to the bill dealing with terms and conditions of employment in 'industry -For some time past, organized labour in Australia has been pressing the Government to take steps to introduce a 40-hour working week. The Government has .said that it has no power to introduce legislation for this purpose or for the purpose of fixing the basic wage.

It'has been contended that the Commonwealth might have the power under the External Affairs powers granted by .section 51 (xxix.) of tbe Constitution,. The Commonwealth was an original -party to the Treaty of Versailles, Part XIII . of which set up a permanent labour organization. The decisions of the International Labour Office are .in the form of recommendations, or draft conventions, and it was thought that, if these recomnierdations wore adopted in Australia, they would have tbe form of a treaty and that, acting under that power, the Commonwealth could legislate for a 40hours week. In the case of King v. Burgess, ex parte Henry, Mr Justice Evatt. as lie then was, and Mr Justice McTicrnan said this, in a joint judgment. . the legislative power of the Commonwealth over ""external a f f a i r s"" certainly includes tlie power to execute within the Commonwealth treaties and conventions entered into with foreign powers. The legislative pi.wi-r in section 51 is granted ""subject to this -Constitution "" ventions could not bo used to enable the Parliament to set at nought constitutional guarantees elsewhere contained, such, for instaiict"". as sections 0. 28, 41, SO. 02,'00. 100, l l l i , or 117.

The Leader of the Opposition said he hoped that this Parliament would not fix hours of labour. I hope that it will do so. We have been elected by the people to govern the country. Why should we hesitate to fix the hours of ""labour for the workers? Once elected by the people, we have a duty to govern rightly on their behalf. If we take . the view that a 40-hours week is essential in all industries, we should have the courage to pass legislation for that purpose. We should also legislate to fix tbe minimum basic wage.

If it does so, it will do something really decent for the workers. I refer now to the bill dealing with organized "" marketing of primary products. Labour regime, farmers experienced prosperity. The Country party, which professes to be the friend of the farmers, shared in the administration of the Commonwealth for years prior to the war, but it did not do half so much for primary producers as the Labour party did in a few years. Tbe Labour Government was able to achieve a great deal for the farmers because it was assisted by the defence powers which operated during the war. The Attorney-General did not state in bis second reading speech what the Government proposes to do with respect to organized marketing, but doubtless the electors will be informed. Farmers want to know a great deal about organized marketing. ' I take the view that the power sought by the Government ought to be granted. I am confident, that, if it is granted, it will be widely used for the benefit of primary producers. Figures have been cited to prove tbe great prosperity experienced by farmers in recent years. We do' not want tbe farmers to go back to the conditions of the bad old days, when they bad to sell oranges, for instance, at .4s. or 5s. a case. We want to keep prices for primary products at. a high level, and that can be achieved only by sound organization of marketing. So this Government is to go to the people again with a referendum asking for the granting of three 'important powers. The first request is for the people to place beyond doubt the right of the Commonwealth Parliament to exercise certain powers .which it has used in the past and under which it has enacted --cine very fine social security legislation. examine tbe exact meaning of the We want the' people to write that power into the Constitution for all time. We wpnt thp people also to give,to this ParMr Williams. liament the power to fix maximum hours of labour and minimum wages. There have been attacks upon the arbitration system, and such attacks will continue to be made. The system has its merits, but there are certain things which the Arbitration Court cannot do but this Parliament can do. In the important years immediately ahead, the Commonwealth Parliament should be all-powerful with regard to hours of labour, wages, and conditions of employment. I trust During the war, under a that tbe Government will state its case clearly and simply to the electors, and that the Prime Minister will state, in his policy Speech, exactly what the Government proposes to do in the immediate future if it is given the powers which it seeks. In bis opening remarks, the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Williams) said that, speakers on the Opposition side of the House had used certain arguments for tbe purpose of confusing the minds of the people. I point out to tbe honourable member and to the House that, in the submission of proposed alterations to a referendum and in the writing of new powers into the Constitution, is is absolutely essential for the people to know exactly what the Government's proposals mean. The careful analysis by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) of tbe proposed Constitution alterations, not for party political purposes, was in the interests of the people, for it enables them to understand exactly the implications. It is the duty of every honourable member, on this or the other side, regardless of whether he supports these proposals or not, to dissect them and ask the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) to explain their meaning so that, as the Leader o! tbe Opposition said, the people shall no'. be called upon to vote in the dark, but sball know what they are voting on. We had a curious example in the first ten minutes of the speech of tbe honoraJble member for Robertson supporting tbe point made by the Leader of the Opposition as to the necessity to proposals. The honourable member said that the alterations would be written into tbe Constitution in terms the meaning of",45,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The
184,Mr Abbott (New England) [9.29].,"which would not be open to doubt. Yet, the Attorney-General himself admitted grave doubt as to how the proposed new powers would be interpreted if granted. He went on to say that he did not propose to interpret them, but would leave that to the court. This is a sovereign Parliament, bound only by the Commonwealth Constitution. It should not always have to be turning to the court for interpretation because of slack and inefficient draftin g of alterations of the Constitution. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to make perfectly clear the meaning of referendum. proposals, instead of making proposals which, if agreed to, w i ll have to be interpreted by the court. The right honourable gentleman said in bis second-reading speech on the Constitutional Alteration (Organized Marketing of Primary Products) B ill the expression "" primary products "" is not a technical term, with a fixed legal meaning. So, like Easter, which wanders round the year, its meaning wanders round the firmament. He went on to sayBut the phrase is in such general use that there'will seldom be any doubt as to whether or not a particular commodity belongs to the category of "" primary products"". In the ordinary popular sense, "" primary products"" are understood to include not only the immedate products of such occupations as the agricultural, dairying and pastoral industries, but also certain processed goods derived directly from tliose product's. All Australians, for instance, would immediately recognize butter, cheese, flour, and dried fruits as primary product*"", though not cakes or bread. Then he saidThere may, of course, be borderline cases. But there are dangers in attempting to define in advance the categories of constitutional power. The exceptional cases, if they arise, can safely be left for decision by the courts. Yet the honourable member for Bobertson said that the proposals now made were so clear that there would be no need to go to the court for interpretation. That shows why honourable members on this side, particularly tbe Leader of the Opposition, have carefully analysed these proposals. Thev have done so in order that the people may understand what they mean, not merely what the Government says they mean. In 1944, when the Attorney-General passed through the Parliament a bill for a referendum asking tbe people to grant the Commonwealth Parliament fourteen new powers, he made many speeches throughout the country, and, also, in this House, in which he referred to the Australian Constitution as a "" horse and buggy"" Constitution operating in the age of motor cars and aeroplanes. He urged that the Constitution be brought up to date. But what did he dd? He tried to put a new set of shoes"" on the old grey mare, and a new hood on the buggy, and to tighten the tyres on the wheels. He made no attempt to overhaul the Constitution, although that is essential. Neither does he do so now. All he tried to do then, as he tries to do now, was to effect a few patchwork repairs, to put the old grey mare back in the shafts and go once more along the road. The powers that he asked for on the last occasion contained some that no people would normally refuse, but others so nauseated the people that they rejected the lot. That referendum was something like' a dose of castor oil which has been so messed about by the addition of lemon juice, whisky and other things in tbe hope of making it more palatable that it becomes even more nauseating than in the beginning and causes violent sickness. The palates of the Australian people were so nauseated that they refused the mixture. The Australian people have had referendum after referendum submitted to tbem, but only those' that had the approval and support of all political parties have been carried. The people have even rejected referendums that'they have been advised to accept by all political parties not only in this Parliament but also in the .State Parliaments. So only with the greatest difficulty can the people be induced to agree to Constitution alterations The only prospect of obtaining their agreement lies in the unanimous support of the proposals by not only parliamentarians but also ""other bodies that have looked into their merits and accepted them as good. Time after time, we have seen the anomaly of one party opposing the referendum submitted by the other party and then making a similar proposal tn tbe people only to have it similarly turned down, because the other side has on that occasion been against it. That Canadian Parliament, is small. I propose applies to every political party. If the Constitution is to be modernized, mer School of Political Science held at taken from tbe "" horse-and-buggy "" stage Canberra between tbe 29th and 31st referred to by tbe Attorney-General, proJanuary, 1944 by Sergeant Bury in reply posals for its alteration must be cast in to an address delivered by tbe Attorneya form that will be approved by all poliGeneral. tical parties.

How can we operate a scheme of sickness and hospitals benefits if we do not control the hospitals? It is one thing to say, "" We shall give to the people hospital benefits "", but if the hospitals are controlled by the State Governments, bow can we be certain that efficient hospitalization can be provided ?

If unemployment were rife in the country districts of New South Wales, and control of unemployment were concentrated in Canberra, what would happen? An unemployed person would a Pply t° Canberra for relief, and after tbe lapse of some months, a notification would probably be posted to him that the "" Minister would call for a report"". The letter would have to be sent to the undertaker, because tbe unemployed person would have died in the meantime. This story that unemployment cannot be handled satisfactorily in Australia unless all authority to control it is centralized in the Commonwealth Government, does not convince me. When the Lang Government was in office, the Lyons Government granted to New.South Wales a large sum of money for the relief of unemployment. Grants in aid can be made by tbe Commonwealth Parliament to the State Parliaments, which, in turn, can allocate the money to local governing bodies. We in Australia should take government to the people, rather than take government great distances from them. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, tbe wording associated with medical and dental services and benefits to students is nebulous. Again, a convention should examine these matters. The Australian Country party has always stood for the organized marketing of primary products. This afternoon tbe Leader of the Opposition stated that there is great difficulty in defining "" priMinister, without consulting them, mary products"". The Attorney-General admitted it in his second-reading speech. As a really true blue old lawyer and former justice of the High Court, he said, "" I shall go to tbe court, and it will solve everything"". looking at the problem, but, unfortunately, we primary producers are a little suspicious of lawyers and dislike resorting to litigation. We want written into the Commonwealth Constitution plain words with plain meanings, which need not be taken to the court for interpretation. This baby which is being carried by the Attorney-General already has within it the seed of its own destruction, because, Mr Abbott. as the right honourable gentleman admitted, there is no technical definition of "" primary products"". What is more, he offered no definition, but stated that he would let the court decide. The primary producers, of Australia do not want the organization of their industries to be left to the tender mercies of the court. I ask, what is a primary product ? Under the sales tax legislation, the Commissioner of Taxation ruled that fish were primary products, but fried fish were manufactured goods. were studied by a convention, we would get a definition of "" primary products "". As primary producers, we want a watertight provision so that we shall know where we stand. Unless the word "" organized "" be properly defined, it can have an ominous meaning for primary producers. What we desire to know is who will control the organized marketing of primary products. We have heard a lot in this House about producer-control on marketing boards, but only within the last month, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully), overrode, not only the recommendations, but also the regulations that had been laid down by the Australian WTieat Board, which is, to some degree, under producer control. Regulations had been issued on the recommendation of officers of the Department of Commerce' and Agriculture, and the Wheat Allocation Committee. In this system of organized marketing, the ordered the State Superintendent in New South Wales to allocate 50,000 bushels of wheat to be gristed for feeding racing greyhounds. Interviewed by the Sydney Daily Telegraph, a Mr Vic Peters, That may be his way of honorary secretary of the Racing Grey-, hound Owners, Trainers and Breeders Association announced that on the representations made by this body, the Minister had agreed to permit the allocation of that quantity of wheat. It was equivalent to 1,000 tons of flour, and 3,000 tons of bran and pollard. If that is the kind of organized marketing that the Government proposes to put into operation under these proposed powers, the",49,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The

As tbe result of the Minister's decision, tbe wheat-farmers of Australia were robbed of approximately £12,500, because the price of tbe wheat made available for racing greyhounds, which were given priority over the hungry people of Great Britain, India, and Europe beings have my sympathy, if they have not the sympathy of tbe honourable member for Forrest( Mr Lemmon). The wheat was made available for tbe racing greyhounds at 4s. l i d . a bushel, but the export price at the port, of Sydney was 10s.. 4f'-d. a bushel.

He is a Fascist at heart and in f der that people should be able to choose looks. The Attorney-General said that this industrial power will not be exercised so as to authorize any form of industrial conscription. In Australia, those words originated in the National Security Act. 1339, which imposed exactly tbe same restrictions as this bill contemplates. The Attorney-General pointed out that the act was repealed under the stress of -war, and full industrial conscription was introduced in this country. Under this bill, it is conceivable that a court might, give an interpretation of these words which would jeopardize the liberty of the individual. My reason for making that statement is that the Attorney-General, speaking at the summer school of the Institute of Political Science in 1944, is reported to have saidlie taking away of the right of the individual to choose his own vocation and employer was only one of the freedoms which tin? Australian people must forgo in the interests of the State. Did the right honourable gentleman make that statement or was he mis-reported? His silence gives consent to the accuracy of the report.

I venture to say that if any does not lie with lawyers, or in acts -of of the proposals foreshadowed by the Parliament, but in the representatives to at the committee stages of these bills of the people in the Parliament -the right honourable gentleman would be In my opinion there is very strong tbe most disappointed man in the House.. reason to doubt whether the language in The Opposition, as a. matter of fact, which these constitution alteration bills wants to have "" a little both ways "".

If the alterations be agreed conscience whatsoever they would declareto, as drafted, we may find that clearly where they stand in regard toa clever barrister . may one day these proposals.

206,Mr Falstein (Watson) [10.5],"S o tween conflicting political programmes.the alterations that, have been, suggested by' the Government. Infact, it would, appear that anything would be better than the. programme which the Government has submitted. In -respect of certain social services,' such -as the provision of free medical and -dental treatment, the difference between the policies of the Government and the -Opposition is that instead of introducing .and passing legislation to provide for a national health and pensions insurance scheme and then dropping it, as the parties now in opposition did, the Labour party believes iu putting its legislation into operation. I remind the House that when the present Leader of the Opposition resigned his position as Attorney General in tbe Lyons Government he said that he. would stand or fall by the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act. When be became Prime Minister a few months later be had ample opportunity to give effect to his declared intention. He claims that that legislation was not supported by the Labour party. If that be so, it Avas because the measure, when compared' with what was later placed on the statute-book when a Labour government was in office, was not worthy -of support. The referendum of 1944, to which the right honourable gentleman referred, was entirely different from that which is now proposed. It contained a number of points which were originally -agreed to, by the State Premiers at a nominated convention. Despite the fact that they agreed to certain proposals, some of the Premiers openly opposed the .granting of powers to the Commonwealth when the proposals were submitted to the people. In 1944 no one could say how long the war in either Europe or the Pacific would last. Honourable members will recall that on the occasion of the 1944 referendum a transfer pf powers to the Commonwealth for the period of the war and five years thereafter was sought. On this occasion the Government aims at ensuring that the policy which it will present, to the electors at the next elections' can be implemented. It does not wish to make promises to the people as, for instance, the. introduction of a 40-hour week and certain social security guarantees, unless it has the power to give effect to its promises. It , therefore, proposes to ask., the people not only to endorse its policy but also' to empower it to give effect to that policy.. Referring to the 1936 referendum on marketing, the Leader of the Opposition said that that was a-proposal for joint control by .the Commonwealth and tbe States in contrast to control by the Commonwealth as is proposed on this occasion. 1 remind the right honourable gentleman that the position to-day is entirely different from what it was in 1936. He is using to-day the arguments used by him more than a decade ago. The practice of clinging to the arguments and methods of years gone by is not favoured by the Labour party. If I were asked to explain the difference between the arguments and action of the Government and those of the Opposition I would say that the former represent progress and the latter reaction. However much the Opposition tries to cloud the issue, it is clear that' its real desire is to prevent the Labour party from making progress with its policy. I shall deal first with the bill to'enable tbe Parliament to make laws with respect to terms and conditions of employment in industry. In order to ensure a maximum war effort it was found necessary to promulgate a number of regulations under the' National Security Act covering the whole of industry. TheLeader of tbe. Opposition -.mentioned tbe National Security (Industrial Peace) Regulations as well as those relating to employment of women,, employment in the coal-mining industry, and economic organization. In peace-time the power of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration is limited by tbe nature and subject matter of the dispute. The court is unable to make a common rule. By section 19 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act the court can only take cognizance of .disputes when they arise in certain ways. It is the desire of the Labour party to streamline the arbitration system, so that whenever a dispute arises, or it is considered necessary to terminate, a possible cause of unrest, the matter may be brought speedily before the court. Under the powers now sought it will be possible for tbe Ct'.mmonwealth to do that. In addition, it is provided by tbe Minister administering the industrial peace regulations, who, in peace-time, may be either tbe Attorney-General or the Minister for Labour and National Service, may certify a particular matter as being one for the proper consideration of the court. That provision has been of greater assistance in getting various matters settled quickly, and it is most desirable that it shall be retained in the peace-time organization. That is one of the things which it would be possible to provide. under the new powers now sought. It is common knowledge that under the economic organization, regulations, wages were pegged at the rates ruling on the 10th February, 1942. Tbat is one of the things which are causing unrest in industry to-day, because the cost of living has risen far more than is indicated by the Statistician's figures. Consequently, there should be an adjustment of wages. Tbe Leader of the Opposition said that this Parliament would not have tbe special knowledge necessary to fix an Australian standard of living, but I claim that it ought to do so. That is to say, it should fix a. minimum standard, leaving to the courts the adjustment of margins and such other loadings as it may think proper. Another important matter which the Commonwealth should cover by legislation under tbe proposed new placitum is tbe employment of women"". Up to the time when tbe war became serious, women had rot been employed extensively in industry ; but, due to the exigencies of the war situation, it was commonplace for women to perform in a large number of industries tasks which previously were thought to be beyond their capacity. Commonwealth, under the regulations relating to tlie employment of women, made a determination of wages which it considered covered tbe needs of single women. That was not the position under the different State awards. In at least one State, an arbitrary figure had been fixed, such as 54 per cent., of the male rate, which was considered adequate remuneration for a woman employed' in the industry concerned. The need for special conciliation machinery portant to the progress of the Commoner. Falstein. wealth, and certainly to the prosecution of the war, as the coal-mining industry, was obvious. That industry was depressed. Tbe provisions that were made by means of National Security regulations were implemented and subsequently were extended by the Coal Production (""Wartime) Act, which empowered the Commonwealth to take control of mines and to do certain things in regard to the industry which had not been contemplated previously. This action had the effect of enabling Australia to do much better tban many of its allies in the war. Certainly, it enabled us to make the maximum war effort of which this country was capable. I come now to the matter-raised by tbe Leader of the Opposition in regard to the interpretation of placitum (xxxv.), read in conjunction with tbe proposed placitum (xxxiv.A.), the subject of the bill I do not agree with the opinion expressed by the right honourable gentleman. I have indicated privately tbe view I bold in regard to tbe argument that he used to bolster up his opinion. Lt is ridiculous to argue that tbe inclusion in the Constitution of the proposed Few placitum (xxxiv.A.) would have the effect of narrowing the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court under placitum (xxxv.), so that it would be able to deal only with matters not covered by placitum (xxxiv.A.) Most -of the members of the profession to which the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), the Leader of the Opposition, and I belong would subscribe to that view. The rule most commonly applied in the interpretation of documents is that a document sball be read as a whole, or that such parts of it as are relevant to a The particular matter shall be read together. If. os I suggest, proposed placitum (xxxiv.A.), after insertion in the Constitution, be read together with placitum (xxxv.), it will be possible for the Parliament to legislate to provide for standard hours; for example, 40 hours, or a less number if that is possible. Under placitum (xxxv.), the court might decide -whether those standard hours should be worked in a five or a five and a half day week. The Parliament might determine and arbitration by legislation how much annual leave in an industry 'so imshould be enjoyed by workers in industry, and on the other hand the matter of sick Constitution Alteration leave might be left to the court to decide. Tbe Parliament, as 1 have already stated, minimum basic wage, leaving to the court the determination of margins and loadings. There is a very wide field in industry which can be covered by the Court under placitum (xxxv.). ' These rciate, for example, to trade dilution, apprenticeship, and matters affecting industries which may have a special need for a .close investigation, such as the maritime, industry, in respect of which special National Security gazetted during tbe war. I now come to the subject of organized marketing. The Leader of tbe Opposition has questioned whether it is desirable that the proposed alteration should be embodied in tbe Constitution in its present form. l i e argued that "" primary products"" are words which require definition. Tbe Attorney-General stated quite clearly in his second-reading speech that those are words of common usage and understanding. form parby"" Butter and other primary products "". now say that butter is not a primary product. In their platform, they also use the expression "" organized marketi n g "", yet they now suspect the use of that phrase and regard it as very sinister. of my remarks that there is clear evidence that the' arguments advanced by members of the Opposition are the sheerest humbug. They have not shown themselves to be really sincere in making a contribution that w ill ensure the progress of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) expressed a desire for an expansion of trade on the basis of merchant to merchant. I wish to place on record that I favour the conduct of extra-territorial trade by Australia on a government to government basis. If we could have a useful contribution by the Opposition in respect of these most important matters, we should do a good deal more for the people than was done ment to ensure in the past years when honourable gentleCommonwealth men who now sit opposite occupied the earliest .possible [3 Apiux, 1946.] (Social Services) Bill 1946. 931 Government benches. They frittered away time, thwarted the progress of the ought to provide for a country, and made such a muddle of affairs that during the depression the nation was brought practically to its knees. In regard to the organized marketing of primary products, the Attorney General has taken cognizance of the fact that section 51 of the Constitution begins by saying, "" The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government . . . "". Perhaps the right regulations were honourable gentleman might consider the desirability of making provision for a separate section, so as to avoid a little of what I may describe as sloppiness in drafting. In the beginning of the section there is a provision that the Parliament shall make laws subject to :he Constitution, but in a later part of the same section there is a reservation that tbe Parliament shall have power to make laws which are not subject to tbe Constitution. Large powers are sought in the social services provisions. Despite the state of the Australian Country ments made by honourable members opposite there can be no doubt as to what Tbe members of that party is meant by these provisions. Although the honourable member for Barker( Mr. Archie Cameron) has said that nobody has questioned the validity of widows' pensions or that the continuance of tbe payment of child endowment is in doubt, I said at the outset I am quite sure that tbe honourable member does not understand the .implications of the decision reached by the H i gh Courti n tbe Pharmaceutical Benefits case which placed in jeopardy .the whole power of appropriation for purposes such as this. If the honourable member wants elucidation of the term "" f a m i l y allowances"" it might be said by the Attorney-General that it might cover, say, assistance for mothers in the home, or for the care of children in those cases where the mother is not able adequately to care for tbem herself, or is forced through economic circumstances to place them in tbe charge of the State while she earns her living. It is the firm intention of the Governthat tbe people of tbe shall receive at tbe date free medical and",52,Cameron O F These Bills It Will Be Able To Influence The

The provision of the powers in the proposed social services placitum will not only guarantee the continuance of benefits enjoyed by tbe people to-day, but also provide sufficient scope for the Government to round off its plan for tbe social security of the people by extending it, on the one hand, to cover certain matters not yet provided for by legislation, and, on the other hand, filling in the little deficiencies which manifest themselves from day to day. I am disappointed indeed that the Opposition has made no useful contribution to the debate on the bills before tbe House, and I emphasize again that they have not yet declared to tbe country or to the Parliament where they stand in regard to them. They should do so now and indicate clearly whether the amendments they propose to move in committee are genuine or not. adjourned.

He was then told that his request could not be acceded to at that stage and to apply again after the lapse of some months. He did so, and was again informed that tyres could not be made available. His car has been on blocks during the period of his war service, and it is now without tyre3 and tubes. As he is,unable to pay the high freight cost of transporting the car by rail to Queensland, I made special representations to tbe Minister for Supply .and Shipping on his.behalf and received tbe following reply, dated the 2nd April, 1946 :With further -reference to your personal representations on behalf of Mr A. B.. Tankey, of High-street. Queanbeyan, who wishes to obtain four new tyres aud tubes for his Buick motor ear, 1 desire to inform you that the matter has received careful consideration. Unfortunately, tyre equipment of the size required by Mr Tankey is in extremely short supply at the present moment, and the existing stock is required to meet the needs of some thousands of business users who are already in possession of permits. In the circumstances, I regret tliat it is, not practicable at the present juncture to accede to Mr Tankey's request. Thousands of business users who have enjoyed the use of their vehicles throughout the whole period of the war are thus given priority in the supply of tyres and tubes over a man who served his country and needs his car to transport himself and family to another State. It is evident that some government officials do not returned soldiers. I take the strongest objection to the treatment meted out to this man, and I appeal to the Minister in charge of the House to review his case.

The rate at. which they were being brought back is so slow that no estimate, apparently, can be formed as to the time when all will be brought here. I have been reliably informed that many large passenger ships on the Australian coast, including hospital ships, are not now usefully employed. Therefore, I suggest that one of these ships be used to carry to Great Britain the Australian contingent, which is to march in tbe Victory Parade, and that, on its return trip, it should carry wives of Australian servicemen. On the trip to Great Britain the space not occupied by members of the contingent could be filled with food for Britain. We have not done so much as we might to supply food to Britain; indeed, the Government has done practically nothing. for the ship to bring the members of tbe contingent back to Australia? would not take up all the accommodation. On the trip to Britain, the cabins could be filled with food which would not require refrigeration. to use a warship to take the contingent overseas ? warships have not been used to bring back to Australia the wives of servicemen. I have been informed that there are on the Australian coast twelve ships witli a passenger accommodation of 500 or over. The sending of a ship of that kind to Great Britain loaded with food would be a gesture that would be very much appreciated. for Immigration and Minister for In formation) [10.43] I had a discussion earlier with the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) regarding the proposal which he has just put forward. If the contingent which is going to take part in the Victory Parade were to remain in London for a considerable sented :period, it might be possible to do what the honourable member suggested. While they were there, tbe ship could return to Australia with the wives and children of ex-servicemen, and then return to pick up the members of the Australian contingent. The present proposal is to use the Shropshire or some other unit of the Australian Navy to take the Australian contingent to Britain. I shall take the matter up with my colleagues, and I assure the honourable member that his suggestion will be investigated sympathetically. The Government is conscious of the need to obtain more ships, so as to bring to Australia tbe wives of ex-servicemen. It is evident that we are doing all that is humanly possible with the ships available, and I believe that we are giving satisfaction. The matter is primarily one that concerns the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost), but I , as Minister for Immigration, am concerned with the return of Australians who have for years been resident abroad, and with persons who propose to settle in Australia. The co-operation between tbe Minister for Repatriation, the Minister for Supply and Shipping and myself is complete. shij>s are running between Great Britain and Australia. I have suggested that one should be used. cargo ships have been running, and that is the cause of the hold-up. Up to the end of last year, we were able to obtain only between 100 and 120 berths on cargo ships each .month. Our present quota is about S00. The passenger ships mentioned by the honourable member are at present being used to bring Australian troops back to the mainland from the islands. If it is true, as he says, that some of these ships are not being used as much as they were, there may be some prospect that his suggestion will be adopted. In any case it will receive sympathetic consideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Tbe following papers were preCommonwealth Public Service Act-Appoint ment-Departmen t of Health-G . E. H.

Broadcasts by parliamentarians, however, on specific subjects of general interest which are not party political are programmed strictly on the basis of listener interest. Apart from these, however, the commission must recognize that the Prime Minister and his ministers must on occasion make public announcements as government authorities of operations in their departments. In addition, the Prime Minister's official statements when sipeaking for the country as a review or commentary, made whole must necessarily be broadcast. The commission, however, endeavoui-3 to keep ministerial statements within these categories and within reasonable compass of ""frequency. Opposition speakers are welcomed if dealing with subjects of general interest and not on party lines. Tbe commission appreciates the fact that Opposition speakers, not being in office and directly controlling public machinery, are at a disadvantage in respect of broadcast appearances, but this situation has always aristin equally under all governments. An examination of the talks schedules of tlie Australian Broadcasting Commission over a similar period during the term of the previous Government discloses a similar disparity as between broadcast appearances of Government and non-Government members of Parliament, f t is because the commission has recognized this situation that it has pressed for the broadcasting of parliamentary debates as a means of more adequately meeting the political needs of the community over the air between elections. As to departmental officials, the programming of factual statements and explanations of a department's operation by its civil head cannot but be regarded as a public service of national broadcasting under any government and the commission cannot regard such heads of departments' as being party political persons. As to union officials, the list shown indicates that in most cases union representatives were balanced by non-union persons in public debate. Where this was not the case union officials were programmed on their return from abroad as Australian delegates to international conferences, and here again the broadcasts were balanced by broadcasts from non-union The Postmasterspeakers. supplied the following Information, upon notice1.

T l i e M in is t e r for S u p p l y and S h i p p in g has supplied the f o l l o w in g answer:I confirm advice given to the honourable member that it would be impossible to provide all the information he has asked for in regard to the number of vehicles held by the Army and Allied Works Council throughout the whole of Australia and northern islands at the termination of hostilities. In regard to tlie surplus vehicles which have been sold, the total sold as at this date, excluding motor cycles, is 35,487, to a total value of £5,445,799. The vehicles in question include many thousands of wrecks and near wrecks scattered throughout the Northern Territory and other isolated areas. In the main the vehicles were war department types with practically no passenger vehicles and a small percentage only of utility vehicles. honorahle M c E w e n ) asked a question concerning conditions of sale of m o to r vehicles by the C o m m o n w e a l th Disposals Commission to residents of the No r t h e r n T e r r it o r y . The M in is t e r for S u p p l y and S h i p p in g has supplied the f o l l o w in g answer:Residents in the Northern Territory are placed upon the same footing as residents in any other part of Australia in regard to the purchase of surplus motor vehicles from the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Where vehicles are sold by the commission at a predetermined price the basis is the rate as fixed by the Prices Commissioner, and the same deductions in regard to cost of repairs apply in the Northern Territory as apply in nil other States. As residents of the Northern Territory would normally have to pay very high freight charges on vehicles purchased by them from the south, they are placed in a very advantageous position by the decision of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission not to make any charge to cover the cost of these vehicles being brought to the Northern Territory by the holding service. Reference has been made in the press to rebates being allowed to motor firms who purchase vehicles in the Northern Territory for 'movement to South Australia and other States. The normal procedure has been for the Commonwealth Disposals Commission itself to move vehicles from outlying areas to the centre at which they would be distributed. In regard to wrecked and out-of-repair vehicles in the Northern Terri-' tory, however, the vehicles were sold as and where they were. In order to permit the buyers marketing these vehicles within the ceiling levels in Adelaide aud elsewhere, a commensurate allowance was made on the pur, south. This procedure is in accordance with the accepted policy of the commission of marketing in all States on an equivalent basis and of ensuring that the ultimate sale price would not be in excess of that determined by the Prices Commissioner. the honourable member for Swan( Mr. Moiintjoy)' asked the following question:Has the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping seen an advertisement by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission in Western Australian newspapers to the effect that tyres and tubes are now available to f it army vehicles? Is he aware that tyres and tubes are not available in Western Australia, and that many farmers in that State have had applications for them with the authorities for several months? W ill he see that a fair allocation of tyres and tube -* is made to Western Australia, and that goods to meet tliat allocation arc despatched to that State without further delay? ' The M in is t e r for S u p p l y and S h i p p in g On the 2 9 t h M a r c h , the has supplied the f o l l o w in g answer:member for Indi( Mr The advertisement inserted by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission followed the declaration by the Department pf the Army of a total of 27,000 new military type tyres, and a considerably larger number of second hand military type tyres. Many of these tyres have not yet moved out of Army stores, aud some 8,000 of the new tyres, and a large number of the second hand tyres have not yet been taken up by the trade. Some. 2,558 War Department type tyres arc still lying in Army stores in Western Australia, and have not yet been taken up by the rubber companies. The purpose of tlie advertisement was to determine the demand for these types of tyres, and to ensure that, the demand having been established, the tyres would be moved from their present locations to the States and areas in which they are required. Action is in train to quickly liquidate the current' stocks in Western Australia, and should any sizes be not available in that State, appropriate transfers will be made from other States. A very recent fire at the Army depot at iVniigarin, Western Australia, destroyed a. considerable quantity of these surplus tyres, but transfers from eastern States will, to the extent possible, overcome the deficiency caused by the fire.

W ill the Government retain all this material in the Northern Territory for present and future developmental needs? 3. W ill the Government sell to present and future lessees such quantities of this material and machinery as are necessary for development, paying particular regard to the needs of returned soldier lessees? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The information desired by the. honourable member is not in the possession of my department. It would have to be obtained from the service departments, the Department of Works and Housing, and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. The Department of Supply and Shipping states that it is impossible at this stage to indicate what the total surpluses in the Northern Territory w ill he, having in mind that both the Army and the A i r Force, as well as the Department of Works and Housing, have considerable commitments for their own post-war requirements. 2 and 3. The attention of the honourable member is invited to the statement. I made on the 22nd March, 1946, in reply to a question without notice asked by him on that date. Since that date I have instructed the Administrator of the Northern Territory and his officers to inspect all stocks of material in the Territory available for disposal with a view to lodging claims for anything that may. be usef u l to the administration. He was also asked to ascertain whether any supplies of steel pickets, barbed wire, boring plants and casing, windmills, etcetera, were available and whether they could be secured and stored for issue later to new settlers. Tlie Department of Supply and Shipping states that before any surplus equipment is removed from the Northern Territory every endeavour is made to ensure that local requirements are met. Surplus goods are, in the first instance, offered by the Commonwealth. Disposals Commission to the governmental authorities in the Northern Territory, and whatever equipment is needed for rehabilitation in Darwin and similar areas is being taken over by the responsible government department. The balance of the equipment is then offered for sale to local Northern AND ALLIED WORKS COUNCIL Territory people, and the availability of equipists, missions, and other likely buyers. Residues of equipment are offered for sale by public auction. Sales are being held at Darwin on the 15th and ICth April of motor vehicles and allied equipment, and on later days during the same month of earth-moving equipment, salvage stocks, engineers' stores and Royal Australian A i r Force equipment. Returned soldier lessees who desire stocks for rehabilitation purposes should* contact -the Regional Superintendent of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission in Darwin or in Alice Springs.
