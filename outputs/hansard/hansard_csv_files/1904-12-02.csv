0,"Ifltouse Of Ftrpresentat'bes. Friday, 2 December, 1004. A.m., And Read Prayers. Mr G. B. Edwards (South Sydney).","I .desire to move the adjournment of the House; to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The proposed arrangement for silver coinage."" Five honourable members having risen intheir places, Question proposed. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Last week the notice appeared in the press that Ministers had made an arrangement with the Imperial authorities for the coinage of silver for the Commonwealth, in return for which the Commonwealth would undertake to restore all the worn gold coined by the Australian mints. The honourable member for Herbert anticipated me by asking the Prime Minister whether this statement expressed precisely the terms of the arrangement, and if he could impart other information to the House with respect to the question generally. The Prime Minister, I believe, does not pretend to thoroughly understand the details of this matter, and in the absence of the Treasurer, which we must the more regret because of his perfect acquaintance with them, was unable to reply to the question with the precision which its importance requires. He seemed to be under the. impression that the arrangement proposed is that we should rehabilitate the whole of the worn sovereigns coined in Australia, which would mean an expense of £150,000' or ^200,000 a year, whereas the correspondence plainly shows that what:",12,Setup

This latter undertaking should not be of much concern to us, in view of the fact that we -Should have, to set against it, the total profits arising from the coinage of silver, which would amount to about £30,000 a year. But what I wish to bring before honourable members is, not so much the details of this arrangement, as the fact that, -in my view, Ministers will be making a mistake if they commit the Commonwealth to a policy which will determine!, for many years to come, the kind of currency which we shall adopt. felt justified, even in the present state of public business, in bringing the matter foron. L therefore, ask the Government to ward, in order to, if possible, induce Ministers to produce the correspondence, and to give us a promise to stay their hands until they can-probabl y in the early part of next session-obtai n a legislative decision upon the principle involved, before proceeding further in the negotiations with Great Britain. honourable members of the recommendations of the Select Committee of this House which investigated the matter, because it is to defend the findings of that Committee that I am now taking action. The Committee were of opinion that over £30,000 per annum could be made by the Commonwealth as a legitimate profit on the coinage of silver. ^That finding was rather doubted at the time, but it has since been fully established by the inquiries which Ministers have made. discovered, however, that if the Commonwealth coined its own silver, its coinage would have to be different from the British silver coinage, because otherwise Great Britain would run the risk of the exportation of Commonwealth silver coins to other parts of the Empire, whereby at her -expense we should make a large profit over and' above the legitimate profit to which I have just referred, because we should be getting face value for coins whose real value would be 130 per cent, less. The correspondence reveals the fact that, as the members of the Select Committee anticipated, the Imperial authorities have insisted that this should be done. They ask, not as the Treasurer suggested during the discussion of the Committee's report that a mere mint mark shall be placed on our coinage, but that it shall be totally distinct from the British coinage, so that it will not be possible to change it for such coinage in other parts of the British dominions. The Select Committee recommended that if the Commonwealth coined its own silver, it should adopt the decimal system of coinage. The report of the Committee was jpresented during the lifetime of the first Parliament, and adopted by the House of Representatives. I have since then, during the lifetime of the present Parliament, brought the matter again before this House, and the recommendations of the Committee have been adopted a second time. Thus it would amount almost to an invasion of our legislative rights if the Executive of the day Therefore, I decided to adopt any other system of coinage than that which we have resolved upstay their hand in this matter. Parliament will probably reassemble within six months,'' and Ministers can then put a definite proposal before us. If we agreed to it, they could proceed with their negotiations with Great Britain. It would make no difference to the amount of profit derived from the I should like to remind coining of silver whether we adopted the decimal system or retained the present system. Buti f the present system is retained, useless expense and'trouble will be incurred should we a few years later adopt the decimal system, and I am afraid that, the retention of the present system would defer for a very long period perhaps for a century-the adoption of the decimal system. If we are going to adopt the decimal system, there is no time so opportune for the change as a time The Committee when we are forced to coin tokens different from those' at present in use. I do not wish to weary the House by reading lengthy extracts from the correspondence with the Home Government. The most important letter which it contains is a despatch from Mr Lyttelton, replying to a communication from this Government, which shows that the Home authorities are under the impression that this Parliament intends to carry into effect the Committee's report, and to adopt a decimal system. But notwithstanding all that was said when the report of the Committee was before this House, about the difficulties which would arise in our relations with the Imperial authorities, and the obstacles which they would be likely to throw in our way, if we attempted to adopt a decimal system, we are imet at the very outset with a very generous and sympathetic response to our application. the Imperial authorities had not yielded all that we required on minor points, but the mistake was rather in the mind of the reader than in the mind of the writer. One of the right honourable gentleman's objections was that the Imperial authorities do not undertake to receive back at face value all our worn silver coin. the matter, both openly in debate, and with me privately, the right honourable gentleman has expressed the fear that if the Commonwealth adopts a new system of coinage, it will be difficult to get rid of our silver coins. He seemed to think that the Imperial authorities would not take them back. would not be necessary that we should ship all our old silver coins to the Royal Mint, and there exchange them for gold, but that all that we should require to do * would be to arrange with other parts of the British dominions which are continuing to use the silver sterling tokens of the realm to take their normal annual supplies from Australia. That is the manner in which the Imperial authorities suggest that we should proceed if we adopt a decimal system. however, that we shall not pour an avalanche of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coinquired to be disposed of were effectively age into any part of the British dominions at one time, and thus dislocate the finances of that country. They suggest that, our exportation of old silver should be limited to £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth a year. The Treasurer regards a limitation as desirable and necessary, but he thinks that it should be fixed at £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, which would enable us to get rid of the present silver coinage in about ten years. To my mind, an exportation of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coinage a year would be ample, though perhaps a limitation of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be too small. ber contemplate the use of two denominations of silver coin side by side? Mr G. B. EDWARDS coins which would be in use under the decimal system proposed by the Committee would be of the same value, though with different names, as our present florins, shillings, and sixpences, so that we might first get rid of our present half-crowns and threepenny pieces, and introduce new decimal coins to replace them. Thus we could commence the decimal system by using the existing florins, shillings, and sixpenny pieces, which constitute the bulk of the The Treasurer thought that coinage in use in either system. We could get rid of our half-crowns and threepenny pieces by arranging with the Imperial authorities to supply New Zealand with the coin which that Colony will require from year to year, or by sending them through the banks to other parts of the world. The Imperial authorities suggest that this In discussing coinage should be exported through the ordinary commercial channels. The Treasurer, in his reply to Mr Lyttleton, did not appear to understand what the Treasury officials in Great Britain meant by the "" ordinary commercial channels."" I think, however, that the meaning is clear. The banks,, from time to time, to meet their reMy point was that it quirements which are not satisfied by the public authorities, export silver from one place to another, and the Treasury officials take it for granted that the Commonwealth Government would be able to arrange with the banks to export a certain proportion of silver, and send it to their branches to take the place of the coin which they would otherwise have to specially import .from Great Britain. The main despatch shows that the Imperial Government were not only ready to grant us all that we reThey make the reasonable request, quired, but indeed were anxious to meet us, and' the only matters of detail that redealt with in the later despatch relating to the exchange of silver. The Imperial authorities, whilst prepared to remove all worn silver, were not ready to meet an emergency such as would be created if they were called upon, owing to the adoption of the decimal system, to remove £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coins of the present currency from the Commonwealth and dump them down in some other portion of the Empire. We are not an unreasonable people, and no doubt all the necessary exchanges could be made if negotiations were entered into with other portions of the Empire. The final letter in the correspondence reveals the fact that the Treasurer replied to Mr Lyttelton's letter, practically thanking the Imperial authoriYes. The ties, and intimating that the Government were going to take advantage of it. Inferentially the Treasurer said that the Government did not intend to adopt the decimal system at present, as it would probably take too long to obtain parliamentary sanction, but that they proposed to adopt a coinage of their own, which could be altered upon the adoption of the decimal system at a later stage. They would then .ask the",12,Commonwealth Coinage
2,Mr Watson,"Does the honourable memImperial Government to remove whatever old coins might still be in circulation. If we adopt the proposals of the Government, as set forth in that correspondence, we shall institute a new system of our own, in no respect, except in form of coin, different from the existing British silver currency. Having adopted such a system, and having placed large numbers of new coins in circulation, it would be almost impossible for many years to come to persuade the Government to introduce the decimal system. I desire that the Government shall stay its hand for the time being, and invite Parliament to arrive at a decision upon the subject of decimal coinage. I contend that this decision could be obtained without much delay, if a proposal were submitted early next session. This House has twice expressed its approval of the decimal system of coinage, and, although the matter has not been formally introduced into the Senate, I understand that a majority of honourable members in that Chamber are favorable to the proposal. In discussing the metric system of weights and measures, honourable senators expressed themselves most favourably to the adoption of the decimal system of coinage. Therefore, the Government would have no difficulty whatever in passing a measure through Parliament in the early days of next session. If the Prime Minister will only add this subject to the rather long list, with which he is filling his memorandum book, of the subjects which are to be considered during the recess, I think that the Government will avoid committing a grave blunder. If we decided to adopt a decimal system of currency, we should at once derive profit from the silver coinage. Instead of coining shillings, we should issue half-florins, or half-dollars, which would be of the same value as a shilling. Then we could have a dollar or florin, and a quarter dollar, or sixpence. duce the decimal coins at once, and should not require to effect any change at a later period. under the present system, and during the period necessary to enable the public to familiarize themselves with the new currency before its use was made absolutely compulsory, and the Commonwealth could derive the whole of the profits of the coinage from the outset. hand, Ministers determine to go on with a coinage of their own, that is not to. be associated with the decimal system, they will ultimately have to remelt the whole of their coin issue, in the event of our deciding-as I believe we shall-to adopt the decimal system. I regard it as my duty to bring this matter under the notice of the House, with a view to obtaining a promise from the Prime Minister that the Government will delay final action until they have had an opportunity to invite Parliament to express its definite opinion as to the best system of coinage to adopt. I think that, in the meantime, the Government will do well to print the despatch received from Mr Lyttelton, to which I have referred, and also the very valuable memorandum written by the Treasurer. I hope also, that the Prime Minister will carry out his promise to print the replies which have been received from the various commercial associations and trading organizations, which have been asked to state for the information of the Government, thjei,n opinions with regard to the proposed decimal system. It seems ridiculous for the Government to write to these various bodies, and ask them to express their opinions, and at the same time to proceed to adopt another system which will entail a large expenditure of money. would be involved in carrying out the scheme advocated by the honourable member. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -No. I am pointing out that we should probably save considerable expense if we adopted the decimal system of coinage from the outset. I contend that Parliament should decide what system should be adopted; that we should obtain the decision of the Legislature, and not of the Executive, upon that point. I think that I have full warrant for bringing this matter forward.. I do not desire to provoke a discussion, but I think that the Prime Minister mig-ht very We should thus introwell promise to hold his hand in this matter, and also agree to the printing .of the documents to which I have referred, which These coins could all circulate will enable honourable members to become more cognisant of the facts.

4,Mr Reid (East Sydney,"Minister ofsatisfactory announcement. In the first place, the Government, in their negotiations with the Imperial authorities, made.it distinctly understood that all their arrangements were contingent upon the possible establishment of the decimal system. That was the first action the Government took. In the next place, I entirely agree with my honourable friend that the subject is one in regard to' which we should endeavour to enter upon some interchange of views with the Premiers of the States. Although, under the Constitution, this is a Commonwealth question, all matters which affect the business interests of our Australian communities must be subjects of concern also to the heads of the different States Governments, and I think .that it will be perfectly proper to lay the whole of the facts before the Premiers' Conference, in order that we may have the advantage of their views. In the meantime, we shall stay our hands. We are not committed to the proposed arrangements until the House has had an opportunity to consider the results of the labours of the Select Committee on Decimal Coinage, and, also, I think, the*replies which were sent in response to circulars addressed to various bodies representing the business communities. I think it would be well if these replies were published, and I see no objection to the publication of the despatch received from Mr Lyttelton, and the minute of the Treasurer, to which the honourable member has referred. The despatch does not appear to be of a confidential nature, and I see no objection to laying it and the other papers before the Premiers' Conference. I shall also give my honourable friend an opportunity to test the feeling of honourable members early next session. I do not know whether the Coinage Committee has discharged all its functions. If not, I should like to see it meet again to consider the replies received from the representatives of the business public. It seems to me that they contain matter which might well come before the Committee, and which might, perhaps, induce it to modify its views. have to be re-appointed. have to appoint the Committee over again, and I will consider whether we could not take that step even at this late stage of the session, in order to permit of the consideration of the communications referred to.

I think that those honourable members who are interested in the.question of decimal coinage have some reason to be disappointed at the replies given by the Prime Minister to the questions recently addressed to him. I think that these meagre replies indicated that the cargo of accurate knowledge which he denies to honourable members upon this side of the House is in evidence in his own case. It seems to me that in some respects the answer which he gave to-day is indicative of a lack of knowledge upon this question. has not yet come before the Cabinet, and I am of opinion that a change of the character indicated is one which ought to have been considered by that body before it was allowed to reach the present stage. taken by the previous Cabinet. that the matter progressed to the present stage under the late Government.

I wish to state the position of the Opposition. What we desire is to provide for untrammeled pared to leave the matter entirely to the discretion of the Court. In taking up this position, we are justified by the experience of the Arbitration Courts of New Zealand and New South Wales. An attempt has been made to show that an injustice has been done to certain persons in New South Wales by reason of preference being granted by the State Court; but it has not been shown, either here , or elsewhere, that any such injustice has been inflicted. It was sought to be shown the other day that the Court hadestablished a new rule in respect to the granting of preference. In only one particular case, so far as I am aware, has the Court departed from the general rule of granting preference whenever asked. I understand that it did not grant it in the case of the laundry workers, but there were particular reasons for its decision. I do not agree with those reasons, but the circumstances are such as are hardly likely to recur. In the latest award made by the Court preference of the most complete character was granted. In a number of other cases the New South Wales Court granted preference, because it was not opposed. If a party asks that preference to unionists should be embodied in a certain He professed award, and the other persons interested' do not oppose the application, how can an injustice be done in granting it? opposing it under the New South Wales Act. By various to attend, but does not appear before the Court to oppose an application, we must assume that he acquiesces in the application, or is indifferent to the maintenance of his rights or privileges. That is our position. We ask for preference, untrammeled by any order or direction to the Court by Parliament, but we are ready to accept as a 1 compromise the principle laid down by the Government, upon which it stands, or ought That will be a to stand , and upon which it ought to be 1 ready to fall. Obviously, however, it is not ready to do anything of the sort. The principle to which I refer is that upon It will be a pleasing which the Government came into powerthe right of the majority to decide whether or not preference should be granted. We only ask that the parties who are to prove the existence of a majority should be those opposed to the granting of preference. It will be difficult for the Minister of Defence to show preference, and are prethat this compromise is either impossible or unjust. The Prime Minister was certainly unable to do so. If , as the leader of the Opposition very aptly pointed out, the Prime Minister proves it to be impossible in the one case, he must admit it to be impossible in the other, and, therefore, he materially strengthens the arguments which were advanced by us at considerable length against the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella before the present Government came into power. We said then, and we say now, that it is practically impossible to establish, to the satisfaction of the Court, that there is a majority in favour of preference. The Prime Minister last night declared himself the champion of the non-unionists, and we are not to forget that on the night upon which the Watson Government were defeated he declared himself to be the champion of those who were opposed to those principles which we believe are essentia] to this measure. .He was the lion in the path of the Labour Party; he was the person who was going",18,Commonwealth Coinage

Spence. shows that in New South Wales, in 1903, there were 754,632 males, of whom 310,321 were under the age of seventeen and a half years, while 20,719 were between the ages of sixty-five and 113, leaving 423,592 adult workers. 30r,660 persons were engaged in such occupations their joining unions. We were told the other day that persons following agricultural pursuits had not joined unions. There are 75,000 such persons in New South Wales; then doctors, ministers of religion, persons engaged in education, art, and other pursuits, number 16,000. Relatives and others not statedto be domestic servants number 99,000. Students and scholars over the age of seventeen and a half years number 10,000. Persons engaged in dairy farming, 15,000a grand total of 301,660. If that number be subtracted from the total number of available males, it gives the number of persons eligible to join unions as 121,932. Mr Spence, however, declares that, there are 70,000 unionists in New South Wales, leaving a minority of about 51,000, amongst whom are such persons as hotel keepers, watchmakers, jewellers, cabmen, market gardeners, orchardists, nightmen, Chinamen, chemists, and others too numerous to mention. Therefore, in New South Wales, although the unionists are in a majority amongst those who are in a position to join unions, one of the strongest unions was unable to prove that it contained a majority of those affected by an award. and learned member conceive of an InterState trolley and draymen's dispute? obliged to furnish particulars. Even the honourable member does not propose to exclude such persons from the benefits of the measure. I admit that it is difficult to conceive that Inter-State disputes will arise, except among seamen, wharf labourers, and shearers, in the iron trade, and in one or two other industries. But one is never to know what will cause an Inter-State dispute. In 1890, from an insignificant spark sprang a gigantic conflagration, and we are not to say that such an occurrence might not come again. I have shown that a great union in New South Wales would have been unable to prove that it contained a majority of those affected by an award. Therefore, to ask He the unions applying to the Court to prove that they represent a majority of all affected is to ask them to do what is always extremely difficult, and very often impossible. If this were not so, why should the Prime Minister object to the amendment of the Of these, leader of the Opposition placing the burden of proof upon the opposing side ? We are not as did not permit of to forget that the majority mentioned in the proviso means the majority of the "" persons affected,'-' and not the majority of the persons ""engaged "" in an industry. If the Court were at all hostile it might very readily construe it in its widest acceptation. Take the case of the union which I have mentioned. The question would arise as to who would be affected by a strike of drivers. It might be held that the persons engaged in warehouses, or even shearers upon stations, were affected by such a dispute. Even the wharf labourers might be held to be affected. view of it, as the honourable and learned member knows. is proposed to appoint -the Minister as a member of. the Arbitration Court. intended to appoint the honourable and learned member. have no hesitation in saying that I should interpret this phraseology very narrowly. If the Minister were appointed, I should have very little faith that he would take a similar course. As we are called upon to trust the Court, we must adopt such language as would enable any Judge to read into it the ordinary English meaning. I have pointed out that the word ""affected"" may mean anything. I should like to know why those who are opposed to preference should hot have the onus cast upon them of showing that they represent a majority of the persons affected? The whole basis of this Bill is organization. It recognises organizations and nothing else. If then, an organization appears before the Court and claims preference, those who desire to deny it that privilege should be required to prove that they have a right to do so. Unless organizations go to the Court how can disputes be prevented ? If we impose such conditions as will prevent organizations from going to the Court,",19,Commonwealth Coinage

39,Mr Hughes,"If I were appointed Ihow can we make the Bill effective? Speaking for one of the largest bodies of unionists in this country-the Waterside Workers' Federation, which embraces over 10,000 membersI may say at once that I do not think we shall appeal to the Court. We shall not incur the clanger of losing the privileges which we now enjoy by appealing for preference under such conditions as are laid down in the Bill. Why should we do so, when we are told by the Prime Minister that we can get all that we require without the assistance of the Court? Why should we incur the expense of appealing, unless we are to obtain some return for our trouble and outlay, and for the risk we. run. I am quite certain that the honourable member for Darling, who can speak with authority on behalf of the Australian Workers' Union, will tell, the Committee that that organization will not appeal to the Court, and run the risk of having to give up those privileges which it has with such difficulty won. cided not to register under the Bill. of the Federated Seamen's Union. Why should .they be asked to prove that they have a majority in favour of preference? Why should the employers not be called upon to prove that there is a majority against it? Would it not be easierfor thirty or forty employers to prove that there was a majority against preference than for 10,000 unionists to prove that there the large majority of the workers in any was a majority in favour of it? Last night, the Prime Minister endeavoured to prove that it would be very difficult for the the New South Wales Act has been, non-unionists-the scattered' units-to go to the Court and individually say-""We are against the granting of preference."" That is reducing the whole thing .to an absurdity. How is the unionist to prove that the non-unionist is in favour of preference, except by canvassing each individual ? In the case of the Trolleymen and Draymen's Union, we should have had to go round to every driver who was not in the union and ask him-""Are you opposed to preference being granted? If not, mav we say that you are not opposed to it?"" How else are we to ascertain-the facts? If we are to adopt some easier and more effective way, cannot the employer follow, the.same course ? One employer could say"" Here is a list of my employee's, numbering 500, who are opposed to preference being granted."" Another one could say"" I have 100 employees, the majority of whom are against the granting of preference "" The employers would Thus be alble, if -they had a case, to establish it with very little difficulty. Honourable members opposite know that if not practically impossible, it is extremely difficult to prove a majority, and they are not prepared to drink that medicine with which they propose to drench us. I wish to point out that the very essence of this Bill is that it deals with organizations, and not with individuals. It is a Bill to prevent industrial disputes. Industrial disputes can only take place between organizations of workers and employers. We do not fear the scattered individual disputes, with which the nation is not concerned, but gigantic disputes with which the whole community would be very much concerned. The danger is so great that I verily believe that honourable members who hesitate to-approve of State interference yet wish to prevent a recurrence of those industrial upheavals which have proved so disastrous in the past. How fatuous it is, then, for them to approve of provisions which will discourage the unions from coming before the Court. Unless the unions can obtain preference they will not appeal to the Arbitration tribunal. I venture to believe that the refusal of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales to grant preference to the laundry workers in Sydney will deter' a number of small unions from seeking the assistance of the Court. Only those unions which embrace industry will think of appearing before it. I desire now to show how effective and how' readily the unions have obeyed the law. They have obeyed the law, when, if they had chosen to break it, the authorities would have been powerless to check them. The Newcastle Miners' Federation, which embraces practically the whole of the miners in the northern coal mining district, compelled the miners at Teralba to resume work, because the Arbitration Court decided that they should do so. The coal trimmers of Newcastle recently resumed work because the Court, when appealed to iby the employers, decided that they should go back. We do not see anything about these things in the press, but, nevertheless, the law was sufficiently powerful to compel these turbulent bodies of men to resume work.

Consequently he is a less sinner by only 16 per cent. thing. the honourable member for Hindmarsh is always doing-eve n when it is not his turn to do so. that throughout this debate honourable members opposite should seem to take it for granted that the principle of preference requires no justification. They appear to think that it is one of the "" of courses"" of the situation. It is, however, an invasion of the fundamental principles of citizenship, as understood in any English-speaking community, which requires to be justified by the special circumstances of the case. I should say that we lay down the rule that, as far as possible, equality of opportunity should be put into legal effect. But equality of opportunity is undoubtedly interfered with by any judicial direction, giving preference to members of organizations over If honourable members non-members; and, therefore, there must be some special circumstances to justify that invasion, just as there were special facts in the case under the Customs Act, to which reference has been made by the leader of the Opposition and the honourable and I claimed-and I learned member for West Sydney. While frankly, admitting that it seems to me to be prima facie repugnant to the principles on which we carry on the Government of the country to grant preference, I , for one, have recognised from the first that there are circumstances which justify the insertion in this measure of clauses allowing preference to be granted, provided that dangerous invasion-dangerou s as being a contravention of our fundamental rules-ha s some reasonable safeguard attached to it. It seems to me that the least safeguard we can provide is that of attaching to the grant of preference the same condition that we attach to all matters of Government which have to be finally decided-the principle of m'ajority rule. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney says that the Government assert that once majority rule I would remind honourable is established, the majority can do what it pleases. We do not say anything of the kind. There is the safeguard of the rights of the minority in the Court. In that we He yielded to the have to trust the Court. If it were possible to point out to the Court the circumstances under which it should grant preference, and those in which it should not do so, I should be prepared to support the insertion of provisions to that end. But there are limitations to our powers of expression, just as there are limitations to our power to foresee the contingencies of the future, and, consequently., there must be some omission from our legislation of the complete expression of our desires. We are compelled to say to the Court, "" We cannot tell It struck me as very curious you what direction you ought to give as to the granting of preference or no preference in any particular set of circumstances. We, therefore, leave it to you, in dealing with a case that comes before you, to see that the rights of minorities are protected."" This legislation can, at least, provide, however, that, when the whole of the physical force of the community is to be expressed through the decision of a judicial tribunal, the Court shall apply that which we have found the best, although not the ideal, rule of Government.

We say that in this as in other matters majority rule shall not be the condition from which preference shall flow as a matter of course, but that it shall be a condition precedent to the possibility of granting preference. It has been said by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney that the preference question is the basic principle of this measure. That statement 'has been made from time to time during the last four or five months; but no one heard of it before. Barton Government introduced the measure, after the elections, when it was taken up by the Deakin Government, and later on when the Watson Government came into office, it was declared again and again that the basic principle of the B ill was the patriotic motive of insuring the welfare of the community by preventing the pecuniary and moral injuries which result from strikes, and which affect, not only those concerned,, but many other innocent members of the conmunity. That was the basic principle of the B ill which was announced from time to time, until the preference clause actually came under our consideration. I assert that it is still the fundamental principle of this measure. Its basic principle is industrial peace, as compared with war; but now one of the combatants says "" If you will not insert in the treaty of peace the conditions which we stipulate for, we shall carry on war."" Is that the way in which peace is to be maintained as a substitute for war? These are the facts as we find them to-day. One of the great parties concerned says, "" Unless you concede our terms, you shall not have peace."" member state, by way of interjection, that the Australian Workers' Union had decided that it would not come under this measure unless this concession were made? In other words, that is a declaration that it will not accept this protocol of peace. is a concession. mystery to me that unionists have never yet realized that the granting of preference is a concession-that it is a departure from first principles, which can be justified only by the special circumstances of the case. I admit that the circumstances are such as to justify a departure, provided that the concession be reasonably safeguarded. I desire _ now to say a word or two in reference to the exact form of the amendment inserted on my motion when the Bill was before us on a previous occasion, and which has been the subject of much discussion during the last four or five months.

The reversal of a principle of our Courts is permitted by the Customs and Excise Acts only when pecuniary penalties are involved, riot when indictable offences, or offences punishable directly by imprisonment, are involved. The provision does not apply where intent to defraud the revenue is charged, that is, where the offence is more than the committal of an error, or a slight breach of the lair. All that is provided is pecuniary penalties have been fixed for comparatively minor offences, the burden of proof shall be on the defendent, and then only because he has put himself into a suspicious position. But where a defendant's liberty is concerned, where it is a question of his remaining a free man or becoming a prisoner, the old rule applies, that a raan is to be presumed' innocent until he is found to be guilty. Yet some honourable members say that there is an analogy between that case and the position of non-unionists'. Is nor the livelihood of any member of the working classes his next most precious possession after his liberty? Is it not more to 1 him than the question whether he shall be subjected to a pecuniary penalty ? If a chain be no stronger than its weakest link, I have no great opinion of the chain of argument which has been forged to support the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. Surely there, must be the strongest, the most cogent, and the most overwhelming reasons to justify in this case the reversal of the rule of British law, and the shifting of the onus of proof from the parties claiming a benefit to those who are not parties to the dispute, but who are compelled to watch it for fear that permanent wrong may be done to them, and perhaps their livelihood be taken away. The Honourable B. R. Wise, speaking in 1900, said that there was nothing in the New South Wales Act which would force a non-unionist to join a union, and no doubt he believed his statement; but will any one deny that he was a false prophet? I venture to say that no one can fairly deny, except in the strictly technical sense, that physical or legal force is applied to non-unionists to make them become unionists. The statement has proved incorrect. The force of circumstances, which is stronger than either physical or legal force, must inevitably drive men into unions if the principle of preference be carried out to the extent suggested by Mr Wise. According to an extract read by the honourable member for Gwydir the other day, Mr Wise, in a letter written to the Sydney Worker, contends that the weaker the union the more reason for giving it preference, because there will not be. so many obtaining a preference over the balance of the trade. That reasoning reminds one of the excuse of the young woman, "" Please, sir, it is only a little one."" that where ing the Act. posite have accepted the principle of majority rule. They are quarrelling with us only as to how it can be applied. It is of no use for them to say that they are accepting it in default of something better. The fact is that they are accepting it. If they are not, they are taking up this position, and it is a disingenuous one: The amendment is unworkable, they say. Transfer the onus of proof to the non-unionists, and it will be unworkable by them, just as it would be unworkable by the unionists. If they take up that position, I say that they are not straightforward. They are pretending to accept a principle which they say cannot be put into practice. If their view of the amend-' ment be correct, that it is impossible to' put it into operation, they are pretending to accept the principle of majority rule, and are at the same time doing what is equivalent to knocking it out altogether. learned member says that it is not impossible. lieve any other honourable member from the obligation to reconcile his actions with his statements.

101,Mr Mccay,"Yet they are deliber-'the duty of proving that .the unionists have not a majority, while they say that the unionists could not prove the converse. On their own showing, they are giving the non-unionists an absolutely illusory benefit. I do not agree with the view which they take upon the amendment. work, though I shall not discuss its verbiage again. When the Watson Administration wished to have it recommitted, the proposal was not to amend it to express the principle more clearly. Government wished to do was to knock out the amendment, and to substitute for it one which would not embody the same principle. It was then a war between two principles, not about the expression of one principle. Senate, the friends of honourable members opposite omitted the provision, and since the measure has come back to us, they have been quarrelling as to the terms of the amendment. But, although they know exactly what it is intended to effect, they do not make a single suggestion as to how it is to be done. On the contrary, they say that the amendment is useless; and they propose to place the burden of doing that which they regard as impossible on the non-unionists. I take the view that the amendment is operative, and that the' Court will place upon it the reasonable construction which I have explained over and over again, and which I shall not detain honourable members by repeating. it is operative, and imore easily operative by the unionists than by the non-unionists. The unionists have machinery which the non-unionists have not. The unions have their executives and their branches. They have representatives all over the Continent, in communication with head-quarters who can ascertain and collect facts and communicate with those who are administering the affairs of the unions. non-unionists have none of these things. It is far easier for the unionists than for the non-unionists .to prove a majority. That would be quite a sufficient reason for objecting to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland. If that were not sufficient, there is the additional reason, which is founded upon sound principles, that those who are asking for a benefit should prove their right to it. Suppose that the Senate's amendment were accepted, and the Act did not provide for any restriction as to preference, and the Court itself, as it would be bound to do, commenced to lay down rules upon which it would grant preference. Could the human imagination conceive that the Court would lay down a rule that it would grant preference without regard to numbers, unless the opponents of preference proved that the applicants were in a minority? WouldI say that it will any Court say any less than that, so far as numbers were concerned, those who asked for the benefit should prove that they represented a majority? No Judge in the world would lay down such a rule as that What that which appears to be contemplated by honourable members opposite. I put that to the country as a fair test, and if any honourable member opposite ventures to assert that I am wrong, I shall leave those most concerned to judge between him and me. When the Bill went to the If the Court could conceivably adopt any such proposition as that put forward by the honourable member for Bland, there might be some reason for supporting it ; but the very fact that when one asks himself the question, whether the Court would do such a thing, he unhesitatingly answers with an indignant "" No,"" enables us to at once realize that the proposal of the Opposition is one that no community could reasonably accept in the circumstances to which i.t is sought to be applied I await with great eagerness the assertion of *any honourable member to the contrary. There is one other matter to which I should I say that like to refer. I apologize to honourable members for speaking at greater length than I had anticipated, but as I have not spoken for some considerable time, and as the proviso which was inserted at my instigation has been the subject of constant reference, perhaps I may be pardoned for extending my remarks.. The quite satisfied that the proviso had served his purpose. that it served my purpose. My purpose was to protect the principles upon which British government is carried on. The proviso has served that purpose,, and I hope that it will continue to do so. If any verbal alteration is suggested that will make the intention clearer, and at the same time preserve the principle of the proviso, I am not so enamoured of my own choice of terms as to refuse to accept it. But I will not surrender the principle. Anything which would obscure the meaning of the proviso, or have the effect of endangering the principle which lies at the bottom",29,Commonwealth Coinage

There is one other matter to which I should like to refer. Do honourable members opposite realize the practical effect of the amendment which they propose in connection with the working of the Bill? The honourable member for West Sydney has told us that the employers can look after the interests of the non-unionists. who interjects is specially interested in a case in which certain methods have been adopted by the employers, or are alleged to have been adopted by themI do not pretend to know the facts-by which the machinery of an Arbitration Act has been availed of in order to defeat the objects of the bond fide unions. They are alleged to have instigated the formation of a bogus union. Do honourable members opposite realize that the passing of the amendment would afford the most direct incentive that could be conceived for the creation of such unions? If it were agreed to. we should see bogus unions springing up like mushrooms all over the country. Then the representatives of the bogus unions would come into the Court and say that they represented the majority, and were opposed to preference being granted to the members of the other and the real unions. registered under this B ill . MrM c CAY member is mistaken. I venture to say that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland would, if embodied in the Bill, afford a greater incentive to practices under the amendment it could not help of that kind than anything else that could be conceived. that. MrM c CAY friends of the honourable member outside would say if they knew that he had ploughed the ground for the planfing of a crop of bogus unions. ever, I leave honourable members to arrange that matter with those whom they are professing lo assist. The honourable member for West Sydney analyzed the figures relating to employment in New South Wales, and tame to the conclusion that 120,000 workers were eligible to join unions, and that 70,000 of them, or, in other words, a majority, were already embraced by the unions. This was held to disprove the assertion made by the Prime Minister, but it establishes, up to the hilt, the allegations that we are always making to the effect that the unions would have no difficulty in proving that they represented majorities of the workers. A gentleman writes to the newspapers, and his statements are accepted without question by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney. Surely the Arbitration Court will not be less amenable to reason than is the honourable and learned member. proviso be inserted? should have no guarantee that the Court will require that certain conditions shall be complied with. If we adopt the amendment proposed by the honourable"" member for Bland, we shall direct the Court that it is not to regard numbers unless the opponents of preference come along, and prove that they have a majority. That would be worse than leaving the matter quite open to the Court. It would be equivalent .to telling the Court that numbers must not count unless the opponents of the applicants proved that they were in a majority. A few months ago, even .the honourable member for Bland desired that numbers should be considered, but, under his amendment, he would direct the Court not to consider numbers, unless others, who had not the same opportunities for representation .that were possessed by the unions, came into Court for the special I think the honourable purpose of showing that which they had no right to be called upon to show, namely, that they were in a majority. No Court would do that if it could help it, but it. Is that the way in which honourable members opposite desire to .treat those who do not belong to the unions? I am not quarrelling with the unions or their I do not know what the work. The mere knowledge of the good qualities of honourable members opposite who are identified with the unions would, apart from other reasons, be sufficient to Howdeter me from taking any other than a favorable view of their organizations. see that a majority would have to be endorsed upon the applications for preference? not have to be endorsed upon the applications.

Suppose, for instance, the Court ascertained that .5,000 men were concerned in their award, and that the union applying for .preference embraced 3,000 members. The Court would undoubtedly hold that as sufficient proof that the applicants for preference represented a majority. The officials of the union would presumably be able to give definite information as. to the number of members they represented. how many persons might be affected by the award. unduly straining the meaning of the words contained in the proviso. However, I do not propose to go back and discuss details which I should be quite willing to again consider if honourable members had given me any reason to do so. They have not, however, suggested a single thing. They have stated that my amendment is of a most terrible character, both in. form and in prinbased upon fact. Years ago, the unionist ciple. They have now abandoned their fight on the principle, and say that its form is bad. They have gone further, and have said in effect, "" We leave you to your own miseries."" They have not suggested any amendment which would improve the proviso without destroying its principle. I have been waiting for months, like "" Patience on a monument,"" .for suggestions from honourable members opposite, and I am still willing and ready to consider any proposal they may make. In conclusion, I wish to say that I believe the principle of majority rule is the least we can insist upon to safeguard us in connection with the departure from ordinary rules involved in our giving one man preference over another by Act of Parliament. We are restoring status. We have been for many years substituting contract for status. Now we are proposing to restore status, and, in fact, to revert to medjaevalscience. ism to some extent. It appears to me that we should make some concession, but that in making it 'we should surround it by all the reasonable safeguards we can think of, and I know of none that is fairer or more necessary than that of majority rule. To that principle I adhere now, as I adhered to it in the beginning, believing that it is the least that we can insist upon in order to make this a fair measure to place upon the Statute-book of the Commonwealth. It might, as we do, take up desire to traverse the statements of the Prime Minister, who has attempted to' give one of those clever turns to this debate which would prevent the arguments of the leader of the Opposition from having due weight. With that acuteness which distinguishes him, the right honourable gentleman has endeavoured to drag a red herring across the trail. As a result, we have had many fine heroics which have no bearing upon the question under consideration, although they may cause the Empk>3'ers' Federation to feel happy in the reflection that its members are represented in this Committee. As one who has made a close study of the history of the labour movement in Australia, I was surprised to hear the term "" British justice"" so highly lauded by the Prime Minister, especially in view of the fact that he must be acquainted with the struggles and martyrdom which have bean experienced in connection with the trade union movement. To declare that justice is meted out in British Courts of law is to assume something which is not practically occupied the position of a wrongdoer. He was supposed to be a wicked man. If he were an agitator-that is, one who was willing to incur the risks involved in an attempt to uplift his fellow man-h e received a less measure of justice than he would otherwise have received. In view of the strong bias which we have seen exhibited, even in the case of our own Judges-for whom I entertain the greatest respectI say that it is the non-unionist who receives consideration, and not the unionist. What measure of justice has been meted out to unionists by Courts where the presiding justices of the peace were squatters? The term ""British justice,"" in my, opinion, had better be entirely discarded. We should establish a Court which is charged with the responsibility of giving decisions according to equity and good conI have known cases in which employers have compelled men to work in a particular locality, irrespective of whether or not they liked the conditions.

That was the tacit understanding between em-",31,Commonwealth Coinage

117,Mr Spence (Darling),"I have noplovers and employees. The Prime Minister declares that such an arrangement is all right. But, I would ask, how came it to be enforced? Simply because the employees retained the power to strike. In my sixteen years' experience there, I can recall only one occasion upon which that principle had to be enforced. I desire to show the Committee how it operates, and I venture to say that the Minister of Defence will presently see that he has an exaggerated idea of non-unionists. There is no occasion to legislate for them in the way that is proposed to-day. The original idea was that we should leave it entirely to the President of the Arbitration Court to say whether a preference should, or should not, be granted to unionists. The charge that the Watson Administration have gone back upon their principles comes with ill-grace from the Minister of Defence, especially in view of the fact that the present Government have swallowed the proposal to include railway servants within the scope of the Billa proposal which they declared they would not accept. Members of the Ministry have dared to twit the Labour Party with having been compelled to accept something with which they did not agree. forced to accept that position, but I declare that, having accepted it, they must shoulder the responsibility. fully differentiated between the one situation and the Qthei. into the present position. hare so solid a following that all its members will be bound to vote if they wish to defeat us. ment an opportunity is given to those who believe in the principle of preference to record a vote in favour of something which is absolutely fair and feasible. The Minister of Defence has not shown that there is any need whatever for the proposal of the Government. in New Zealand or New South Wales legislation, in regard to which there has not been a word of complaint. The Government simply refuse to trust the President of the Arbitration Court. The objection of the Australian Workers' Union to this proposal is that it is not workable. No evidence has been brought forward to show that there is any necessity for it whatever, and I maintain that no harm will be done by vesting a discretion in the. Court. During the course of this debate, a great deal has been said in reference to non-unionists. I have urged many times that the term "" non-unionist "" is a misnomer, and the same remark is applicable to the term "" preference."" Nonunionists are men who, in time of industrial disputes, are prepared to accept the inducements offered by employers to fill the places of men on strike. They are the men whom I described on a previous occasion as being of a criminal type; but they are not the men we have in mind when we refer to non-members of unions. The mission in life of the non-unionists will disappear with the establishment of the Arbitration Court, because employers will hot need their services. of enthusiasm of such persons. "" scabs"" and "" black-legs,"" we have in mind men of that class, and not the nonmembers of unions, for whom the Prime Minister, the honourable member for NewEngland, and others have displayed so much anxiety. Unionists are admittedly the best workers. In engaging hands, an employer naturallv selects the most competent, and therefore it will always be to his advantage to employ unionists. The grievances which lead men to organize are generally the accumulation of many years of employment, and therefore trade unions are formed, not by those who are idle, but by those who are working. It is only reasonable to assume that those who are kept in steady employment are more competent than those who are not, and as unions are for the most part formed by Under the amendthe first-named class, the unionists must be the more competent workers. It will therefore be seen that in asking that unionists shall be given a preference, we do not demand something that may inflict an injustice on employers. I do not argue that men who have the misfortune to be It is not contained out of work are necessarily incompetent. I merely say that unionists, because of the fact that they are employed, must be good workers, and .that it is reasonable to assume that they are more competent than those who remain idle. As a rule, a man joins a union as soon as he obtains work. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill: of New South Wales was passed, unions and unionists were not nearly so numerous' as they are to-day. With the passing",32,Commonwealth Coinage

123,Mr Spence,"When we speak ofof great revival. A large number of organizations voluntarily sprang into existence, and were readily joined by the workers. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney has quoted some figures relating to the number of unionists in New South Wales, but I would point out that they merely repiesent the number who are financial members of registered unions. Mr A. Spence secured them from the registrar, but they do not by any means represent the total number of unionists in the Staie. The subscription to the union of which I am a member is paid annually, but many men engaged as shearers during one season, and who join, the union, may not be employed in that calling in the following year, and therefore do not contribute to its funds. they are unfinancial, they are at heart true unionists. sands of these men, so that the Minister of Defence will recognise that the figures quoted by the honourable member for West Sydney must be largely increased in this way. honourable member ought to know-wha t great objection can there be to the Governwithout saying that no evidence has been ment proposal? able member. The Prime Minister admits that in certain trades the unionists have a majority. Our best men make unionism a matter of religion. They regard it as a most sacred principle They have suffered for it over and over again, and have endured poverty and almost starvation for the sake of the principle. It is a slander to describe such men who do not actually belong to a union as non-unionists. Many who have been unionists for years, but have become unfinancial, are not included in the list which Mr Spence secured. With the passing of the New South Wales Act, the men employed in a number of industries organized because they knew that they would be able to appeal to the Court to redress grievances which they were not courageous enough to deal with according to the old-fashioned method. In these circumstances, why should the Government insist upon the clause being passed as it left this Chamber? answer is that it can do no harm. The Government have spoken of the principle for which they contend as being most that Act, however, there was a important, and they seem to be almost prepared to stake their political existence upon our acceptance of it. When, as practical men, we assert that the Government proposal cannot be carried into effect-whe n we assure the Government that practical unionists behindus who know their business express the opinion th.it the clause would be of no service unless amended as proposed by the Senate-w e may be pardoned for assuming that there must be seme motive, which has not yet been brought to light, for their refusal to agree to any amendment.

It goes adduced showing that there is any necessity for such a provision as that carried on the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. Although the Arbitration Court of New Zealand has had the right for some years to grant preference to unionists, no complaints of the injustice of a preference award have been brought under the notice of the Court. Mr Justice Cohen, President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court of New South Wales, has also stated publicly that no complaint as to its work has been brought before that tribunal. The Prime Minister has correctly asserted that the unions relating to those industries which are likely to be brought under an award of the Court have a majority. Then why all these_heroics ? ment wish to destroy the Bill. sire to prevent the passing of a workable measure? I appeal to the Committee to accept the Senate's amendment, and to leave the Court free to exercise its discretion in the matter of preference.

131,Mr Spence,"Why should they deit is designed to do away with strikes. If an employer feels that he can manage his business better when untrammeled by an award of the Court, he may readily avail himself of means to render himself immune in this respect. for him to let it be known amongst his employees that it will not be to their interests to join a union. If employers had adopted that course when the New South Wales Act came into operation, there might not have been so great a revival of unionism. The fact that in numerous cases the men did not organize before the passing of the Act, is evidence that they had not sufficient courage to resort to the old-fashioned methods of standing out against what they considered to be unfair treatment. fear of loss of employment would have deterred them from organizing. rica the workers are compelled to sign an agreement' that they will not join a union before they are engaged, and that system is in operation in all the States. Company make their men sign an agreement to that effect. forced to sign such agreements at the risk of losing their bread and butter. I wish to show that without preference to unionists, the employers can not only defeat the purposes of the measure, but also oppress unionists. That is being done in Australia at the present time, and is common in America, where the late Jay Gould had what was called an ironclad oath, which he compelled all his employees to take. How is the Bill to prevent the blacklisting of unionists unless preference is given ? It is the low-priced labourer and the sweating employer who have brought about the social evils against which we are now legislating. Such persons will not stick at anything. Without an organization it would be impossible to go to the Court for an award, and the present friction and trouble would remain. Buti f , when an organization has obtained an award, employers can give preference to non-unionists, the unionists will be penalized. The clause which prevents an employer from dismissing them because they are unionists is valueless, since an employer who held his tongue could easily evade its provisions. Without preference, nor only will individual unionists have no security, but the organizations themselves will have no security. To my mind, the term "" preference "" is a misnomer, and the word "" security "" should have been used in place of it. Under present circumstances, if the unionist is not safeguarded, preference is likely to be given to non-unionists, to those who have been so strongly denounced by the Prime Minister, It is only necessary who, in his next breath, championed their cause. The reason for giving preference to unionists is to make them secure, to give them a chance to earn their living, instead of being supplanted by non-unionists. The fact that in New South Wales men are joining unions without any coercion shows that the workers generally do not object to organization. They recognise the advantages which come from it. Is it necessary to consider the few selfish individuals who will not join unions, but who The are ready to take the advantages which flow from unionism? It is foolish to say In Amethat it is wrong to compel a man to pay his share for the benefits which he has received, though I agree that no one should be coerced into doing what is inimical to his interests. Do we allow any section of the property-owners in a municipality to escape the payment of rates ? f t property owners refuse to pay rates, the municipal authorities at once sue them, and they have to show that they have good ground for refusing to pay. prove their liability. fuse to pay have to prove justification for their action. Similarly, any non-unionist who refuses to join a union, should be asked to state his objections to doing so. The Court is open for him to do that. TheB i ll provides that no union shall have f rules which are unequal in their incidence. The door must be left open to non-unionists, and all objectionable features must be removed before there can be registration. The non-unionist gets as much benefit from unionism as do the unionists who for years have given their money and time, have sacrificed their interests, and have suffered as no men have suffered on the battle-field, for the advantage, not of themselves, but of their fel low-men. A non-unionist, however, who is a competent workman, has a better average chance of obtaining employment than has a unionist, because many employers make it a condition of employment that their men shall not be unionists, and shall not join unions. I interjected when the Minister was speaking that the employers claim to represent and to act for the non-unionists, that is, for those who have stood by them in time",34,Commonwealth Coinage

The members of the Pastoralists' Union not only have worked a system of boycott, but .have established a system of references which has been explained to honourable members. Non-unionists who stood by their employers during the shearing strikes, and declined to join the union, receive references from the stations on which they were employed, which have since become so valuable that in some instances they have been sold for as much as £ 5 each. ATather amusing incident occurred in connection with the purchase of one of these references, which had been granted to a man named Cohen. The man who had bought it went to the manager of the station, and asked for a job. He had assumed the name of Cohen, but he forgot that the man to whom the reference was given was a German Jew, who spoke broken English, whereas he himself was an Irishman. tected, and the reference was taken from him, so that he lost both it and the money which he paid for it. The President of the Pastoralists' Union in New South Wales, Mr able members may be disposed-irrespec W. E. Abbott, is always careful to say that the union represents and acts for non-unionist employees. The disputes which occur are not between employers and non-unionists, but between the employers and organized labourers, and when a case comes before the Court, they are the parties to it. The unionists look after the interests of the workers as a whole, whereas the employers look after their own interests and the interests of that particular section of employees whom they feel are of value to them. Therefore it cannot be said that these employee's are not represented. They are represented by the employers. Are we wrong in asking that the employers shall be compelled to show that the claims of the unionists are not just? the shearers everything they asked for, and yet they would not accept his terms ? us. In eight years the pastoralists refused on four or five occasions to meet us. That is why we need compulsory arbitration. meeting when the honourable member could not control his union ? everything that was asked for. correct. When the two parties to a dispute go before a Court, every one interested is, as I have shown, represented. It has been admitted that the unions which are likely to go to the Court comprise a majority of those in the trade. That being so, what need have the Government to take this stand about non-unionists? The employer acts for the non-unionists, and looks after them because they may become useful to him. He may utilize them to prevent an award from being secured. Bogus unions cannot be represented before the Court, but the employers can bring forward witnesses whose evidence might have great weight. All those interested could be represented, and there is no need for any special provision to afford protection to non-unionists. We have found it necessary to bring forward the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland, because we recognise that in view of the attitude assumed by honourable members opposite, it Consequently, the imposition was deis useless to expect them to agree to the Senate's proposal. We are now suggesting the amendment as an alternative, in the hope that a sufficient number of honortive of party considerations-to make the measure workable. It has been argued by the Minister of Defence that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland would be unworkable. It is extraordinary that the old axiom that if a rule is good it should work both ways should not apply on this occasion. ment were inserted the clause would be less workable than as it stands. proviso is workable; and that the amendment is less so.

We are willing to accept the clause use of without the proviso, but we cannot go further than that. ber agree to abandon preference altogether ? gard preference to unionists as the very essence of compulsory arbitration.

We say that no preference would be given to unionists, beyond that they would enjoy as superior workers. Only two classes of employers will be concerned in the disputes which will probably come before the Court, namely, the ship-owners and the pastoralists. The ship-owners would be parties to any disputes which might affect the marine engineers, the waterside workers, or the seamen, whilst the pastoralists would be concerned in any dispute affecting the Australian Workers' Union. I -understand that about twenty ship-owners practically control the whole of the coastal shipping trade of the Commonwealth, and I contend that it would be very easy for them to produce evidence against the granting of preference to, say, the members of the Seamen's Union. It would be more convenient for them to show that there was a majority against preference, than for the representatives of the 10,000 seamen to prove thai their application was supported by a majority. the officials of the Seamen's Union that that organization embraced 10,000 members would be accepted by the Court? They would be required to show that they represented a majority of the whole 01 those who would be affected by the award. The ship-owners have records of every man in their employment, and they know exactly how to communicate with them. might, with the greatest of ease, take a referendum in order to ascertain views of the men upon the subject of been told by employers that their workmen do not believe in unions, and that, as a matter of fact, the majority would be .content if there were no such organizations. that be the case, it should be easy for the employers to prove that the applicants for preference did not represent a majority. The pastoralists would be able to produce similar evidence, although in their case the difficulty would be greater. It has been admitted that so far as the Australian Workers' Union is concerned, there would be more difficulty in proving that a majority was in favour of preference, because the men are not employed continuously, but only for a few months every season, and do not work for the same employer every year. The pastoralists are organized, and have lists of their workmen, and could easily ascertain their views. They are, in fact, the only persons who could ascertain the opinions held by those who are not in the unions. We know that our union represents a majority of the men engaged in shearing and other bush work; but it would be very difficult for us to establish that fact before the Court. So far as reason and common sense are concerned, we might satisfy all requirements; but the Judge could not ignore the provision in the Bill that preference must be supported by' a majority of those affected by the award. a union went into Court, and asked for preference, it is inconceivable to me that the Court would not regard the whole of the members of the union as being in favour of the application. unable to ignore the terms of the proviso, which, as the honourable and learned member for Indi so forcibly pointed out, require that the application for preference must be approved by a majority of those affected by the award. It is not sufficient that a majority of the workers should be embraced by the union. shearers. Suppose that they had a dispute as to rates of pay, and w ent into the Court r and asked for preference. Even though they might be able to satisfy the Court that they represented the majority of the shearers, they could not establish the fact that they They represented the majority of those who would be affected by the award. The persons afthe fected might be held to include all the bush-workers whose occupation might be preference. We have frequently interfered with by a strike of shearers; all the wool-carters from the shearing sheds to the railway stations, all the carters from the railway station at Darling Harbor to If the ship's side in Sydney, and the wharf labourers who are paid so much per bale for stowing the wool in the ships' holds. It is impossible for us to know what view the Court would take in such a case. We cannot say positively who would or would not be affected by the award, and we should have to take our chance of any view which the Judge might entertain upon that point. I have the greatest faith in the fairness of the Judges; but I recognise the power and influence that would probably be exerted by the legal gentlemen employed by the employers, and the extent to which the Court would be required to adhere to the",36,Commonwealth Coinage

150,Mr Spence,"Tak e the case of theprovisions of the Bill. as President of the Australian Workers' Union, could put before the Court, would not be sufficient to satisfy me if I were on the bench. The Pastoralists' Unions hold their meetings just about the beginning of the year. festoes, setting forth the rates of pay and conditions of work for shearers for the coming season. At that time of the year, it is utterly impossible for us to reach the whole of our members. Many of them are nomadic, and have no settled place of residence. No one can determine the exact whereabouts of the members of such a great nomadic class. Union could not secure a vote of its own members, if it desired to do so, upon any particular date. I claim that the unionists should always be granted a preference. The proposal of the Government is that no preference shall be granted, unless the application is approved by a majority of those affected by the award. Court has to inform his mind upon the question in such manner as he thinks fit. Government does not express that. ber look at clause 25 ? states that before any preference is granted to unionists, the application for such preference must be approved by a majority of those who would be affected by the award of the Court. the methods prescribed by clause 25. raising has been emphasized by the Court in New South Wales. Our executive is the recognised authority of the Australian Workers' Union. ber be satisfied if we made it clear that all the unionists were to be regarded as supporting the application for preference? other considerations. We have had legal experience of this difficulty. It occurred in connection with the alteration of our rules, and the registration thereof. That alteration was effected by taking a plebiscite of as many members as we could reach by advertisement, and by an appeal through our Executive. Nevertheless the registrar held that that was not in keeping with the rules of our organization, and' consequently our application was refused. Is it The case which I , not reasonable to assume that the registrar of the Arbitration Court will entertain a similar view? Some honourable members have declared that the amendment has been prompted by a desire to prevent consideration being extended to employees who They then issue their maniare not organized. I deny that allegation. In fact, it is a bugbear. It is impossible to know who will be affected by any award of the Arbitration Court. In the Australian Workers' Union, the difference in its membership has totalled 8,000 within two years. That fact is entirely due to the destruction. of sheep through the drought. I would further point out that a certain The Australian Workers' class of individuals engage -in shearing 1 only when they cannot obtain other work, so that the number who would be affected by the Government proposal would be very large indeed. Honourable members are aware that Judges are required to deal with the cases which come before them upon the evidence which is presented. Do we not know that a decision is given upon the evidence that is submitted? Although a majority of shearers are members of the Australian Workers' Union, I would point out that the majority of those who would be affected by an award of the Court are not W ill the honourable memmembers of that organization. The employers recognise that fact. The Government proposal is the most ridiculous one that has ever been put before Parliament. On the other hand, nobody would suffer by the passing of the B ill in the form in which it has been agreed to by the Senate. We should be perfectly safe in accepting the decision of that House. The Opposition found it necessary to move an amendment, with a view, if possible, of arriving at a compromise, and, I think, that our proposal is a fair one. The Minister of Defence asserts .that if we passed the clause as it left this Chamber, it would be a workable one. I do not agree with him. The granting of preference to unionists is absolutely essential to the proper "" policeing"" and working of the measure. It cannot injure any one. It will not prevent any man obtaining employment. When a man is asked to join a union, he should recognise that it is to his benefit to do so. We have to submit to many things, of which we may personally disapprove, for the good of the whole community, and I think that it would be a good thing if men could be forced to join unions. The Opposition, however, do not ask for anything of the kind. We do not even say that the granting of preference shall be manda-",37,Commonwealth Coinage

Those who join a union voluntarily, do so because they know that it will be to their advantage. been coerced to join unions, but where' that has occurred, it has proved a good thing for the persons concerned. I am in a position to say that many men are thankful for the fact that they were compelled to join a union. become managers and foremen in various trades, date their start in life from the time when they were compelled ,to joina trade union. Yet we have had the Prime Minister roaring about a class of men who Object to join a union, although it is to their benefit to become unionists. Such men do not exist. The extraordinary assertion has been made by the Minister of Defence, that because we have voiced the opinions of unions who think that without this amendment the Bill will be unworkable, we are holding out a threat. When the Employers' Federation circulated j a very long screed among honourable members, urging them to reject this measure, no one suggested that they were threatening us in any way. It is our duty to see that the workers, in agreeing to come under a measure of this kind, and to forego all their old privileges, shall obtain something in return; we must see that they are not placed in a worse position. All that unionists think they would be far better without such a measure as this would be if the Senate's amendment were rejected, and th'ajt unless reasonable provision be made for preference, they will not take advantage of it. tq pass a workable B ill , and .that the Gowould be impossible for me to do so. vernment will consent to a ' reasonable amendment of the preference clause, even if they are ""not prepared to withdraw their opposition to the proposal made by another place. have had a fairly extensive experience Of strikes, and have taken part in some of them. I can say, however, that I have never counselled one, but, on the contrary, have done my best to avert such disputes. I was very glad when I found that we were likely to pass legislation for the set12 0 tlement of disputes by means of conciliation and arbitration; but. so far as I can see, the Government now propose to force upon the unions a B i ll which, if carried in the form they desire, will serve only to intensify industrial warfare. My experience as a trade unionist convinces me that that will be the only result. The Men have rarely Prime Minister told us that the amendment moved by the leader of the Opposition was repugnant to him; but I venture to say that the B ill , if passed in the form proposed by the Government, would be wholly distasteful to nineteen-twentieths of the Many who have unionists and non-unionists of Australia. The question of preference has been exhaustively discussed, and I have asked the Minister of Defence time after time to tell us how a union would be able to satisfy the Court that its application for preference was approved by a majority of those affected in the industry to which it related. It is one of the simplest things in the world for a lawyer to stand in this House, and say to the unions, ""You have the machinery, and can easily ascertain whether you represent a majority."" If we are to have such a clause as the Government wish to force upon us, how is the machinery of the unions to be put into operation? As a member of the executive of the Shearers' Union in South Australia, which comprises nearly 3,000 members, I have had some experience of that machinery. I have acted for years as returning officer for the union, and know that it is exceedingly difficult to take a ballot of the members. If I were asked haw said is, that they to issue circulars to ascertain the opinion of shearers who were not in the union, how should I be able to find them? That is one question which I submit to the Minister of Defence. Then, how should I be able to ascertain whether this man, or I trust that an effort will be made that, was interested in the industry? It I would also ask the honourable and learned gentleman to tell me who would be "" affected"" by an award, so that I might ascertain their opinions. Having settled that question how should I be able to reach these men? The Minister knows that his scheme is impossible, and yet he says that the Government are prepared to accept the principle of majority rule. The Bill will have to be greatly improved if the Government expect that the unions will abide by what may be demanded of them. Under the guise of giving us an",38,Commonwealth Coinage

As the Prime Minister remarked last night, our Bench up to the present has been pure; but he added that he was not going to say that it would be always so.

South Wales is different. who is administering the New South Wales Act; but I would not trust a man like the Chief Justice of that State, after his public utterances in regard .to the measure, to do justice to the workers. Mr Justice Cohen has stated that the giving of preference to unionists has not, and will not, injure any one. Why is it, if the principle is such a bad one, that when the last general elections were held in New South Wales the Conservative Party did not stump the country from end to end for its* repeal?

The effect of that would be that the Australian Workers' Union-of whose executive committee I am a member -woul d have to hold a meeting, not in Adelaide, but in Sydney, to alter its rules, in order to register, and before that could be done, a bogus union, such as has been spoken of in the strongest terms of disparagement by the Prime Minister, might register, 'and obtain preference. We seriously object to placing ourselves under a Bill which allows that to be done, and I shall not vote for the' measure if it contains these objectionable provisions. It has been said that the ex-Prime Minister accepted these provisions. I did not do so, however, neither did the majority of the Labour Party. I am sorry that the ex-Prime Minister accepted them, but he did so because he knows the anxiety of the unions, of the public, and of some of the employers to obtain a Commonwealth Arbitration Bill, and, therefore, he conceded as much as he could. He would strike them out to-morrow if he could do so, but he has not a sufficient number of followers behind him. The honourable member for Dalley, who objects to these provisions, will not come to this sideand help to make the Bill better. The Minister of Defence has complained that we say that preference requires no justification. Why should it? Does he think that the unions should give up all that they oossess-and , Heaven knows, that is very little tification for it , if it were properly safeguarded. and learned gentleman wishes to safeguard it in the interests of the non-unionists. But if there were 2,000 men in an industry, of whom 1,001 were members of a union, there would be no security for the other 999. able member give preference to a minority ? provides for preference being given to unionists, members of unions will be dismissed all over the Commonwealth. WeI have not objected do not wish to coerce any one to join unions. That is not done at the present I have no desire time; but it is the object of the B ill . In my opinion, the measure will do the greatest injury and injustice to the trade unionists who, as the Prime Minister has admitted, have, done such a great work for their fellows. We have been accused of having accepted some of these provisions, but we have accepted only what we could not help accepting. Honourable members must not think that I am satisfied because I am prepared to accept the amendment now proposed by the leader of the Opposition. That will not induce me to vote for the B ill . There is another provision of more importance ; than this. On the Government side there are over a dozen members who are entirely opposed to arbitration, and they are now trying to thrust upon us a Bill wbjich we do not want. If they were true to 'their pledges, however, they would help us'to throw the Bill under the table, rather than pass it as it stands. The Minister of Defence has said that the effect of the New South Wales arbitration legislation has been to force employees into the unions, and he fears that under this B ill , if employees are forced into unions, they will be used for political purposes. said that the figures showed that a majority of the available men were members of unions. the Minister's word's, which were to the effect that the New South Wales Act had been instrumental in forcing the men into urtions. to the correctness of my notes taken at the time. If the Minister's statement be corI said that there was jusrect, I should like to know how it is that niany thousands of workers are still non-unionists. I am sure that there is nothing in 1 the contention of the Minister. Those who desire to take advantage of the Bill must join the existing unions or form others, yet the Minister is unwilling to grant preference to unionists. He says that bogus unions will spring up like mushrooms if the amendment of the honW o u l d 'the honororable member for Bland is adopted. We do not think so If , however, the Minister thinks that the Bill will afford encouragement to bogus unions, he should do everything he possibly can to assist us to prevent that result from being brought about.",41,Commonwealth Coinage

If so, I should like to know what all the fuss is about? I predict that in every case which comes before the Court, the employers will seek to show that the applicants for preference are in a minority, and, in many cases, the proof to the contrary will not be forthcoming. The experience which has been gained in connection with the Shearers' Union in South Australia should be sufficient to demonstrate that it is difficult to say who are or are not engaged in that occupation. Unless some radical amendment is introduced into the Bill the unions will refrain from registration under it .

FIRE BRIGADE TELEPHONES : DESTRUCTIO N The Minister OF TREES BY THE TELEGRAPH That the House do now adjourn. Mr .MAUGER (Melbourne Ports) I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a matter of considerable importance. It is reported in to-day's newspapers that the Post and Telegraph Department proposes to take some very drastic steps in connection with the fire brigade telephone and fire alarms. After years of toil, expenditure, and experiment, we have established a fairly complete fire brigades system, but if the proposals of the Department are carried out a most important institution will receive a serious set-back. I suggest that the Postmaster-Generalshould call a conference of the Superintendents of Fire Brigades in each of the States, to discuss matters with him before he takes any definite step, and, further, that in the event of his determining to make any change in regard to the fire alarms, he should give the -House an opportunity, to consider his proposals. the officers of his Department in some of the country towns in New South Wales. In I s the honourable member some of these places the telegraph lines are roads close to such parks, and the officers Many of my forefathers died these towns most inconsiderately in asking If any serious industrial trouble graph posts which the Department say canask him to exercise that common sense and courage which distinguish him.

It is sheer vandalism to cut down trees which have been planted at such great cost, and which combine so much utility with ornamentation. I am sure that if the Minister took the course I suggest he would be cordially supported by honourable members. notice that in some cases handsome trees have been destroyed or disfigured merely because the telegraph officials wished to avoid the trouble entailed in shifting a telewhatever. Had the telegraph poles been graph post or two for a few yards. Arboriculture is not encouraged in New South Wales to the same extent as in some parts of Victoria, and those townspeople who have been sufficiently public-spirited to plant trees in their streets should be protected against such acts of vandalism as those which are often committed by the officers of the Department. I hope the Minister will give the matter his most serious attention. those members who'objected to the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act authorizing the Department to lop trees which interfered with telegraph lines. The Committee was divided upon the question, but the provision was agreed to by an overwhelming majority, of whom the honourable member for Robertson formed one. favour of vandalism. honourable member for Robertson was in favour of that provision. I think that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was in charge of the Bill at the time. Sir Malcolm McEacharn fomented opposition to it, but I find that honourable members who wished to alter the Act sense to be applied to the matter. right to infringe the law than has any other member of the community. up by the Government is ridiculous. consideration, the right honourable member for Swan was one of the ablest supporters of vandalism. Sir Malcolm McEacharn foretold what would happen. I appeal to honourable members to be consistent in this matter. add a few words to the appeal of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I do not propose to review the action of the last Parliament, or to comment upon that of the present Parliament. I contend that the law to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Maranoa is working harshly in the case of country districts. Ir> one town in my own constituency, I am aware that the people have incurred considerable expense in planting the main street with good shady trees; Nevertheless, those trees have been made an eyesore to the residents, and confer no benefit upon them erected a little earlier the lopping of the trees would have been avoided. This is a serious matter to persons who have to put their hands into their pockets to improve the town in which they live, and I trust that the Government will pay some attention to it. dorse the remarks of the previous speakers. It seems to me that there is a general complaint in regard to this matter. This House expects that in the administration of any Act regard will be paid to the local circumstances which obtain. In districts where the summer temperature ranges from 80 to 100 degrees in the shade, persons appreciate the advantage of shady trees. But after these trees have attained the growth of many years, the Department is in a position to say to the particular loI did not vote in cality interested, "" You must pay us so much, otherwise the trees will be destroyed."" In my own district I am aware that a demand was made for the payment of £ 1 7 or £ 1 8 for removing telegraph poles. In this connection, I trust that the common sense of the Minister will prevail, and that before any such action is taken in the future a fair understanding will be arrived at with the local residents. to impress upon the Postmaster-General1 that this vandalism should be stopped'. Innear ly every town in Australia some expenditure has been incurred in connection with the planting of trees. In many of these towns the trees are being disfigured, if not killed, by the Post and TelegraphDepartment. I should like the Postmaster General to issue instructions that treesplanted by municipalities shall not be touched without the consent of the local governing body.",43,Department
