With regard to the establishment of a school at Tennant's Creek, it is a little dimcult at the moment to decide on the best site. This is a big mining field extending over some hundreds of square miles, and it is difficult at present to say method by which the Defence Department at which spot the school would best serve future requirements. I assure the honourable member that I shall look into the matter when I visit Tennant's Creek, which I propose to do within about three weeks. Minister for Defence state what progress has been made in the formation of Scottish regiments in the various States, and, also, what assistance or encouragement the department.has been able to give in this direction? 5th Battalion in Victoria which is known as the Victorian Scottish Eegiment is allied with the Gordon Highlanders. The 30th Battalion in New South Wales which is known as the City of Sydney Regiment is allied with the Black Watch Royal Highlanders. The clothing of these Scottish regiments in full Highland uniform is progressing. It is understood that Highland uniforms were issued to non-commissioned officers, and men of the Victorian Scottish Regiment at their head-quarters in Sturt-street, South Melbourne, last night. The outfits cost each man approximately £4 10s., in addition to the Government allowance. No allowance extra to the clothing allowance for all Infantry units is granted to Scottish regiments. However, the value of certain items of clothing that are not required by the Scottish regiments is allowed and articles of Highland pattern may be purchased from that allowance. In some cases where it is possible, Highland pattern articles of uniform are issued, such as the Highland pattern -jacket and glengarry instead of field serhonorable member a considerable area vice cap. Additional articles such as kilts and sporran which are not provided by the department and cannot be obtained from the normal clothing allowance must be -obtained privately. I would add that this matter is proceeding very satisfactorily and that the Scottish people, in supporting such a movement, have set an example which might readily be followed by members of other national societies in Australia. Minister for Defence inform me of the arrived at its decision to ally local regiments with regiments in Great Britain? Can he tell me also, why preference was given to the Gordon Highlanders and the Black Watch, when such a regiment as the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders at Inverness could have been chosen? Such arrangements are made directly by the battalions concerned. the prosecution of Mr Gerald Griffin, apart from the question of costs which is comparatively a minor matter of importance only to those participating in them, will the Government consider making adequate compensation to this man against whom a prosecution has proved abortive, and, in future, will it endeavour to make better use of the excellent legal advice at its disposal? it is the feeling of everybody in Australia that migrants of a certain kind should be prevented from landing in this country. Rather than adopt the suggestion made by the honourable member, I think the Government is much more likely, to consider amending the law in this respect.

Furthermore, the fact that the United States of America is not a member of the Air Convention to which otheT countries, notably Great Britain and Australia, are parties, causes further difficulty in permitting the entrance into Australia of machines from the United States of America.

I do not know that gentleman, but his inquiries must have been very superficial if he did not know the censorship laws of the United States of America under which many books banned under the Australian law are also banned in America. Of course, some books not banned in America are banned in Australia. Mr Metcalfe made a comparison between Australia and Great Britain; but evidently he did not know that prosecutions are occasionally launched in Great Britain under the censorship law, and heavier penalties are imposed than is. the case in Australia. was prosecuted for having imported certain books into Great Britain and was fined £100.

60,Mr Casey,"No; this uill ratifies thehand and the various States on the other. Mr Justice Pike, after a very f u l l in vestigation, recommended that the losses should be shared equally between the Oommonwealth on the one hand and the States on the other. H is recommendation was accepted by all parties, and, so f a r as the Commonwealth was concerned, involved writing off an additional amount of approximately £2,600,000 as from the 30th June, 1927. This position was dealt with briefly in the budget speech of 1929-30, and an announcement was made that the Commonwealth accepted the recommendation of Mr Justice Pike, and would in due course take action accordingly, after the States had accepted and ratified the resulting agreement. The total losses as found by Mr Justice Pike were approximately £24,000,000. Under his recommendation the Commonwealth was asked to bear one-half of that sum, namely £12,000,000, but towards that half there was taken into account the financial assistance which had previously been given under these various headings by the Commonwealth to the States. Briefly summarizing the directions in which the Commonwealth has helped the States in this matter, the 50 per cent, of the responsibility assumed by this Government is made up as follows:Contributions mainly by way of an interest Tebate of 2 i per cent, per annum for the first five years to enable the States to provide advances at reduced rates of interest to settlers .. . -4,700,000 Loans by Commonwealth to States to be written off£ From 1st October, 1925 5,000,000 As at 30th June. 1.927 2.600.000 7.600,000 The two amounts of £5,000,000 and £2,600,000 I have already referred to From the 1st January, 1931, the interest charged to the States on outstanding loans was reduced from actual cost to a flat rate of 5 per cent, and subsequently, following the floating of the large internal conversion loan in Australia, the rate was further reduced, as from the 31st July, 1931, to 4 per cent. The agreement, the execution of whicli was delayed for various reasons, and Mr Casey. which is attached to the bill and thereby submitted to Parliament for approval, deals, broadly speaking, with the following main subject headings:(a) The classes of persons eligible for settlement under the agreement; (ft) The acknowledgment by the States of sums advanced to them by the Commonwealth; (c) The acknowledgment by the Commonwealth of the remission of portion of the indebtedness of the States; (d) The rates of interest payable by the States; (e) The maximum rates of interest chargeable to settlers; ( / ) The engagement of the States to complete a satisfactory settlement of the settlers who have remained on the land, particularly in regard to home maintenance areas. The balance of the loans now due by the States to the Commonwealth, after allowing for the writing-off of the £7,600,000 previously detailed, is approximately £27,000,000. Clause 15 of the agreement provides that from the 1st July, 1933, this sum shall be regarded as a debt owing by the States to the public, instead of £ as a debt owing by the States to the from revenue, Commonwealth Government. of machinery, with the object of simplif y in g inter-governmental accounting. The clause has been agreed to by all the States. As previously stated, effect has been given in the accounts of the Commonwealth and the States to the financial provisions of this agreement in respect to the writingoff of the £5,000,000 from October, 1925, 12,300,000 and the subsequent further sum of £2,600,000 from June, 1927, the action in both cases having been carried out after being dealt w i th in this House. I shall explain how the financial agreement comes into this picture. In the financial agreement the totals of the States' debts as at 30th June, 1927, which were subsequently taken over by the Commonwealth, are set down specifically. This new agreement affects these totals of debts as between the Commonwealth and the States, and consequently it is",17,Second Reading
61,Mr Francis,What is the difference?,18,Second Reading
62,Mr Casey,"It is merely a matternecessary to amend the financial agreement in respect of those altered totals. The amount of £5,000,000 to be written off as from October, 1925, was deducted in computing the debts of the States for the purposes of the financial agreement, but the further amount of £2,600,000 to be written off, which was a subsequent development, was not deducted from the States' debts. Consequently a clause is provided in the agreement, the eflect of which is to reduce the net debt of the States as at the 30th June, 1927, as set out in the financial agreement, by approximately that amount of £2,600,000. In drafting the agreement the opportunity was taken to make a small amendment in one of the clauses of the financial agreement itself, relating to membership of the Australian Loan Council. In explanation, I remind honourable members that in order to amend the financial agreement in any respect it is necessary to come to an agreement and to have it ratified by all the parliaments of the States and the Commonwealth. That, of course, means rather a major operation. [Quorum formed.] I was endeavouring, when interrupted, to explain to the House the reason for the introduction of an amendment of the financial agreement into this agreement, which relates to soldier settlement loans. In the experience of the administration of the financial agreement and the Loan Council, a point has arisen which, in the opinion of the various governments, has necessitated a clarification of one of the clauses of the financial agreement. As no amendment could be made of the financial agreement other than by another agreement and its ratification by law by all the parliaments of Australia, the opportunity of the introduction of this bill in each Parliament was taken as a convenient means of introducing the small amendment necessary. agreement provides for a Loan Council consisting of "" One Minister of State of the Commonwealth to be appointed in writing from time to time by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to represent the Commonwealth, and one Minister of State of each State to be appointed in writing from time to time by the Premier of that State to represent that State."" ' In moBt cases the Prime Ministers and Premiers were also the respective Treasurers of their Governments, and it was desirable for them to nominate themselves in many instances as members of the Loan Council. Some doubt has been expressed as to whether the Prime Minister or a Premier could legally appoint himself as a representative of his Government to the Loan Council, and, in order to clarify the matter, provision has been made in clause IS of this agreement to amend the financial agreement so that the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the States shall be ex officio members of the Loan Council, with, of course, the right to appoint substitute representatives should they choose to do so. Apart from these two minor alterations the agreement does not alter the financial agreement in any way, and I give the House the assurance that neither does the agreement in any way affect the future administration of soldier land settlement. With that brief explanation of the bill, I commend it to the House and hope that honourable members will give it a speedy passage. surer explain why the reservation "" other than the State of Queensland"" is inserted in clause 12 of the agreement as it appears on page 5 of the bill ? able member the reason offhand, but I undertake to inform him during the course of the debate.

As a direction to the Government that a Parliamentary Select Committee, representative of all parties in this House, and assisted hy qualified experts, be set up to inquire into the banking and monetary systems of Australia, I move this amendment now because I desire to avail myself of the last opportunity we shall have this session to discuss this very important subject. During the recent election campaign the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) stated that he would not oppose the holding of an inquiry into the banking and monetary systems if the new Parliament desired it. On the 20th February this year it was announced that Cabinet had decided to appoint a royal commission to conductsuch an inquiry. In a recent issue of the Sydney Morning Herald it was stated that the Prime Minister, during his visit to London, would probably investigate the possibility of obtaining the services of an overseas chairman for the royal commission. Before this, the Sydney Morning Herald, of the 7 th January, stated that the names of two business men had been mentioned as possible chairmen of the commission; one was Sir Walter Massy-Greene, who was Assistant Treasurer in Mr Lyons's first Ministry, and the other was Mr E. C. Dyason, of Edward Dyason and Company, stockbrokers, and a director of many Victorian companies. Reports have also mentioned the names of Sir George Schuster, formerly economic and financial adviser to the Colonial Office, and a recent appointee to the position of director of the Westminster Bank; Sir Charles Addis, a director of the Bank of England; and Sir Josiah Stamp, another director of the Bank of England. Australians have a vivid recollection of other visits by overseas financial experts, and of what resulted therefrom. They have not yet forgotten the visit of the "" B i g Four "", or the visit of Sir Otto Niemeyer, ancl they do not want a repetition of the policies which were inflicted on this country as a result of those visits. If a chairman from overseas is appointed to this royal commission, as seems possible, the inquiry would become definitely suspect before ever it began. I fear that I shall have to rule out of order any further discussion on the lines which the honourable member has been following. The honourable member is in order in moving that the amount of the proposed vote be reduced by £1, but he may not enter upon a discussion which would anticipate debate on a motion already on the notice-paper. notice-paper has to do with the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the banking and monetary systems of Australia. I do not propose to trespass on that ground. I do not want a royal commission to be appointed; I want a Parliamentary Select Committee to inquire into these matters. honourable member seeks an inquiry into the banking and monetary systems of Australia, and necessarily any debate on that matter must cover the same ground as a debate on the motion already on the notice-paper. the honourable member who has given notice of that motion desires to reach the same goal as myself, but we propose to travel hy different roads, and it may well be that, as a result, we may arrive at different destinations. honourable member further in order to determine whether the debate will be in order. any longer shirk its responsibilities, but must institute an immediate inquiry into our banking and monetary systems in view of the fact that, at the last elections, 1,300,000 electors voted for a radical change in the present banking system.

73,Mr Beasley,"Parliamen t cannotHerald, which, in a leading article published in its issue of 11th December, 1934, statedIt is difficult to imagine what form of inquiry instituted by the Australian Government could effect a useful purpose. The usual procedure . . . is for the Government to appoint a royal commission and to define the scope of its investigations. The Government would . . . have to obtain, as members of the commission of inquiry, persons who were acknowledged to be very learned in the science of economics, but who have not been identified with any of the semi-political discussions on monetary policy that have been exercising Australia for the past three years. So far as Australia is concerned, probably all those who oould be regarded as its leading authorities . . . have taken a prominent part in public discussions, and . . . have ruled themselves out as thu unbiased judges whose findings would be generally accepted, nor would it be much use searching outside Australia for the authorities who could take the evidence and give a finding on the monetary policy as settling the matter for Australia.

It has heen admitted, in quarters have no affiliations with the Labour movement, that if one-half of the facts set out by the Leader of the Lahour of New South Wales, Mr Lang, in his Mr Beasley. recent volume WhyI Fight, are accepted, the private banks should be hounded out of the community l if e of this country. There is an adequate field for an inquiry by a tribunal that is determined to get at the truth. To appoint a commission on which the 1,300,000 electors who voted for the nationalization of banking were not given definite representation would be to make it a mockery of justice, and to confirm the belief that the banks control the governments of to-day. Therefore, I claim that Parliament should set up its own committee of inquiry, and decide itself on the scope of the investigation. At least, Parliament must decide the terms of reference of any royal commission on this vital subject. The recent experience of the Petrol Royal Commission alone shows that, in general, these commissions are not only costly hut also expert time-spinners. Even the Sydney Morning Herald, referring to the proposed royal commission on banking, declared on the 7th January lastcommittee on If the inquiry is instituted immediately it adequate will probably take twelve or eighteen months with facilities to obtain to complete, and the expense incurred would assistance probably make it rank with -the royal comThe two recent inmission on petrol as an item of federal espenditure. Por the reasons I have given, the duty of Parliament to appoint such a commission and the diabolical activities cannot be shirked.

In 1924 Great Britain spent £50,000,000 on its army, compared with £43,500,000 this year, a reduction of £6,500,000. £56,000,000 in 1924, and in the Estimates brought forward last month it proposes to repair some of the wastage and damage caused to its fleets over recent years and for this purpose this year will spend £60,000,000. Also its expenditure on the air force will be increased from £15,000,000 to £24,000,000. ' Such is the increased expenditure proposed by a nation which has led every country in the movement for universal peace. But the commitments which Britain has to face in other parts of the world precludes that country from affording protection to Australia. There can be no beating about the bush in this matter. We in Australia are therefore obliged to make some effort on our own part to protect ourselves. With this end in view the Commonwealth Government last year allocated £4,000,000 for the establishment of a trust fund. It is to be commended for its action in this respect, but we are not yet doing suflicient for any one of the three services of the armed forces to keep pace with efforts in this direction by other countries. It is interesting to examine the expenditure per capita of the population in various countries for defence purposes. This figure exceeds 45s. a head in Great Britain, about 30s. in the United States of America, 20s. in Japan and 15s. lOd. in Australia. [Leave to continue given.] Our estimated expenditure on defence for the current year from all sources including loan money and allocations for for the army and 2s. l i d . for the air In this matter this Parliament has Australia. We have sincerely tried to achieve peace through disarmament. The Scullin Government, when in power, made a gesture in this direction. I understand that when he attended a conference at Geneva on this subject, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) was able to tell the conference that Australia had disarmed. Never was a truer word spoken concerning this matter as it affects Australia, because we had, at that time, not only disarmed, but On' its navy it spent had emasculated forces which had been built up on the traditions of the A.I.P. To-day we are faced with the problem of re-forming our defences. We have to provide an insurance fund of some sort, and we have made a start in this direction by the purchase of a cruiser. This, however, does not complete our obligation under our agreement with Great Britain to provide for our own defence. So far as the navy is concerned, we are still one cruiser short. This position may be rectified later. As regards the air force we find that Great Britain proposes to increase its air force hy 50 squadrons, the increase to be spread over last year, this year and next year. Even then Great Britain will remain only the sixth nation in the world as an air power, Germany, France, Russia, Italy and the United States of America taking precedence over Great Britain in that respect. This fact may come as a shock to some of us who, because we have been accustomed to see only British aeroplanes in this country, have probably been led to believe that Britain is one of the greatest air powers. Australia's requirements from the point of view of an air force, are different from those of Great Britain. This is because we need a certain type of plane to cover our long distances, and because the facilities for providing those",25,Second Reading

86,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [2.17],"subject, it cannot be denied that, under existing conditions, the elected representatives of the people who form this Parliament are being kept in a subservient position. Although we may have read in the' report of the Imperial Conference of 1926-and it was repeated in the report of the conference of 1930-a statement to the effect that the dominions were no longer subservient to the Imperial Parliament, the inaction of the Commonwealth Government in respect to the ratification of the Statute of Westminster has left us in a subservient position. We have been told, on occasions, that the Imperial Parliament, having passed the act constituting the Commonwealth of Australia, can now, or in the future, revoke, amend or repeal that measure. . The same may be said of the Statute of Westminster. members that it is one thing for the Imperial Parliament to make a decision of this description and quite another for it to attempt to override any decision of the Commonwealth Parliament and then enforce its view on the people of this dominion. I find, on looking back over certain happenings in this country during a period of years, that the right of the Commonwealth Parliament was challenged on one occasion by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company when it refused to submit certain evidence to a royal commission. The company obtained the requisite certificate from the High Court and made an appeal to the Privy Council, in which it questioned thc power of the Commonwealth Parliament to pass the Royal Commissions Act. The Privy Council decided that the Commonwealth Parliament did not possess such power. In these circumstances, the Commonwealth Government of the day should not have neglected to take the earliest available opportunity to intimate to the Imperial authorities that Australia regarded itself as having complete control of its own affairs, ancl that the represenAustralia should remain in subservience tatives the people elected to this Parliament would not submit to any overriding of their decisions or those of the High Court of Australia. suggest, for a moment, that the decisions of the gentlemen who sit on the High Court Bench, or the expressed opinions of the members of this Government, do Mr Ward. not sometimes savour of a desire to limit the operations of this Parliament, but the Labour Party, at least, should make quite clear our determination that the people of Australia shall be the master? of their own affairs. It seems to me> however, that certain provisions of the Constitution were framed to meet the day when a Labour government, with the courage' of its convictions and a determination to carry its policy into ful l effect, would occupy the treasury bench. I believe that certain provisions have been included in t.he Constitution which would make it exceedingly diffipult for even a. Labour government with an adequate majority in both Houses of the Parliament to proceed to carry out its policy. Such a government would have to make radical But I remind honourable changes in regard to the political structure of the State. Some people hold the view, wrongly, I think that the Commonwealth Constitution can be amended in any respect provided that the people of Australia act in a certain way; but it seems to me that certain provisions of the Imperial act constituting the Australian Commonwealth imply that in some respects our Constitution can be altered only by the Imperial Parliament itself. This is a matter of major importance, and if failure to remedy these disabilities means that the Commonwealth Parliament is to be hampered in its operations, it is time that a radical change was effected in the situation. As an Australian-born citizen, I assert that no authority outside of the Commonwealth should be able successfully to challenge the right of this Parliament to deal -with the problems of this country. The Imperial Parliament would instantly resent any attempt to interfere with its authority to enforce its decisions, and so, I submit, should the Commonwealth Parliament. Some honorahle members opposite may hold the view that to the Imperial authorities, notwithstanding that the claim has been made time and again that we are a selfI do not governing community. We may pretend to ourselves that we are the masters of our fate, but in certain respects the people of Australia have remained vassals of the Imperial Parliament ever since the colonies were founded; and until it 13 measure was illegal, no action has been made abundantly clear that no outside taken to compel the Irish Free State to authority has any power to veto the alter its decision. decision of this Parliament and of the High Court of Australia, it cannot to re-state my point of order?

91,Mr Ward,"I was endeavouring tothrough that channel to such a degree that Ministers in this chamber have been prepared, on every available occasion, to retract the statements they made when they appeared before the electors, and give eifect to a policy which is not in the the Prime Minister will consult best interests of the Australian community. Earlier in the debate, mention was made of the fact that we had in this country a democracy which was worth maintaining. If democracy means anything, it should at least mean the right of the people to have the final word as to the policy to be followed by the Government. have the opportunity to express their views only once every three years. Any party can go before them and espouse a certain policy, but the electors have no guarantee that, when returned as a government, it will give eifect to the policy the interests of the general community, which they approve of, and no legal power to compel it to. do so. During the last election campaign the members of the Government, including the right honourable fhe Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page), said that it was a doctrine of despair, so far as Australia was concerned, to suggest that she should restrict her exports of primary products. They declared that they would not favour a policy of restriction, but immediately the Imperial authorities communicated their wishes to the Commonwealth Government, they were prepared meekly to bow the knee. not help themselves. they were forced into that position. At least the Australian people should be told the actual state of affairs. They should know that this Parliament sits for no other purpose than to give effect to decisions arrived at on the other side of the world. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) who has noticed in the press statements made by the supporters of the Government, has done right in calling attention, to the incommunity was raised, in order to give tention of the Government to find on the other side of the world a chairman for the royal commission which to inquire into the operations of private hanking in Australia. The Prime Minister himself said, I think, that he proposed to take steps in that direction when in London, so that a chairman who would not hold fixed opinions in regard to the operations of private banking in Australia could be secured. No doubt the British Government, which at the moment is composed of men whose duty and function it is to protect the vested interests which primarily they represent. The British Government will then doubtless recommend to the Prime Minister as chairman some gentleman who shares their fixed opinions Unfortunately, the people with regard to the operations of private business concerns. That gentleman, when appointed, will conduct any inquiry that may be held, not with a view to delving into the operations of the private banks, and discovering how they militate against but rather as a white-washing campaign to lull the public into a sense of security. He will do his best to convince the people of Australia that there is nothing that requires to be hidden in the operations of the private banks, and that they are really carried on in the best interests of the whole Commonwealth. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. P. Harrison) stressed the necessity for increased expenditure upon defence. I have tried from time to time in this Parliament to impress upon honourable members that the best defence we can have in this country is to give the people a decent living standard, in order to give them an incentive to defend it. I heard questions asked to-day with regard to the unsatisfactory position of recruitment for the armed forces of Australia. If it were not for the economic conditions prevailing outside, the position of recruitment would be much worse than it is at the present time, because many men joined up with the armed forces in order to obtain the food and clothing that they so much require. On the other hand, if the living standard of the whole them something that they believed worth defending and fighting for, there would be no need for patriotic speeches to stimuit promised to appoint late recruitment, because every member of the community would then he prepared to take up arms in defence of this country if the occasion arose to do",31,Second Reading
92,Mr Lazzabini,They said they could,32,Second Reading
93,Mr Ward,"Yes, they pleaded thatso. The history of Australia shows that many of our defence arms have been declared obsolete long before their term of usefulness has expired. The reason is that those interested in the manufacture of armaments are able to influence the decisions of departmental oflicials, and of members of this chamber, and consequently recommendations have continually come forward that certain portions of our armament are obsolete, necessitating the purchase or construction of new and additional equipment. As regards the spending of money upon armaments, what guarantee can this Parliament or the people of the Commonwealth hav« that they will not in the future be involved in wars in the making of which they have no say, and of which they do not approve? So long as we are under Imperial domination, the British authorities can determine when we shall go to war, and, under the existing Constitution, if they had the courage or desire to do so, they could actually impose conscription upon the manhood of Australia without referring the matter to this Parliament or to the people of the Commonwealth. I should not be prepared to vote additional expenditure on defence armaments under those conditions. There are many ways in which the money could be more usefully expended. The Acting Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that the financial position has materially improved. that, in the opinion of members on this side, is a particularly good reason why Parliament should continue to sit and give effect to what was promised to the electors during the election campaign. TJp to the present the Government has done very little in that direction. Instead of expending the surplus revenue on purchasing implements of war, it would much better suit the Government to take care of the wreckage left over from the last war. During the last few weeks, honourable members have received numerous letters from ex-soldiers who are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, asking that the Government should grant them pensions. Many of these unfortunate men, who left this country believing that they were fighting for the preservation of democracy, and that Australia would take care of them when they returned, or look after their dependants if they made the supreme sacrifice, are inmates of institutions throughout the various States, and are unprovided for by the Government because they are unable to prove that their particular disability is attributable to their war service. No more cowardly attitude has ever been adopted by any department or government than is typified by that particular provision which compels an unfortunate member of the community to prove that his disability is due to a particular cause. The mere fact that he is a sufferer from a dreadful complaint should be sufficient to induce any government or community to come to his aid. In the opinion of the Labour party these men should be entitled to a pension without being under any obligation to prove that their disabilities are due to war service. The Government has not yet done what it should for the invalid and old-age pensioners. Although, according to the Statistician's figures, the cost of living increase dates from the 1st January of this year, the pensioners will not receive the 6d. a week addition to their pensions until July next. During the five months that Parliament will be in recess the pensioners will be passing through the winter months, the hardest months in the year for them, and they will not receive until July next even the meagre increase to which they are entitled. It is true that If it has, the Government has removed from the act certain obnoxious provisions, but it acted not from a praiseworthy desire to help the pensioners, but because it had found the provisions difficult to operate, and because, as a result of them, it was losing favour in the eyes of the electors. Just before the last election the Government indicated its readiness to repeal those provisions under which claims could be made against the relatives of pensioners, so that even the credit for that cannot be given to the present Government. When these specific items come up for discussion, honorahle members on this side of the House will be able to cite instances of undue hardships being suffered by pensioners and those who have made applications for pensions. The Government has been equally culpable in regard to its treatment of the unemployed. In fact, the unemployment position has not improved at all. Many of those who were previously classified as unemployed may at the moment be doing some work, hut in New South Wales at any rate, thousands of men ou relief work ire worse off to-day under the anti-Labour Stevens Government than they previously were when they drew the dole. member's time has expired. [2.48] I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. P. Harrison) whose opinions ondefence must naturally command respect both inside .and outside the House. I maintain that the history of our time will record nothing finer than Britain's gesture to the world on behalf of peace during recent years. The nations of the world have been sitting in almost endless conference iu Geneva; the deliberations of the Disarmament Conference have lasted for nearly three years, under the presidency of a man for whom I have the greatest regard Mr Arthur Henderson. During that 'time Britain progressively reduced its armaments, as an example to the other nations of the world. It reduced armaments almost to the point of madness, until at last it was realized that the process could not be carried further. The example which Great Britain had given was not followed. The smaller nations had always looked to Britain as the custodian of World peace, and I fear that this very action of Britain in reducing armaments, caused her to lose prestige. On the last occasion when I was in Geneva this fact was, in my opinion, demonstrated during the election of vicepresidents. On all previous occasions it seemed to be taken for granted that the British delegate should be returned at the head of the list of six vice-presidents, but, on this occasion, to my surprise, the list was headed by the delegate of another nation which had set out some years -before to pile up armaments. I have always maintained that the provision of measures for national security is the great obligation resting upon a national government. It was certainly a definite obligation taken over by the Commonwealth Government at the time of federation. I have sometimes been asked how I can reconcile my views on defence with my acceptance of the Government's invitation to go to Geneva as one of its representatives upon more than one occasion. It is easy for me to make that reconciliation; to do so it is only necessary to refer to Article8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. That article which is so clear, and yet so often misunderstood, contains these wordsThe members of the league recognize that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national arma,ments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by coniimon action of international obligations. By virtue of that article it is incumbent on all nations which are signatories to the League Convenant, to take steps to provide for national defence, which is something quite different from piling up armaments in preparation for an aggressive attack upon other nations. I .am not a. blood-thirsty scoundrel. My experience of three wars, with all their misery and suffering, and of their tragic aftermath, has made me wish ardently for peace in our time, and for successive generations. However, the condition of the world today is such that there can be enduring peace only if there is security, either collective or individual. I have a vivid recollection of my first visit to Geneva in 1922, when I sat on a committee which tried to draw up an agreement providing for the reduction of armaments by members of the league. It was a treaty providing for mutual guarantees, but even -at that time it quickly 'became evident that we were engaged upon a hopeless undertaking. The representatives of some nations maintained that it would be impossible to have security without disarmament, while others said that it would be impossible to have disarmament without security. That agreement was never ratified. I congratulate the present Government on its recognition of the great responsibility which devolves upon it for the maintenance of national security. Even those of us to whom the word "" war "" is anathema, realize that present world conditions make it essential that we should be in a position to defend ourselves if necessary against a potential enemy. We are the most",32,Second Reading

We are anxious to maintain friendly relations with other countries, and to develop our great heritage in our own way. Nevertheless, it is our sacred duty as a people, and the inescapable duty of this Parliament, to prepare to defend ourselves against the aggressive action of any enemy, outside our gates. We must all admit that defence is only a measure of national insurance. Living as we do in an ordered community, we still find it necessary to maintain a police force, to have criminal courts and jails, and to lock our doors and windows. If such precautions are necessary to defend ourselves against internal enemies, how much more necessary is it that we should take adequate steps to defend ourselves against possible aggression from outside? I do not believe that war is looming, or that there is any immediate risk of it, but it remains true that the condition of the world is such that we cannot escape our obligations to provide for our own defence. I am concerned, and so are other Queensland members, regarding the damage to the natural amenities, as well as to the commercial resources, of the Great Barrier Beef, which is certain to result from the uncontrolled exploitation of the marine wealth of that region. The press repeatedly reports the collection of immature trochus shells, and the destruction of bird life on and around the various islands and reefs in that area. Reference is also made to the visit of Japanese sampans to the reef, and it is urged that action be taken to police these waters. The collection of immature trochus shell will quickly denude the reefs of a source of considerable economic wealth. I understand that the Department of the Treasury in Queensland administers tbe Pearl Shell and Fisheries Act, and that the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock is concerned with the protection of bird life. I am anxious to know whether it would be possible for the patrol boat which, according to a statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs the other day, is to be stationed at Thursday Island, to help the State government in the more effectual policing of these acts I shall be pleased if the Minister wi}l, in the course of his reply, indicate whether it will be possible for the co-operation of the Customs Department to be obtained 'towards this end. [3.0] -Everybody must agree .that, in incurring heavy expenditure on defence, grave and important issues arise for consideration. The honourable member for Lilley( Sir Donald Cameron) has had a wide experience of war, and is no doubt sincere in expressing the hope that there will be no more wars; but I point out that on this subject there are two schools of thought, one of which claims that the continuance of the private manufacture of armaments has been the chief cause of the failure of -men like Mr Henderson and others to bring about disarmament. I sat at Geneva in 1924 with men representing 46 different nations, and the fundamental principle upon which they were agreed was contained in clause 13 of the Peace Treaty, which outlined a new method of bringing about international peace. It was declared that there could be no hope of establishing international peace unless it was based on international justice. We have also in our midst a school of thought which still believes that the only means of providing security against war is to maintain the race in armaments. We have heen chasing that shadow for hundreds of years. Although men would have heen thrown into gaol during the last war for saying that all wars were caused by trade rivalries, it was laid down at Geneva that, in order to eliminate international jealousies, it was necessary to bring about international justice. It was recognized that this was based upon industrial and economic conditions, and therefore the International Labour Oflice was established, so that, in conjunction with the League of Nations, there would he a tri-partite conference composed of employers, employees, and government delegates. It was hoped that this conference, hy meeting periodically, might bridge over the great gap between the nations which leads to unfair competition in trade, and makes international peace",34,Second Reading

If we desire to be true to our Empire, we should avoid flabby sentimentality, and try to make Australia as self-contained as possible. We should stand on ourfeet, and work in harmony with other nations. We should not insult Japan by taking trade away from that country and giving preference to Canada. orable member for Lilley concerning his experience at Geneva remind me that Mr Arthur Henderson and a representative of Austria both told me that they hated war, and hoped that the standard of living in their respective countries would be raised to something approaching that in Australia. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . -The honourable member's time has expired. desire to refer as briefly as possible to two national questions that are being discussed in Australia to-day by hundreds of thousands of people who look to this Parliament for a lead in regard to them. Within the last couple of weeks we have had under consideration the rehabilitation of Australia's rural industries. While I am in accord with the policy of the Government in that regard, I believe that if Australia is to overcome her economic difficulties, the objective sought must be attained by natural rather than artificial means. The assistance that is being given t.o rural industries may be likened to that given to the unemployed; it can be regarded only as a temporary expedient. In my opinion, the natural course is to prosecute with vigour the development of our overseas trade. This matter has been touched upon by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr regard to both food and clothing as Holloway) who has just resumed his seat. The Australian delegation at present in London is engaged on an important national mission, and I believe that the majority of the people of Australia trust that it will bring its negotiations to a sucmust be handled scientifically and cessful issue. It is not desirable, however, that we should haggle about terms that are being arranged 12,000 miles away. We know the policy of the mission which is in accordance with Australian opinion. pretation in London of a speech delivered in this chamber might cost Australia millions of pounds per^annum. I , therefore, consider that the negotiations overseas should be unhampered by misunderstood debates in Australia. But there is another point that is deserving of consideration in connection with our overseas trade. We can discuss, The remarks of the honwithout danger, the enormous possibilities of trade between Australia and the East. The story cannot be told too often that just to the north of Australia there are the enormous markets of China, Java and the Straits Settlements. If we include Japan and the countries adjacent to Australia, it can be said that we have a population of 1,000,000,000 persons to draw upon. If we could consolidate this important item of Australian policy, our Empire trade question would not present such serious aspects. The more we consider the matter, the more convinced must we become that the market in the East is potentially the greatest of all for Australia. The American people have secured the great bulk of that trade by their well-known characteristic business methods. The United States of America has developed this eastern trade as a means of providing relief in connection with unemployment. Australia could act similarly. It has th© necessary resources as well as business men with the requisite initiative, energy and enterprise to obtain equally good results. The people of the countries that I have mentioned, with an enormous population of 1,000,000,000 can consume far more than can be produced by the small population of 6,500,000 which Australia contains. It has frequently 'been said that the peoples of the East are becoming more westernized in the years go by. We are right at the door of that market, much closer to it than the United States of America; consequently, our freight costs would be correspondingly less. But the matter systematically; goods should be standardized ; no consignments should go forward in inferior packages, and . have a detrimental effect upon our trade.

One of the greatest constitutional authorities in Australia, the ex-Attorney-General, Mr Latham, has stated that the existing arbitration system is little short ,of lunacy, and that our industrial problems will not be solved until a universal system is adopted. that the present Attorney-General (Mi. Menzies) holds the same view, and that all political parties agree that an alteramost important member would be clothed tion is desirable. There can be no doubt that industry is being crippled as the result of two authorities operating in the one field. awards cause constant unrest, confusion, antagonism, and bitterness. The wheels of industry are clogged, and unemployment is increased. The cost of production, paradoxically enough, is different in each State. The years are passing, yet we still allow this inane system to continue. I know that an amendment of the Constitution is necessary to effect an alteration I believe, however, that tlie people, of Australia would now welcome the opportunity to express their opinion, and 1, therefore, suggest that the matter be seriously considered by the Government' during the. coming recess with the .objective in view' of taking a referendum of-the, .people of Australia on this' importhe whole matter, and expose what is no tant matter. The contention of the honourable member for-'West Sydney( Mr Beasley).is that an''inquiry into the banking and monetary'""system of Australia might more appropriately' be made by a committee of honourable members than by a royal commission, possibly under the chair: manship of a gentleman from overseas, and''that more beneficial results would accrue from a body so constituted. It is not necessary in this debate to have a. long discussion of the merits of any particular system, nor to caiivass the financial arrangements of either this or any other country. Labour party contends is that it is thc opinion of a large school of thought, not only 'in Australia, but also throughout : the world, that there is something radically and fundamentally wrong with the existing system. We merely ask for the appointment of a body that will make the most effective investigation of the matter. A royal commission would be circumscribed by the terms of reference, which could be so drawn as to make its inquiry altogether ineffective. The Government would have the selection of the chairman and the personnel of the commission. If the gentleman chosen to I believe be chairman were taken from the service 1 of the Bank of England, as the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has suggested, the with wide powers to make recommendations in the interests of the existing system. It is Conflicting and overlapping also probable that the other members would have similar predilections. A parallel case would be the appointment of a committee of brewers to inquire into the question whether or not a temperance policy would be good for the country. Selected witnesses would be called, who would give only such answers as were desired by the commission. But an investigation by a committee of honourable members would result in the fullest publicity being given to our side as well as to the bankers' side of the case. '.rhe party with which I am associated is prepared to nominate members for appointment to such a body. Those members would focus the spotlight of publicity on more than a swindle and a confidence trick on the public. If the existing system is the "" Rock of Ages"" we are led to believe that it is, those who operate it have nothing to fear from a public inquiry into it by a committee of honourable members. If , on the other hand, we who are opposed to it are the arrant fools and humbugs we are said to be, the exposure of the fallacy of our arguments ought not to be difficult; but we are prepared to call their bluff, and, by bringing them into a public inquiry, expose once and for all the confidence trick which they practise, and then leave the decision of the matter to the people when the All that the issues are placed before them, relying upon their good sense and sound judgmejit to do what is right.

It is generally admitted to-day that Germany was defeated in the last war, not because its army collapsed, but because the morale of its people gave way. Therefore, our first line of defence should be to establish a strong morale among our people. If we are sincere about this we will first of all, as the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr was on the point of succumbing. ForWard) suggests, bend our energies to creating a happy community, so that our manhood and womanhood will take pride in retaining possession of this country, and so lhat it will be a land worth living in and if necessary, worth dying for in defence of its shores. If we build up our country in that way, it will be possible for us, after placing our own unemployed again in work, to invite our kith and kin from other parts of the dominions, and people from other countries, to settle here and enjoy a happy life with us. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member has exhausted his time. desire to bring under the notice of the Minister' for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page) the unsatisfactory conditions at the stock quarantine station at Coode Island, Melbourne. Recently one of my constituents, who imported some stud sheep from Great Britain, found that the conditions under which these sheep had to remain in quarantine at that factory. sheep arrived in Victoria at that particular time, and I am prepared to admit that these shipments were greater than usual. However, I claim that provision should be made at such stations to receive at any time reasonably large shipments of stud stock. At Coode Island there is only one small paddock for accommodating sheep, and that is in a disgraceful state of disrepair. Three consignments of sheep arrived there on the occasion I refer to. some being males and some females. Obviously, these had to be kept apart. The ewes were put into the paddock, and it was necessary to find other accommodation for the rams. For his rams he had the choice of a pig pen or a horsebox. As the weather was very hot he was afraid to house the sheep in the horsebox. Eventually, when he decided to put them in the pig pen, he found that the troughs still contained sour food which had been used to feed pigs penned there some months before. The pen was in a filthy condition, with the result that a valuable ram developed some obscure disease, and for some weeks tunately, however, it recovered. I hope the Minister in charge of this department will be able to do something to remedy the conditions to which I have referred. It is generally recognized, and more so at the present time, that if we are to sell our produce overseas we must produce the best. That can only be done, so far as stock is concerned., by the importation of the best stud stock from overseas. Every encouragement sliould be given to breeders in this country to import the best breeds, but if such conditions as I have referred to have to be contended with, Australian breeders will be very much discouraged. I hope that the Minister will look into this matter. The Minister for Defence( Mr Parkhill) pointed out yesterday that his party had received a mandate from the people to do certain things, and that therefore the Government was entitled to use its numbers to put its legislation through this 1 Parliament irrespective of the opinions of the Opposition. Such a statement is not altogether correct. Certainly the station were most unsatisMinister's party-the United Australia Several shipments of stud party-wen t to the country with a definite policy, but also before the electors af. that time were the Country party and the parties now in opposition, which also placed definite policies before the people. The party of which the Minister for Defence is a member was not returned to this House with a majority by which it could carry on the government of this country, and the policy put before the electors by the United Australia party is not the policy that has been put into effect in this House. We have been asked to give effect to the policy of the Country party, which was returned with a minority, compared with the strength of the other parties in this House.

108,Mr Fisken (Ballarat) [3.40],I,40,Second Reading
109,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [3.43],"up the House for the next five or six months is that there is a likelihood' that, if this House remains in session, its discussions will interfere with certain negotiations now taking place overseas. I do not think that the Acting Prime Minister expected the House to accept that view. The real reason why the Government is seeking an extended recess is that trouble has occurred between the Country party and the United Australia party in Victoria. Even assuming-that the Prime Minister's reasoningVasisound, a recess of six months would not be justified, for the negotiations proceeding overthem are without work. If they even seas will be completed long before the expiry of that time, and if any agreements are reached it will be necessary for Parliament to give legislative effect to them. The Minister for Defence also referred last night to the legislative record of this . Government; but we have to look to the future. According to the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) every man and woman in New South Wales who wants work is now at work on the basic wage; yet the statistical returns show that more than 29 per cent, of the persons registered for employment in that State are without work, and those figures take no account of youths who have left school and reached the age of eighteen years, but cannot be registered. member for Ballarat( Mr Eisken) referred, in the course of his speech, to the disgraceful rolling stock provided for the carriage of stud sheep in Victoria; but we should remember that in order that the livestock could be provided with the accommodation five or six young people who were seeking shelter or a ride in the vans had to be turned out of them. This Government should be concerning itself not only with the international protrade treaties which result from the work blems that face the nation, but also with the domestic dangers that confront us, for it cannot be expected that our unemployed people will continue, for an unlimited period, to suffer the pains of hunger without making a vigorous protest. During the last week or two 20,000 relief workers struck work in Victoria for an increase in their rate of sustenance. Mr E. J. HARBISON -They were led by communists. always said that the unemployed were led by members of an organization known as the Industrial Workers of the World; to-day the communists are accused; but the fact is that 90 per cent, of the people out of work in Australia are loyal to the Constitution of this country, and many of them fought to maintain it during the great war. Prior to their enlistment, those men were promised that upon their return to Australia from overseas full provision would be made for their welfare, yet to-day thousands air creep into a train in order to travel to some other place hoping to find work there, and are discovered, they are treated as criminals, thrown into prif&n and subjected to the indignity of having their fingerprints taken. We have been told that this Government has done a great deal for the relief of the farmers of Australia. All it has done has been to hand over the taxpayers' money to the State governments without any controlling interest whatever in the expenditure of it. Parliament could do good work during the next few months if it remained in session. Honourable members are entitled to full information with regard to the progress of the negotiations now proceeding overseas. Major Elliott the Minister for Agriculture in the The honourable British Government, has left us with no false conception of the policy of Great Britain, for he told us clearly that his government intends to preserve the home market for the British producers. We can take no objection to that course; but we are entitled to make a bitter complaint against our own government for bartering away our Australian home market to overseas interests by means of various trade treaties. If the of -the Australian delegation now in Loudon are no more successful than those which followed the Ottawa conference, the outlook for our producers is hopeless. Some honourable members seem to be quite ignorant of the fact that in some of the pastoral areas of Queensland the most severe drought for the last 50. years is being experienced.

They have had experience of droughts in the past, however, and are not prepared to suffer the hardships that they entail.

I am told that a wheat-farmer in South Australia who has 1,000 ewes can, with a reasonable price for wool, obtain a return from his general operations of from £ 10 to £12 a week; but it must be remembered that he has a handy market for his fat lambs and wethers, whereas the pastoralists of Western Queensland have not. Eailway freights make it impossible for the pastoralists in remote areas to get their surplus stock to the markets. Our railway freights are still based on war prices and conditions, and it is high time that they were reviewed. The granting of relief under such measures as we have had before us during t he last week or two will have a palliating bunals, and, if he finds that the comeffect, but more must be done if we are to get to the root of the trouble. Grants of the kind that have been made, help the financial institutions more than the farmers. Unless conditions improve in Western Queensland an amount of more than £12,000,000 will be required in the next year or two to rehabilitate the pastoral industry there. It has been said in some quarters that we have been engaged in a ""scrap"" in the interests of one section of the community; but it must be borne in mind that the wool and meat industries of Australia affect the welfare of every person in this country. I should like to know what is to happen to our meat producers if no satisfactory agreement can be made as the result of the present negotiations in Great Britain. Has the Government any other plans in view? Will anything else be done to develop markets for our meat and other products. The CHAIEMAN -The honourable member's time has expired. to direct the attention of the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes) to a matter relating to the proceedings of the Pensions Entitlement Tribunal. I shall refer to a particular case which involves an important principle of procedure. An ex-soldier has informed me that he was in receipt of a full pension but was called upon to submit himself for re-examination. He was examined by a military doctor on whose recommendation his pendissatisfied he appealed, and the tribunal referred him back to' the same doctor for further examination. Naturally, he complains that appeals conducted on those lines become rather a farce. That is not the first instance that I have had of complaints of that nature. There is no doubt that such procedure is not calculated to do justice to the appellants: No matter how impartial a doctor may desire to be, he has a. natural tendency in his second examination to devote himself to discovering circumstances which support tlie recommendations of hi3 previous report. I feel that the complaint is genuine, and shall place the details of rhe particular case before the Minister. I also recommend the Minister to go into the matter of the procedure of these triplaints are justified, to make a general recommendation to them, calculated to put a stop to this practice, and be moro conducive to giving justice to all who come before them on appeals regarding pensions.

114,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"honourable members of the opportunity to agaiust Parliament going into recess for such a lengthy period. other honourable members on this side, I believe that, since this Government came into power, Parliament has had too many recesses. Since the election in September -last, Parliament has sat for approximately only 40 days. I feel sure that, if the electors had suspected what was going to happen, the Government would never have had the opportunity to occupy the treasury bench. Minister for Defence( Mr Parkhill) said yesterday that Parliament had sat longer under this Government than it did under the Scullin Government. The records will prove that that is not so. The Minister said further that the Government had no intention of calling Parliament together whilst negotiations were taking place between the Australian delegation and the British authorities in London. He gave the very definite reason that the Government felt sure that the negotiations would be hampered by members on this side making statements which Avould embarrass the contracting parties. One has only to read pages of Hansard to realize that, if ever any obstruction or embarrassment was caused to a government, it was done by certain members, now sitting on the ministerial side, when the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) was negotiating on the other side of the world on behalf of the Australian people. The present position is wrong, and should not be allowed to continue. Parliament should meet shortly after the Easter holidays to carry on the work of the country. It should at least be given the opportunity to discuss the negotiations that are likely to take place overseas, and be told the exact position. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) a few moments ago mentioned that this Parliament did not have a chance to discuss the Ottawa agreement during the time it was under negotiation. That is perfectly true, and the same will apply on this occasion. I am satisfied that Parliament should be given the opportunity to discuss what is going on, because members on this side have certain views to put forward which will be of benefit to discuss it. I also protest the people of Australia, and helpful to the delegation now overseas. With The Government on this occasion is adopting the same method as was followed by the late Bruce-Page Government. The country is being governed by the Cabinet and not by Parliament. During the regime of the Bruce-Page Government the country was run by commissions. When the election was being fought in September last, the principal issue on each side was banking. It waa The unfortunate that the people did not then give the Labour party an opportunity to put its banking policy into operation. I am pleased that the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has tabled an amendment dealing with the Labour party's policy of banking reform. Unfortunately, as the result of the poisonous and scurrilous propaganda put forward by the opponents of the Labour party, the electors were stampeded, and Labour was unable to gain suflicient seats to give it control of the government. Otherwise, we should not be pleading now with the Government to set up a committee of inquiry into the matter of banking reform. In my opinion, the Government haa failed miserably to relieve unemployment. Ministers have claimed that it has reduced the number of unemployed, but that is not in accordance with the facts. Even the figures disclosed in the Commonwealth Statistician's returns cannot be taken as an accurate record of the uixomployed, because they cover only the number of industrial unionists who are registered as unemployed by the various organizations, and, unfortunately, quite a number of industrial organizations do not send in their figures to the Commonwealth Statistician. There are, therefore, many thousands of members of industrial organizations unemployed today, and not shown in the statistician's figures. In addition, many thousands of boys ancl girls leaving school each year have no chance to join industrial organizations and be registered; they are thus unaccounted for. It is therefore evident that the figures of unemployment throughout Australia to-day are no better than they were when the Government first took office. The only State which has made an honest attempt to reduce the number of unemployed is Queensland. are lower to-day than in any year since 1929, and much lower than in any other State. monwealth Statistician, for the first quarter of 1935, show the percentages of unemployment to he as follows-Queens land 9.8, Victoria 15, Western Australia 15.4, Tasmania 16.7, South Australia 20.7, and New South Wales 23.6. The Queensland figure is the lowest percentage in that State since 1929. That is due to the administration of the Queensland Labour Government, which has tackled the problem scientifically. orable member's colleague just said that Queensland producers were paying wartime freights on primary produce. be so, but I make the definite claim that the Queensland Labour Government has done more to relieve unemployment and assist the farming community than has been done by the Commonwealth or any other parliament. I listened attentively yesterday evening to the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price), who endeavoured to convince the House and the country generally that the Government bad done such wonderful work that conditions as 1 listened also to a recent remark of the Minister for Health( Mr Hughes). It is amusing to contrast the two speeches. The honourable member for Boothby said that the country was on the safe road to recovery. looks around wall find that we are a long way from it. We shall continue to be on the wrong road so long as the Government persists. in the attitude it has adopted during the last five or six months. As against the honourable member's statement that the country was on the safe road to recovery, the Minister for Health made, on the Navigation Bill, the following altogether different and contradictory statement:The trut h is that the Commonwealth is struggling uncier very great difficulties, which, with every passing day, are becoming more formidable. Then we have the utterance of the High Commissioner, Mr Bruce, at a banquet The figures in that State in London a few months ago. He definitely warned the people of Australia that their country was facing one of the The latest figures of the Commost critical periods of its history. These things, to my mind, go to show that Australia is a long way off the road to recovery and requires most careful handling, particularly from a finance point of view, to put it on the right road. Unfortunately, in my judgment, the Government is not tackling the finance problem in a proper way. As regards matters concerning my own electorate I have, for many years past, endeavoured to induce the Government to give the people of Brisbane the justice to which they are entitled. As I have pointed out in this chamberand other honourable members know the position just as well as I do-Brisban e lacks decent accommodation for its postal business and postal officials. I have tried during my term in Parliament to impress upon the Government the necessity of erecting, in Brisbane, a new post office in keeping with the. dignity of the city and the dignity of the Commonwealth. One has only to go to Brisbane and look at the post office in order to be convinced that it is a scandal and a disgrace to the city and to the Commonwealth Government. Last year the Direcin Australia were such tor of Posts and Telegraphs visited Brishad never obtained before. bane and inspected the post office, and afterwards it was reported in the press that he was convinced that something should be done to relieve congestion in the department, and to provide a suitable building.

Of the four main branches, three of them showed profits, while in the fourth, the Telegraph Branch, there was a loss of £41,000. The total profit over all the departments was more than £2,000,000.

I urge the Government to give consideration to improving telephone facilities in country districts, so as to provide a better service for those on the land. Where possible, telephone bureaiux should remain open for at least one hour after 6 o'clock. That has been done in many cases, but the practice should be extended. Men on the land are usually absent from their homes throughout most of the day, and sometimes do not return to them until after 6 o'clock. The evening is the only time they have in whicli to transact business and then, in too many instances, the telephone bureau is closed. It would also be an improvement if something could be done"" to synchronize the lunch-hour closing interval in the various centres. In some places the offices close from noon to 1 p.m., and in others from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. I recognize that the offices are sometimes situated in business premises whicb have fixed closing hours that vary in different places, but perhaps something could be done to overcome-this difficulty. Some time ago, a number of returned soldiers were taken on as temporary employees in the Postmaster-General's Department, mostly as linemen. Since then many of them have been dismissed. Though we realize that they cannot be kept on if there is no work for them, we find that of late the department has been taking on younger employees from other branches, while the returned soldiers are still without employment. The department, in its report, refers to the recruitment of linemen in these terms: Tho field of recruitment has also been exfact, he is receiving one this afternoon. tended to include officers of other Commonwealth departments, thus affording a wider field of selection which should prove advantageous to the department and extend the scope of opportunity to employees generally. That is an admission that employees of other departments are being taken on, to the exclusion of returned soldiers. I urge the Government to take steps to see that employment is given to returned soldiers before positions are filled by the transfer of officers from other departments. The Wireless Branch of the department shows a profit for the year of £87,000. I think that an endeavour should be made to eliminate interference with wireless receiving sets by electrical machinery. I know that this is a difficult problem, but all the department seems to have done up to the present is to send officers to interview the users of electrical appliances, and seek some arrangement with them. Several years ago certain returned soldiers applied to the Pensions Department for a lump sum in lieu of their pensions, and very foolishly those in authority granted their request. I believe the pensions were commuted on a five-year basis. Now, many of those who received those lump sums are in need, and are anxious to have their pensions restored. I do not ask in their behalf for anything that would cost the Government more than it first contracted to pay. In most cases the pensions have been suspended for more than five years, so that the lump sum paid to the pensioners was actually less than would have been paid by way of pension during the intervening period. I urge the Government to go into this matter with a view to having the pensions restored if it can be done. | 4.23] I desire to draw the attention of the Government and of honourable members generally to the position of the tobacco industry in Australia. I know that this subject has beeu brought prominently under the notice of the Government during the last few weeks, and. that the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) has received several deputations in regard to it ; in The Minister and the Government are giving a great deal of consideration to this important question; but, in my opinion, there is too much consideration and not enough action. We have had the spectacle over the last few years of this industry being continuously before Parliament; but while there has been a tremendous amount of talk, we have not succeeded in getting much done.. Twelve montlis ago the Government raised the import duty on tobacco by 6d. per lb. That was mainly for the purpose of getting revenue with which to assist the",44,Second Reading

That money was distributed to the States for expenditure on expert instruction to the growers; but of what use is it to teach the growers how to produce good tobacco if , when it is produced, they cannot find a market for it? light leaf they can grow. Minister adheres to his belief that the Australian growers produce a greater proportion of bad leaf than good. I dispute that opinion, and I know that there is no immediate prospect of agreement on the point, though eventually we may be able to agree. However, if only a small proportion of the tobacco were inferior, it remains true that the economic position of the industry is unsound. Whereas every other Australian industry is assured of a local market, this one has no market at all. I mean that no grower of tobacco in Australia is ever certain that he will be able to sell his tobacco, no matter what its quality, when it is ready to market. industry in Australia that, is dominated by a powerful monopoly. At least 90 per cent, of the trade in Australia is in the hands of this monopoly, which is, I admit, in many respects mainly a revenue-collecting agency for the Eederal Government. It is also making large profits, liowever. sheltered as it has been behind the tariff for the last 30 years. The competition of manufacturers in other countries has been excluded, mainly foi' the benefit of this combine. producers of raw material in this industry are in a very different position from those in other industries. My chief object in referring to the matter to-day was to draw the attention of honourable members to the enormous revenue weight that has been placed on the industry, and to ask the Government, in particular, whether it is a fair thing. Almost every week this Parliament passes measures providing bounties, or some other form of financial assistance, for various industries, secondary as well as primary. Yet those industries are not directly revenue-producing; actually, they' are a financial burden on the community. The tobacco industry, on the contrary, is, with the possible exception of the income tax, the greatest single revenue-producer in the Commonwealth. That being so, we should regard it with greater respect, and display a greater willingness to treat it fairly. An industry which is a valuable revenue producer should not be dealt with in such a manner as to promote the economic welfare of the primary producers of a foreign country. That does not square with the protectionist policy supported by this Government, and to a large extent by myself and mother members of the Country party. It is an illogical policy to adopt towards an industry that is under the heel of a powerful combine which has grown up behind the shelter of the tariff wall. Consider, for a moment, the huge sums of money that have been squeezed out of this industry. As a result of the tariff alterations made by this Government some three years ago, the excise revenue derived from the manufacturers of tobacco before it is placed on the market increased from £1.870,000 in 1931-32 to This is the one primary £3,122,000 in 1933-34. This is an enormous increase, and this year, according to figures supplied by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White), it is estimated that the. excise revenue will further increase to £3,200,000. The .industry cannot thrive under this increasing load of taxation. I admit that the country cannot do without this revenue to-day, but there is a limit to the capacity of anv industry to hear this huge impost. Of course, it is passed on The to the tobacco consumers, who are one of the most heavily taxed sections of the community, and are apparently willing to carry that burden. The growers of tobacco in Australia are having it taken out of their hides, because the big combine is not prepared to pay them a profitable price for their leaf. Seeing",45,Second Reading

125,Mr Thompson,"I know that thethat it can obtain leaf cheaply from otlier countries, despite the import duty and freight charges, and still sell the product at a price comparable with that at which it sells tobacco made from Australian leaf, it does not desire to purchase the product of the local growers, and will not buy it except under compulsion. The Australian industry cannot compete with imported leaf whilst this tremendous load of excise taxation is placed upon it . The Tariff Board reported a few years ago that £6,500,000 a year was a fair sum to take from the industry by means of import and excise duties, but to-day this Government is collecting from it taxes to the amount of nearly £8,000,000, and each year the amount is increasing. We can safely say that to-day the industry is contributing to the revenue industry is getting it from the public. is taking from the industry £1,000,000 a year move than the Tariff Board declared to be a f a ir tiling. In view of tlie revenue producing value of the industry, the Australian growers should be given more encouragement ""than they have received at the Government's hands. of the revenue comes from overseas? half of it is derived from the excise duty; it is nearly fifty-fifty. If no tobacco were imported, the excise duty would have to be so adjusted as to enable the amount of revenue that the Government dosires from the industry to be raised. Thei n dustry can be made to contribute as much revenue as the Government wishes, either through the customs duty or t.he excise duty; so we should not lose revenue in the long run by encouraging the local industry. The revenue load upon it is being increased every year without giving the growers any compensating advantage. Although there are some 5,000 registered growers, most of them are merely holding their registration certificates in the hope that the prospects of the industry w ill improve. The CHAIBMAN member's time has expired. ing the present session most of our time has been spent in considering legislation for the granting of assistance to rura l industries, and the sum of £12,000,000 has been generously allocated for that purpose. Scarcely a session of this Parliament passes without assistance being granted to the wheat-farmers, but practically nothing has been done to help the purchasers of war service homes to retain their shelter during the years of depression. I draw attention to the activities of the Repatriation Department in regard to ex-soldier3, who, because ihey are suffering from tubercular complaints, seek war pensions. Fully 65 per cent, of the applicants for these pensions are afflicted with this terrible disease, ancl in practically every instance the medical authorities declare that their am aware that the present Ministerf o r Repatriation ( Mr Hughes) does not altogether endorse the medical opinion, nor do most of those who come in contact v it h these men. When the ex-soldiers enlisted, they were medically examined for service overseas, ancl no trace of this complaint was discovered, yet the majority of them are now found to be H o w much tubercular. Immediately upon their return fro m the front, most of them n-ent back to their former occupations, some suffering only slightly from the effects of their war service; but, as the years have passed on, they have become more and more incapacitated. I particularly remember the case of one man who, immediately upon his return, went back to his former employment. He had been discharged as suffering slightly fro m the effects of gas. His disability became gradually worse, and to-day he is a. complete invalid. Although his application for a pension is supported by medical certificates from outside the department, his request has been definitely refused on the ground that his present disability is not duo to war service. Other honourable members, of course, know of numerous cases of this kind, for they are to be found throughout Australia.

Last Monday, a complete stranger to this town, Digger Charles O'Donnell, who served in the Australian Imperial Forces in the 49th (Queensland) Battalion, died in the Castlemaine Hospital.

Of an exceedingly independent nature, he refused help, unless able, in some way, to repay it.

136,Mr Casey (Corio,"Acting TreaEarle Page). The Grovernment is of the opinion that the appointment of a political body to investigate the banking and monetary system would not be fruitfu l of the best results in the interests of the whole Australian community. This technical and intricate subject does not lend itself to political treatment, and consequently, the Government proposes to set up an unbiassed body, representative brains in the community, to undertake the investigation. The Government is fully seized of its responsibility in regard to the personnel of the committee, and the settling of the terms of reference. It is concerned to find out whether or not there is a monetary shortcut to prosperity; whether there are any abuses ih the existing monetary and banking system, and, if so, the best way to cure them; what reforms, if any, are necessary, and what they might be expected to achieve. The committee when appointed, will be armed with sufficient powers to enable it to undertake its difficult task. That this subject could not receive other than political treatment at the hands of a political committee is proved clearly by the failure of the parliamentary investigation into a similar subject in New Zealand. Not even the most ardent supporter of the body which undertook the investigation would say that the inquiry was productive of good results or, indeed, of any constructive proposals. The Government can conceive of no more dangerous line of inquiry than that of setting up a politically-minded body to thresh out an important technical subject. Great damage would be done to the Australian community were a committee to. bring forward ill-considered or partisan proposals, and consequently the Government will do its best to avoid that result. Honourable members can rest assured that the terms of reference will be carefully, and yet widely, drawn, to enable all relevant phases of the subject to be considered, and that the personnel of the committee will be the most experienced and unbiassed it is pos-> sible to obtain. As to the suggestion that the Prime Minister intends to select the members of the committee overseas, I can only say that the right honourable gentleman himself has denied any such intention. The Government has not yet come to any determination regarding the personnel, but is prepared to accept its responsibility in regard to the matter, and also in regard to the settling of the terms of reference.

137,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.54],"II have been impelled to take this action by the eloquent speech of the honourable son). I was disappointed at the failure of the honourable member to move the amendment that he invariably moved on similar occasions before the Country party was given practically half the seats in the Ministry, and he, in consequence, became one of the Government whips. The Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) and other members of the Country party were consistent advocates of the interests of Australian tobacco-growers when they sat on the cross benches, and I cannot conceive of their opposing my proposal in view of the speeches that they then made in support of similar proposals. Speaking on the 24fch May, 1933 (Hansard, page 1703) the present Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson) said that he and his colleagues believed that a price incentive could be given to tbe users of Australian tobacco without loss of revenue; a scheme had been worked out by the Secretary of the Victorian Tobacco Growers Association, which would permit of Australian tobacco being sold for l^d. less than the then price for a 2-oz. packet. The honourable gentleman moved an amendment the effect of which was that, instead of having a flat rate of excise of 4s. 6d. per lb. on both Australian petition for the 1931 Australian crop, and imported tobacco, for the first year there should be an increase of the excise by 4d. per lb. on imported leaf and a reduction of 8d. per lb. on Australian leaf, making a. differentiation of ls. per lb., tbe rates being 3s. lOd. per lb. on Australian and 4s. lOd. per lb. on imported leaf. Quite a number of animated and heated speeches were made in support of that amendment by members of the Country party. The Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby), who is at present abroad with Sir Henry Gullett and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), said in reply to the Minister for Trade and CusWhite) has endeavoured to misrepresent the proposal whioh the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson) clearly submitted to the committee. The honourable member for New England to-day holds a position of responsibility in the Government, and represents count f r . Forde. try interests in this Parliament. His electorate contains a large number of tobacco-growers. No honourable member comes more closely into touch with Ministers than does the whip of the Government party. He has frequently to confer with Ministers as to the business of the' House, and the procedure to be adopted to facilitate the passage of legislation. I am astonished, therefore, at the inability of the honourable member for New England to induce Country party Ministers to translate into legislation the ideals that they cherished in regard to the tobacco industry when they sat on the cross benches. Let us study the imports of unmanufactured tobacco. For the first seven months of 1933-34 they totalled 4!,195,000 lb., valued at £259,000. The imports for a similar period in 1934-35 were 9,568,000 lb., valued at £648,000. If the Commonwealth were to give this industry the assistance to which it is entitled, it could supply practically the whole of Australia's requirements of tobacco leaf. In December, 1930, the Scullin Government, after hearing a deputation of tobacco growers, decided to increase the import duty from 3s. 6d. to os. 2d. per lb. The result of that action was very keen comand all the available leaf was sold at an average price of 3s. per lb. The clearances of imported leaf dropped in one year by 5,000,000 lb., from 20,000,000 lb. to 15,000,000 lb., and, although the quantity of Australian leaf used in manufacture was trebled, the increase being from 1,000,000 lb. to 3,000,000 lb., the demand for Australian tobacco could not be met, so popular did it become, ancl so great was the incentive given to the Australian smoker by reason of the difference in price between the Australian and the imported tobacco. The manufacturers admitted their inability to obtain sufficient supplies of Australian leaf. They sent three or four buyers to every that deserving section of primary producers at last came into its own. The tobacco-growers did wonderfully well until there was a change of government.

The reduction was from 5s. 2d. to 3s. per lb. Concurrently, the excise duty on all tobacco was increased by a like amount from 2s. 4d. to 4s. 6d. per lb. That meant, in effect, an additional duty of 93 per cent, on Australian tobacco. resulted in the price of that tobacco being raised, and being brought so close to the price of imported tobacco that it could not be sold, because of the falling off in the demand for it. The clearances of foreign leaf immediately increased, the competition in the tobacco-growing districts for Australian leaf practically ceased, and the growers found it difficult to dispose of their crops, with the result that the quantity of Australian leaf used in manufacture sharply declined. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr tory by the Administration have been White) told us this afternoon that all light leaf-in other words, all highquality leaf-ca n be sold. It is well known that high-quality production to the extent of 90 per cent, cannot be obtained in either the tobacco industry or any other industry. Just as in 1930-31 tliere was a keen demand for all the tobacco grown in Australia, so there would he a keen demand again to-day if the present Grovernment were to treat the industry as sympathetically as it was treated by the Scullin Government. No one knows better than the honourable son) the disabilities, trials and tribulations of the growers, not only in his own district, but also in every part of Australia. The honourable member will bear me out when I say that hundreds of growers were forced out of business, and had to go on the dole. Since then bluemould, floods and frosts have accentuated the growers' troubles. Eor the first seven months of this financial year, 9,500,000 lb. of tobacco was imported, or more than double the.quantity for the corre sponding period of the previous year. It has been said that there is no market for all the dark leaf produced in Aus-' tralia, yet, prior to July of last year, black tobacco was being imported into the Northern Territory from overseas, duty free. honourable member himself was in office. office the demand for Australian-grown leaf was so keen that the price went up to 3s. per lb. j buyers were very active in endeavouring to secure the Australian leaf, and growers were able to sell all the tobacco they grew. But a different This state of affairs exists to-day, due to the meddlesome interference of this incompetent Government. During the first year of office of the Lyons Government, by arrangement with the tobacco combine, the price was reduced by 9d. per lb., resulting in a profit to the combine of £300,000. This matter was raised in the House, I think, by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), and since then tlie Minister has given an assurance that aU purchases of tobacco for the Northern Terrirestricted to tobacco manufactured from Australian-grown leaf, and that this arrangement will continue in the future. That is as it should be, but our thanks are due to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports for bringing this matter under the notice of the Minister. A deputation from the Australian Tobacco Growers Association waited on the Minister in December last, and brought under his notice the fact that large quantities of dark tobacco were being imported into New Guinea and Papua from the United States of America. For the year ended the 30th June, 1934, the imports of American tobacco were 99,000 lb. into Papua and 175,000 lb. into New Guinea. This was a black twist tobacco, intended mainly for native consumption. Asi t has been suggested that Australian growers could supply this dark leaf, I hope that the Minissr will give a definite assurance that action will be taken to preserve this market for the Australian growers. To stabilize the Australian industry, a lowering of the excise on Australian tobacco and cigarettes has been suggested by growers, but the Minister, in replying",50,Pairs

The duties of this Council arc defined in Commonwealth Statutory Rules, 1901-1927, volume 1, as followsThe powers and functions of the Council of Defence shall be( i ) To insure that the whole policy of the defence of Australia by the naval, military and air forces is consistent generally with Imperial plans, and especially with such of those plans as directly concern Australia, and to issue such instructions in connection therewith as are necessary ; ( i i ) To act as the medium of communication with the Committee of I mperial Defence or any other body of a similar nature formed by the government of the United Kingdom; ( i i i ) To effect such supervision of the approved defence policy in the naval, military, air and munition branches as w i ll insure its efficient and economical application; (iv) To co-ordinate the activities of the naval, military, air and munition branches with each other as well as with those of other Commonwealth departments and the commercial and manufacturing activities of Australia insofar as is necessary to insure, in the case of need, the mobilization of all resources for the defence of Australia ; and (v) To advise upon and supervise the total expenditure upon defence and the distribution of that expenditure. I emphasize the duties outlined in paragraph 5. It seems to be most extraordinary that a body invested with such important powers with respect to defence meet on even one occasion during tfte last five years. It is difficult to reconcile the answer of the Minister to my question relating to definition of policy with The Dethe duties I have just mentioned in paragraph 5.

These are: first, the coastal defences of this country which are being improved; secondly, the necessity for modernizing the army by mechanization and motorization ; thirdly, the necessity for equipping the troops with modern automatic weapons-w e still have light-horse regiments armed with Hotchkiss guns that went out of date in 1916; fourthly, the question of air defences mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo; and finally, the maintenance of adequate reserves. training the turnover is unfortunately very rapid and we find that we are left Avithout adequate trained reserves. The honourable member for Bendigo says that if we take the specialists away from a particular unit, there is nothing left.

I hope that the Minister will pay special attention to the reconstitution and functions of the Council of Defence. Trade and Customs) [5.26] I rise to speak at this stage because there is a tobacco deputation awaiting me in the precincts of the House, and because I should like to reply to the "" very timely "" speech of the honorahle member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) before leaving the House to meet the deputation. The tobacco industry, like many others, has been under the constant supervision of governments. one with which the Commonwealth Government cessfully, and it is now on its feet. I think the same can be said of the cotton industry. But the tobacco industry offers greater difficulties. I contend that what the Government has done so far has been on right lines. The difficulties of the largely of its own creation, inasmuch as a number of persons were induced to inI vest their money in it as a result of the heavy import duty imposed by the Labour Government. Many of these persons were without adequate knowledge of tobacco-growing, and they paid high There are five fundamental prices for the land they cultivated, and in consequence there was not the proportion of good, readily saleable leaf that there should have been. It is interesting at this stage to consider how the volume of imported tobacco is falling. In 1927-28, the proportion of Australian tobacco used was S.3 per cent.; by 1933-34 the proportion of Australian leaf rose to 25 per cent. In other words, the Australian growers are now supplying 25 per cent, of the market in Australia for leaf employed in the manufacture of tobacco. There is also a definite improvement in quality, and it is in this direction that the success of the Under our present system of industry lies. Australian leaf is used without blending? Australian tobacco entirely. A large proportion of the imported leaf is leaf of light colour. The Australian smoker wants a light leaf, but unfortunately our growers are not producing sufficient of this quality to meet the demand. I am sorry that the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) suggests that some influence is preventing the Government from doing the right thing in this matter. All the leaf of the right kind thai the growers can produce can be sold at a good price. The duty on this leaf is 3s. 6d. per lb., which, on some types, represents a protection of 500 per cent. That is a fact. Difficulty, therefore, occurs only with regard to the darker grades. The honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) is aware of this. Nevertheless, the Government desires to do the right The wine industry is thing by the growers and to assist them. Last year it voted the sum of has grappled suc£20,000 a year for five years to assist them by supplying them with technical information so as to enable them to change over to the right type of leaf.

At the time the Government induced them to buy the whole of the crop, the big companies bought sufficient quantities of dark leaf, which, allowing for maturation, will meet the demand for a period of three years. That is why to-day they are buying their requirements only from year to year according to their usings of dark leaf. Nevertheless they are taking the whole of the light leaf that is grown. they have swung away from the dark grades ? taste for which the manufacturers have to cater; in Australia there is a distinct preference for light leaf. The Government desires to assist the growers in any way it can. Tobacco is a great taxing medium. over £7,000,000 annually from import and excise duties on tobacco; about one-tenth of this revenue, namely, £700,000, is tobacco. Negotiations have been proceeding for some time with Papua and New Guinea to see if dark tobacco can be sold in tliose territories. Leader of the Opposition has spoken much of twist, but there is not the skilled labour available in Australia for its manufacture. workman can learn to perform any task that is set for him. found belief of tbe honourable member, but it has not been confirmed by the response made by the industry to the duties which the Scullin Government imposed. Australian manufactured twist tobacco cannot compete with that made by the American negro, which is now imported in large quantities into the Pacific islands and the territories. Consumption of Australian-grown tobacco is greater now that it has ever been; so it avails little for the honourable member of for Capricornia to be harking back to the clays when he was Minister for Trade and Customs. Despite his contention, the fact remains that even with lower import duties more Australian-grown tobacco i's being used now than ever before; furthermore, importations of tobacco are now at their lowest. Scientific research and investigation of this industry are proceeding apace. I emphasize the fact that no import or excise duty will cure blue mould, which is the greatest enemy of the Australian tobacco-grower to-day. That fact will be generally admitted. it, except the tobacco-grower himself. admits it. Last year's crop and this year's crop were unusually small owing to the ravages of this disease. The price which the Australian grower is obtaining for good leaf enables him to sell his tobacco at a profit. In Queensland prices have ranged up to 4s. per lb. The prices charged by manufacturers to the consumers are reasonable; employees in the industry are safeguarded, and the We receive revenue is protected. Honourable members opposite are fond of attacking what they call the combinea term which they apply to the principal tobacco company. derived from Australian-grown I am not undertaking to defend it ; it can speak for itself. But it has proved a good friend to the Australian growers. It provides pracThe Deputy tically their only market. In fact, it complains that after it has made large purchases many of the growers sell what is left over at a very low price to rival companies. I remind honourable members opposite that tbere is not just one tobacco, concern ; there are several of them. The further assistance of the industry is a matter of finance. Tf we can give more help, it will only be by sacrificing some revenue. However, if assistance can be given to the industry by excise, such a policy will be considered by the Government. As a matter of fact, this course has been considered year after year by the Government, and the money voted to the industry in the past and the increase of import duties were intended to",53,Pairs

If any further excise concession can be made to help the industry, it will be made. [5.35j I am pleased that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) brought this matter forward. I was beginning to wonder whether the honourable gentleman had lost all interest in the tobacco industry, because this is the first time that he or any other honourable member of the Opposition has shown the slightest interest in it since the last election. Wheu the honourable member alleges -that the attitude of myself and other members of the Country party on this matter to-day differs from what it was formerly, I remind him that a proposal was being considered by the Scullin Government in which he was Minister for Trade and Customs to make very radical alterations in the tariff protection of the industry. He is very well aware of the fact. is quite wrong; the incidence of the protection was to remain unaffected. mittee that what I say is correct. member know what was in the mind of the Scullin Government? a considerable alteration in the excise rate, which was to be raised as the import duty was lowered. The object was to safeguard the revenue. knows that that is not true. the honourable member showed me in his room a marked schedule indicating the proposed alterations. The honourable member must not call me a liar; I remind him that he showed me the schedule on which Mr Theodore had marked the figures. I ask the honourable gentleman to tell the truth in this matter. I am fully aware that the position of the industry has altered since the last election, and that to-day we as members of the Country party are supporting the Government; that is why I am the Associate Whip. My party has, to a great extent, merged its policy with that of the United Australia party because of the greater chance of effect being given to our principles by a composite government. Part of our policy, as-announced by our leader, was a reduction in the rate of excise in favour of Australian tobacco. As president of the Australian Tobacco Growers Association, I have not lost sight of the duty I owe to the industry, and ever since the last election I have been discussing this matter with the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) and with members of my own party. We have put certain proposals before the Government. My object in speaking on this matter to-day was to let the Government kuow that, in view of the fact that Parliament will adjourn for a lengthy period, the growers are expecting a definite declaration by the Government as to its future intentions with respect to the industry. The Government cannot lightly sacrifice a large amount of revenue, even though it realizes that the industry deserves further consider a tion. Therefore, we have to give the Government an opportunity to deal with this.matter as part of its budget policy. So far, the new Government has not brought down a budget. this House should consider the position. fact, but I consider that nothing which can be done at the moment is likely to prove of any very great benefit to the industry. However, if the Government announces that it proposes to make some budgetary provision for the industry the growers will be satisfied that the promises made to them are to be honoured. Therefore, we must give the Government -a chance to consider its proposals. In view of the Minister's statement to-day, I am quite satisfied to leave the matter rest there for the present. I interpret that statement to mean that this is definitely a revenue matter, that the Government proposes to consider the Country party's policy when framing its next budget, and that it will give due attention to the proposals that I with other members of the Country party have put forward for a reduction of excise in favour of Australian tobacco.

For this reason I shall vote against the amendment. Downs) [5.41] I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General( Mr Hunter), a certain matter in connection with broadcasting, which has been brought to my notice by two petitions, signed by between 30 and 40 business men in the city of Toowoomba. These people complain concerning a licence granted by the department to a firm of persons to operate a powerful broadcasting station about 18 miles from the existing station at Toowoomba. Their objections are based on the ground, first, that there is a station already operating in Toowoomba, and that, if another broadcasting station is allowed to operate so close to the present station, advertisers will find it necessary to utilize both stations in order to get the same coverage as they are getting to-day, because radio audiences in that district would be divided between the two; secondly, advertising costs are an important consideration, and they fail to agree that they should have increased costs imposed upon them; and, thirdly, they foresee a considerable increase in the power of the existing station, 4GR, and feel that, in order to support two stations, the limited business to be solicited would have to pay an increase in the rate of advertising. About ten years ago a young man, Mr E. Gold, established on a small scale the present station. The venture has prospered; each year the station has improved its service, which is now utilized by a population of from 28,000 to 30,000 people within a radius of 5 miles of Toowoomba. Now, after having built up his business, this young man finds that the department which granted him his licence, has granted a licence for the establishment of a more powerful station to operate in the zone which the original station serves. The station is now conducted by the Gold Radio Service Proprietary Limited. It is felt that an injustice is bei7ig done to this body through the latest action of the department. Mr Gold has worked hard to develop his station, and he has given every satisfaction to local listeners, with the result that to-day he is able to provide an excellent continuous service for about 60 hours a week. Also he has used the station to help charitable objects. That this service is greatly appreciated is revealed by the fact that so many business men in Toowoomba have signed these petitions. These men suggest that a licence should not be granted for a new station to operate within 70 miles of Toowoomba. Mr Gold statesThis is the first occasion on which the department has taken such action, and I do not know of any country town in Australia where a station already in operation has been treated in this way. Moreover, the business people of Toowoomba who wish to use the service for advertising purposes will feel compelled to patronize both stations and in that way will incur additional expense. Those controlling the station at Toowoomba are willing to increase its power and thus enable it to operate over a wider area. The station to which a licence has recently been granted cannot provide the improved service needed. in the far western portion of Queensland. both B class stations. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -Yes, but one is of greater power than the other. By issuing an additional broadcasting licence the department will not receive additional revenue, because those possessing sets can receive from both stations. partment receives practically no revenue through such stations. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -The granting of an additional broadcasting licence will not increase the number of receiving sets as listeners can at present tune in to both stations.

The population within the municipality is 26,500, and that in the locality where a new post office is required is about 9,000, and is increasing yearly. The centre of the district is about one and a half miles from the main post office, and there are five or six schools within the area in addition to many business places and large saleyards. Old age pensioners are compelled to go a long way to collect their pensions, and others wishing to transact postal business are seriously inconvenienced. ask the Minister to give careful consideration to the urgent request of the local residents, and I trust that something will be done to assist those who at present are seriously inconvenienced. An inspection should also be made of many existing postal buildings in the country districts with a view to effecting improvements. The Oommonwealth Government grants money to the States, some of which might be used for necessary federal works and in connection with buildings under the control of the Commonwealth. The post office buildings at Rosewood and Lowood are quite unsuitable for the purpose and new structures are essential. I realize that the Government has to be guided by the amount of money available, but in view of the business conducted at those two offices it is essential that new buildings should be constructed. should like to inform the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson), who said that the subject of tobacco production has not been raised by honourable members on this side of the chamber since the last general election, that I have asked several questions on the subject recently while honourable members supporting tbe Government bave not even mentioned it. The honourable member also stated that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) showed him a draft of a tariff schedule containing a proposed increase of the excise on Australian-grown tobacco. I challenge the accuracy of that statement, because such information was not given to the members of the party to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition belongs. The Scullin Government increased duty on imported tobacco and reduced the excise on Australian grown leaf, with the result that the number of tobacco-growers increased from under 1,000 to 6,320 in 1932. That is a point which the honourable member for New England should bring before the organization which he represents, and the deputation which he is to introduce to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White). I understand that this is to be the second deputation which he, as president of the Australian Tobacco GrowersI Association, is to introduce to the Minister. The honourable member shows his impartiality and his-keen interest in the welfare of the growers by declining to ask honourable members on this side of the chamber who represent districts in which tobacco is grown to be associated with the deputation. able member that it was to consist of representatives of the Country party. particular party? When the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition proposed that the duties imposed by the Scullin Government should be restored and the excise reduced, the honourable member for New England voted against the proposal. When the United Australia party had a majority in this chamber and the members of the Country party were threatening the Government, the present Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) saidI make no apology for defending an industry of this sort. I never hesitate to support any worth-while industry, be it primary or secondary. A few moments later the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) interjectedWill the proposals of the right honourable gentleman afford the same high degree of protection as was given by the duties introduced by the Scullin Government? The right honourable gentleman repliedThey will have an identical effect, for they will preserve the margin that exists between the price of local and American leaf.

He further said that, as the production in Australia improved, tbe Government could protect tlie revenue by increasing the excise, and the duty, and thus maintain the margin. Does he still stand by this policy, and will he give effect to his previous proposals? Does the honourable member. for New England suggest that the expenditure of £20,000 will save the industry when production has fallen from 20,000.000 lb. to a little under 1,550,000 lb.? Is that reduction due to blue mould? Will the honourable member support the statement that disease is solely responsible for the present position of the industry? T. say that it is not. On the contrary, it is due to the unsympathetic treatment of the growers by this Government. Will the honourable member tell men who have lost their capital that the trouble is due, not to the lack of protection, but to disease? The honourable member should not try to bluff his way through by saying that the Scullin Government was going to increase the excise iu order to preserve the revenue. The fact is that the growers would welcome a return to the Scullin policy. The Tariff Board reported that £6,000,000 would be sufficient to collect from the industry, but to-day £S,000,000 or £2,000,000 more than was recommended by the board is being collected. Why does the honourable member not suggest that the industry should get the benefit of that £2,000,000. He is the president of the Tobacco Growers Association, but it would be interesting to know what time has elapsed since a ballot was taken, if ever, and how long he would survive if he had to face another vote of the growers. When the Leader of the Country party was speaking on this subject in 1932, he saidThu oflicers being already there, thoy may without much difficulty extend their activities done. by differentiating in the matter of excise between Australian-grown and imported leaf. To that the honourable member for New England replied: "" It can be done "". taken the honourable member for New England, who is now the Whip of a Coalition party, walked across the chamber in support of the Government and voted against the interests of the growers. The members of the deputation will not be pleased when they know that he has suggested to the Minister that he is agreeable to wait through a long recess before receiving any pronouncement of government policy. By that time we will be told that wool prices having decreased, the revenue must be further conserved, and that nothing can be done to assist the tobacco-growers, not even an effort to find them a market. The honourable member, while drawing his parliamentary allowance, will be leading deputations of Collins-street tobacco-growers and neglecting genuine growers, many of whom are on the dole. I ask the honourable member to visit the areas where tobacco is being produced and to obtain the views of the growers, instead of being influenced by those parasites who live on the growers. When the present Acting Prime Minister was in opposition, he criticised the Government's attitude on the subject. I consider that the Government, which, as it were, issued false prospectuses in regard to the tobacco industry, was most unfair to the growers. Now it leaves them to face bankruptcy. In fact, the mining speculators who issued the prospectuses in regard to the Arnheim Land and The Granites gold-fields were gentlemen in comparison. Wc had every right to expect that the members of the Country party, who were members of this Parliament while the Scullin Government was in power, would support the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for it does not go so far as the proposition the present Acting Prime Minister made to the Scullin Government concerning which the honourable member for New England said, "" it can be done "". ber should stand up to his obligations like a man. It seems to me that some honourable members of the corner party like to parade their alleged interest in country people without accepting the responsibility of fighting for them.

The Commonwealth Government, which has felt justified in remitting millions of pounds of taxation to wealthy persons, should accede to these requests, and restore in valid aud old-age pensions to £1 a week. Recently we voted £12,000,000 for the assistance of the farmers. Surely we can afford to pay a little more to the pensioners who were called on to make such a heavy sacrifice during the worse period of the financial depression. These pensioners are, for the most part, the men and women who did the pioneering work in Australia. We are being told every day that economic conditions are improving, and that prosperity has returned. If that be so, it should not be difficult for us to do the right thing by the pensioners.

The present Government introduced the system of increasing pensions in accordance with the rise in the cost of living, and this was done when the cost of living was at its lowest point. On the 1st July next, by reason of the increased cost of living, the maximum rate of pension will automatically increase from 17s. 6d. to ISs. a week. A corresponding increase in the rate of all pensions below the maximum rate will also be made. It has already been mentioned in this House that the pension paid in Australia, with regard to both its amount and the conditions under which it is granted, is considerably more liberal than that granted in any other country. Only this morning a point was raised in this chamber that involved consideration of the old-age pension paid in Great Britain, and I was obliged to inform honourable members that the conditions under which the payment is made in the Old Country-the sum of 10s. a week is granted at the age of 70 yearsare less liberal than those in Australia, although Britain is the richer country. The Government has considered every aspect of this matter, and regrets that, at the moment, it cannot see its way clear to increase the pension as proposed under the amendment.

Last year British investors lost nearly Argentine railway companies. The Australian railways are State-owned, and the loss incurred on them as running concerns amounts to approximately £S,000,000 per annum, which is just about equal to the aggregate annual deficits of the States; but we have always honoured our interest obligations with respect to the money borrowed for their construction. Even Professor Copland, who cannot be regarded as a very democratic economist, stated upon his return to Australia from G-reat Britain about a year ago that, before we had seen the last of the depression the interest rate would have to come down to at least 2-J per cent, all round. Notwithstanding the default of capitalistic enterprises in Argentina, that country is being taken by the hand by the British Government and is receiving preferential treatment.

The deputation then suggested that the Government should consider the possibility of granting pensions to all soldiers suffering from tuberculosis who were perI f the manent inmates of a sanatorium. It was also asked that the department be instructed to be a little more sympathetic when determining whether or not the disease arose out of an applicant's war service.

253,Motion (By Mr Paterson) Put,"I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Casey) a matterrelating to the invalid and old-age pension administration affecting people who live in remote areas. The department requires each applicant for a pension to submit a doctor's certificate with the claim. In the case of very poor people this is a hardship; and in that of those who live in remote parts of North Queensland it is a considerable difficulty, for it frequently happens that no doctor is available within a reasonable distance. In such cases a previous certificate obtained by the applicant should be sufficient. Aged persons who live in isolated places usually consult medical practitioners when they have the opportunity to do so, and are often advised to apply for the pension, but for one reason or another do not do so at the time. 1 consider that a medical certificate obtained medical practitioner should meet the requirements of the department. the time a medical certificate is available, and investigations have been made by the department, tliese people are practically at death's door. It is an easy matter to deal with invalid pensions within-an area which can be reached by a. medical officer. Is there no chance of a government medical officer visiting these remote parts, where there is no doctor, at least once a year to give these certificates? Often a pension is granted to an invalid, and a review is necessary at the end of twelve months tp ensure its renewal. I can instance the case of a man at Gregory Downs where there is no police station. The nearest is 80 miles away and the nearest doctor is 380 miles away. months, although the invalid pensioner is really worse in health than when the pension was granted, his pension is cut off because he is unable to obtain a medical review, the reason being the impossibility of his reaching a doctor. There should be some means whereby in country districts, in cases such as I have quoted, the pension could be continued until such time as a doctor, or, failin g a doctor, the man in charge of the nearest police station, visits the district. police are constantly on patrol through these towns, and could furnis h reports to the Pensions Department. This, I am sure, would meet the emergency. I am confident that the Acting Treasurer w ill give favorable consideration to these cases. The difficulty occurs, also, i i i the electorate of Maranoa, represented by the Assistant Minister( MrH u n t e r ) . Cases of this kind cause a good deal of trouble, and could, I think, be handled more generously. I am confident that the Minister w ill take some action, in connection with them.

The Minister has made his speech on the bill which validates 200 reductions in duties and now I am speaking for the Opposition. not on the point raised by the honourable the Minister, but on the gr*ound that the amendment was a direct negative. Mr Speaker. However, I contend that this House should proceed with the consideration of the customs tariff schedule, item by item, before it adjourns for the recess. When introducing these measures, the Minister attempted to lead the House to believe that they were innocuous, and that they were merely to validate collections of tariff under the tariff proposals of the 6th December last to the SOth September. He said that under section. 226 of the act it is necessary that the schedule recently introduced be validated during this session. The necessity for passing this A'alidating bill at this juncMinister himself last year when he amended the act by inserting the wordsor liefore the expiration of six months after such tariff, or tariff alteration, is proposed, whichever first happens. This new section, which became operaThe Government tive as from tbe 1st January, 1935, was added at the behest of the free-trade element in the Government and the Country party. The Government was warned at that time that the amendment would react against itself. Thus, the Minister has been "" hoist with his own petard "". I believe the Minister realized that the suggestions made by the Country party in this regard were quite unreasonable, but, eventually, he yielded to the pressure from the Country party which was not then in the Government, but whose absorption in the Government was then being contemplated. The position under the act is that, unless a tariff proposal be passed by both houses within six months of its introduction, importers who have that the amendment moved paid duties at a rate higher than those the honourable the Deputy provided by the previously existing tariff can issue writs for the recovery of the extra duty paid, and the department will have no legal defence in such a case. In view of the statements made by the Minister before the act was amended, I am of the opinion that there is no justification for a six months' delay of the debate on tbe tariff schedule that was introduced in December. What is there to prevent Parliament from sitting on and considering this important schedule which sets out to reduce duties on over 200 items ? We are asked to validate this schedule without being given an opportunity to vote on each item, and without being able to say, by our vote in this House, whether we approve or disapprove of the duties recommended by the Minister in the schedule.

The Ministeri n introducing this measure saidThe validating bill now before the House would be unnecessary were the present session to be a long one or if we were able to devote the whole of the time of the present session to consideration of the schedule, irrespective of other important matters needing attention. On whom rests the responsibility for the short session?

C. schedule was passed by Parliament, but Beasley, nowadays decreases operate from, the Clark, J. J. day on which a schedule is tabled. Drakeford, A. S Reductions of duty are, therefore, Forde, F. M. very serious to our industries. It is true Frost, that the Scullin Government brought into Green, A. effect drastic increases of duties on certain imports, but drastic remedies were required at that time in order to stem the flood of imports into this country, a second time-put . The House divided. and to rectify our adverse trade balance. Tbe finances of the country had to be stabilized and our industries adequately protected. It was necessary to allow some time to elapse after the tabling of those schedules in order to ascertain their effect on our trade balance. The Scullin Government was most unfairly criticized by the present Minister for Trade and Customs and the present Minister for Defence, when they were sitting in opposition, for not providing an opportunity for the sc-hedules to be discussed immediately they were tabled. < Before directing attention to some of the eloquent statements made by the Opposition of that day on that subject, I wish to refer briefly to the reductions made in this schedule on 205 items of the tariff.

Debate resumed from the 28th March (vide page 449), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. -This is one of three customs validation bills introduced by the Minister for White) When discussing another | measure, and when interrupted by thu application of the "" gag "", I was pointing out that on the 22nd October, 1931, the honourable member for Swan( Mr. Gregory) moved an amendment on the measure then before the House to provide that all Gustoms tariffs should be considered and a decision reached upon them within 90 days of being tabled. The proposal was supported by the present Ministerf or Trade and Customs, the present Minister for Defence( MrP a r k h ill ) , the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), the then member for Kooyong( Mr Latham), the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr. Maxwell), tbe honourable member for Perth( MrN a i r n ) , and the presentMinisterf or the Interior( Mr Paterson), as well as a number of others. Those honourable members contended that the tariff schedules should be discussed item by item, so that proper consideration could be given to the Government's fiscal policy. During the war period there was some justification for the ratification of tariff schedules being delayed for perhaps three or four years owing to the urgency of other business. The Government 'cannot, however, say that there is I have been warned all insufficient time available on this occasion, because Parliament now proposes to go into recess for about five months. A l though the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and three other Ministers are in London, the divisions just taken show that the Government still has a majority. The present Ministerf o r Defence, who claimed that the items should be dealt, formed.] with seriatim, also saidThe effect of the new clause if agreed to will be. that tariff schedules must be' ratified by Parliament within six months. The intention. of the Government's amendment is to hasten the consideration of customs taxation proposals which concern every one. The clause is a good one. Is be now doing what he said should be done ? The honourable member for Swan saidI hope the clause will be approved by honourable members. We should insist on tariff schedules being passed by both chambers more particularly if tliose resolutions affect Trade and Customs( Mr the taxation of the people. The Minister about three weeks ago. has said clearly that customs schedules must be ratified by Parliament within six months validating or the duties collected pursuant to their provision must be refunded.",87,Pairs

The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) saidThe schedule should become void if it is not ratified within six months.

I realize that many difficulties must confron t the Ministerf or Trade and Customsi n an endeavour to harmonize the divergent fiscal views of the supporters of honourable member for Eorrest( Mr Prowse), the honourable member for Perth and the honourable member for Swan are ardent free traders, while the honourable member for Parkes( Sir CharlesM a r r ) , the honourable membei for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) believe in adequate protection. The Leader of thc Government in the Senate( Sir George Pearce) is a free trade eagle when in Perth, but he attends dinners of the Chamber of Manufactures when in the eastern States. The right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), speaking in Adelaide on the 8th of July, 1934, saidTo render factories idle is to strike a blow at the most important market for primary producers. It is as essential for the welfare of the man on the land as for the man In the city that factory employment should be maintained. That was before a composite ministry was formed. I should like to know if the Ministerf or Trade and Customs has seen the Prime what has been done by the Government behind his back and in spite of the definite assurances made by him to a deputation in Melbourne before he left Australia. The cablegram readsThe Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia deprecate your published rejection of our opinion that substantially reduced duties mean injury to sections of Australian industry. At our interview before your departure emphasis was given to the close relationship between tariff insecurity and Australian unemployment. Attention was also directed to the alarming diminution of our credit reserves overseas. The continuing lowering of protective duties is economically indefensible and is not being practised elsewhere. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this bill does not validate the tariff schedule introduced during this session, and it appears to me that this is the schedule which the honourable member is debating. tariff schedule introduced by the M in i ster for Trade and Customs on tlie 6th December, provides for a reduction of duties on 205 items and we have been the present Government. The asked to validate those duties up to the 30th November. I should like to bring before the Minister the serious effect which the Government's fiscal policy has upon our overseas trade balance. The Commonwealth Statistician, in showing the d r if t that is taking place, states that the imports of merchandise in February. 1935, were valued at £5,349,000, compared with £4,848,000 sterling in February, 1934, or an increase of 10 per cent., and that the exports of merchandise in February, 1935, were valued at £7,965,000, compared with £9,090,000 sterling in the . previous February, a decrease of 12 per cent. According to the Commonwealth Statistician our importations of the following classes of goods increased in the eight months of 1934-35 compared with the eight, months of 1933-34 as follows:Article. 1934-35. 1933-34. £ £ Apparel and attire .. 1,050,000 830,000 Textiles .. .. 9,450.000 7,654,000 .Foodstuffs of animal origin .. 805,000 607,000 Boots aud shoes .. 139,000 84.000 cablegram sent to the The increase in the value of textile imMinister protesting against ports in the period under review was, it w ill be seen, nearly £2,000,000. ment figures'!!",88,White

303,Mr White,"W h a t about the employpresently. It is a fact beyond dispute that 400,000 of our people are still out of employment. Although it is in the interests of the Empire as a whole that Australia should carry a larger population than at present, the Government seems to do its best to check the development of our secondary industries, upon which, of course, depends the development of our primary industries. Our primary and seoondary industries must develop side by side. Any policy which checks this is suicidal. Instead of living up to its pre-election promises, the Government has backed and filled to every free trade element in the community, and truckled to foreign traders and importing interests. Mr ""WHITE I think the honorablt member might bear in mind that he is supposed to be discussing the Exchange Adjustment Bill. for the, Interior( Mr Paterson), in the course of a tariff debate in this chamber on the 9th March, 1933, saidI am prepared to support this or any other dards-, acute unemployment was exGovernment in reducing by half the duty on every item of the tariff. But the Nationalist party has taken this honourable member to its bosom and excluded from tbe Ministry several United Australia party members whose views were favorable to protection. member is not now discussing the bill. making these observations when another measure was under consideration. member may not now refer to a debate on another measure. change adjustment must necessarily have an important influence upon the protectionist policy of this country and that I am therefore entitled to deal with the sub1929-30, a falling off of 31,000. ject from the employment view-point. Statistics show that, on the average, one Australian is thrown out of employment when goods of Australian production to the value of £864 are diverted overseas. On that basis the diversion of the output of Australian factories to the extent of one per cent, would throw 4,465 workers out of employment, a diversion of 10 per cent, would throw 44,650 workers out of employment, and a diversion to the extent of 20 per cent, would render idle 89,311 workers. I am surprised that the Minister in charge of this bill, who was, many years ago, an ardent protectionist, even to the extent of supporting the prohibition of certain imports, should now, by means of exchange adjustment and other practices, allow goods of foreign countries produced under low wages to win a commanding position in the markets of Australia at a time when more than 400,000 of our people are still out of employment and 1,000,000 of them are in most difficult circumstances. I should like to refer to a statement made by the Minister in which he unfairly attributed unemployment in Australia to our protectionist, policy. Every fair-minded elector knows that the depression, in its darkest hours, hit protectionist and free trade countries with equal severity. In low-wage countries and in countries with better stanperienced in the depth of the depression. In those dark days, the national income of Australia fell by £200,000,000, and the nation was faced with a deficit of £10,000,000, and an adverse trade balance of £78,000,000. The world economic survey published by the League of Nations showed that by June, 1933, the money value of world trade had shrunk by two-thirds. Although in Australia we have increased our volume of exports by 25 per cent, since tbe beginning of the depression, the value in pounds sterling is still only £90,000,000, compared with £140,000,000 in gold currency for a smaller volume of trade before the depression. The depression began to make its presence felt towards the' end of 1929. The number of persons employed in the factories of Australia was 450,000 in 1928-29. and 419.000 in For practically half the financial year 1929-30, a. Nationalist government was in office; but as the result of the Scullin Government's protectionist policy put into operation in the second half of that year our factories were able to develop their trade.",89,White

309,Mr Forde,"I submit that exhonorable member that he must confine his remarks to the subject-matter of the bill. as manipulated by this Government, has had the eifect of whittling away the protection afforded to our industries by the Scullin Government's beneficent policy. Compared with 1931-32, there was an increase of employment in the factories of Australia in 1933-34 of 68,000 persons, and this, I contend, was entirely due to the Scullin Government's protectionist policy. The present Government is doing a great dis-service to the Commonwealth by giving effect to the requests of free traders and persons interested in :he importing business to "" butcher ""' the tariff. Since 1911 the population of Australia has increased by 2,000,000, and most of these are supported by the secondary industries. There are 50,000 fewer persons engaged in primary production to-day than there were in 1911, although 9,000,000 acres more land is under cultivation, and the quantity of wool produced annually has increased by 200,000,000 lb. ' To listen to some of the representatives of the Country party, one would imagine that the primary producers have not benefited in any way from the protection policy, but that is not so. On the local market the butter producers sell 46 per cent, of their product, the cheese producers 68 per cent., the sugar producers 64 per cent., the dried fruit-growers 39 per cent., and the mutton and lamb producers 82 per cent. relevancy of the honourable member's remarks. ment legislation in connection with tariff reductions has largely deprived Australian industries of the benefits of protection.

359,Dr. Eable Page (Cowper,"Actingthat State( Mr H3udd), and the-Minister for the Interior( Mr Paterson), and as the last named cannot again address the House on this bill ""without closing the debate, I desire at this stage to outline to honourable members the attitude which the Government proposes to adopt. The measure provides for the construction by the Commonwealth of a standard-gauge railway between Port Augusta and RedH ill in accordance with the provisions of the agreement made between the Commonwealth and South Australia in 1925 and ratified by both parliaments the following year. The present route from Port Augusta to Adelaide is circuitous, with steep grades and sharp curves. Practically a round of the clock is occupied in traversing it, though the direct distance over level country is rather lees than that between Albury and Melbourne, which Victorian trains cover to-day in four and a half hours. A State railway on the 5 f t . 3 in. gauge already traverses more than half the distance between Adelaide and Port Augusta on the direct route, and under the agreement referred 'to the Gommonwealth has the right to have a third rail laid on this track, and to build a new standard-gauge line across the remaining gap of 82 miles, so thai Trans-Australian sleeper trains can run right into Adelaide. The time saved in this way, together with adjustments to the ""Western Australian time table and a speeding up on thc Trans-Australian line, would enable a whole day to be saved in travelling between ""Western Australia and thc eastern States. The agreement also contemplates the laying down of a third rail, at South Australia's expense, on the proposed new standard track from RedH ill northward as far as Port Pirie, to enable the State to conduct its Port Pine-Adelaide traffic by the direct new route. ""While prepared to carry out the agreement in its entirety, the Oommonwealth had suggested to .South Australia as an alternative, and without prejudice, that the Commonwealth should purchase the 5 f t . 3 in. line between Salisbury and Red Hill, convert it to the standard gauge, and confine the third rail provision to the thirteen miles between Adelaide and Salisbury instead of the 128 miles from Adelaide to Port Pirie. The South Australian Government was not prepared to sell the Salisbury to RedH ill line to the Commonwealth for conversion. Nor was it willing to co-operate in carrying out the agreement made with the Commonwealth. This great step forward in the improvement of east-west communication is inevitable, and the present time is most opportune to carry out the work for two reasons-mone y can be obtained for the proposal at low rates of interest, and employment for many hundreds of men would be found in South Australia for the next two years. Although the Government has the best possible grounds for the belief that the agreement with South Australia is as valid now as on the date of its ratification, we naturally desire to secure the willing co-operation of the State rather than its reluctant acceptance of a legal agreement, and in view of South Australia's present opposition to the third rail provision, and its disinclination to accept our proposal to purchase the -Salisbury to RedH ill line, we are prepared to offer what we hope will satisfactorily terminate the present disagreement on the whole matter. We propose that the Commonwealth should extend its standard-gauge Trans-Australian line from Port Angusta southwards as far as Port Pirie only, a distance of about 56 miles, and that South Australia should extend the 5 f t . 3 in. railway, ending to-day at Red Hill, northwards as far as Port Pirie, a distance of approximately 26 miles, making Port Pirie the break-of-gauge station. If the portion of the Melbourne-Adelaide train reserved for Western Australian passengers were run through to Port Pine, passengers could then transfer to the Commonwealth transcontinental line train there instead of at Port Augusta, and on the eastward journey passengers, on leaving the transcontinental line train at Port Pirie, would step into the Melbourne train. By extending the 5 f t . 3 in. line from RedH ill to Port Pirie, South Australia would provide itself with a direct line on one gauge between Port Pirie and Adelaide. A saving of at-least £450,000 would be made in the total expenditure by this proposal, and although it would not permit of transcontinental line trains running into Adelaide, the same great saving of time could be secured.. The earnestly hopes that the South Australian Government will accept this modified proposal, for the twofold purpose of transforming the worse section of the east-west line into one of the best, and for the provision of employment during the coming winter. In order that no time may be lost in this regard, the Oommonwealth proposes to commence the construction of the new line from the Port Augusta end, under the authority of the existing agreement. Meanwhile we shall be prepared to enter into a new agreement with South Australia on the lines suggested, and even though some months must elapse before such a new agreement amending the present agreement could be ratified, South Australia would still have ample time to complete the small section of the line between RedH ill and Port Pirie by the time the Commonwealth reached the latter point. To save delay and avoid disappointment to men looking for employment, I ask the House to pass the bill in its present form, accepting the assurance of the Government of its willingness promptly.to amend both the bill and the agreement on the lines indicated, if we can secure the co-operation of the South Australian Government. [12.13] -The speech of the Minister in charge of the bill ( Mr Paterson), coupled wibh the remarks this afternoon of the right honourable the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page), should remove from the minds of honourable members any doubt they have had as to the right of the Commonwealth to go on with this work, which may be described as the second step in connection with the proposals for the standardization of the railnecessary to connect the proposed Rod way gauges of Australia. I am not quite clear whether the Government has now submitted an alternative proposal, in order to meet the arguments advanced on behalf of the South Australian Government, or whether it definitely intends to adopt the new scheme. proposal. does not embrace a much larger scheme for the complete standardization of railway gauges, so that there might be a trunk line of standard gauge from Sydney Oommonwealth Government to Perth, the greatest asset-producing work that could be contemplated by the Oommonwealth and State governments, and another step towards providing a national system of railways for Australia. This would need to be followed by further standardization proposals, if the government railways of this country are not to be completely sacrificed in the interests of private enterprise. This great scheme should be supported by all who regard our transpprtation problems through Australian spectacles. The position in which the trans-Australian railway is left at the present time is glaringly unfair, and unless tbe position is improved it will be almost hopeless. The original intention, undoubtedly, was to provide fluid or unchecked connection between the Trans-Australian line and all the State railway systems; but this plan has been left in mid air. The line begins at a minor port in South Australia and ends nearly 400 miles from the main port of Western Australia. At neither end of the line have the locomotives and rolling stock any fluid or unchecked connection with the State capital, ancl in each case the people making the through journey have to suffer the inconvenience and delay occasioned by a break of gauge. The passing of this measure will enable both portions of the agreement embodied in the South Australian Act No. 1725 and the Commonwealth Act No. 2, both of February, 1926, to be implemented. I hope that no deviation will be made from that agreement merely to satisfy particular local interests. I should like the final agreement to be reached on the original basis, by the South Australian Government building the 26 miles of line H i ll to Port Augusta line with Port Pirie, at the same time maintaining the through line from Adelaides to Port Augusta via RedH ill . I do not claim to have an intimate knowledge of this part of South Australia, but I have been over, the route on one or two occasions, and it seems to me the original plan is more sensible and more likely to give satisfactory service.",102,Second Reading

362,Mr Drakeford,"I regret that itI n September, 1925, an honourable agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth and South Australia. This agreement, amongst other things, provided(a) For the building of a railway to Alice Springs, to be paid for by the Commonwealth. (i>) For the building of a railway from the Central Australia railway since it Port Augusta to RedH ill , and providing a was opened to Alice Springs about five third rail on the existing railway between years ago, ancl compare them with the lied H ill and Adelaide, so as to permit of 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge trains running through from losses on the railway when it was opened Port Augusta to the main Adelaide Railway only as far as Oodnadatta, we shall find Station. These works, like the railway to that, interest and all other charges conAlice Springs, were to be paid for by the sidered, since the opening of the line to Commonwealth. (o) For providing a third rail on the line about £600,000 greater than the loss of raihvay Uetween RedH ill and a point near Port Pirie BO as to permit of 5-ft. 3-in. during the corresponding period prior to trains running f r om Adelaide to a point near the opening of that railway. Port Pirie. This work alone was to be at January, 1911, when the Commonthe cost of South Australia. In due time, the railway was built to sibility for this railway, the losses in Alice -Springs, and it has been operating working and the interest charges have now for some years. Evidently what amounted to over £3,500,000. South Australia required, when the agreement was signed in 1915, was a line to Alice Springs at ithe expense of the Comthat the Commonwealth should perform monAvealth, ancl when the State got the that part of the agreement extending railway to that point, it lost all interest the railway to AliGe Springs, but when in the remainder of the agreement. The the Commonwealth seeks to observe the building of the line to Alice Springs, other part of the agreement by extending however, was only a portion of the agreethe line from Port Augusta to Red Hill, ment; and the Commonwealth having and making the necessary provision for fulfilled its obligations so far as that line a connection with Adelaide, there is an is concerned, has been endeavouring for outcry in South Australia. The extena considerable time to carry out the sion of the Trans-Australian railway whole of the agreement and put from Port Augusta to Adelaide is an in hand the construction of the railway absolute necessity. The line was built at from Port Augusta to Red Hill, and very great cost, and cannot be left susprovide the third rail between RedB ill pended in mid-air, as it were, between and Adelaide. But, for some strange two narrow-gauge systems, one on the reason, the Government of South Auseast and one on the west. Having tralia is now seeking to iprevenit the perused the Commonwealth Railways Commonwealth Government from carryCommissioner's annual reports, I find ing out the works covered by the agreethat, year after year, he has urged and ment which was signed in 1925 and is entreated that this work should be still in existence. One wonders what the carried out. In his report for the year attitude of the South Australian Governended the 30th June, 1934, he summed ment would have been had the Commonup crisply in eight points why these wealth refused to build the railway to railway works should be put in hand. Alice Springs. would have been accused of a breach of the agreement, and protests would have been heard throughout the length and extension of the trans-Australian railway by breadth of South Australia. The Oomthe monwealth, however, honoured its obliAugusta-RedH ill Railway Act 1930) and the gations and built the line, although it has provision of standard 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge conbeen proved a financial burden. The railway to Alice Springs was opened in August, 1929, and since that time the losses on the Central Australia railway, according to the annual reports of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, have amounted to about £1,250,000. If we check up the losses on Alice Springs there has been a loss of Since wealth Government took over the responSouth Australia was quite agreeable The Commonwealth The report states, at pages 13 and 14So seriously do I view the need for the building of the railway from Port Augusta to RedH ill (as authorized by the Port nexion between RedH ill and Adelaide, that I must again urge this work be undertaken. From time to time. I have stressed tlie need for this work, aud I cannot do better than repeat what I wrote in one of my recent annual reports-' The business of the trans-Australian railway continues to be hampered by the existence of a very indirect route irom Fort Augusta to Adelaide, which involves two changes of gauge -on e at Port Augusta from the 4-ft. 8±-in. trans-Australian railway to the 3-ft.. 6-in. line decreased cost of material, the Port Augustafrom Port Augusta to Terowie, and the obher at Terowie from the 3-ft. 6-in. State line to the 5-ft. 3-in. State railway, and vice versa. The good impression created with the passenger by the trans-Australian railway is often nullified by the slow and uncomfortable journey on the narrow-gauge connection, and this frequently results in the passenger leaving the train at Port Augusta and motoring to Adelaide. These disadvantages would all be removed by the construction of the railway which has already been authorized by the Port Augusta-RedH ill Railway Act 1930, which was assented to on the 23rd December, 1930, and provides lor the construction of a railway from Port Augusta to RedH ill (at an estimated cost of £735,000) as part of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Soutli Australia, dated 18th September, 1925. It would be necessary to provide a third rail On the existing 5-ft. 3-in. line from RedH ill to Adelaide, ut an estimated cost of £380,000, which also includes access to Adelaide station. "" Briefly stated, the construction of this railway would(1) Provide a line 70 miles shorter than the existing route. (2) Enable the journey between Adelaide and Kalgoorlie to be reduced by about nine hours. (3) Save passengers the inconvenience involved by changing trains at Terowie and Port Augusta. (4) Afford the passengers more comfort and less expense. (5) Eliminate two handlings of mails and goods at Terowie and Port Augusta and the consequent expense and delay. (8) Enable the railways to quote cheaper rates and speedier transit for the increasing volume of goods traffic between the eastern States and Western Australia. (7) Permit of live-stock from the transTrans-Australian railway. Certainly Australian railway being conveyed from the point of loading to the market in the same wagon, and this, combined with the speedier journey in more commodious vehicles over a shorter route, would ensure the live-stock reaching the market in first-class condition, and without being bruised. The time of journey from Port Augusta to Dry Creek wonld occupy from ten to twelve hours, as against the 25 hours which now elapse between arrival Auarusta. and the arrival at Dry Creek. Mr Drakeford. (8) Provide a line on which 85 per cent, more loading could be carried on each train from Port Augusta, and 54 per cent, on each train to Port Augusta. (This existing line via Terowie rises to 2,000 feet, whilst via RedH ill the highest point would be only 455 feet.) "" It ie certain that, with lower wages and Red Hill-Adelaide railway could now be constructed for much less than the estimate; and it is recommended that as soon as funds cau be made available the construction of the railway be put in hand."" The trans-Australian railway, constructed at very heavy cost (£7,987,210), can never give to the people the service it should give until the railway extensions referred to are provided. That is a concise and complete summary of the position, which it would be very dimcult to controvert. I respectfully submit that the House will not do its duty unless it passes this measure and promotes the endeavour of the Government to provide an avenue of employment in South Australia, in which the percentage of unemployed is the greatest of any State of the Commonwealth. It is estimated hy the Commonwealth that there will be a profit of over £5,000 per annum on the working of the railway after paying interest and working expenses. In view of the urgent necessity for the extension of the Trans-Australian railway into Adelaide, the work should be put in hand without delay. South Australia evidently considers that the building of this railway will rob of traffic the existing railway between Quorn and Terowie. That section may be affected; but, when the traffic from the Trans-Australian railway is considered, it will be seen that the Quorn to Terowie section will not be any worse off than it was during the many years it was working prior to the opening of the the live stock from the Central Australian railway will go by the new route instead of the old, to the great advantage of stock-owners in the saving of haulage distance, quicker transport, and lower freights. If , however, the railway between Quorn and Terowie were to lose this live-stock traffic, there would be an adjustment of the train the service, and the working expenses over of live-stock at Port the section would be very materially reduced. As every railway man is aware, and as every stock-owner has reason to know, one of the disadvantages of railway transport is that stock are sadly knocked about, and their market value is considerably reduced, in the operation of shifting them from the trucks to the yards and back into the trucks. Whatever lass there might be in revenue would be largely made good by the reduction of working expenses. It may, of course, be necessary for South Australia to consider the advisability of extending its 5-ft. 3-in. gauge from Terowie to' Quorn. It is claimed in some quarters that at one time the State undertook to make that conversion, and thus avoid the existing break of gauge, and at the same time provide a far better service. Being unacquainted with the merits of that claim, I cannot say whether the State is under an obligation in that respect; but that it is entirely a State matter, is shown by the statement of Mr Webb, the Commissioner for the South Australian Bailways, who, giving evidence before the Commonwealth Public Works Committee in 1926, saidUltimately we propose to extend tlic liroad which burn native instead of imported gauge from Terowie to Quorn. Evidently, therefore, that extension was in the mind of the Commissioner, and -doubtless of the South Australian Government, also-. The suggestion made from time to time, that the railways are a thing of the past and that expenditure should not be incurred upon new construction, comes, I respectfully suggest, from inspired sources, which would prefer the railways to remain losing propositions in a cold, commercial sense, so that private enterprise, with which they sympathize, might continue to increase its profits. To-day, railway services in many parts of the world are demonstrating, by the use of lighter and faster trains, and more comfortable passenger rolling-stock, that they are capable of undertaking rapid transit over long distances, and of continuing to be the principal transport agency of the people. An example of that is a recent performance on one of the English railway systems. The descriptio7i of it, which was published in the press within the last fortnight, mentioned a maximum speed of 108 miles an hour, and an average of 88 milss aa hour for the full journey of hundreds of miles. Streamlined trains and air-conditioned passenger rolling-stock are regaining custom which had temporarily sought other means of transport. In the United States of America, steam-driven engines as well as other types are running at very high speeds. In one case, a journey of 3,258 miles is completed in 56 hours 55 minutes. At one stage of the journey a speed of 120 miles an hour is attained, and the average throughout is 57.2 miles an hour. For a distance of 519 mile* the average speed is 59.2 miles an hour, and on another section of 508 milesprobably mainly on descending gradients -the average is 84 miles an hour. That is accomplished by one of the latest diesel-engined trains built' on streamlined principles. There is talk of similar trains being built in Australia. I could give numberless examples to combat the suggestion that railways are a thing of the past. On the contrary, all the indications point to the fact that they are making headway. That is particularly the case with steam-driven trains fuela very important factor which is deserving of consideration by both sides of the House when dealing with a problem of this kind. The South Australian railways have suffered severely from the alleged rehabilitation scheme initiated by an American Commissioner, who sought to apply the latest American methods to entirely unsuitable Australian conditions. The State was loaded with the expense involved in a big-engine policy, which necessitated the expenditure of huge sums upon alterations to the permanent way and platforms, the widening of tunnels, the provision of heavier rails, and more substantial bridges, and almost a complete change of railway equipment, the full extent of which was hardly realized when the scheme was undertaken. As a railwayman who has had many years experience of practical train operation, I say that the big-engine policy developed within reoent years, is entirely unsuitable to Australian conditions. The infrequency of the service, due to this policy, has made the railways very unpopular, particularly in. connection with goods trains, and has bean t&e means of driving custom to motor transport. Those having goods to shift were not content to wait for a bi-weekly service, but sought prompter transport. American practicefavours larger trains and fewer units; but that policy, while possibly suitable for long hauls through closely populated districts, has been tried in certain parts of Australia, and is not favoured. In my opinion it is not justified. The running of fewer trains over our long distances causes definite dissatisfaction with the railway service, and is detrimental to it. The adoption of that practice undoubtedly contributed to the establishment of motorcarrying companies and passenger bus services which now get the cream of the traffic. The latter are a very inferior substitute for the average railway carriage being definitely less comfortable. They also have the disadvantage of increasing thc use of foreign fuel. The complete story would take far too long for me to tell in the time now at my disposal. There can be no doubt, however, that the South Australian railways rehabilitation scheme, not only failed to rehabilitate the railways, but also influenced the mind of the people of that State adversely, which accounts, to some extent, if not altogether, for the opposition now being shown by some sections of the people there to the construction of the Port Augusta to RedH ill railway. I say "" some sections "" advisedly. A good deal of noise is being made about this proposal in South Australia, but I believe that the great majority of the people there would be pleased to see the line built. The saving of time that would be effected by the construction of this line ferring to Oommonwealth railways emhas been advanced as one reason why it should be built, and it is without doubt an important consideration. The Minister in charge of the bill said, in his second-reading speech, that the distance from Albury to Melbourne, which is approximately the same distance as that from Port Augusta to Red Hill, is now being covered in from four to five hours. from 7.30 a.m. to 12 noon. a former employee on locomotives of such men is determined on a mileagerunning from Benalla to Melbourne and basis. At present the 260 miles between from Benalla to Albury, I know that a considerable speeding up has occurred on that line. The express trains which The used to reach Melbourne at 1 o'clock now arrive at noon. A similar saving of time has been effected in the journey from Melbourne to Albury. But the journey from Port Augusta to Adelaide and from Adelaide to Port Augusta on tbe existing lino takes from twelve to thirteen hours, which is approximately one hour more than was the case some years ago. from eleven to twelve hours. the time taken in transferring goods and passengers from one train to another at Port Augusta, for, obviously, if the break of gauge be eliminated, a considerable amount of that time will be saved, to the great convenience of the travelling public. When we consider also that a further saving of time will occur when the ballasting of the East-West railway line is completed, we may safely estimate that a saving of 24 hours will be possible between Adelaide and Perth. The ballasting of tbe East-West line will permit of higher 3peeds on practically the whole route, which will make the journey much more attractive than at present, and be to the good in every respect. I hope, however, that the Government will give full consideration to the effect of the construction of the Port Augusta to RedH ill line on tbe mon employed on that section of the railway service, for it would be unfair if their interests were overlooked. The opening of this line for traffic will have the effect of transployees work now being done by railway employees of tbe South Australian Government. We should bear in mind, therefore, that the advantage accruing to the people who will use this line may involve disadvantages to the men employed on the existing line. I suggest that consideration should be given to the adoption of the system of payment of railway men on long distance trains adopted on the Zealand and the United States of",104,Second Reading
