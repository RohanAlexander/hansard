Petitions received and read. Treasurer a question in reference to a statement made by the State Treasurer of New South Walesi n the local Parliament last night. Mr Woddell said that, pending the transfer to the State of the balance of the revenue collected on behalf of the Commonwealth, it was found necessary to arrange temporarily for a small overdraft for which the Government was paying 1 per cent, interest in excess of the rate allowed by the banks on fixed deposits. I desire to know if the delay mentioned by the State Treasurer of New South Wales has been occasioned by the action of the Commonwealth Treasurer, and, if so, what is the cause of such delay; and whether the Treasurer will take immediate steps to obviate the necessity of the Treasurer of New South Wales being compelled to make financial arrangements at the expense of the people of that State. able friend was good enough to intimate that he' intended to ask this question. Section 89 of the Constitution Act provides for the 'collection of the money and for crediting and debiting it in a certain way, and then tliat the Commonwealth shall pay to each State, month by month, the balance, if any, in favour of the State. On the last day of each month each State has received the balance payable to it . Under the existing arrangement the staff of the Treasury, 6 September, 1901. which is a very small one, remain t ill two or three in the morning of the 28th or the 29th of the month, as may be, in order that the whole of the calculations may be made. Telegrams are sent the next morning to our .officers in each State that they are to remit to us a certain sum, being the share of the State in the new expenditure, and to pay over to the State the balance, -whatever it may be. I can understand that, -without there having been any delay or neglect -whatever on the part of the Commonwealth, some little inconvenience may have arisen in the States through their not being able to collect their money day by day as in the post. No communication, however, has been made to me in any shape or form, but, although the Constitution provides that the money shall be paid month by month, if it would be of any convenience to the States for us to pay it at more frequent periods, I do not see any objection to our doing so. If , for example, it would be of any assistance to the States for us to pay week by I desire to ask the week, we could arrange. to pay over what has . been collected, less what has been expended week by week, and at the end of the month the necessary adjustment could be made. If the Treasurer of New South Wales is anxious to have such an arrangement earned out I w ill consult with the Attorney-General. Honourable",14,Setup

This is the first of the various fences in connection with this class of legislation which the House has had to take. I do not think that the manner in which the fence has been approached is as satisfactory as it might have been. baulking. I generally take my fences on the stride. Probablyi t is the intention of the committee to pass this clause upon the voices, but I do not propose that it shall so pass without having given some indication of my own view in regard to the principle involved. I believe that the attempt by the Attorney-General to overcome this difficulty by the insertion of a sub-clause in the clause relating to regulations was an attempt to get rid of considerable trouble. But personally, I prefer always that matters shall be dealt with in a straightforward way, and that there shall be no subterfuge adopted in the consideration of legislation of this character. decline to believe that this is a question involving the greater question of a white Australia. I regard this B ill as a commercial measure entirely, and to hamper it with the restriction which is now submitted for our consideration is imposing upon those engaged in commercial transactions in an unnecessary obligation. I decline to think that we are studying the best interests of the Commonwealth by this hysterical effort to' carry out the idea of a white Australia, and to bring about restrictive legislation within the period covered by thefirstsessionwhichisnecessarily fraught with much anxiety to the Ministry who have charge of the Bills which are essential to the harmonious working of the Commonwealth departments. My'object in rising is emphatically to enter my dissent from this"" prostration before an ideal, however lofty it may be, and against the consideration of this clause on other than broad commercial lines. proper time arrives for the consideration of the question of a white Australia, I shall not be behind any honourable ' member of this House in my desire to see ! that the people of Australia are not contaminated by fellowship with alien races. B ut I feel that the attempt which is now being made in this direction is .a mistake and a disadvantage to those who introduced it . I regret it very much. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I am a little bit puzzled to know exactly what is before the committee. So many clauses and amendments have been submitted that it is somewhat puzzling for any one to speak upon this question without entertaining a fear that before he has. finished there might be some other alteration I do not baulk as a rule; of the Government attitude in regard to this matter, and that possibly the proposal which is now before the committee might be withdrawn, as were tlie three previous amendments, in which case we should have to commence the debate de novo. I was both surprised and grieved at the attitude taken up by the members of the Government upon this question. Pirst of all the Attorney-General' endeavoured to smooth the matter over by suggesting that instead of dealing with it in a direct and straightforward manner, we should attempt to hoodwink those who have the right to veto 'this Bill, namely, the Imperial Government by inserting a harmI less little clause in it, giving the GovernorGenerali n Council power to deal with a matter of such vital importance by regulation. He suggested that we should trust to the mere casual way in which some portions of the measure would be skimmed over, for this provision to be passed, instead of declaring in a manly and proper way what really was the policy of the Government. This is a question which has had the attention of the Ministry for some considerable time. U p t ill a few weeks agoand I do not see how I can avoid alluding to the treatment accordedto this Bill by another representative of the Government who is not under the control of this House -w e found the Government distinctly and clearly opposing a clause of precisely a similar nature in reference to the employment of coloured crews. orable member cannot allude to what took place in another Chamber.

The honunder debate, an honourable member is to be debarred from referring to the attitude of the colleagues of the Government upon the same Bill, and upon the same clause, the discussion upon which has not yet closed, even though it has been dealt with in another place Tlie Bill is not now in course of consideration in the other place. However, it is not .my desire to press this point. point, and ought to be pressed. MrV . L . SOLOMON I ask you, sir, to look into the matter, and to give us your decision at a later stage. We have too much serious business to attend to in delay its progress by challenging your ruling, or by placing you in a position which none of us desire to see you occupy. I shall content myself with saying that we do not know from one day to another what position the Government are taking up in regard to this matter. When they are backed by a large majority in sticking to their Bill, they refuse to insert a clause of this sort one day, and a little while after a member of the Government comes down and suggests getting over the difficulty presented by a side wind, and by adopting a course of procedure which I venture to think the majority of this committee would deprecate. The Attorney-General proposed to overcome the difficulty by a system of legislation which I do not think it is a good thing in this higher Parliament of Australia to commence, namely by dealing with a matter in an underhanded, dodging, sinuous sort of manner. Those words perhaps are too mild taken up by the Government upon this question. Wheni t was found that there was a determination on the part of a certain section of this House and of a few other supporters of the Government to have this question decided promptly, and to have some such provision as is now before the committee inserted in the Bill, the attitude of the Ministry underwent a change, even though we were told by the Attorney-General only a few minutes before that it was inadvisable that such a provision should be inserted in the way proposed. The inference to be drawn from the remarks of the Attorney General, carefully as they were couched, was -that if such a provision were inserted the Bill would probably be refused tlie Royal assent. Within an hour after this endeavour on the part of the Attorney General to ""draw a herring across the trail,"" we had the Prime Minister telling us he had come to the conclusion that there was not the slightest fear of any veto-that this Bill was on an entirely different basis from the Immigration Bill, or from any experiences of Queensland, and that there was nothing to prevent the Bill being passed with this clause. to reason. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Some of ns are, and, like the Government, do just what the honourable member suggests. It seems strange to me that we should waste, in two connection with this Bill to brandies of the Legislature, a considerable number of hours debating this question. The Government have had this matter under consideration, and have fought tooth and nail to win and yet, in a few minutes, we had the Prime Minister taking an attitude entirely different from that assumed by tlie Attorney-General on the same clause. . If that is a specimen of the way in which we are going to legislate on these questions, I am somewhat sorry for some of the supporters of the Government. Some of those who thought that the position taken up by the Government on this matter for over two months, and up to as late as four o'clock yesterday, was one that had received the consideration we naturally imagined such a question would receive at the hands cf the Cabinet, suddenly discovered that when threatened by a certain section of the committee, the Government climbed down very ungracefully. MrV . L . SOLOMON I dare say the word "" threat"" should not have been used, but the Government, on ascertaining what the strong feeling of a certain section of the committee was MrV . L . SOLOMON I am sure the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa, eloquent with the torrid heat of the district he represents, had great influence with the Prime Minister. My idea is that when the Government advocate a policy, they should advocate it fairly and squarely and take a test vote as quickly as possible. They ought not to dodge until they have carefully counted noses, and then frame the policy of this great Commonwealth according to the peculiar altered circumstances in",16,Electoral Bill Monwealth Free Of Postage Or Upon Such

The real point of the question was put very clearly by the honourable member for Wentworth. a ""white Australia,"" and though it may suit some honourable members of the committee to raise that cry, it has very little indeed to do with the case. ""white with in a Bill which we hope will shortly be before us. for Wentworth pointed out a large majority of members have been returned pledged to support a ""-white Australia."" with all due humility that there is no member of this House who has done more for that object during the past sixteen years than myself. I was the first who raised the cry against Chinese immigration, and endeavoured to conduct a crusade against the influx of these aliens at Port Darwin, and to induce the Government of South Australia . to put a stop to it some sixteen years ago ; so that think that my advocacy of a "" white tralia "" which has been reiterated time after time in the State Parliament, for over ten years, can be questioned. bility of the Imperial Government tbe Bill with the proposed clause in it, I do not think there is much danger, considering the form in which the proposal is now framed. us at first it was proposed that none but British seamen should man any vessel which was under contract to carry mails, and there was a very grave possibility of the Bill being vetoed by the Imperial Government. running in stipulating that Indian of His Majesty shall be debarred employment steamers, is that of jeopardizing the very handsome contribution which Great Britain at present contributes to our mail subsidy. In round figures I understand cost of the subsidized mail services at the present time is £177,000 per annum, of which Australia contributes about £70,000, and Great Britain the balance. that Great Britain is going to negotiate these contracts, and submit to Mr V.

SOLOMON -The honourable member must have been asleep not to know that the expenditure in regard to defence has gone up by leaps and bounds, while the expenditure of other departments has very much grown. I am not blaming the Government for this for one instant, but I say I do not the expenditure we estimated a few years Ausago has been greatly exceeded, and exceeded in many instances by the actions of the States. Instead of £300,000 constituting the total As to the probaexpenditure, in some of the transferred devetoing partments, the cost will be very much greater than at the .time of the estimate.

26,But The Only Danger We Are Mr Mauger,"Will the honourable memeven with the stipulation as to the employment of white labour, the companies may be found willing to take the contracts at not much more than at present; but on the other hand there is the point which I wish to emphasize, that I am very doubtful, whether the British Government will be satisfied to negotiate these contracts and more than Australia towards the subsidy, while coloured British subjects in India are barred from eniploymenton the steamers. We had a warning in connection with the Natal Immigration Bill. It was pointed out that Great Britain would be placed in a very difficult position if colour were made a bar to the people of India coming to Australia. In Natal the educational test was adopted, and the Government of South Australia tried to follow the example. Of course, I do not know whether the education test now proposed by the Government may not be put aside and that of colour substituted ; judging from recent events, I should think such a contingency extremely probable. I want the committee to consider whether under the circumstances, with only two or three years to run before the contracts expire it is wise to hamper : this purely machinery Bill with a clause of this kind. I do not think the fact that black stokers are not employed on the mail steamers will give one additional man a day's employment in Australia. In addition to the disabilities we have already placed on steam-ship companies in regard to ships' stores in the Customs Bill, the disabilities in another Bill to which I am not going to allude in detail, and also in the Inter-State Bill, are we going to impose another by saying they shall not enter into a contract for the carriage of Australian mails so long as they employ a black man in the stoke-hole ? I am not going to 1 argue the question whether white men can work in the stoke-holes in the Red Sea, but I know that in some six or eight trips round the coast of Australia, through the Torres Straits and on to Port Darwin, I have seen the Stoke-hole work on the boats of the China Navigation Company, the Eastern Australian Company, the Netherlands-India Company, and other vessels, as much as the black stokers could stand, and it was sometimes pitiable to see the condition in which they were brought up on deck. In hot climates I have no hesitation in saying the work is absolutely 13 s unfitted for white men, and that it is more trying than is the work in tbe sugar-fields. It is for the committee to consider whether we are not opening the door to too much additional expense in taking up tlie attitude now suggested. I desire as much as any one to establish a white Australia, but I wish to see it done in such a way as not to uncontribute at least one-third necessarily hamper our trade relations. I think that a white Australia should be brought about, and I am pledged to assist in bringing it about, but I think that it would have been better to leave the question out of this Bill altogether, and to deal with it by legislation relating purely to the question of the introduction of black people into Australia. We have no right to smuggle the question into this Bill, and I can see no excuse at all for adopting the course which is now advocated by the honourable member for West Sydney. The desire of the labour party is apparently to bind the Government -who m they are at present supporting-to a definite line of policy on this question. An Honorable MEMBER -I s not that a good thing to do ? MrV . L . SOLOMON -Judging from what we have seen I am very much in sympathy with the idea that such a course is necessary. I hope that the proposed new clause will not be passed, but that the committee will see that as a matter of purely financial consideration it would be very much wiser to deal with all questions relating to the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers, and the introduction of coloured immigrants into Australia, in a separate Bill covering the whole ground fully and fairly. have been rather surprised to hear the utterances of the honourable member who has just sat down, and, as one of the supporters of the Government, I must thank him for the very favorable opinion he entertains of us, as if we were some stream that would follow i u whatever channel the Government might choose to cut. As far as I can gather, the Government lay clown a very clear course. The Attorney-General clearly put it before the House that he could see that a difficulty would probably arise with the British Government if we included in the Bill the principle contained in the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney, and he proposed that the matter should be dealt with by a provision merely stating that any proposed mail",18,Electoral Bill Monwealth Free Of Postage Or Upon Such
27,Mr Cruickshank (Gwydir),"Icontracts should be brought before the House, and submitted for discussion, before they were accepted by the Government. This would enable honourable members to express their approval or otherwise of any proposed agreement 'before any subsidies were paid. A number of questions occur'in connection with this matter which require the serious consideration of the House. We have to consider what we shall have to pay for a white Australia, and we can only arrive at a just conclusion upon this point, ; when we know what steamers it is proposed to employ, what kind of labour is to'be employed, and what subsidy will be required under different conditions. We shall have to go further than this even. shall have considerations of trade and commerce not only on our own shores, but with foreign countries; and the time is-not very far distant when we shall have to consider what sort of labour shall be. encouraged and paid for on those steamers which carry on our trade beyond the Commonwealth. So far as my own personal feeling goes I would employ not only white people but British subjects as far as it is possible. I believe that white men are quite capable of doing the work in the stoke-holes of these steamers, and I would have gone further than the honourable member for West Sydney has gone, by providing that all men employed in connection with these steamers, whether for coaling or other purposes, should be white men and British subjects. Sir WILLIAM honourable member compel the steamers to contracts, I think the whole thing is uUuse Australian coal, too 1 so far as that. I think the Government have been treated rather harshly by members on the opposition side. The Government and those supporting them are doing something which the members of the Opposition do not want them to do, but which honourable members on the other side would, at the same time, like the country to -believe that they are in favour of. The Government are taking the proper course in this matter, and the discussion which has taken place will be of the utmost value, because it will show that the feeling of the House is strongly in favour of having this question of the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers fought out at once on high principles. worth) I do not intend to take up the time of the committee more than a'moment, because I recognise -that we are airsick of this Post and Telegraph Bill, and' will be glad to see it through the House. I am glad bhat the result of the debate has been to ; -modify somewhat-and in a way that will render it less objectionable-^the amendmentintroduced'by the honourable member for. West Sydney. A t the same time! I must again enter my protest against the introduction of this clause into the B ill, because I think it is absolutely unnecessary, and that it will.give rise to unnecessary irritation. We have four years iihead of We us before the present contracts will expire, to take into account and at least two years before they will have to be considered, and there is no necessity to raise a question of this kind and cause a ferment before the occasion arises. After the severe castdgatiOn that the Government have received at the hands of the honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, I do not think I will 'say anything further, except that the Government is the most openminded Ministry that I have ever met; it has the most elastic conscience, and w ill be an interesting, psychological study for the future historian. I think that I covered the ground last night as completely as it could be covered, and I do not want to obstruct the proceedings of the committee or take up time now. While the further alteration of the amendment does away with a great deal of the possible obstruction to the practical carrying out of the mail necessary at-this stage. to enter into a discussion of the merits, of this question, because I understand 'that the majority of honourable members are at one upon it , but I think it would be wrong not to say a word or two in reply to the observations of the honourable member for Wentworth, for the reason that hereafter-it might be questioned whether this House was really resolved upon having this principle carried out or not. I should be very sorry indeed if any doubt existed on' that question, and I should be also sorry if it were ever understood from observations that might be pointed out in Hansa/rd-'suc h as those which have just fallen from the honourable member-that the Government ever-wavered",19,Electoral Bill Monwealth Free Of Postage Or Upon Such

I listened very carefully. to the speech of the 1 Attorney-General, and I did not detect any doubt or hesitation in the views he held. I understood him to say that whilst he thoroughly 'agreed with the views expressed in the'amendment proposed by the honourable member for West Sydney, he raised the question as to which was the roost politic and the most certain way of Attaining the desired end. ""Very"" forcible reasons were 'brought forward by the Attorney-General,-but,on the whole ' balance of the argument, I agree that the : course of inserting this provision in the body of the Bill is the preferable one. After discussion, the Government are prepared to agree to that course, but it is an unfair aspersion on them to say that they have changed their minds on the subject. I think that we all thoroughly understand -as were promised. The first change meetsthat the Government, a majority of the House, and a vast and overwhelming majority of the country are in one accord with the principle embodied in the clause.

I trust that the subdivision which has been made-particularl y in regard t'o the matter of newspaper supplements-Will make it much more acceptable to those who have' to study it without obtaining legal advice. As far as I havechecked the clause-and I have checked it very carefullyI believe it includes everything that was agreed to by the 1 committee in clause 26.

If the object is simply to protect local labour this clause does not attain that purpose, and some additional words are required in subclause (6). Theni n sub-clause (d), after the word ""newspaper,"" the words ""and date thereof"" might be inserted, because I do not see why tlie supplement companies should have the advantage in this regard. tlie Attorney-General desires that both the title of the newspaper and tlie date should appear on the supplement, but if that amendment be made, all the concession which the Attorney-General has agreed to might become useless, for the reason that when the supplement arives here from abroad the date of its issue may not have been decided on. because the title must appear, and the date can be added. supplements, distributed by weekly journals.

And there are other papers withwhose opinions it would do us a great deal of' good to be inoculated occasionally. The only wonder is that the Government have not inserted some provision that only pictures."" locally produced shall be hung on our walls.

Mr G. B, EDWARDS (South Sydney) I voted for.this amendment as a free-trader, and I will, take that course-again, but I hope we shall not be dragged, into another long fiscal discussion. If we were running the Postal department as a business firm would run it, we should have none of this trouble about definitions at all. We should cany all printed matter in the same way as would a private carrier at so much per pound, and we should make more money and give more satisfaction to the public, and not be the victims of all the devious dodges spoken of by the honourable member for Coolgardie. All these definitions with regard to what shall constitute a newspaper create difficulties which encourage the public to indulge in all sorts of forms of swindling, and it is a pity that we cannot, run our Post-office on sound commercial lines. enter a protest against the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney that we should look upon the Post-oflice as a commercial concern.

That is the nature of the provision in the Gladstone and Collide Railway Act, and a similar provision, in a slightly different form, appears in the Albert River and Bourketown Tramway Act, and other similar measures. I move That the words ""or any private railway or tramway already constructed or in course of construction "" be inserted after the word ""State,"" line 10. I have four different Acts here relating to lines which are already in existence. This clause provides that no such line shall be used for the purpose of transmitting and delivering telegrams for the public. In tbe case of one tramway which I know of, a telegraph line is already in existence. It is erected on the poles of the tramway company, and the men carry instruments with them, so that in case of accident they CanN o t if the Crown subattach them to the telegraph line and send for assistance.

142,"Now, Several Of The Acts Sir Philip Fysh","Only such reasons,establish practice with regard to the user of these particular lines, especially when they are within cities. It seems to me that where there are lines which may interfere with public lines there should be some special power in the hands of the Postmaster General to exercise control over them. I must leave the matter in the hands of the committee, and if the honourable member should be successful in his endeavour to insert these words, it must remain for the electrical authority to show cause why they should not be retained. Sir MALCO LM M c EACHARN (Melbourne) -The objection raised by the honourable member seems to be that he wants certain authority vested in the Postmaster General. I have no desire to take away from the Postmaster-General any authority whatever over the lines. I merely wish to retain to these individuals, or companies, certain rights which the}' now enjoy under certain Acts of Parliament. member limit himself to existing lines of railway 1 Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN quite prepared to do that. the Government would do well to consider this matter carefully before consenting to the amendment. I have no objection to private railway companies being allowed to transmit their own messages over their own lines. They may very well have telephone or telegraphic lines to facilitate the general working of their railways, but in regard to tramways it seems to me that the position is very different, because the matter of erecting a separate set of poles for telephonic communication in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, or Melbourne might be a very serious one. Sir MALCOLM are on the companies' own poles. that there sire tramway companies in the Commonwealth other than electric companies. WhilstI am prepared to allow any private railway company in country districts to have telephone or telegraph lines to facilitate the transaction of their own business I do not think we should go any further. In a Queensland Act there is a section which actually allows a private company to receive and transmit messages for the public. That is a matter which I hope the committee will never tolerate here. The main object of these private companies is to run railways and not to conduct telephonic or telegraphic communication. I ask the Government to carefully consider the matter before giving way. matter which the Government and the committee ought to weigh very seriously. I am quite with the honourable member for Bland in refusing to extend privileges to companies in relation to federal jurisdiction. As a matter of principle I should be against granting any privileges to companies to establish telegraph lines. Buti n the Queensland Act to which the honourable member for Melbourne has referred, I find sections which lead me to suppose that we must be very careful before we take away grants which have already been made, and rights which have been given in consideration of public duties and services performed. I find, for instance, that in the Albert River and Bourketown Tramway Act, section 13 providesthe honourable The company may and shall establish and maintain on or alongside the tramway such telephone and telegraphic communication as the I am commissioner directs and approves, and such communication when established shall be deemed to be part of the tramway. Apparently in consideration of the right to build a tramway, the company are compelled to relieve the State of the functions and expense of establishing telegraphic and telephonic communication. power in all. those Acts to run a line on the poles belonging to the company. direct the tramway company to go to the expense of erecting a telegraph line. The section further provides that they shall have a right to receive and demand rates Now, because we have collected into one band the powers, rights, and duties of the various Statesi n relation to these particular matters, are we going to be so unjust as to take away from persons or corporations rights which they have, in consideration for compulsory duties performed t I think that we ought to hesitate, and look into this matter thoroughly, before we take a step which may be unjust, and which, therefore, this Parliament ought not to countenance. 1 ask the Government to delay the consideration of this matter, and to' look into the various Queensland Acts which have been referred to.",30,Mcmillan Would The

148,Mr Isaacs,"But the Government maySir 'MALCOL MM c EACHARN (Melbourne) -In'repl y to the honourable member for Bland, I may-say'that it is'almost essential, in the case of tramways, that there should be telephonic communication. It may be a<.inatter of life or death at"" times. If an accident happens at a distance from the head-station, the drivers of the car have . instruments with them which they can connect with the telephone wire, and they are thus able to ask for the electric current to be cutoff, whereas if a messenger had to be sent -back, it might be a quarter of an hour-before the disconnection could be made, and in that time death might be caused to some person who might come into contact with the heavily-charged traction wire. Not long ago there was a death in Melbourne through some one coming into contact with a wire which had fallen. the companies should not be allowed telephonic communication, but I think that it should be arranged for through the postal authorities. has not been found workable. These telephone lines are used only for the purposes of the company, and on occasions such as I refer to. It is really in the interests of the public that the existing rights of the companies should not be taken away. that the Government should give the matter serious consideration. This Parliament must respect the'rights which have been given to private companies, such as the private railway companies in Queensland, though I maintain that those rights should never have been given, and I fought against the passing of the measures by which they were given. It is probable, however, that similar measures will be introduced into the Queensland Parliament this session, and I wish 'to know, therefore, if the Queensland Legislalature will have power to grant concessions in regard to telephone and telegraph communications-to future companies. will give the Postmaster-General the necessary power. see a provision inserted enabling the Postmaster-General to resume these lines after due notice. A measure introduced last year into the Queensland Parliament would have given a private company the right to control nearly 700 miles of telegraph line. its own use. would have had control of one--sixth of the telegraph lines Of Queensland. We should watch these matters very closely, and provide definitely that the Postmasters-General may resume telegraph and telephone lines after due noticehas been given. If a mining field becomes a large centre' of population, big profits may be made out of these private lines, upon which, in some cases, the companies are allowed' to charge 50 per cent, more than the Government rates. Mi-. DEAKIN (Ballarat-Attorney-Gene ral).'I do not feel competent to discuss the question now before t i e committee, but I would suggest to 'the honourable member for Melbourne that, if we passed this clause, we might, in the clause which gives the Postmaster-General power to make regulations, authorize him to make regulations providing for the use of these lines by any private railway or tramway company upon such terms and conditions as might be prescribed. think that such a provision would meet the case. The honourable and learned gentleman is suggesting now what he suggested last night-that we should provide by' regulation what it is desirable to do by direct enactment. Sir PHILIPPYSH I propose to limit the provision to existing lines, leaving the matter to be dealt with by the electric authority when the clause is amended. in the Commonwealth retaining the control of great undertakings, such as those to which the clause applies, but if private -enterprise is to be hampered by unnecessary restrictions, I am afraid that the development which there is the strongest justification for expecting in the northern parts of Queensland' will be interfered with.' I agree with the honourable member 79 for Melbourne that the committee should exercise caution and see that restrictions are not placed in the Bill which will interfere with the expansion of private enterprise. Where the Commonwealth will not undertake the responsibility of providing and maintaining telegraphic or telephonic communication, unnecessary restrictions should not be imposed to prevent private enter| prise from' doing the work.",31,Mceacharn Th E Lines For The Despatch Qf Telegraphic Messages

The question is whether this. Parliament can legislate in the direction in which the States have already legislated to protect themselves.' If we cannot, then by handing over the control of the post-offices to the Commonwealth the States will have deprived themselves of one of those elements of administration that are necessary for the enforcement of local laws. If the States are not to have continued to them the advan-' tages they have hitherto possessed, because they have handed over 'certain powers to the Commonwealth, they ought to know their position at once. I hope the committee will consider the matter, and that if there is any way of meeting the objections raised we shall have them removed. I cannot consent to withdraw the amendment, as I desire that the committee should take the responsibility of dealing with it . the contention of the Attorney-General would be a correct one if the sub-clause were to apply to every State, but as has been pointed out, the provision will apply only to those Statesi n which Acts have been passed prohibiting the transmission of certain objectionable articles as mail matter. awkward matter for the Postmaster-General to be called upon to administer five different State Acts? difficulty comes in.

I do not understand the honourable member for Tasmania to contend that his amendment would apply to Acts passed in the future. to throw an indeterminable responsibility upon the Federal postal authorities. reference only to Acts which had been passed, I should support it . I think we have no right either to diminish the revenue of any State or to interfere with any domestic law in a State, and if a State' has passed a law with a view to prevent the transmission through the Post-office of literature defined to be of an objectionable character, we ought to do nothing which would render that law ineffective. The provisions of this Bill deal with the subject to a certain, extent, and I think the honourable member for Tasmania would be well advised if he altered his amendment so as to make it apply only to Acts passed prior to the Postal department being taken over by the Commonwealth. similar power of interference with news-: papers or other postal articles has been conferred on the Postmaster-Generali n other parts of the Bill, a right of appeal is provided for against anything that may be done by the Postmaster-General, and if the honourable member for Tasmania presses his amendment I shall certainly endeavour to alter it on tbe lines of the amendment already carried in clause 27, providing that any person aggrieved may appeal to a Supreme Court Judge. I intend to support the amendment. In some of the States certain enactments have been passed providing that newspapers containing particular kinds of advertisements shall be destroyed by the Postmaster-General; and, so far as' South Australia is concerned, the Acts there relating to this matter would be rendered inopera tive, unless protected, as proposed here.

I intend, therefore, to support the honourable member, though I believe that he ought to make it clear that the amendment applies only to Acts at present in force. More machinery than appears here requires to be inserted for the carrying out of the provision. against the proposal, because it seems to me that by its adoption we should be creating a most extraordinary position. We should have the Postmaster-General attempting to administer the Acts of the different States, although those Acts might vary to a very considerable extent. It-would be .utterly absurd to ask the Postmaster-General to attempt in the slightest degree to administer State laws. Moreover, the States have f u l l power to protect themselves in regard to all publications issued within their own territory. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I wish to ask if there is anything in the Constitution that enables my honourable friend to move this amendment with a view to giving the States the power proposed. It seems to me that the amendment is an invasion of the Commonwealth powers and of the Postmaster-General's rights. Under its operation each State could set up and run the Commonwealth under a sort of split division. Tasmania would exercise one power, Western Australia another, and so by-and-by we should have a lot of Postmasters-General. There is thus no telling where the matter will end. For that reason I must vote against the honourable member. worth) -It seems to me that this proposal is absolutely inconsistent with the conclusion at which we arrived a short time ago in dealing with the "" Tattersall"" clauses. The principle which we then laid down was that we were to deal with the powers of the Post-office as a Federal service without any regard to the laws of the States. We are now contravening our former conclusion by attempting to pass this amendment. Amendment negatived Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 66 verbally amended and agreed to.

Clause 88 gives power to the Postma&ter-General to resume any telegraph or any telephonic lines that have been constructed by private persons in the event of their non-compliance with the regulations. I think that power should also be given to the Postmaster-General to resume any telegraphic or telephone lines at any time after due notice has been given. I therefore move That the following new clause be inserted to follow clause 88 :(1) The Postmaster-General may, after giving six months' notice, resumeany private telegraph or telephone line. (2) The compensation, if the amount cannot otherwise be agreed upon, shall be settled by arbitration. I would point out that in some States concessions have already been given to certain companies to run railways. Not only have they been allowed to construct telegraph lines for the successful management of those railways, but they have also been permitted to send public telegrams. It is just possible that upon some of the mining fields of Northern Queensland, one or two places like Charters Towers, with a population of 26,000 or 27,000 inhabitants, may spring up, in which case these concessions would become very valuable.

249,Mr Mcdonal D (Kennedy),"I desireSir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I think that the proposed amendment is a very reasonable one, although it will require some alteration so as to provide for the payment of compensation. Instances have arisen in Western Australia, where railways which were constructed by contract were not taken over by the Government t ill twelve or eighteen months after their completion, during which period the contractors were making very large sums of money. I think that, if a concession of this kind does prove' to be valuable, those who possess it should, when it is taken away from them, be paid reasonable compensation-sa y 10 per cent, above the cost of construction. amendment is that it ignores the conditions under which these telegraphic or telephonic lines were constructed, inasmuch as the agreements relating thereto contain conditions under which resumption can take place. It would be arbitrary to propose that the Postmaster-General should be able to ignore the express terms of an agreement in which the power, of resumption is given under certain conditions. Postmaster-General shall resume them. we should have to' take the responsibility of any use which the Postmaster-General might make of this power. I understand that some of these lines have been constructed under State Acts. Under those Acts there are certain powers of resumption. The Government has a certain amount of control over them tion with the Postal authorities I was informed that they favoured the amendment since it enlarges their powers, although they rather hesitate at the absolute form which it takes. They are perfectly prepared to accept the power of resumption, coupled with a recognition of -existing conditions. Except in that general way, I have not been informed upon the matter. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I would point out that the clause does not say that the Postmaster-General'shall take over these lines. I do not think that the Ministry would be foolish enough to authorize the Postmaster-General to take over certain lines contrary to existing agreements. It appears to me that power of resumption should be given, so as to provide for a contingency arising such as I have previously suggested. Sooner or later I believe that the Government will have to come down and deal with the State Acts, to which reference has been made. There are some places where these concessions have been given, which within a few years will have a very considerable population-probabl y 20,000 or"" 30,000 inhabitants. It is not right that any private company should have control of the telephonic or telegraphic communication in such centres. It is a fair thing that if the Government desire to resume such lines, say at 10 per cent, above the cost of construction, they should have the power to do so. MrM c C AY (Corinella) I think that we are all agreed that it is eminently proper that the Commonwealth should have power to resume these means of communication where that is deemed advisable in the public interest. The choice which the honourable member for Kennedy places before us is not between resumption and non-resumption, but between resumption as an executive act, of which Parliament may not be fully informed, and resumption as an act of the Commonwealth Legislature. As a representative of the people, I am very But , as a Parliament, loath to part with the control of Parliament in these matters. If the resumption is an executive act, Parliament will have the choice, not between approval or disapproval of it , but between approval of .it and the dismissal of the Ministry for making it , so that, instead of being able to deal directly with the question, we shall be able to deal with it only indirectly. A 50 years' concession of rights such as the honourable member for In a hurried consultaKennedy referred to is not a thing which I should have supported if I had been in the House in which it was proposed, but I think that Parliament should have all proposals for resumption definitely before it , and should not allow resumptions to be made without its sanction even by so trusted an Executive as that now in office. The honourable member for Kennedy has made a proposal which is novel, but I do not think that the objections which may be raised against it are sufficient for rejecting it.

Sir purposes. private profit, though, no doubt, the public interest is subserved, or otherwise the power would not be given. The honourable and learned member for Corinella objects to the power of resumption being given to the Executive instead of to Parliament,"" but if each resumption had to be authorized by special Act, it would be an exceptional and invidious procedure. What we want is a general rule. We are providing now for the regulation of the post and telegraph serstruction of a railway is contemplated the vices of the Commonwealth. Certain companies and individuals-especiall y in Queenland, where they have done some queer things-hav e been given special concessions. I understand that in some cases private companies have obtained concessions in regard to telegraphic and telephonic communication which extend over 50 years. It is not going too far, however, to say that tlie Postmaster-General may take over those lines on payment of reasonable compensation, if he thinks it necessary to do so in the public interest. It is our duty to recogParliament. The desire of the honourable nise contracts within resonable limits, even if they have been wrongly made, but it is not necessary for us to be pedantic in the matter, when there are precedents for compulsory resumption which go back for years. I think that the principle of the amendment should be embodied in the Bill, though I admit that it requires to be moulded into proper shape. Tbat can best be done by the Ministeri n charge of the Bill. rights and concessions which have already been granted, but where it is thought advisable to acquire private property for public purposes, it is the duty of the State to do so, paying at the same time a fair equivalent for it to the persons from whom it is taken. I do not think, however, that we are at present in a position to say what are the terms upon which this should be done under the Bill. The Commonwealth cannot resume a private telegraph or telephone line which never belonged to it. This is not a mere technical difficulty, it is a practical difficulty. One can -underable, and, therefore, this amendment or the stand the Postmaster-General saying to a private company-""You shall no longer have the control of your lines.

' The Commonwealth does not pay anything now for the right to erect telegraph poles in a private paddock. ment. We must be' more definite than the wording of the clause as drafted, and no final bargain should be made merely by executive act. It has been found in Victoria, and I have no doubt in other parts of Australia also, that when the convalue of the land through which it will pass is enormously increased. Therefore, I think it would be well, if we give power to the Postmaster-General to give notice of intention to take over a line, to provide that the compensation shall be based upon the value at the date of the giving of that notice, and that it shall be finally agreed upon before the matter is placed before Parliament; and that the Postmaster General should not be allowed to commit the Commonwealth without the sanction of member for Kennedy is a right one, but his amendment will require very careful drafting for the protection of the interests, not only of private companies, but also of the Commonwealth. Mr A. M c LEAN (Gippsland) I endorse the view that, where the interests of a private company or. a private individual may be found to clash with those of the general public, they must give way, but, at the same time, we should see that the private company or'private individual whose property is taken for public, purposes obtains fair compensation for it . No new principle is involved in the amendment. Every time that the State resumes land for a railway or any other public purpose itviolates an existing contract, but it does so in the interests of the public, and the individual suffers no loss, because he receives fair compensation. It appears to^ me that if we fail to insert any such provision as this in the Bill, rights may hereafter accrue.

It will not be possible to insert a new clause in another place, but a clause sent from here could be amended. Government are passing through another place a measure giving the widest powers to the Government, on behalf of the Commonwealth, for the acquisition of land and property of all kinds, with elaborate provisions for arbitration, cost, and other matters. the Land Acquisition B ill ? perty ; and the measure is drawn in the most general terms. From my recollection of the Bill as it entered the Chamber, I believe it provides amply for carrying out the intention of this clause. I am aware that it has been amended in some respects, but I have not undertaken to follow the discussions elsewhere. efficiency in this direction has been impaired by amendments, but I think not in any respect. If the principle of this clause, which is a familiar principle, is again endorsed in relation to telegraph and telephone lines, as the honourable member for , Kennedy desires; and if, when we again examine the Bill, which is about to be sent down to us, it is found not to cover tbe case, we can consider whether such a provision may not be more properly introduced . there than here. If it be not provided for there, it may be its well to leave it in this Bill. It is unnecessary to have a double discussion of the same principle. If the committee, as I understand they do, accept the principle, I will examine the Bill, and consider the best procedure. in now 1 13 u at the table, especially when the Bill is to leave us so soon and there are a number of other matters to be considered. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has followed the debate, and he must have noted several matters which need a good deal of consideration. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I have the Queensland Acts, and I find the Postmaster-General has amply protected himself, excepting in so far as purchase is concerned. The companies must take telegrams for one-third of the rates charged by the Postmaster-General, and-all telegrams on public service must be carried free. It is also provided that after 50 years-whic h I think in the case of telegraphs is wrong-ther e should be option As a matter of fact, the at any time on the part of tlie Government to purchase. done in the case of railways. Sir MALCOLM M c EACHARN I do not agree with the honourable member. In the case of a railway considerable risk has to be taken, and a railway may be worked for years without any profit. It would not be just for tlie Government .to have the option of coining in at any time, and taking the works over for one-tenth more than they cost. Under the Queensland Act the Postal department had the right to buy, after 50 years, under certain conditions, the purchase money to be not more, under any circumstances, than one and I cannot say whether its one-tenth of the actual cost of construction. The same principle will apply to the case of telegraphs. New clause agreed to. I move That the following new clause be added to the Bill"" Any electric authority which hereafter constructs any electric liue, or does any other work for the generation, use, or supply of electricity, so as to injuriously affect any telegraph line connecting a cable with a telegraph line or post office of the Postmaster-General, shall pay to the owner of the telegraph line so injured all expeuses reasonably incurred by such owner in making any alteration required for its protection.""

267,Mr Batchelor (South Australia.),"to a number of honourable members, who have made that intimation to me. Someof the main objections which were raised to the amendment submitted last night are removed altogether. For instance, objection was taken to the amendment that it altogether prohibited the construction of certain telegraph lines, whereas in the proposed new clause, there is no prohibition at all. The new clause simply provides that where there is injury to an existing telegraph line, the expense of protecting the line shall be borne by the authority who does the injury. wealth telegraph line ? connecting a cable with the Postmaster General's office. of a private company's privilege. was raised to the amendment that it gave priority over any State undertaking. That was not a very sound objection as it appeared to me, but, in any case, it does not apply to the new clause. The sole object I have in view is to protect the cable communication, and to do that in a way to which I am sure no one, who is not inclined to be prejudiced against a certain company, can take the slightest objection. The suggestion that the proposal is in favour of any particular company is quite ridiculous, the only object being to protect international cable communication. Sir MALCOL M McEACHARN (Melbourne) I last night opposed an amendment having tbe same object, because, to my mind, the amendment would have precluded tramway or electric light supply in various quarters. The proposed new clause simply provides that if a cable company have their communication with the Post-office established prior to any other electric authodevice to meet the case. We have consisrity crossing their line, tliat authority shall tently throughout the measure provided be responsible for putting their line upon the metallic return. is not the present law, and it certainly would not be the law under this Bil l as introduced. In the case of an electrical authority being there before tbe cable company are connected with the Post-office, the cable company would have to protect themselves against induction. That is a different proposal from the amendment submitted last night. It is only fair that a cable, on which we depend so much for getting our messages with as little delay as possible, should be protected where another electrical authority may come in and ruin the cable connection for a considerable period, unless the metallic return be adopted. oppose the amendment submitted last night, because it appeared to place a private company in a position of apparent superiority to a State-owned system. Neither a State, Injury to a Commonnor municipality in a State, which desired to establish electric trams or electric lighting in the neighbourhood of the junction between the cable and the Postmaster-General's office, should be placed investment. But I am now compelled to re-echo the remarks of the honourable member, for Melbourne. The proposed new clause is of a very different character from the amendmentof last night, and maybe regarded without apprehension. The connecting line can only be a short line, and no right is conferred on a private company which is not conferred throughout the Bil l upon the Postmaster-Generali n all cases in which his lines are affected by any more recently constructed work. As I had occasion, in discussing the general question, to point out last evening, this being a telegraph line, it cannot possibly injuriously affect any other line, seeing that it is constructed on the low-current system. But if by any possibility there should be on the shores of South Australia, where this cable will land, any electric trams or system of electric lighting, the utmost burden imposed on the new venture is to either pay the small cost of moving the telegraph line -whic h might be the cheaper course-o r adopting the metallic circuit, or some other that the last comer in matters electrical is to be responsible for putting the previously established system to any extra expense. That is not unreasonable, and is all that is proposed. The new clause gives neither the Eastern Extension Company nor tlie Pacific Cable Company any new rights or privileges, but simply puts this position-that a new company may be put to the expense of rendering their system impervious against leakage or induction from the more powerf u l systems used for tramways or electric",43,Malcolm Mceachabn For Public It

Under the circumstances, I think the proposal is not an unreasonable one. opposed an amendment to the same intent, proposed by the honourable member for South Australia, Sir Langdon Bonython. Apparently the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, has modified the proposal then made; but has the Attorney General considered the effect in tlie near future of the Eastern Extension Company opening offices in New South Wales? Under these circumstances, it will be not only a line connecting the cable with the Post-office, but a distinct line altogether, running a considerable distance to the company's own offices. If that point be explained satisfactorily, I may be able to vote for the amendment. The Eastern Extension Cable Company have power in most of the States to open their own offices, and they will have their own lines-whic h are not limited as to lengthconnected with the cable end, placed under the same protection as the State lines under the control of the Postmaster-General. honourable member for Dalley is a very important one, and I should like to know whether the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, could give any idea as to the length of the line that would be required to be protected. It is intended that these lines should extend only from the shore end of a cable to the post office at which the connection is made, or to a line under the control of the Postmaster General. In the case of Port Darwin the honourable member for South Australia, Mr the amendment, although not so direct and V . L . Solomon, would probably be able to inform us of the distance. MrV . L . SOLOMON fine between the cable and the land lines at Port Darwin extends only a few hundred yards. Pacific cable 1 believe the connecting line will extend for some few miles, and in connection with tlie Cape cable there will be about six miles of line, extending from the Grange along the Henley Beach road to the Adelaide Post-office.

And there should be a distinct limit as to the length of line, when we accord the company's lines protection equal to that granted to the State-owned lines. words have been used in this amendment, it is precisely the same as tliat upon which we voted last night. Either the ordinary law permits what I may call the second electrical authority to do tlie acts contemplated or it does not. If the law permits it to do that act we should not take that right away, because we should take a right away from somebody by imposing obligations for the benefit of any private authority. We have no right to show preferences to any private individual. If the law does not permit that second The point raised by the electrical authority to do the work then the ordinary law can stop them or make them pay the penalty if they act contrary to the law, but why we in this, which is a paramount act, should override the existing rights of all other companies for the sake of one company is more than I can understand, and I say that we should be grossly inconsistent if we, by supporting this amendment, were to reverse the vote which we gave last night. reason will prevail in this matter, and that clear as that submitted last night, will be carried. The lines contemplated in the The connecting amendment form tlie connecting links between us and the outside world, and the private considerations involved are as nothing compared with those which affect In the case of the the whole community.

I have no objection to tliat company, but I have just the same regard for any potential company which may come into existence for the .purpose of carrying out any tramway or electric lighting scheme, and for the State tramways and the municipal electric lighting schemes. Each and every one of these authorities have to take their chance under present, circumstances, and if they clash with one another under the law of the Statei n which they are operating, why should we single out any one for specially considerate treatment? Tlie main objections which were urged against the amendment in its original form have not been removed, and I shall certainly oppose it in its present shape. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I voted against the amendment that was proposed last night to achieve the same object as the honourable member for South Australia now has in view, and although I sympathize with the honourable member I have heard no reasons urged that would justify me in reversing the vote I gave last night. If the Bill proposed to take away any of the rights now enjoyed by the cable companies, it would be right and proper to insert some such provision to protect them against any possible injuries, but it is not proposed to subject them to any risks that they do not incur at the present time, and I see no reason why we should go out of our way especially to provide for the protection of certain companies when we refuse to give the same consideration to the States or to any other companies. If we went so far as to do this, in order to be consistent and fair, we should provide tliat when any electrical authority has constructed a work it should be entitled to compensation from any authority who might interfere with and injure that work. It is not, however, proposed to go so far as that, and therefore I think we should pause before agreeing to the amendment now proposed. Mr G. B.

We do not know how far the interests of the various States might be prejudiced by such a provision as that now suggested, and I hope the committee will not waste any further time over this matter, but decide to reject the amendment once and for all. MrO ' MALLEY (.Tasmania) Last night the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, moved an amendment and I had to vote against him. It seems to me that we have now before us in this amendment the same dear sister that was with us last night; the only difference being that whilst she appeared in her_ ballroom dress on a former occasion, she is now before us in her bathing costume. that I should call the attention of tilecommittee to the fact that this is not as somehonorable members have put it , an instance of giving to a private company certain rights that we are refusing to the States. None of the States can own telegraph or telephone lines, and no private corporation can be affected except the Eastern Extension Company, the Pacific Cable Company-if that can be considered a private corporation-o r any other cable company that may construet a cable and land it on our shores. It is only in these instances tliat we can have connexions made between cable ends and tlie lines of the Postmaster General. It cannot be said that we are granting to a private company what we arerefusing to a State, because these cablecompanies furnish exceptional instances of which there can never be more than two or three in Australia. The question as. to State rights cannot very well arise. These connexions must be very few and very short. Although the States cannot construct telegraph or telephonelines, they can authorize the carrying out of certain forms of electrical enterprise, but as. has often been pointed out, these enterprisesmust always take the form of using electricity at a higher power than it is used in connection with telegraph or telephone lines.
