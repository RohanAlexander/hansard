Sailors with Disabilities was started with the objective of creating opportunities for many young people that would not otherwise have been available to them. In 1993, the seed was planted to put together a disabled crew to sail the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race and that goal was achieved the following year. ThisI think everyone will agree is an incredible achievement but the ability of the crew was highlighted further in the tragic Sydney to Hobart race of 1998, the race that experienced the fiercest storms ever. They crossed the line in ninth position and took first place in their class, which was truly remarkable considering that most of the fleet did not even finish the race. Like many organisations the success of Sailors with Disabilities has only been achieved thanks to the generosity of sponsors like Lyons Yacht Designs, Club Marine and KAZ Group, to name but a few. The success of many groups such as this can be measured by the adversity that people overcome and what they do and have done in life. Previous crew for Sailors with Disabilities include John McLean, who, among other things, has competed in the Hawaiian iron man competition, swum the English Channel and competed at the Sydney 2000 Paralympics, and Vinny Lauwers, a paraplegic who has successfully sailed around the world non-stop and single-handed. This crew has achieved remarkable success. I commend them on their record-breaking voyage. I wish them well in their future The following answers to questions were circulated: Productivity Commission: Third Party Access Review (Question No. 537) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 June 2002: (1) How long has his Department and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had access to the Productivity Commission’s review of the national third party access regime?

196,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Under s.8 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the ABC Board has a duty to develop codes of practice in relation to radio, television and, if appropriate, datacasting services, and notify those codes to the ABA. Both the ABC’s Codes of Practice and its Editorial Guidelines address radio and television services. The ABC has advised that it has also developed Editorial Guidelines for its online activities. (3) The powers of the ABA are identified in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, and its powers in relation to online content are identified in Schedule 5. ABC online services are subject to the requirements of Schedule 5. The ABA may also investigate complaints in relation to breaches of the ABC or SBS’s codes of practice under ss. 150-153 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. However, the ABA may only investigate possible breaches in relation to radio, television and datacasting srvices. The national broadcasters’ online activities are not addressed in ss. 150-153. (4) See part (3). (5) Under the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the ABC is independent of the Government. (6) See part (2) and part (5). Roads: Eastern Freeway (Question No. 1806) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 May 2003: (1) Does the Government support linking the extension of the Eastern Freeway to Ringwood with the Scoresby Freeway project; if so, why; if not, why not. (2) Was the Government consulted about the Bill before the Victorian Parliament to establish the Southern and Eastern Integrated Transport Authority; if so, (a) what was the nature of that consultation, (b) when did it occur, and (c) what will be the Federal Government’s involvement in the Authority. (3) Is the Federal Government represented on the proposed Authority; if so, in what capacity and by whom; if not, why not. (4) In respect of the Scoresby Freeway: (a) how much money has the Federal Government committed in total, (b) how much money has been committed annually over which years, and (c) is the total amount capped; if so, at what level; if not, what is the approval mechanism for additional funds. (5) Did the linking of the Eastern Freeway to Ringwood with the Scoresby Freeway project incur, or does it have the potential to incur, additional costs for the Federal Government commitment to road funding in Victoria; if so, what are the details; if not, how is the Federal Government sure that this is the case. (6) In respect of the Scoresby Freeway: (a) when is the construction scheduled to commence, (b) what is the expected date of completion of the project, and (c) has the Government been advised of any revised cost estimates for the project by the Victorian Government; if so, (i) when were they advised, (ii) what are the new estimates, and (iii) in which years and/or stage of construction are those additional monies required. (7) Is the Government represented on the Mitcham-Frankston (Scoresby Freeway and Eastern Freeway Extension) Community Advisory Group; if so, in what capacity and by whom; if not, why not. (8) Does the Group have the right to make recommendations on the associated public transport aspects of the project.",115,Questions On Notice
197,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(9) What is the Victorian Government budget commitment to the Scoresby Freeway project and how has linking that project with the Eastern Freeway Extension impacted on that commitment. (10) What process or protections are in place to ensure that the Federal Government does not become liable for additional expenses associated with the Eastern Freeway Extension now that the projects have been joined. (1) Delivery of the Eastern Freeway Extension to Ringwood is outside the scope of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Commonwealth and Victoria for funding of the Scoresby Freeway. The Commonwealth’s support was neither required under the MoU, nor sought by the Victorian Government. (2) (a), (b) and (c) The Commonwealth has been consulted. The nature of this consultation included briefings and a copy of the Bill and this consultation took place last year. The Commonwealth has no involvement in the authority. (3) No, as it is not appropriate. (4) The Commonwealth has committed $445 million towards the project, with $23.473 million provided up to 30 March 2003. The balance of $421.523 million is allocated over the years 2003 to 2008, with $63.3 million in 2003/04, $63 million in 2004/05, $50 million in 2005/06, $87.5 million in 2006/07, and a further $155.9 million thereafter. This is conditional on Victoria complying with the conditions of the MoU. The basis for Commonwealth funding for this project is set out in the MoU. If the Victoria Government wishes to seek additional funding for the Scoresby Freeway project, it would need to make a formal application to the Commonwealth and this would be assessed in terms of the MoU. (5) (a), (b) and (c) A media release by the Victorian Government at the time of the decision to combine the two projects stated that costs for the combined project would be reduced by $180 million. The Commonwealth has sought details of this saving but has not received them to date. (6) (a), (b), and (c) The Victorian government has advised that construction should start in 2004 and be completed by 2008. Revised cost estimates have been provided by the Victoria Government to the Commonwealth, however, releasing these estimates prior to the completion of the bidding process would undermine and compromise that bidding process. The cost estimates are commercially sensitive and used to assess bids and it is not normal practice to release such information during a bidding process involving private sector financing. Victoria has not formally sought additional funds from the Commonwealth. (7) The Victorian Government has not yet finalised membership of the advisory group. (8) The advisory group’s procedures will be a matter for the Victorian Government to decide. (9) The Victorian Government has stated that under the current toll-road proposal it expects to spend $100 million out of a total of $200 million in pre-construction costs between now and the projects opening in 2008. The Victorian Government has not advised how this $100m is split between the Scoresby Freeway and the Eastern Freeway Extension. The issue about impacts on the Victorian Government budget commitment from the linking of the Scoresby Freeway with the Eastern Freeway Extension is a matter for the Victorian Government. (10) The MoU is the basis for the Commonwealth contribution to the project. If the Victoria Government wishes to seek additional funding for the Scoresby Freeway project, it would need to make a formal application to the Commonwealth and this would be assessed in terms of the MoU.",116,Questions On Notice
198,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Immigration: Special Purpose Visa (Question No. 1808) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 2003: (1) In respect of the Minister’s powers under subparagraph 33(2)(b)(ii) of the Migration Act to establish a new type of Special Purpose Visa (SPV) category for crews on vessels and the stipulation that a SPV will only be taken to be held where the Single Voyage Permit (SVP) or Continuous Voyage Permit (CVP) was granted in circumstances where “the vessel is an international vessel engaged in a pattern of business that takes it outside Australia on a regular basis”, which Department is going to monitor that the vessel goes to a place outside Australia and how will it do so. (2) Is the definition of “regular basis” weekly, monthly or some other period of time, and which Department will monitor that the vessel is not breaching the conditions. (3) What is the definition of a place outside Australia and which ports would be considered outside Australian waters. (4) In respect of the requirement that, at the end of a three month period, the ship and crew are required to leave Australian waters to a place outside Australia: (a) what is the time period for Special Purpose Visas to be re-issued, (b) what measures are in place to satisfy DIMIA that the crew members, during the course of the voyage, have gone to a place outside Australia before they are issued with another Special Purpose Visa, and (c) how will this Department monitor cases where crew on Special Purpose Visas on Continuous Voyage Permits are working beyond the three months limit. (5) Can he confirm that Special Purpose Visas have not been, or are not being issued beyond the three month period, and how will they be monitored and implemented in conjunction with the Department of Transport and Regional Services. (6) What are the fines and penalties, if any, if crew members breach the three month visa condition. (1) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) works with the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) and the Australian Customs Service (Customs) to monitor the operation of these arrangements. DOTARS provides Customs with information about ships that are issued a Continuous Voyage Permit (CVP) or Single Voyage Permit (SVP) for coastal trading. Customs then monitors the vessel’s movements in Australia and records when the vessel indicates that it intends to depart to a place outside of Australia. (2) The Migration Act 1958 does not define ‘regular basis’. DOTARS requires all vessels that hold a CVP or SVP for coastal trading to depart Australia before a further permit will be issued. Such vessels are therefore required to depart Australia at least once every three months. Customs then monitors the vessel’s movements in Australia and records when the vessel indicates that it intends to depart to a place outside of Australia. (3) ‘Outside Australia’ is defined in regulation 1.03 to mean ‘outside the migration zone’ but is not defined in the Migration Act 1958. In agreeing to sign a Ministerial Instrument under s33 of the Act, to grant SPV coverage to foreign crews, a condition of my signing was that the ships be involved in international travel, which involves visiting a port in another country. For the purposes of the Ministerial Instrument, ports in other countries are ports outside Australian waters. (4) (a) Once a vessel meets the requirements listed in my Instrument of Declaration, the crew is taken to hold Special Purpose Visas (SPV’s) by operation of law. No time periods are set.",117,Questions On Notice
199,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(b) Under my Instrument of Declaration, a crewmember’s visa status is linked to the grant of a CVP or SVP of up to 3 months duration. As DOTARS will not issue further CVPs or SVPs to vessels unless they first depart Australia, the crew of such vessels cannot be taken to hold further SPVs until this condition is met. Customs monitors the arrival and departure of vessels in Australia. (c) Customs monitors a vessel’s movements in Australia and alerts DIMIA if a vessel breaches the three-month condition. (5) SPVs are not ‘issued’ with a time limit. Rather, a person holds an SPV by virtue of their status. Under my Instrument of Declaration, a crewmember’s visa status is linked to the grant of a CVP or SVP of up to 3 months duration. As such, an SPV cannot be issued beyond the three-month period. trading. Customs then monitors the vessel’s movements and alerts DIMIA if a vessel breaches the three-month condition. (6) Crewmembers who remain in Australia beyond the period allowed for by their SPV, and who do not hold another valid visa, are unlawful non-citizens and liable for detention and removal. Telstra: Mount Macedon Facility (Question No. 1812) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 13 May 2002: (1) Is the Minister aware that construction of a CDMA Tower at the Emergency Management Australia (EMA) site in Mt Macedon commenced without any community consultation; if so, when did the Minister first become aware that the tower was being built. (2) Is the Minister aware of the considerable community disquiet regarding the building of this tower. (3) What steps will the Minister be taking to ensure that the community of Mt Macedon and every other community in Australia are properly consulted before the building of such towers. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, I am advised by Telstra that construction of the facility at Mount Macedon commenced on 3 March 2003. Telstra has also advised that a planning application for their initial preference for a facility at their telephone exchange in Honour Avenue, Macedon, was lodged with the Macedon Ranges Shire Council in late April 2002. The Council opposed the application, and the EMA site was identified following a subsequent meeting between the Council and Telstra which examined other options. On 17 November 2002, SJB Planning, on behalf of Telstra’s Mobile Network Services (MNS) Division, wrote to the Macedon Ranges Shire Council regarding the requirement for a planning permit for the EMA site. The Council responded on 15 January 2003 with a letter advising that the site is exempt from Victorian State Government planning scheme controls under the Macedon Ranges Planning Scheme as it is located on Commonwealth Crown land. This exemption is a matter for the Victorian State Government. Accordingly, Telstra commenced preliminary work on the site, ceasing when they became aware of community opposition. I first became aware that the installation of a mobile phone facility was proceeding at the EMA site at Mt Macedon on or about 19 March 2003. (2) I am aware of community concern regarding the building of this tower. Telstra has advised, however, that it has been formally approached by a group of local business people that support improved mobile phone coverage in the area.",118,Questions On Notice
200,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsI also note the efforts of Telstra to consult with interested parties. Telstra advises that it has met with community representatives on 18 March, 25 March, 1 April and 19 April, as well as with local business representatives, Council representatives and local Federal Members of Parliament. Such consultations remain ongoing, in an effort to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome. (3) The Government is aware of community concerns regarding the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure, and legislated to remove many of the immunities carriers previously enjoyed in relation to State and Territory planning and environmental laws, thus providing for the approval of most infrastructure to be dealt with by relevant State and Territory authorities, usually at the local level. The proposed site for the tower in Mount Macedon is located on Commonwealth Crown land at the Emergency Management Institute. The Victorian State Government has decided to exempt Commonwealth Crown land from its local government planning scheme, thereby meaning that the site is not covered by the provisions of Macedon Ranges Planning Scheme. These planning controls and this exemption are matters for the Victorian State Government. When community opposition to the Mount Macedon facility became apparent, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts conveyed to Telstra that a less contentious site would be preferable. Telstra advises that it has subsequently conducted a series of ongoing consultations with community representatives, local business representatives, Council representatives and local Federal Members of Parliament, in an effort to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome. In a limited number of circumstances carriers have immunity from State and Territory laws and can install telecommunications facilities under Commonwealth law. One of the main such instances relates to the installation of facilities which have been identified as ‘low-impact’ in the Telecommunications (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination 1997 (the Determination) and its Amendment No. 1 of 1999. Low-impact facilities are those that are considered essential to maintaining telecommunications networks, but are of low visual impact and unlikely to cause significant disruption to the community during installation or operation. They include some radio communications facilities, underground and above-ground housing, underground cables, public payphones, emergency and co-located facilities. By exempting such facilities from local planning approvals, the Government has been successfully encouraging carriers to roll out networks using components that fall within strict type, size, colour and location limitations, thereby minimising the impact of telecommunications infrastructure on the community generally. If practicable, carriers must also co-locate new low-impact infrastructure with existing facilities and coordinate installation with other planned telecommunications or other infrastructure, in order to minimise disruption to individuals and the community. Carriers seeking to install low-impact facilities are required to comply with the rules of conduct set out in Schedule3 to the Act and in the Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997 (the Code). These rules respond to the broader community concerns regarding the environment and heritage areas, and give some limited rights to landholders. Affected landowners and occupiers can make a written objection to a carrier regarding a proposed low-impact activity. If, after consultation, agreement cannot be reached, objectors can request that carriers refer unresolved objections to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO). The TIO provides a free service to people who have been unable to resolve a complaint directly with their telecommunications service provider or a carrier. In addition to the regulatory framework governing the installation of infrastructure, there are a number of initiatives addressing radio communications issues that have been undertaken by the telecommunications industry. The Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) has developed an Industry Code for the Deployment of Radio communications Infrastructure (the Industry Code), including mobile phone network facilities. The Industry Code augments the Telecommunications (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination 1997 and the Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997. The Industry Code specifies a ‘precautionary approach’ for the building and operation of radiobased telecommunications equipment. Site specific obligations on carriers include having regard to minimising electromagnetic energy emissions exposure to the public, and the objective of avoiding community-sensitive locations. Examples of community-sensitive locations include residential areas, childcare centres, schools, aged care centres, hospitals and regional icons. The Industry Code also provides for a significant expansion of consultative practices required by carriers with affected community members. In the first instance, carriers are required to notify Councils and affected parties of the consultation process, and resolve any issues of concern by direct negotiation. Complaints concerning carrier performance of mandatory obligations may be lodged through a complaint mechanism allowed for in the Industry Code, and the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) can investigate breaches by carriers. This will allow local Councils and communities to have greater participation in the activities of telecommunications carriers when they plan, install and operate telecommunications facilities. The Industry Code was registered by the ACA on 10 October 2002. However, as it introduced substantial changes in the procedures which carriers are required to undertake, it was implemented in two stages, becoming fully operational on 10 April 2003. Communications: Mobile Phone Facility (Question No. 1825) mation Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 13 May 2003: (1) Is the Minister aware of a recent decision by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal which allowed a telecommunications company to install a mobile phone facility on the roof of a Melbourne apartment building without the owner’s permission. (2) Has his Department obtained advice in respect of the decision; if so, what effect does the decision have on the right of building owners to object to the construction of such facilities on their premises. (3) Does the Government intend to legislate in response to the decision. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, I am aware of a ruling by the Victorian Civil Administration Tribunal (VCAT), handed down on 24 March 2003, in relation to a mobile telephone facility that was constructed by Hutchison Telecoms atop a 12 storey apartment building, owned by the Victorian Department of Human Services, at 150 Inkerman Street, St Kilda. Hutchison has advised that VCAT ruled that the facility qualified as a low-impact facility under current Commonwealth legislation. Hutchison Telecoms has further advised that the Victorian Department of Human Services has subsequently initiated proceedings in the Victorian Supreme Court to appeal the VCAT decision. It is not appropriate that I comment further about a matter before a court of law.",119,Questions On Notice

202,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(2) The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has not sought advice in respect of the VCAT decision, which is consistent with the Government’s policies and legislation. (3) The Government has no plans to legislate in response to this decision the Government appreciates that the community has concerns regarding the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure, and believes that it is important for community interests to be taken into account while meeting the broader national need for modern and efficient telecommunications networks. Prior to 1997, telecommunications carriers were exempt from all State and Territory regulations and planning requirements and were able to freely site telecommunications facilities. To address community concerns regarding the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure, the Government enacted the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Act), which removed many of the immunities that carriers previously enjoyed in relation to State and Territory planning and environmental laws. The Act now provides for the approval of most telecommunications facilities, such as broadband overhead cable and the majority of mobile telecommunications towers, to be dealt with by relevant State and Territory authorities, usually at the local level. In a limited number of circumstances carriers retain immunity from State and Territory laws and can install telecommunications facilities under Commonwealth law. One of the main such instances relates to the installation of facilities which have been identified as ‘low-impact’ in the Telecommunications (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination 1997 (the Determination) and its Amendment No. 1 of 1999.

These rules respond to the broader community concerns regarding the environment and heritage areas, and give some limited rights to landholders. In particular, the Code requires that carriers provide adequate prior notification to land owners and occupiers, including the local Council (where the Council is the manager of public land), of their intention to inspect land and to install facilities, cause as little damage as practicable, and restore land on completion of the work. The notice must state that compensation may be payable if a landowner or occupier suffers financial loss of damage because of anything done by the carrier, and it must also explain the arrangements for making objections to the carrier’s low-impact activity. Affected landowners and occupiers can make a written objection to a carrier regarding a proposed low-impact activity. If, after consultation, agreement cannot be reached, objectors can request that carriers refer unresolved objections to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO). The TIO provides a free service to people who have been unable to resolve a complaint directly with their telecommunications service provider or a carrier. Compliance with the Act and the Code are standard carrier licence conditions. If a carrier has not met the requirements of the Act or the Code, a complainant may raise the issue with the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) which regulates the Australian telecommunications industry. In addition to the regulatory framework governing the installation of infrastructure, there are a number of initiatives addressing radiocommunications issues that have been undertaken by telecommunications industry. The Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) has developed an Industry Code for the Deployment of Radiocommunications Infrastructure (the Industry Code), including mobile phone network facilities.

Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1857) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 May 2003: (1) In respect of the following events: implementation of the Precision Runway Monitoring System; sale of Sydney Airport before Sydney Airport’s aircraft noise problems have been solved; and failure to adopt and implement any of the eight recommendations of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee’s Report on the Inquiry into the Development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan, June 2000, how does the action or inaction of himself, his Ministry, his Department and Air Services Australia benefit (a) QANTAS, (b) the Airport Lessee Companies, and (c) the Tourism Industry. (2) How do these decisions adversely impact the environment or otherwise trammel the public interest. (1) The implementation of the Precision Runway Monitoring System (PRM) benefits Qantas as the principal airline using Sydney Airport, the airport lessee company, and the tourism industry as it allows the airport to be operated more efficiently in adverse weather conditions. It is anticipated that the sale of the airport into private ownership and operation will bring the efficiency gains expected from the Government’s program of privatisation of airports to the airport company, the airlines, and the tourism industry. The Government tabled its response to the recommendations of the Senate Inquiry into the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan in the Senate on 16 May 2002. The Government’s current review of the Airports Act 1996 will also take into account its response to the Senate Inquiry. (2) The events identified in (1) are not expected to adversely impact on the environment. Recommendations for environmental safeguards in the public interest that arose from the extensive environmental assessment undertaken by Environment Australia into the introduction of the PRM have all been implemented. In addition, the airport lessee company is obliged to take account of the public interest and the environmental impacts of its operations under its obligations in the Airports Act 1996. The Government’s decision in relation to the Senate Inquiry is outlined above in answer to question (1).

(2) In respect of each such appointment: (a) what is/was the person’s name and the position or positions to which he or she was appointed, (b) which political party did the person previously represent during his or her period of parliamentary representation, (c) is that person entitled to a parliamentary pension and was that pension to which the person was entitled reduced as a result of the appointment, (d) what is the itemised nature of the remuneration package including superannuation that is payable as a result of the appointment, (e) is/was the appointment full-time, part-time or casual, (f) what allowances are applicable for travel, vehicles, telephones, use of Internet services and attendance; and (g) what is the total amount paid under each entitlement. I am advised by my department that the information sought by the honourable member is not held centrally, and is thus not readily available. The work required to answer the honourable member’s questions would involve a significant diversion of resources within each department and I am not prepared to authorise the use of those resources. The honourable member may wish to note that the annual reports of departments, agencies and statutory authorities, or their websites, will normally contain the names of appointees. A list of all consultancy contracts let to the value of $10,000 or more, including the name of the consultant is also required to be available in annual reports. This information might enable the honourable member to narrow the scope of his questions. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1934) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 2003: (1) Why has Australia established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Iranian Government that provides for the involuntary repatriation of Iranian asylum seekers in Australia. (2) Why has he refused to make details of this MOU available to the Parliament and to the public. (3) Has the Australian Government taken any action to ensure the safety of Iranians returning to Iran; if so, what action has been taken; if not, why not. (1) The MOU on Consular Matters was established to ensure that those nationals of either Australia or Iran, who have no lawful basis to remain in the other country, can be returned to their country of nationality as soon as practicable.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Revenue (Question No. 1944) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 28 May 2003: (1) Did he read the editorial titled “What does the ABC think it is doing” that appeared on page 10 of the Australian on 22 May 2003. (2) Did he read the reply to that editorial by the Managing-Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr Russell Balding, titled “No evidence for Bizarre ABC claims” published on page 16 of the Weekend Australian on 24-25 May 2003. (3) Will he rule out introducing a Bill to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act that would permit the public broadcaster to raise revenue through commercial advertising; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The Government has no plans to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 at this time. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding (Question No. 1945) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 28 May 2003: (1) Is he aware that staff of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) told a Senate Estimates Committee on 26 May 2003 that the ABC was axing its two digital multi-channels, Fly TV and ABC Kids. (2) Why will the government not provide the extra $250M for the ABC as requested by its Managing Director. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) The ABC’s funding request for 2003-06 was considered in the 2003-04 Budget process. In accordance with its election commitment, the Government’s 2003-04 Budget has maintained the ABC’s triennial funding in real terms. In 2003-04, the ABC will receive a total appropriation of $742.6 million. This total funding includes the additional programming funding of $71.2 million over four years provided in the 2001-02 Budget, the first such additional programming funding that the ABC had received in 16 years. It also includes the significant and ongoing funding provided to the ABC by the Government for digital broadcasting. Since 1998-99, the Government has provided $57.6m in equity injections for the ABC’s digitisation process. The Commonwealth is also fully funding the cost of the ABC’s digital transmission services, a commitment of over $600m over ten years.",125,Questions On Notice

209,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsDespite this, the ABC has taken a decision to cease its multichannel services, ABC Kids and Fly. These services together cost approximately $7m, or less than 1% of the ABC’s total appropriation. In the Government’s view, the cessation of these services without consideration of other options reflects the lower priority the ABC now accords digital services, despite the significant funding provided to the ABC by the Government for its transition to digital broadcasting. It is important to note that the ABC’s decision to commence the multichannel services was one that was made by the ABC totally of its own volition, without consulting the Federal Government. The ABC neither sought nor received any assurances from the Federal Government about ongoing funding for the multichannels prior to taking the decision to commence them. Arts: Computer Games Classification (Question No. Question Nos 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970) Mr Danby asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 29 May 2003: (1) Which organisation is responsible for the classification of computer games. (2) Do all computer games need to be submitted for classification before being sold; if so, (a) what is the process for classifying computer games, (b) what is the penalty for selling computer games which have not been classified, and (c) on what basis is the classification made, in particular, are the (i) ideology, (ii) values, and (iii) concept of the game relevant. (3) Is the Minister aware of a game called “Special Force” created by Hezbollah in Lebanon; if so, is he also aware that the game, (a) has an introduction including an exploding Israeli tank, (b) shows rows and rows of burning Israeli flags, (c) awards points for executing the Israeli Prime Minister, (d) includes parts based on actual attacks of Israeli positions, and (e) includes parts that, (i) say “You must oppose, confront and destroy the machines of the Zionist enemy”, and (ii) show “the defeat of the Israeli enemy and the heroic actions taken by the heroes of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon”. (4) Is the Minister able to confirm or deny reports in The New York Times of 18 May 2003 that copies of this game have been sold in Australia. (5) Has the game been submitted for classification; if so, (a) when, (b) did it receive a classification which permits its sale and distribution in Australia; if so, (i) why, and (ii) will the Minister request a review of its classification, and (c) if it was not classified, (iii) why not, (iv) what action has been taken against people who have imported, manufactured, distributed, sold or bought the game, and (v) if no action has been taken, why not and will the Minister order action to be taken. (6) Are there similar games on the market, if so, what are they and what classifications have they received. (1) The Commonwealth Classification Board (the Board) is responsible for the classification of computer games. The Board is an independent statutory body, supported by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC). The Board is selected to be broadly representative, as far as possible, of the Australian community. (2) Computer games must be classified before they can be legally sold, hired, advertised or publicly demonstrated in Australia. (a) The process for classifying computer games is prescribed in the Commonwealth Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (the Act). On application, the Board classifies computer games in accordance with the requirements of the Act, the principles set out in the National Classification Code (a schedule to the Act) and the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games (the Combined Guidelines).",126,Questions On Notice
210,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(b) There are penalties for selling unclassified computer games, which are set out under State and Territory classification enforcement legislation. It is an offence to sell unclassified computer games in all States and Territories. The maximum penalty for selling an unclassified computer game in each jurisdiction is as follows: Jurisdiction Maximum penalty for selling an unclassified computer game Northern Territory $10,000 or 2 years imprisonment Australian Capital 100 penalty units ($10,000), 1 year imprisonment or both Territory Tasmania Fine not exceeding 100 penalty units ($10,000) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or both Western Australia In the case of an individual, $10, 000 or imprisonment for 1 year In any other case, $50 000 South Australia $5 000 Queensland 5 penalty units ($375) for a computer game that, if it were classified, would be classified as a G, G(8+) or M(15+) computer game; or 10 penalty units ($750)for a computer game that, if it were classified, would be classified as an MA(15+) computer game; or 150 penalty units ($11250) for a computer game that has been, or would have been, classified RC. Victoria 240 penalty units ($24,000) or 2 years imprisonment New South Wales in the case of an unclassified computer game that is subsequently classified G, G(8+) or M(15+)-10 penalty units ($1100) for an individual, 20 penalty units ($2200) for a corporation in the case of an unclassified computer game that is subsequently classified MA(15+)-20 penalty units ($2200) for an individual, 50 penalty units ($5500) for a corporation in the case of a computer game classified RC or an unclassified computer game that is subsequently classified RC-100 ($11000) penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months for an individual, 250 penalty units ($27500)for a corporation. (c) The Board classifies computer games in accordance with criteria outlined in the Act, the National Classification Code and the Combined Guidelines. Computer games may be classified G, G8+, M15+ or MA15+. Games that exceed the MA15+ classification are Refused Classification (RC). There is no R18+ classification category for computer games. In relation to the specific question of whether the ideology, values or concept of the game are relevant to a classification decision, these terms are not specifically used in the Act, the Code or the Combined Guidelines. The Code does, however, require the Board, when making classification decisions, to take into account the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults. For example, the Code provides that computer games that depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of, among other things, crime, cruelty or violence in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified, are to be classified RC. The Code also states that computer games that promote, incite or instruct in matters of crime or violence are to be classified RC. (3) I am aware of reports in an article in The New York Times of 18 May 2003 (the article) of a game called Special Force. I am also aware that the article alleges that the game was created by “Hezbollah” and contains the depictions referred to by Mr Danby in his question. (4) I am aware of the reports in the article that copies of this game have been sold in Australia. I am unable to confirm or deny those reports. (5) I am advised that the Classification Board has no record of a computer game called Special Force being submitted for classification. (a) Not applicable. (b) (i) and (ii) Not applicable. (c) (iii) The game has not been classified because it has not been submitted for classification. The Classification Board classifies computer games on application. (iv) and (v) I have asked for this matter to be referred to Community Liaison Scheme (CLS) staff at the OFLC for investigation and appropriate action. The CLS is a joint Commonwealth, State and Territory initiative with national coverage. CLS staff fulfil an educative role assisting retailers and distributors of publications, films and computer games to comply with their legal obligations under the national classification scheme and to identify breaches of classification laws. Should the CLS investigation reveal that Special Force is being sold in Australia, I have asked that the matter be referred back to the Director of the Classification Board for consideration in relation to exercising his powers to call in a product for classification. (6) Without knowing specific details of the content of Special Force, it is not possible to nominate with any certainty other similar games on market. I note that the article in The New York Times of 18 May 2003 refers to another computer game called Counterstrike. I am advised that the OFLC has no record of a game with that exact title. I am advised that the OFLC website at www.oflc.gov.au contains a classification database listing computer game classification decisions and that interested persons can search this database according to criteria such as title and classification. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1975) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs upon notice, on 2 June 2003: (1) Was an asylum seeker, Mr Sayed Husseini, removed from Christmas Island to Nauru on or about 18 March 2003; if so (a) on which exact date and (b) was he given prior notice, if not, why not. (2) Was he removed at around 3 a.m.; if so, (a) why was he removed from Christmas Island at that time of day, (b) who made the decision on the time of removal, (c) to whom does that person report, and (d) what was the process for approving the removal. (3) Are the officials who ordered Mr Sayed Husseini’s removal aware of the Summary Conclusions on the Concept of “Effective Protection” in the context of Secondary Movements of Refugees and Asylum-Seekers of the Expert Roundtable held in Lisbon in December 2002 which was organised by the UN High Commission for Refugees and US based Migration Policy Institute; if not, why not. (4) Were steps taken to ensure the removals of Mr Sayed Husseini and others from Christmas Island to Nauru were consistent with each of the key factors identified in the aforementioned document; if so, in what way were they. (5) Was Mr Sayed Husseini (a) prohibited from saying goodbye to friends he had made on Christmas Island; if so, why, and (b) was he allowed to visit his wife’s grave on Christmas Island before his removal; if not, why not. (6) Will he provide copies of all documents relating to the removal of Mr Sayed Husseini from Christmas Island to Nauru; if not, why not. (7) Will he provide a detailed breakdown of all the costs associated with moving Mr Sayed Husseini from Christmas Island to Nauru, including the staff and air transport costs involved. (8) As Nauru is not party to the Refugee Convention, did the Australian Government seek and obtain specific assurances from Nauru before the transfer from Christmas Island to Nauru, that Mr Sayed Husseini would not be refouled by Nauru to any country in which he would be at risk of persecution, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; if Australia did seek such an assurance, what are the details of that assurance; if not, why not. (9) Has it been determined whether Mr Sayed Husseini is to be returned to Afghanistan; if so, what is that determination, and under what conditions will his return be carried out. (10) Has any asylum seeker transferred to Nauru from Australia been refouled by Nauru to any country where they would be at risk of persecution, or of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. (11) In what ways do Australian Immigration officials ensure compliance with each of the safeguards and minimum standards outlined in the Summary Conclusions on the concept of “Effective Protection” in the context of Secondary Movements of Refugees and Asylum Seekers, particularly with respect to fundamental human rights in the third State in accordance with applicable international standards. (12) What are the review mechanisms available to ensure that adequate attention has been given to the safeguards and minimum standards outlined in the aforementioned document and to the health and emotional well-being of asylum seekers moved from Christmas Island to Nauru. (1) (a) Yes, Mr Sayed Hussaini was removed from Christmas Island to Nauru on 18 March 2003. (b) Mr Hussaini was one of only three remaining detainees on Christmas Island who were transferred to Nauru on this date due to the mothballing of the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Facility. All three detainees had been regularly counselled by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in the weeks prior to the transfer, in relation to the impending mothballing of the Christmas Island facility and the probability that they would be transferred to Nauru. All three detainees received confirmation of their departure from Christmas Island and notification that they were being transferred to Nauru. (2) Yes, Mr Hussaini and two other detainees departed on a charter flight to Nauru at 0300 hours. (a) The departure time of 0300 hours was amended from a later departure time to accommodate the limited operating hours of a transit stop. (b) The decision was made by the Acting Assistant Secretary, Unauthorised Arrivals and Detention Services Branch following advice from the charter operator. (c) The First Assistant Secretary, Unauthorised Arrivals and Detention Division. (d) Recommendation was made to the Assistant Secretary that the three detainees be transferred to the Offshore Processing Centre on Nauru, in line with previous transfers of other Offshore Entry Persons to either Manus or Nauru. (3) The officials’ decisions and responsibilities were in accordance with Australia’s international obligations and the relevant domestic legislation. The conclusions mentioned reflect the discussion occurring in one informal meeting involving some states, NGOs and academics. They have no status either within the international protection community or in law and are neither agreed nor binding on any party, and so are to be distinguished from formal UNHCR ExCom conclusions. (4) The steps taken were consistent with Australian domestic law and Australia’s international obligations.",127,Questions On Notice
211,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) (a) As stated previously all three detainees including Mr Hussaini had been made aware in the weeks prior to the transfer of the impending closure of the Christmas Island Detention Facility. All three detainees had been regularly counselled by DIMIA regarding the probability that they would be transferred to Nauru, providing all three detainees with ample time to make arrangements to say goodbye to friends on Christmas Island. (b) Prior to boarding the plane, Mr Hussaini attended the Christmas Island Cemetery to visit his wife’s grave. (6) The transfer to Nauru occurred under s198A of the Migration Act 1958. Section 198A (1) of the Act provides that ‘an officer may take an offshore entry person from Australia to a country in respect of which a declaration is in force under subsection (3)’. Nauru was declared on 2 October 2001 under the requirements of s198A (3) of the Act. All three detainees transferred to Nauru are offshore entry persons who entered Australia at Christmas Island, an excised offshore place, after the excision time for that place and became unlawful non-citizens because of their entry. Documents relating to the transfer of Mr Hussaini to Nauru are DIMIA Central Office documents of a logistical nature only. (7) The cost of the charter for the removees and escorts was $145,000. Return commercial flights and accommodation for escorts amounted to approximately $13,740. (8) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Republic of Nauru provides that any asylum seeker awaiting determination of their status, or those recognised as refugees, will not be returned by Nauru to a country in which they fear persecution (9) All persons found not to be refugees are expected to return to their home country or other countries where they have residence rights. Mr Sayed Hussaini’s return will be considered in that context. (10) No. The MOU with Nauru provides that no asylum seeker awaiting determination of their status or recognised as a refugee will be returned to a country in which they fear persecution. (11) See also part three above. The officials’ decisions and responsibilities were informed by Australia's international obligations and the relevant domestic legislation. The conclusions mentioned reflect the discussion occurring in one informal meeting involving some states, NGOs and academics. They have no status either within the international protection community or in law and are neither agreed nor binding on any party. (12) Again, the officials’ decisions and responsibilities were informed by Australia’s international obligations and the relevant domestic legislation. The conclusions mentioned reflect the discussion occurring in one informal meeting involving some states, NGOs and academics. They have no status either within the international protection community or in law and are neither agreed nor binding on any party. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Nauru centres. IOM is renowned worldwide for its care and treatment of migrants, including asylum seekers and refugees. The processing centres on Nauru provide daily medical clinics staffed by IOM doctors and nurses. There are currently five doctors including a psychiatrist. In addition to these clinics, more serious medical conditions can be treated at the Republic of Nauru Hospital or, following IOM medical advice, persons may be transferred to Australia for treatment. Residents on Nauru have access to a wide range of recreational and vocational activities such as sport, satellite television, shopping and swimming excursions, a library, gardening or participating in educational activities such as learning computer skills. School age children are able to attend local schools. IOM maintains open channels of communication and centre residents can send and receive mail, have access to satellite phone and a local internet cafe for personal email and internet access. Roads: Safety (Question No. 2009) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 5 June 2003: (1) Does the Government have statistics on the number of vehicle accidents in Australia caused by drivers engaging in mobile phone conversations with hand-held phones; if so, what are the details. (2) What action has the Government taken to standardise mobile phone hands-free jacks to ensure that all phone brands are compatible with the jacks, thereby minimising the use of hand-held mobile phones. (1) The Commonwealth does not have the broad statistics sought. However, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) maintains detailed statistical data from coronial sources on Australian road vehicle crashes that result in fatalities. Where the crash results in a fatality, the ATSB’s statistical data generally include accident ‘causes’ as assessed by the police or coroner. Mobile phone usage was recorded as a cause in one fatal accident in the four-year period 1996-1999 (the latest period for which full coronial information is available). Hand-held mobile phone usage while driving has been illegal under Australian Road Rules since late 1999. (2) This matter is not within my area of responsibility. Gambling: On-Line Services (Question No. 2012) Ms Hoare asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 5 June 2003: (1) What measures are in place to prevent Australians from accessing on-line gambling services. (2) Is the Minister due to provide an update on the operation of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001; if so, when. (3) Which Commonwealth agency is responsible for investigating breaches of the Act. (4) Is the Minister aware of any breaches on the Act that have been investigated and prosecuted; if so, what were those breaches and who committed them. (5) Is the Minister aware of a complaint made against the Tasmanian Department of Economic Development; if so, what was the outcome of that complaint and the reasons behind that decision. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) establishes a regulatory framework at the Commonwealth level to address community concerns about the availability and accessibility of interactive gambling in Australia. Under the IGA it is an offence to provide certain interactive gambling services to customers physically located in Australia. This offence, which carries a maximum penalty of $220,000 per day for individuals and $1.1 million per day for corporations, applies to all interactive gambling service providers, whether based in Australia or offshore, whether Australian or foreign owned. The IGA also makes it an offence to advertise interactive gambling services in Australia. These services typically involve the Internet to play games of chance, or games of mixed chance and skill. The main offence provision of the Act applies to the provision of interactive gambling services to customers physically located in Australia. The IGA does not make it illegal for Australians to access interactive gambling services. The Government does not wish to force problem gamblers underground, as this would potentially lessen the likelihood of them, or their families, seeking assistance.",130,Questions On Notice
212,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,132,Questions On Notice
213,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(2) Under section 68 of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts must, before 1 July 2003, cause to be conducted a review of issues related to interactive gambling regulation in Australia. I am advised the Minister has instructed the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to conduct the review, which must consider a broad range of issues related to Commonwealth interactive gambling regulation, including the operation of the IGA, among other matters. To this end, the Department issued a call for submissions from members of the public and organisations wishing to comment on the matters to be considered. Over 40 submissions have been received to date. The Minister has advised he expects to receive a report of the review later this year. (3) As part of the regulatory framework established by the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) administers a complaints scheme under which Australian residents or companies trading in Australia are able to complain to the ABA if they believe that Australians can access prohibited Internet gambling content. The scheme commenced on 11 January 2002. The ABA is required to investigate complaints and refer Australian-hosted prohibited Internet gambling content to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) or a State or Territory police force if it considers the complaint should be so referred. If the prohibited Internet gambling content is hosted overseas, the ABA is required to notify the makers of filters listed in Schedule1 to the Interactive Gambling Industry Code (the Code). The Code was developed by the Internet Industry Association, as required by the IGA, specifically to deal with overseas sourced material. The Code requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to provide their customers with one of the approved filters listed in Schedule1 of the Code. The ABA may also refer overseas-hosted prohibited Internet gambling content to the AFP or a State or Territory police force where they believe the material is hosted in a country of interest to that police force. (4) and (5) The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) administers the interactive gambling complaints scheme under which Australian residents or companies trading in Australia are able to complain to the ABA if they believe that Australians can access prohibited Internet gambling content. The ABA have advised that as at 9 May 2003 they have received a total of 24 complaints concerning potentially prohibited Internet gambling content since the scheme commenced on 11 January 2002. Fourteen investigations have been completed, with eight investigations terminated due to lack of sufficient information. Two investigations remain current. Of the fourteen investigations completed, eight resulted in location of prohibited Internet gambling content hosted outside Australia and the ABA notified the details of the content to the makers of filter software products, in accordance with the procedure set out in the Code. Four investigations resulted in location of Australian hosted content that was not prohibited. Two complaints concerning potentially prohibited interactive gambling service advertisements were received by the Department for the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002. Both complaints concern the alleged breach of section 61EA of the IGA, which makes it an offence to publish an interactive gambling service advertisement in Australia, subject to various exceptions. I am advised by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts that one of these complaints concerned an alleged breach of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (IGA) by the Tasmanian Department of State Development (DSD) website (renamed the Tasmanian Department of Economic Development). The complainant alleged the Tasmanian DSD had advertised, promoted and endorsed the interactive gaming services of Tatts.com Pty Ltd in an Internet publication and in doing so had breached section 61FE of the IGA which makes it an offence to publish an interactive gambling service advertisement in Australia, subject to various exceptions. Details of the Department’s assessment of the two complaints are provided in the Report on the Operation of the Prohibition on Interactive Gambling Advertisements, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 15 May 2003. The Report is attached for your information. In the period from 1 January 2003 the Department has received an additional three complaints regarding potentially prohibited interactive gambling service advertisements. One complaint has been referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The AFP has advised they have accepted the matter for investigation. The Department is currently considering the two remaining complaints. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 2018) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 16 June 2003: (1) Is he aware of claims that asylum seekers being held in detention have been forced to (a) give birth with no translator or support person, such as a friend or relative, present, (b) give birth with a male guard present, (c) undergo caesareans without having given their informed consent, (d) wear handcuffs during transportation from the detention centre to hospital, and (e) wear handcuffs during the birth or caesarean. (2) Will he undertake to investigate these claims. (1) Yes, I am aware of Dr Lawrence’s claims in relation to asylum seekers being denied birth rights including being handcuffed during childbirth. These are not new allegations and were raised in a television program in November 2002. (2) In November 2002, I instructed my Department to commence investigations into the allegations. Detainees are transferred to an appropriate health facility to give birth. My Department is not aware of any occasion where a detainee has been restrained during childbirth or en-route to hospital. During the birth a female officer remains outside the birthing unit, unless the detainee requests the presence of the officer to act as a support person. The decision on whether a caesarean section is required is the responsibility of the treating medical practitioner, usually an obstetrician, to whom the detainee has been referred. The responsibility for ensuring that any person understands the nature of their medical treatment while in a hospital is the responsibility of the medical practitioner and the State or Territory Health authority. If interpreters are not available onsite, then access to an appropriate interpreter can be arranged by the health services provider through the Telephone Interpreting Service (TIS). Telstra: Share Dividends (Question No. 2019) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 June 2003: (1) Will Telstra provide alternative methods for the receipt of share dividends other than direct credit to a shareholder’s bank account after 1 January 2004. (2) Has any provision been made for shareholders who do not wish to provide bank account details to Telstra for the receipt of share dividends; if not, what will happen to share dividends in the event of a shareholder refusing to provide Telstra with bank account details.",132,Questions On Notice
214,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) If share dividends are to be retained by Telstra, (a) will the retained dividends be credited with interest, and (b) will any provision be made for the effects of inflation. has provided the following answer, based on information provided by Telstra, to the honourable member’s question: (1) Telstra has given its shareholders a year’s notice of a new policy to pay future dividends by direct credit. At present, two thirds of Telstra shareholders already receive their dividends in this way. The policy will take effect from the first dividend payment in 2004. During this time, Telstra will continue to work with its shareholders who still receive their dividend by cheque, and assist them in overcoming any concerns they might have relating to the privacy and security of their information and other issues regarding the banking system. Furthermore, in order to aid shareholders in transferring from cheque payment to the method of direct credit, Telstra has expanded its policy regarding direct credit and will now accept instructions to pay dividends to third party accounts. Telstra will also consider, on a case by case basis, any circumstances or issues where the policy may impose undue hardship on a shareholder. (2) If Telstra does not hold appropriate banking instructions from a shareholder after the new policy comes into effect, Telstra will seek to obtain those instructions as soon as possible in order to minimise any delay in payment of the shareholder's dividend. The new policy is intended, among other things, to reduce the substantial sums that Telstra currently bears due to delays in presentation of dividend cheques. It is also intended to reduce the sums that Telstra is obliged to pay to the relevant State or Territory unclaimed moneys authorities, where dividend cheques remain unpresented beyond the relevant statutory period. Telstra will not retain the dividends of those shareholders who have not supplied banking details. The money, instead, will be treated in accordance with the unclaimed monies legislation. (3) Telstra will not retain the dividends of those shareholders who have not supplied appropriate bank account details. This money will be treated in accordance with the unclaimed monies legislation, and, as is currently the case with unpresented cheques and incorrect banking instructions, interest will not be paid. Taxation: Lodgment of Returns (Question No. 2036) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 18 June 2003: (1) Further to the reply to question No. 1619 (Hansard, 16 June 2003, page 15723) is he aware of reports that Mr Roger de Robilliard, a barrister, appeared before the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 5 March 2003 for not filing a tax return since 1997.

The objectives of ELR are: to make payments to eligible Australian creators and publishers on the basis that income is lost from the availability of their books in educational lending libraries; and to support the enrichment of Australian culture by encouraging the growth and development of Australian writing and publishing. The Government is pleased at the very positive reception ELR has received from the writing community and the education sector. In particular, the payments have brought benefit to a writing sector which contributes significantly to Australian culture. In common with all programs introduced for a specific period of time, the continuation of ELR after 30 June 2004 will need to considered by the Government in the context of the 2004-05 budget. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 2072) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 25 June 2003: Which Australian laws and what international law governs the rights of children in detention. The immigration detention environment is governed by a legal and policy framework consisting of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation and regulations, Ministerial Directions, and departmental policy and procedural documents. This framework is informed by Australia’s obligations under international conventions and treaties. The principal source of domestic law is the Migration Act 1958. In relation to children in detention, other relevant legislation includes the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 (the IGOC Act), the Privacy Act 1988 and State and Territory child protection legislation. The IGOC Act is the administrative mechanism by which legal guardianship for certain children entering Australia is conferred upon the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. This means that the Minister as legal guardian of certain children has the rights and powers which a parent may have over their own child. Various pieces of State legislation also have effect in the detention environment, to the extent that this legislation is not inconsistent with Commonwealth legislation. State legislation that can affect children in detention is, broadly, that relating to health, education, welfare and criminal law. International instruments governing the rights of children in detention are the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

(2) What was the total cost of this project and what was the total contributed by the Commonwealth. (3) Is it the case that the ECOmmodore uses 50% less fuel than a conventional vehicle of the same size and produces the same performance as a standard 3.8 litre V6 from a four-cylinder motor. (4) Is the Minister able to say how much the demand for petroleum fuels would be reduced if the Government encouraged or required vehicle manufacturers to produce fuel-efficient vehicles like the ECOmmodore; if not, why not. (5) Has he seen a report by the CSIRO titled Energy Outlook to 2020, which indicates that there are no plans to produce vehicles of this type in Australia. (6) Does the Government support the production of vehicles of this type in Australia; if so, why; if not, why not. (7) Is the Minister able to say when Australian production of vehicles with hybrid petrol-electric motors will begin. (1) The ECOmmodore was an engineering ‘learning platform’, to give scientists and engineers the opportunity to explore new and innovative technologies such as power-train strategies, control systems, energy storage systems etc, that may be relevant to future hybrid vehicles. From a CSIRO perspective, the outcome was the experimental vehicle, the ECOmmodore, which demonstrated how engineers and scientists from CSIRO and Holden could work together to push the boundaries of a range of automotive technologies. The hybrid ECOmmodore was never intended to be the precursor of a production vehicle. (2) The total cost of the CSIRO contribution to the ECOmmodore project was approximately $900,000. CSIRO does not know the amount of the Holden contribution. (3) One of the design targets, based on engineering modelling, was for a vehicle that used 50% less fuel when compared to a standard 3.8 litre V6 Commodore. Actual fuel consumption figures vary considerably, and are very much drive cycle dependent. (4) Questions on the demand for petroleum based fuels are difficult to answer, due to the many interrelated factors involved. These include the percentage of the current car fleet replaced by such a vehicle and the timescale over which this would this occur. Detailed information on the make-up",139,Questions On Notice

The report states that “Various manufacturers are experimenting with different vehicle power-train concepts, especially hybrid electric systems” (page 10) and that “Hybrid cars are now on the market” (page 15). (6) The Government supports the production of vehicles that incorporate modern fuel-saving technologies. The Government’s Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme (ACIS) is directed towards encouraging new investment and innovation in the automotive industry. A new feature of this scheme will be a $150 million R&D fund specifically for vehicle manufacturers investing in new and innovative technologies. The decision to produce hybrid vehicles in Australia is a commercial decision for vehicle manufacturers. (7) No. The Government is unable to pre-empt the decisions made by commercial vehicle manufacturers regarding the Australian production of such cars. Fuel: Ethanol (Question No. 2110) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) What is the current total vehicle fuel demand in Australia. (2) What proportion of Australia’s total vehicle fuel demand could be supplied by locally produced ethanol. (3) What proportion of the wheat or sugar crop or other crops would be required to produce ethanol to replace (a) 10% of the demand for vehicle fuel, (b) 20% of the demand for vehicle fuel, and (c) 100% of the demand for vehicle fuel. (4) What is the value of the subsidies the Government would need to pay to substitute ethanol for (a) 10% of the demand for vehicle fuel, (b) 20% of the demand for vehicle fuel, and (c) 100% of the demand for vehicle fuel. (5) Which companies are currently receiving a financial benefit from the Government for the production of ethanol. (6) What effect would the substitution of petroleum-based fuel with ethanol have on Australia’s overall emissions of carbon dioxide. the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Total transport fuel consumption in 2002 was 35,047 megalitres, comprising: 18,884 megalitres of gasoline; 13,720 megalitres of diesel; and 2,443 megalitres of LPG. (2) Domestic production of fuel ethanol in 2002-03 was approximately 75 megalitres. This equates to 0.4 per cent of gasoline consumption, or about 0.2 per cent of total vehicle fuel consumption in 2002. (3) (a) Replacing 10% of the demand for vehicle fuel with ethanol would currently require 3504.7 mega litres of ethanol.

Based on the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) June quarter 2003 forecast for the 2003 wheat crop of 21.662 mega tonnes, and that 1 tonne of wheat would produce 400 litres of ethanol, this would require 80.9% of the forecast 2003 wheat crop. (c) Replacing 100% of the demand for vehicle fuel with ethanol would currently require 35,047 mega litres of ethanol. Based on the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) June quarter 2003 forecast for the 2003 wheat crop of 21.662 mega tonnes, and that 1 tonne of wheat would produce 400 litres of ethanol, this would require 404.5% of the forecast 2003 wheat crop. (4) (a) 3504.7 mega litres of ethanol would be required to replace 10 per cent of the demand for vehicle fuel.

(b) 7009.4 mega litres of ethanol would be required to replace 20 per cent of the demand for vehicle fuel. Based on the current production subsidy rate of 38.143 cents per litre payable to producers of domestic ethanol, the value of the subsidy required is $2.67 billion. (c) 35,047 mega litres of ethanol would be required to replace 100 per cent of the demand for vehicle fuel.

(5) Manildra Energy Australia Pty Ltd and CSR Distilleries Operations Pty Ltd. (6) The effect on Australia’s overall carbon dioxide emissions of substituting petroleum based fuel with ethanol would be dependent on the feedstock and production process to produce the ethanol. Ethanol generally only realises a greenhouse benefit where the feedstock is a waste product (eg low grade molasses, wood waste) or the energy source used in its production is relatively clean. Figures from the latest CSIRO studies show a modest greenhouse benefit using waste wheat starch as feedstock and current production processes. Fuel: Ethanol (Question No. 2111) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Is he able say whether ethanol produced in Australia and proposed as a replacement for petroleum based fuels would be dried, that is, containing less than 1% water and therefore miscible with petrol, or sold as 95% ethanol containing up to 5% water; if not, is he able to say whether the Government has considered the relative merits of the two forms of ethanol. (2) How much more carbon dioxide would be produced by the production of dried ethanol compared with the production of 95% ethanol. (3) Would the production of ethanol as a significant replacement fuel, that is, replacing 10% or more of consumption, lead to an increase or a decrease in Australia’s overall emission of carbon dioxide. (4) Is he able to say what the estimated price of ethanol would be, expressed in cents per litre, if it were produced in sufficient quantity to replace (a) 10% of the demand for vehicle fuel, (b) 20% of the demand for vehicle fuel, and (c) 100% of the demand for vehicle fuel. vided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:",141,Questions On Notice
230,Mr Hockey,"The Acting Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has pro(1) Ethanol is produced in Australia in two forms: hydrated and anhydrous. Hydrated ethanol contains 95% ethanol and 5% water and is suitable for use in blending as a 15% emulsion in diesel. CSR Distilleries currently produces hydrated ethanol for blending with diesel for a trial it is conducting in Mackay, Queensland. A further process of dehydration is required to produce anhydrous ethanol containing less than 1% water for blending with petrol. The Manildra Group currently produces and markets anhydrous ethanol for blending with petrol. CSR Distilleries is currently producing and providing anhydrous ethanol to Caltex for a 10 per cent ethanol blend trial in Cairns, Queensland. The Government has considered the relative merits of both forms of ethanol within the context of studies conducted by Environment Australia. (2) Based on the CSIRO Comparison of Transport Fuels 2001, the additional energy required to produce anhydrous ethanol is in the order of 3%. The impact on emissions of carbon dioxide is dependent on the fuel source used to produce this energy. (3) The effect on Australia’s overall carbon dioxide emissions of substituting petroleum based fuel with ethanol would be dependent on the feedstock and production process to produce the ethanol. Ethanol generally only realises a greenhouse benefit where the feedstock is a waste product (eg low grade molasses, wood waste) or the energy source used in its production is relatively clean. Figures from the latest CSIRO studies show a modest greenhouse benefit using waste wheat starch as feedstock and current production processes. (4) To estimate the price of fuel ethanol under each scenario would require extensive analysis involving assumptions about supply and demand factors. Supply side factors would include the cost of raw material feedstocks, the feedstock yield, the size and type of plant and technology used to produce the ethanol, the relative price of petrol, the extent of subsidisation provided for ethanol production and the market value of by-products. Demand side factors would include demand for fuel ethanol including its use as an octane enhancer. Fuel: Diesel Shortage (Question No. 2112) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Is he aware of a 1999 report by the Bureau of Resource Sciences warning that diesel fuel was the most likely of all the petroleum fuels to face supply shortages in the near future. (2) Is he or his department aware of any other reports predicting a diesel fuel supply shortage; if so, what are those reports. (3) What is the Government’s strategy for dealing with diesel fuel shortages if they develop. (4) What steps, if any, has the Government taken to reduce the consumption of diesel fuel. (5) What would be the effect on the demand for diesel fuel if (a) 10% of road freight movements, (b) 25% of road freight movements, and (c) 40% of road freight movements, were transferred to rail. (6) What is the current annual level of spending by the Government on diesel fuel subsidies and what has been the total expenditure on diesel fuel subsidies by the government since 1996. (7) Has the Government implemented any diesel fuel subsidy schemes since 1996; if so, (a) what has been the cost of each of these subsidies, (b) what effect have they had on the growth of diesel fuel consumption since 1996, and (c) has this led to an increase in investment in diesel powered plant and equipment and, if it has, by what magnitude. (8) Will the Government compensate those who have been encouraged by Commonwealth diesel fuel subsidies to buy diesel powered plant and equipment when diesel fuel shortages make their equipment unusable; if so, how; if not, why not. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) No. (2) The Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources has been managing an APEC study that makes some predictions about future supply and demand of petroleum products for 2002, 2006 and 2012 in light of changing fuel standards, regional refinery capacity and investment strategies. In broad terms, the preliminary results of the study show that Australia currently has excess refining capacity and is essentially self-sufficient in all finished products. These results indicate the Australia-New Zealand refineries will be producing an excess of diesel of 13,000 barrels per day in 2006. I would caution that this modelling was conducted before the recent closure of the Port Stanvac refinery and that it was based on some assumptions regarding future refinery investment required to meet new fuel standards. (3) The National Oil Supplies Emergency Committee is the main executive channel through which the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments, in cooperation with industry, formulate their overall management response to a widespread fuel shortage. In the event of a fuel emergency, this Committee would be convened to coordinate response measures including the adoption of emergency arrangements, the collection and provision of statistics, and the coordination of public information. (4) The Government’s policies are aimed at increasing the quality and efficiency of all transport fuels for environmental, health and economic gains. (5) This information is not currently available and would require a significant study to be undertaken to provide detailed answers. (6) Estimates for annual expenditure on the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS), Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (DAFGS) and Fuel Sales Grants Scheme (FSGS) in the 2002-03 and 2003-04 financial years can be found in the Portfolio Budget Statement for the Australian Taxation Office from the 2003-04 Budget. Expenditure figures for these schemes for financial years 1996-97 to 2000-01 can be found in the publication Taxation Statistics 1999-2000, published by the Australian Taxation Office. (7) The DAFGS and FSGS both commenced on 1 July 2000 as part of the tax reform process. The in the service of rural and regional Australia. The DAFGS and DFRS were replaced with the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme from 1 July 2003. The FSGS provides a grant to fuel retailers on the sale of petrol or diesel in eligible locations in regional and remote Australia, in order to ensure that the pump price of fuel for motorists in these areas did not increase as a result of the introduction of the GST. (a) Expenditure data for these schemes is available in the publications referred to above, (b) unknown, and (c) unknown. (8) The Government is not currently anticipating any shortages in diesel fuel.

231,Mr Hockey,"The Acting Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has provided theWill he amend the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 to prohibit a media proprietor from owning both a television network and newspapers in the one market; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Senator Harradine’s amendment to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 prevents mergers between television broadcasters and newspapers in metropolitan licence areas. This amendment detracts from the ability of small to medium sized players to expand and reposition themselves within the industry. This amendment will also curtail the competitiveness of small to medium sized firms who will not be able to attain the necessary economies of scale and scope to compete effectively against the larger incumbents. The Government therefore opposes this amendment.

234,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(1) Yes. (2) It is in the public interest to allow Australian companies to be competitive on an international stage by realising the benefits of scale and scope that cross media mergers can provide. Well resourced media companies that do not have to rely solely on cost cutting for improving profitability are more likely to deliver the program diversity and high quality news and information services the public desire. It is also in the public interest to increase the competitiveness of small to medium sized firms and new entrants, by allowing them to attain the necessary economies of scale and scope to compete effectively against the larger incumbents. At the same time there are a number of amendments to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 which provide strong safeguards to protect diversity of news and media opinion, and prevent market dominance by any media group. These include: an amendment stipulating that a cross-media merger cannot be approved unless five independently owned commercial media outlets (across radio, associated newspapers and TV) in metropolitan markets, and four in regional markets, remain in the market after the cross-media acquisition occurs; an extension of the ‘two out of three rule’ to metropolitan markets; a restriction on newspaper ownership to one newspaper per market where the person also holds a cross-media exemption certificate for that market (relevant newspapers are those included on the ABA’s Associated Newspaper Register); and a requirement to review the ownership and control provisions in three years time. Communications: Media Ownership (Question No. 2116) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Has the Minister seen the report titled “There will be no deal on media mess” by Terry McCrann in The Daily Telegraph on 24 June 2003 where it was reported that media policy in Australia is in a right mess and it will still be in a right mess, whatever happens this week and that a backroom deal between the Government and four independent Senators is unlikely to produce good policy. (2) Does the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 allow further concentration of media ownership in Australia; if so can the Minister explain how that is in the public interest. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes.

241,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:establish a Working Group which will prepare and present a draft text which will be the basis for negotiation at the Ad Hoc Committee. The draft text will take into account all contributions submitted to the Ad Hoc Committee and, where there are alternative approaches, the Working Group will present textual options that reflect those approaches. The Working Group will comprise 27 government representatives designated by regional groups, 12 NGO representatives and a representative from a national human rights institution. The Working Group will meet inter-sessionally in the United Nations in New York early in 2004, and will present the outcome of its work on a draft text to the Ad Hoc Committee at its third session. (2) The Government submitted a response to the request of the United Nations Secretariat, arising from General Assembly resolution 57/229. (a) A copy of the response is attached. (b) The Government remains of the view that, in order to achieve the desired outcome of improving the position of people with disabilities, it is important to assess the rights set out in the existing human rights instruments and to identify any areas where protection needs to be strengthened or clarified. The Government has attempted to ensure that any new instrument embodies the best protection for the rights of people with disabilities. (3) The Government’s constructive and supportive approach to the current negotiations is evidenced by Australia’s participation in both meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee. The Government remains committed to working towards the best way to ensure appropriate and effective protection for the rights of people with disabilities. Outline for contributions and proposals for a convention Australia has had a long standing commitment to promoting rights and equal opportunities for people with disabilities. The Australian Government is committed to eliminating discrimination on the grounds of disability and ensuring that people with disabilities are able to participate in the community to the greatest possible extent. Australia has a comprehensive domestic legislative framework protecting the rights of people with disabilities and supporting their participation in the broader community. At the federal level, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in many areas of public life. The DDA is also intended to promote the fuller participation of people with disabilities in public life. For example, the DDA gives the Attorney-General power to make disability standards in a range of areas. The object of disability standards is to clarify rights and obligations under the DDA, both for people with disabilities, and for providers to whom the Standards apply. Compliance with disability standards provides a defence to a complaint of unlawful discrimination, and a breach of the Standards. At present, disability standards have been made in the area of public transport, and standards are currently underway in the areas of access to public premises and education. Australia’s national human rights institution, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC), has made an important contribution in this area by encouraging compliance with the DDA, raising awareness of disability discrimination issues and promoting education. Industry and community organisations have also played a vital role by establishing partnerships to address disability discrimination issues. Examples of this can be seen in the areas of banking and telecommunications. State and Territory anti-discrimination laws also prohibit discrimination against people on the ground of disability, and have also assisted in ensuring the participation of people with disabilities in public life. Australia also has a range of policies, programmes and services designed to assist participation of people with disabilities and to raise awareness of disability issues. This degree of commitment means that Australia considers that any new initiatives need to ensure strong protection for people with disabilities, and that they are appropriately targeted. Views on the complementarity between a new instrument and existing international instruments Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for People with Disabilities Australia made a substantial contribution to the development of the United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (the Standard Rules), including providing the rapporteur for that process. The Standard Rules provide a good framework for member States to formulate programmes to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The Rules are concrete in form, they directly address the issue of member State responsibility, and they include an independent and active monitoring mechanism. The principles enshrined in the rules are broadly accepted by the disability community. Given the high level of awareness and acceptance of these principles it would be appropriate to build on these further. Monitoring and evaluation of the existing international legal instruments, especially the international human rights instruments Australia has launched an initiative directed towards improving the effectiveness of the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies. In relation to their role in receiving complaints from individuals, Australia is particularly concerned about the lack of adequate mechanisms to filter out complaints that are clearly inadmissible, the long delays caused by multiple submissions and inadequate reasons given for the views expressed. The initiative aims to introduce best practice and consistency into the operations of the existing treaty bodies. A great deal of progress has been made and the Committees have introduced some much needed changes and are looking to make more. However there is a way to go. Therefore, it is Australia’s strong view that the most appropriate approach would be to first thoroughly examine all available options for strengthening and streamlining the existing human rights machinery to improve the way in which existing treaty bodies deal with disability issues. In this context, Australia is concerned that discussion is proceeding toward a convention in the absence of an examination of what rights for people with disabilities are currently not protected under existing instruments, and whether there are methods for closing these gaps that would not take the length of time that the negotiation of a new convention would (for example, ensuring that existing treaty bodies specifically deal with disability issues, or, if necessary, amending existing instruments). Referendum: Legislative Deadlocks (Question No. 2124) Mr Organ asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Is it the Government’s intention to conduct a referendum on a proposal to allow joint sittings of both Houses of Parliament to pass legislation which has been repeatedly blocked in the Senate as envisaged by him recently at the Liberal Party national conference. (2) Will the Government include a proposal for the introduction of proportional representation for the House of Representatives; if not, why not. (1) The government has committed itself to releasing a discussion paper on the way legislative deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate are resolved under section 57 of the Commonwealth Constitution. As I stated in my address on 8 June 2003, if there appears to be a reasonable prospect of community support for a change to section 57 after three months of consultation, the government will consider whether to hold a referendum in conjunction with the next federal election. (2) No. The government does not support a change to the method by which the House of Representatives is elected. Aviation: Ticket Levy Collection (Question No. 2125) Mr Organ asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: Can he explain why a constituent who has booked a flight with Virgin Blue after 1 July 2003 has been told by the carrier that it will not refund the $10 levy despite the fact that it no longer applies on the date of travel. Under the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Act 2001, the levy is payable at the time of ticket purchase, therefore passengers who book and pay for travel prior to 30 June 2003 will be subject to the levy. This mirrors the way the levy was administered when introduced on 1 October 2001, whereby only tickets purchased after that date were subject to the levy. Tickets purchased prior to that date for travel after 1 October 2001 were not subject to the levy. Fuel: Ethanol (Question No. 2126) Mr Organ asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) Is he aware of the article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 12 June 2003 that reported that Manildra Energy Australia Pty Ltd received ethanol subsidy payments of $17,132,670 to cover excise costs between 17 October 2002 and 31 May 2003. (2) Is this the same company which Electoral Commission returns show donated $213,000 to the Coalition in 2001-2002. (3) Can he explain why the Government has decided to impose excise on liquefied petroleum gas without providing a similar subsidy to an industry which involves over 2,000 small to medium enterprises employing tens of thousands of people. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes, I am aware of the article. Under a contract between the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources and Manildra Energy Australia Pty Ltd, ethanol production grants of $17,132,670 were made between 17 October 2002 and 31 May 2003. (2) Australian Electoral Commission Records show that Manildra Flour Mills Ltd donated $241,091 to the Coalition parties in 2001-2002. Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd belongs to the same group of companies as Manildra Energy Australia Pty Ltd which is in receipt of the ethanol production grants. Australian Electoral Commission Records show that the Australian Labor Party also received donations from Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd totalling $55,455 over the same period.",148,Questions On Notice

244,Mr Hockey,"The Acting Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has provided the(3) As part of the 2003-04 Budget, the Treasurer announced that all untaxed fuel, including LPG, CNG, LNG, biodiesel and ethanol, will be brought into the excise (and customs) system from 1 July 2008 when used in internal combustion engines. In other words, the excise treatment of LPG will have the same basis as that for ethanol beginning 1 July 2008. Ethanol is already subject to excise and customs duty now; while LPG is not. This will not change until 1 July 2008. These changes to the fuel excise system provide a more consistent and robust tax regime for fuels and allow fuels to compete on their commercial merits, not on their tax treatment. Generous transition arrangements give currently effectively untaxed fuels an opportunity to establish their role in the market. The Government’s position is that fuels should ultimately compete on their commercial credentials. Final excise rates to apply from 2012 will be determined later this year and will have regard to the energy content of fuels. Health and Ageing: Aged Care (Question No. 2127) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 26 June 2003: (1) In respect of the Aged Care Approvals Round (Residential Care Places), how many provisional allocations are more than two years old.
