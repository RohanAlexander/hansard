House adjourned at 9.59 pm The following notice was given: Mr Oakeshott to present a bill for an act to amend the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to support the greater commercialisation of renewable energy technologies, and for related purposes. (Renewable Energy Amendment (Feed-in-Tariff for Electricity) Bill 2009) Monday, 22 June 2009 ----Youth Allowance speech of last Wednesday to table a petition that was taken up in my electorate, particularly around Warrnambool, raising serious concerns about changes proposed to Youth Allowance. Clearly the proposal is going to disadvantage a number of would be students who have taken the gap year and are now going to find retrospectively that they are not going to qualify for Youth Allowance. This is causing enormous angst. Over 400 people turned up to a meeting in Warrnambool at fairly short notice. I have more than the 1,400 signatures on this petition. Unfortunately that list is a little long to meet the criteria of a petition, and that is why I seek leave to table it. But it is very important that this message be heard and that people understand that the retrospectivity, and the fact that the changes to Youth Allowance are going to work against many country students, is only going to cause further disadvantage, in country areas where already we know that the participation rate of students at tertiary level is lower than it is for those in city areas.

I would like to report to the chamber that the Rudd Labor government economic stimulus package is delivering $131 million to Townsville in the seat of Herbert. I hasten to add that we have also invested, as part of that stimulus package, $10 million to the V8 supercar event which will be taking place on 10, 11 and 12 July in Townsville, and also the Flinders Street Mall, worth $16.2 million. This confirms once again that, of the stimulus package announced by the Rudd Labor government, 70 per cent is invested in key infrastructure in our society and our community. I commend everything that this government is doing to stimulate the economy, keep jobs and build key infrastructure for the future of this nation. Tangney Electorate: Child Sponsorship Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (6.43 pm)-In this time of financial woes and negativity there shines a bright light in my electorate of Tangney. Recently Canning Vale was named by World Vision as the third most generous suburb in Western Australia. In fact, some 862 child sponsors live in that area. These residents are not super wealthy but they have opened their hearts to those less fortunate. An example is Vikki Winchester, whose family sponsored two Ugandan children to help these children fulfil their dreams and aspirations and to show her own two children how lucky they are to live in Australia.

Blair Electorate: Kalbar Show Show and to celebrate 80 years of the Kalbar Show operating. I want to commend the Kalbar and District Agricultural and Pastoral Association Inc. for their wonderful contribution. A few weeks before that, with my wife, Caroline, I was at the Kalbar Show Ball at the Roadvale School of Arts. I want to congratulate rural ambassador for 2009 Colleen Lobwein, flower girl Jessika Doyle, junior princess Emily Greenwell, princess Tammy Lee, junior showgirl Amy Kliese, showgirl Victoria Dieckmann, Matron Jocelyn Oppermann and king of the ball John Spencer. The Kalbar Show Ball is an important event in the Fassifern Valley. The Kalbar Show started as a calf show in 1926 at the local Englesburg School, which is now known as the Kalbar State School. Dances were held in the Hermanns family barn on their farm and grand concerts were held in the school of arts that night. They used to take the cattle up to three miles across the grounds, which were then, as I understand, owned by the Damm and Hermann families involved in cattle production and growth in that area. Pigs from the district were also entered in the early shows. The shows were held in April, but eventually they were moved because they conflicted with Easter and ANZAC Day. It is great to be there at the Kalbar Show. Local wine, olives and gourmet cheeses(Time expired) Koalas population in my electorate. What we have seen from censuses conducted since 1996 through to 2005 and 2008 is a halving of the population, potentially, in the last three years, and that is of great concern. The error margin may be high and we may need more science, but quite simply I stand to make an appeal to the people of South-East Queensland to push harder for the protection of the koala. This will require more resources from the state government than the paltry $2.1 million that has been committed. That is simply not enough. It is way too expensive to simply try and resume land for millions of dollars and hope that deaths on roads and due to dogs will fall away. The 300 that die every year under the wheels of motor vehicles and the 100 that are killed by dogs is simply unacceptable. These animals are almost effectively extinct in South-East Queensland. I know some of the scientific community have concerns, but what we need is to take some heed of the work being done in WA to protect the endangered woylie. We may well have to fence off the major roads, which are effectively killing fields for these animals. Being able to live together with the koala may only remain possible with some protection from these major byways and highways. We need to relocate koalas away from highly built-up areas. That romantic notion that we can live together with koalas may have to be revisited before it is too late. We may only have years to act, not decades, and I urge the state government and the federal government as well to step forward and provide resources for highway-side fencing.

Bocce is one of the family of bowl sports. It has been played in Australia since the early 1900s and is particularly popular amongst the Italian community. Men and women bocce players from around Australia participated in the championships in what was a very well organised and successful event. National Australian bocce championships have been held in Australia since 1970 on a rotational basis between each of the states. From the Australian championships, players are selected to represent Australia in the world championships. I attended both the opening and closing stages of the championships in Adelaide and I was very impressed with the effort that went into organising the four-day event and the number of volunteers who contributed towards the successful championship. It was also wonderful to see the genuine camaraderie between the bocce players who took part in the event, including the officials. I especially acknowledge the efforts of Marco Quaglia, President of the Campania club; Silvio Varricchio, President of the South Australian Bocce Federation; Mirella Mancini OAM, Secretary of the South Australian Bocce Federation; and Raymond Cher, President of the Bocce Federation of Australia. I acknowledge their tireless work to make the championships a success and I wish all the Australian competitors well in the world men’s championships being held in France between 28 September and 4 October. I also wish the International Bocce Federation success in having the bowl sport included in future Olympic Games, which I understand the international(Time expired) Workplace Relations have become anxious about what new modern awards mean for them. Small businesses which already operate on small profit margins are rightly worried about huge increases in their wage bills-in some cases, 20 per cent or more-that appear inevitable as a consequence of Labor’s award modernisation. These so-called modern awards have the potential to see thousands of employees lose their jobs and push an already struggling small business sector to the wall. The awards are going to put up the costs of labour in a whole range of industries and, as a result, see people laid off. An irrigator in my electorate said the modernisation will drive up her wage costs. She says that most horticultural employment is seasonal. Crops need to be picked and Sundays need to be worked. That is because customers expect produce to arrive on Monday mornings. She says that it is hard enough to turn a profit as it is in the current environment, with drought, water restrictions and the economic downturn, and this government is killing off small business. Another small business owner of a pizza franchise in Berri tells me that when the award is introduced it will be devastating for his business. He employs 15 staff aged from 15 to 50 years of age. He tells me that as a fast food pizza shop the primary business hours are from 4 pm to 9 pm daily, and later on Friday and Saturday. He says the award will be devastating for his business, forcing him to pay an additional loading for all hours worked after 6 pm every Saturday and every Sunday.

Louisa Lawson was Australia’s first woman publisher. She established and edited the Dawn magazine for women. She is also credited with being the originator of the suffrage campaign. Louisa frequently asked in her Dawn magazine, ‘Who ordained that men only should make the laws which both women and men must obey? Pray, why should one half of the world govern the other half?’ In addition to campaigning for a political voice for women, Louisa subsidised courses for women at technical colleges, advocated for the establishment of hospitals for homeless and battered women, championed the rights of workers and the poor and strongly supported an Australian republic. Louisa’s achievements are not widely known outside of Gulgong and Mudgee, where she grew up. Although she was a worthy poet herself, her life and works have been largely overshadowed by her famous son, Henry Lawson. I am grateful to the Gulgong branch for preserving Louisa’s memory through an annual dinner in her name. I particularly want to thank Alex and Debbie Lithgow, John Kotlash and Vicky Smith, Jack and Margaret Foreman, Colin and Trish McDonald, Sandra and Owen Power, John Curry, Merryl Dillon and also my parliamentary colleague Senator Steve Hutchins. I also thank Chris Cooke for the wonderful tour of the Henry Lawson Centre in Gulgong, and I was happy to learn that the centre is planning to add an extension devoted to Louisa Lawson. Cowan Electorate: Carramar and Tapping Residents Association has a history of activism and constructive engagement in the Carramar-Tapping district. Indeed, I would say that the association is arguably the most active residents association in Cowan. I regularly receive their emails about a range of issues concerning the area. At a recent meeting I expressed my thanks and high regard for the work the association’s executive does for the community. The president is Renato Bonasera, the treasurer is Ian Worrell, Sandra Hill-Williamson is the secretary, and Maria Szep is the events coordinator, and I particularly note her excellent work in organising the Carramar community expo at the new Carramar shopping centre and community centre. It was a hugely popular event and I congratulate her for her efforts. I also acknowledge the long-term efforts for the suburb of Carramar undertaken by committee member and former president Norm Hewer. Norm has recently been elected to the council for the city of Wanneroo and I congratulate him on that.

Girl Guides Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (6.53 pm)-Girl Guides will be celebrating a century of guiding in Australia next year at a jamboree in Victoria. The venue has had to be moved as the original location was badly damaged in the Victorian bushfires. Quite a few girls from the Gosnells district in Hasluck will be flying to Melbourne for the event. Last Saturday night, 20 June, about 60 girl guides from the Gosnells district held a sleepover to coincide with the world’s biggest sleepover function. They held their function to assist 20 girl guides who suffered during the Victorian bushfires. They held a function in February to help their Victorian sisters by assembling toiletry packs to send over, but this most recent function was to pack a dillybag or, to the uninitiated, camping equipment-essential items for a girl guide. Each girl brought items such as tea towels, packing plates, cups et cetera to assemble a dillybag to replace the camping equipment lost in the fires. Guiding is a wonderful institution for girls and young women aged five and upwards. It is run by volunteers committed to instilling community values in these young lives. It is important to recognise these volunteers.

Ms SAFFIN (Page) (6.55 pm)-I would first of all like to put on the record my thanks to the honourable member for Berowra for seconding this private members motion tonight. I would also like to thank all the honourable members for speaking. There is good reason for this chamber to debate the deplorable humanitarian, human rights, economic, racial, legal, constitutional and political crisis that confronts the people of Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi has said, ‘Please use your liberty to help us achieve ours.’ We are here; we can give that reassurance. The most recent despicable act-one of many that form a pattern of systemic and widespread violations of all manner of human rights-of this brutal regime led by General Than MAIN COMMITTEE Shwe involves the trumped-up charges against Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and someone who is admitted into the Companion of the Order of Australia, made worse by the fact that when she was charged she was already serving a six-year sentence, again on trumped-up charges, laid after she was a victim of an assassination attempt by the regime itself. At that time they also imprisoned her deputy, U Tin Oo, taking him back to his home in Rangoon to serve his sentence. I have here, Madam Deputy Speaker, Opinion No. 11/2005 (Myanmar) of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which says, among other things, that U Tin Oo’s liberty is arbitrarily deprived. I seek leave to incorporate the opinion into my contribution tonight. Leave granted. The document read as followsDear Ms. Saffin, I would like to refer to the forty-second session of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in which the Working Group adopted several Opinions on cases of detention submitted to it. The Working Group decided, inter alia. to transmit its Opinions three weeks after having transmitted them to the governments concerned, to the sources of information which had submitted the cases to the Group. In accordance with the Working Group’s methods of work, I am sending to you, attached herewith, the text of Opinion No. 11/2005 (Myanmar) regarding a case submitted by you ( MrU Tin Oo). This Opinion will be reproduced in the Working Group’s next report to the Commission on Human Rights. Yours sincerely, Miguel de la Lama Secretary Working Group on Arbitrary Detention Communication addressed to the Government of the Union of Myanmar on 12 October 2004 Concerning the case of MrU Tin Oo The State is not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by resolution 1991/42 of the Commission on Human Rights. The mandate of the Working Group was clarified by resolution 1997/50 and extended by resolution 2003/31. Acting in accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group forwarded to the Government the above-mentioned communication. 2 The Working Group regrets that the Government did not provide it, despite repeated invitation to this effect, with the requested information. The Working Group believes that it is in a position to render an opinion on the facts and circumstances of the case. 3. The Working Group regards deprivation of liberty as arbitrary in the following cases: I. When it manifestly cannot be justified on any legal basis (such as continued detention after the sentence has been served or despite an applicable amnesty act) (Category I); II. When the deprivation of liberty is the result of a judgement or sentence for the exercise of the rights and freedoms proclaimed in articles 7, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and also, in respect of States parties, by articles 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Category II); III. When the complete or partial non-observance of the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the relevant international instruments acMAIN COMMITTEE cepted by the States concerned relating to the right to a fair trial is of such gravity as to confer on the deprivation of liberty, of whatever kind, an arbitrary character (Category III). 4. According to the information received, MrU Tin Oo, a citizen of Myanmar born on 3 March 1927, Vice-President of the National League for Democracy (NLD), was arrested by police and military forces on 30 May 2003 at around 7 p.m. in Kyi village near the Dipeyin (Tabayin) township, Sagaing Division, when the NLD convoy was attacked by government’ affiliated thugs during a speaking tour of Upper Myanmar. Scores were killed and hundreds were wounded during the attack. MrU Tin Oo received blows to the head. 5. MrU Tin Oo was taken to Kale (Kalay) prison, Sagaing Division, and detained there. He was later on transferred to Mandalay-Ohpho Prison. The detention of MrU Tin Oo was ordered by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). As to the legal basis, no arrest warrant or detention order was issued against MrU Tin Oo, nor any charges raised against him. The detention might be based on the 1975 State Protection Law. 6. On 14 February 2004, U Tin Oo was shifted from Kale Prison to house arrest. However, he is still not allowed to see anyone. His home in Yangon is being guarded by armed and security personnel and his phone cut off. 7. The source alleges that no charges have been raised against MrU Tin Oo and no trial is envisaged; his detention is not subjected to judicial review; he is held in incommunicado detention and denied access to a lawyer; 8. The Government, which had the possibility to answer to these allegations, did not contest them. 9. The Working Group finds that MrU Tin Oo could not benefit of the fundamental guarantees of due process, being an administrative detention. No arrest warrant was issued, no charges have been brought against him; he has not be subjected to an independent judicial process, held in camera and without access to defense. 10. As to the situation of his house arrest, the Working Group has already stated in its Deliberation No. 1 that house arrest may be compared to deprivation of liberty provided that it is carried out in closed premises which the person is not allowed to leave, which is the case here, as the Government has not denied it. 11. The Government was also unable to provide information as to the facts that gave rise to MrU Tin Oo’s arrest. At the time of his arrest was in a speaking tour in the country for the NLD party. The Working Group considers his deprivation of liberty takes place for the mere exercise of his political rights and the exercise of the right of freedom of movement, peaceful demonstration and of freedom of expression, all rights protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rigths. 12. In the light of the foregoing, the Working Group renders the following opinion: The deprivation of liberty of MrU Tin Oo is arbitrary being in contravention of articles 9, 10, 19, 20 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and falls within categories II and III of the categories applicable to the consideration of the cases submitted to the Working Group. 13. Consequent upon the opinion rendered, the Working Group requests the Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation, and bring it into conformity with the standards and principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Adopted on 26 May 2005 The law-and it galls me to call it that-under which Aung San Suu Kyi is currently charged is called the Law to Safeguard the State Against the Dangers of Those Desiring to Cause Subversive Acts 1975. The name says it all. It is an Orwellian sounding act, sometimes called the State Protection Act. It is an act that is used to silence any political contestation voice other than the military in Burma. MAIN COMMITTEE We know that there is a humanitarian crisis in Burma. People are hungry and children are malnourished-their development and growth stunted. Since 1990 the matter of human rights in Burma has been before the United Nations and resolutions have been passed every year since 1991. People like Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, the previous UN special rapporteur on human rights violations in Myanmar, has recently called for an inquiry that should happen through the Security Council. He is calling for a commission of inquiry into the human rights violations, possibly leading to an indictment being taken to the International Criminal Court, which can happen in that procedural way through the Security Council. I strongly endorse such a call. It is time. The generals have had long enough. Part of the reason that Aung San Suu Kyi has been charged is that somebody broke into her home in University Avenue and there is a law in Burma that to have a guest stay overnight you must have permission. When it was a socialist regime it was form 9; it is now just a rule that is enforced. If you do not have that permission, you have violated the law thereby endangering the state or whatever is determined at the time. This is what they are going on about with her at the moment. We also know that there is a constitutional crisis in Burma. Suu Kyi recently said, ‘We are facing a crisis of constitution, not a constitutional crisis.’ I want to note also that on Friday, 19 June it was Aung San Suu Kyi’s 64th birthday. A resolution was passed by all sides in this House and I also note that honourable senators passed a resolution in the Senate on Thursday, 18 June. On Thursday, 18 June all members overwhelmingly signed the card and some people ate some cake. I also note that Aung San Suu Kyi had a cake in prison. She shared that and the bit of food that she had with fellow prisoners and the guards. The purpose of the card was not only to wish her a happy birthday, as many people around the world have done-and there is a special website for it now-but also for us to say to her, ‘We wish you freedom, and anything at all that we can do, in our small way, we will do from here.’ It was nice to have the support of absolutely everybody. I also want to commend a couple of Australian companies, Downer EDI and QBE, for voluntarily withdrawing their operations in Burma this year. I just wanted to put that on the public record.

I second this motion, but I do so because I very much respect the work of the member for Page in relation to human rights issues generally. I think she has been quite remarkable in the way in which she has motivated many of us to become engaged in the issue relating to Aung San Suu Kyi. I commend her for her effort last Friday to record the 64th birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi and for coordinating the messages that could be sent to her because of the inspiration that she has been to so many people. I commend her on that. This motion was proposed at an earlier point in time, before Aung San Suu Kyi’s recent arrest. Although it observes, towards the end, something of the Security Council processes, it was intended to note 27 May as the 19th anniversary of the National League for Democracy’s overwhelming victory in Burma’s first democratically-held elections. I commend those who are interested in this matter to read the text of the motion, because it outlines much of the history of Aung San Suu Kyi’s circumstances and some of the efforts that are being made to secure her freedom. MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Statements By Members
289,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (7.00 Pm),"Australians often comment about the adversarialI wanted to spend a little of my time tonight noting what a special lady Aung San Suu Kyi has been. To have spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention, her commitment to democracy and her country have been inspirational. During the past 19 years she could have left Burma. She could have been free. However, she chose not to be. It meant that she did not get to see her husband before he passed away-something that she was prepared to endure for her cause. I think it is very important to commend the activities of organisations like Amnesty International. I also commend the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, whose op-ed I read last Friday, and I support the efforts to bring about change. I noticed some commentary in an interesting website called ‘Moreorless: heroes and killers of the 20th century’. It had this to say: The military dictators of Burma have turned a country that was once known as the “rice bowl of Asia”, and which is endowed with many natural riches, into a basket case. They have cynically manipulated and brutalised the country’s ethnic minorities, and suppressed those fighting for democracy. Suu Kyi is the symbol of the Burmese people’s struggle for freedom. Her poise, humility and integrity stand in stark counterpoint to secrecy and self-interest of the junta. The SPDC’s treatment of Suu Kyi is the yardstick of its commitment to democracy and human rights. So far it is not measuring up. Under its current leadership it is unlikely it ever will. The only hope for Burma appears to be the development of a fracture within the junta that leads to its collapse. This is unlikely while Burma’s neighbours-China, India and ASEAN-continue to either support Than Shwe and his cronies or condone them by their silence. That is a very short but perspicacious piece. I would encourage members to read the speech by Aung San Suu Kyi’s son in accepting her award of the Nobel Peace Prize, because it says something about the family’s commitment and about her. I noted in particular her son’s comment: I know that if she were free today my mother would, in thanking you, also ask you to pray that the oppressors and the oppressed should throw down their weapons and join together to build a nation founded on humanity in the spirit of peace. He goes on to say: Although my mother is often described as a political dissident who strives by peaceful means for democratic change, we should remember that her quest is basically spiritual. I think she is a remarkable lady with a remarkable family. This motion deserves support. (Time expired) Ms NEAL (Robertson) (7.05 pm)-I rise tonight to speak on the motion moved by the member for Page and to congratulate her on raising this very important matter today. I rise because this House cares and has grave concerns about the treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi at the hands of the dictatorial military regime of Burma. Since her return to Burma in 1988, Suu Kyi has been a beacon for freedom and human rights in that very troubled nation. In both her personal and public lives, Suu Kyi has inspired people in her own country and around the world through her unwavering fight to bring a democratically elected government to Burma. In 1988, mass demonstrations against the country’s military regime saw Burma thrown into turmoil. By October of that year, approximately 3,000 protesters had been killed. This civil disobedience forced the regime to call almost democratic elections. In 1990, Suu Kyi led the National League for Democracy to an overwhelming victory in Burma’s first democratic election. This was despite the fact that she and many other NLD officials and supporters were in MAIN COMMITTEE detention at the time of the vote. The NLD won almost 60 per cent of the valid vote and 80 per cent of the seats, but the military dictatorship imposed martial law and refused to recognise the election result. This constituted a gross violation of domestic and international law. Since those momentous occurrences, the Burmese regime has subjected Suu Kyi to years of unlawful incarceration and deprivation of liberty in one form or another. She has been detained for 13 out of the last 19 years. It should be noted with regret that, according to Amnesty International, up to 2,000 other supporters of democratic reform are also in detention in Burma. These people are political prisoners. An assassination attempt was made on Suu Kyi in 2003. I join with the member for Page in condemning in the strongest manner the actions of Burma’s State Peace and Development Council and its leader, Than Shwe. The continued unlawful detention of Suu Kyi on trumped-up charges is a violation of human rights that has been condemned by representative bodies around the world. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, has rightly said that the unlawful actions against Suu Kyi meant that the ‘honour and the credibility’ of the Burmese regime ‘are at stake’. I note with approval that the Australian foreign minister, Stephen Smith, has unreservedly condemned the continued detention of Suu Kyi. The minister has called for her ‘immediate and unconditional release’ and has reaffirmed the Australian government’s financial sanctions targeting senior members of the regime. The events in Burma since 1988 go to the heart of democratic principles, international law and human rights across the world. I welcome the Australian government’s strong stance on these matters. The trial of Suu Kyi that is underway at the moment is a sham being carried out under an oppressive and dictatorial regime. People around the world have united behind the calls for justice for Suu Kyi. They have also united to bring pressure to bear on the regime of Burma to make positive steps towards holding democratic elections in that country. The first step along this road is the immediate release of Suu Kyi and the dropping of the phoney charges against her. If Burma is to take its place in the world and be recognised as a nation that values democracy, human rights and the rule of law, Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy must be part of that process. Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize for her decades-long struggle for democracy in Burma. She too has called on the world to join that struggle, saying, ‘Please use your liberty to promote us.’ The Australian government has been steadfast in its support of Suu Kyi. I urge all Australians to show their solidarity with Suu Kyi and with the people of Burma. Change must come to Burma, and all Australians must do their bit to continue to fight for this to occur. Democracy, the NLD, was formed, with Suu Kyi as the general secretary. Since then she has been in this most remarkable position. I congratulate the member for Page, Janelle Saffin, for bringing forward this motion for Australians to continue to support Aung San Suu Kyi. Aung San Suu Kyi is influenced by both Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence and, more specifically, Buddhist concepts. Aung San Suu Kyi entered politics to work for democratisation, helped found the National League for Democracy on 27 September 1988 and was put under house arrest on 20 July 1989. She was offered her freedom if she left her country but she refused. One of her most famous speeches is the freedom from fear speech, which begins: MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Opinion No 11 2005 Union Of Myanmar
290,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (7.10 Pm),"In September 1988, the Burmese National League forIt is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it. In 1990, the military junta called a general election, which the National League for Democracy won with certainty. Being the candidate, Aung San Suu Kyi under normal conditions would have assumed the office of Prime Minister. Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power. Consequently, there was an international outcry, as there should have been. Aung San Suu Kyi was forced into house arrest at her home on University Avenue in Rangoon. During her arrest, she was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize the year after. Aung San Suu Kyi used that Nobel Peace Prize of US$1.3 million to set up a health and education trust for the Burmese people. Suu Kyi has been placed under house arrest on numerous occasions since she began her political career, spending 13 of the past 19 years under house arrest. During these periods, she has been barred from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. International visitors have likewise been prevented from meeting her. Suu Kyi met the leader of Burma, General Tan Shwe, who was accompanied by General Khint Yunt, on 20 September 1994 while under house arrest. It was the first meeting that she had had since she had been placed in detention. When the military government has released Suu Kyi from house arrest, it has made clear that if she left the country to visit her family in the United Kingdom it would not allow her to return. It is the unfortunate case that, after Suu Kyi underwent a hysterectomy in September 2003, the government again placed her under arrest in Rangoon. The results from UN facilitation have certainly been mixed. She has had the opportunity to meet special envoys from the UN, but that has led to no real outcome. There have been significant issues for the people of Burma, who have always sought to have her removed from detention. Many nations and figures have continued to call for her release and that of 2,001 other political prisoners in the country. The UN has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the junta and Suu Kyi. On6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the United Nations, the government released her and a government spokesman said that she was free to move because ‘we are confident that we can trust each other’. Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed that this was a new dawn for the country. However, on 30 May 2003, a government sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of Depayin, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. The government again imprisoned her in Rangoon. Aung San Suu Kyi has received vocal support from many Western nations in Europe, Australasia and North and South America, as well as India, Israel, Japan and South Korea. In December 2007, the US House of Representatives voted unanimously, 400 to zero, to award Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal. The Senate concurred on 25 April 2008. On6 May 2008 also, President Bush signed legislation awarding Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal. (Time expired) Ms REA (Bonner) (7.15 pm)-I, too, rise to support the motion put forward by the member for Page and, once again, in conjunction with others, I congratulate her on what is, I think, a very well-worded motion. I am very happy to endorse it. When I gave my first speech in this place early last year, I used a quote from Martin Luther King which said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere-a sentiment that at MAIN COMMITTEE the time expressed my personal view of the importance of fighting for justice and human rights across the world. As a statement. I think that defines the issue that we are trying to confront in Burma by supporting the National League for Democracy by calling for the immediate release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and for the brutal military regime in Burma come to an end. I did not know when I used that quote at that time that Martin Luther King actually said that on the day that I was born; I think it is an interesting coincidence that I chose it. Unfortunately, it is still a quote that is apt today. We live in a global village. That is why democratically elected members of parliaments across the world should stand in unison to call for the end of brutal regimes wherever they currently exist. We should stand together, and I see that, in terms of democratic parliaments, there is a very strong move across the globe, led by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and many other leaders to call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and to acknowledge the democratic leader of that country. Democracy is a very fragile beast, as we all know, and it does have its faults. But until we are presented with another form of government that promotes individual freedoms and support for the human rights of a nation’s citizens in a better way, we should all be calling at least for it to become much more widespread as a system of government. The democratic rights and human rights of individual citizens in a democratic nation with a free parliament and laws do not only protect the citizens of that country but, indeed, have an impact on all of us, and that is why I believe that the Martin Luther King quote is so important. I also think it is a responsibility of all of us, as community leaders, to support, as I said, the many comments and the moves from the United Nations and other organisations calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. I think we should support the statements that have already been made by many ASEAN leaders who are calling on the Burmese military regime to release her and to acknowledge her position as a democratically elected leader. I know I joined with others last Thursday in acknowledging her birthday. It was her 64th birthday. She has been in detention for 13 of the last 19 years, and has been the democratically elected leader of Burma for almost the last 20. It means that she was elected leader-and has since been in detention over that period of time-when she was just a year or two younger than me. I hope by the time. I reach my 64th birthday that not only will Aung San Suu Kyi be free but also the rights and freedoms of all Burmese citizens will be enshrined by their government, that they will enjoy the democratic freedoms that we enjoy and that we in this parliament will no longer need to move motions like this against the incarceration of democratically elected leaders. I hope that the world will have moved on. But unless the Burmese government releases the 2,000 political prisoners led by Aung San Suu Kyi, I fear that we are many years away not just from a democratically elected government in that nation but, unfortunately, also in others around the world. It is symbolic that they be released. It is important for the people of Burma but it is also important for us as global citizens. (Time expired) minders of how the hard-working people of many nations are held back by autocratic regimes. I see examples of countries where the potential of the nation, and particularly its people, is being held back by the lack of democracy. These are nations where the spirit, enterprise and hard work of even the poorest people are yoked by regimes dedicated to the maintenance of MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Opinion No 11 2005 Union Of Myanmar
291,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (7.20 Pm),"WheneverI look around the world, I always see retheir own power and wealth. The examples of such regimes are far too many, and the oppression will forever be intolerable. This motion, however, gives me the opportunity to speak on one example of an autocratic regime that oppresses democracy and its people in order to perpetuate its hold on power and its pursuit of self-interest. I speak of the Union of Myanmar-the nation that most of us still refer to as Burma. This motion notes that we have just passed the 19th anniversary of the 1990 general election that resulted in an overwhelming victory for Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, which won 392 of the 492 seats. Burma operated as a democracy between 1948, when it became independent from the United Kingdom, and 1962, when it became a military dictatorship. General Ne Win seized power, taking advantage of the instability of the democratic government. The people of Burma wanted a return to democracy and, from late 1985, student protests gathered in intensity. The result was the fall of the government on 8 August 1988 in what is called the Four Eights uprising. Tragically, General Saw Maung declared martial law and seized control. It was he who first formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which then suspended the constitution. Maung was replaced by Senior General Than Shwe in 1992, and in 1997 SLORC was renamed the State Peace and Development Council. It is right to say that name changes make no difference to the way a regime like this operates. Autocratic, self-serving regimes are defined by their record in murders, tortures, rapes, forced relocations, forced labour, recruitment of child soldiers and imprisonment of political opponents. Both SLORC and SPDC are condemned for their crimes against their own people. The outcomes for the people of Burma, which come from the oppression of the SPDC, are a failed economy and significant, widespread poverty. These are the usual economic hallmarks of regimes that hold the descriptors of dictatorships, communism or socialism. A sad example of classic mismanagement is the 2005 decision by the junta to establish a new capital, known as Naypyidaw. The regime determined that it would establish a brand new capital, and it has been reported that they began moving government departments when it was still completely undeveloped. It has been suggested that the move commenced at 6.37 am on 6 November 2005 because a monk had stated that this time and date was astrologically significant. On 11 November at 11 am the second wave, comprising 1,100 military trucks carrying 11 military battalions and 11 government departments, left Rangoon. It would appear that the emphasis on the number 11 suggests an adherence to superstitious reasons, but it caused great dislocation because of the insufficient infrastructure. It has also been said that the city has a huge development of tunnels under it to address the paranoia of the SPDC leadership, which fears either an internal insurrection or a foreign invasion. The regime seems to be increasingly guided by government-employed astrologers, which is shown by the creation of the new capital and which increasingly undermines any form of confidence in the new regime. It is therefore little wonder that the economy flounders and the people are increasingly impoverished. We know that Burma is a country torn by internal division and that the SPDC oppresses its ethnic minorities even more than the ethnic Burmese majority. Reconciliation with the ethnic tribes such as the Karen people can best be achieved through the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi. MAIN COMMITTEE I join with other speakers on this motion in calling on General Than Shwe to immediately and unconditionally release Aung San Suu Kyi, senior NLD leader, the courageous former general U Tin Oo, other members of the executive and all pro-democracy political prisoners in Burma. I will finish by saying that the SPDC, as the rulers of the Union of Myanmar, is a regime that has no legitimacy. It is corrupt, it is incompetent and it is holding the people of Burma and the ethnic minorities back. Only through that democracy will that country and all its people thrive. I think that all the people of that nation want the SPDC’s time to be over. I hope that, when the time comes, the cost of freedom, particularly in terms of human life, will be minimal. Finally, I thank the member for Page for the opportunity to speak on this worthy matter and for her work in this area. by a cold, but I will do everything I can to speak on behalf of the millions of Burmese who have no voice. I commend the member for Page for moving this motion and I commend the other members who have spoken in support of it. For many years Burma’s regime, the State Peace and Development Council, has shown a profound disregard for the human rights and democratic aspirations of the Burmese people. The Burmese regime has presided over the stark deterioration of the Burmese economy. Burma has become a poor and isolated country. In 1988, students, professionals and others launched a nationwide uprising aimed at bringing an end to authoritarian rule. Millions of people courageously marched on the streets, calling for freedom and democracy. The military responded by gunning down thousands of demonstrators and imprisoning thousands more in one of South-East Asia’s most bloody episodes. The most recognisable face of Burma, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been in and out of house arrest and prison since 1988. Her transgression, her crime, was to lead the National League for Democracy to a decisive election victory in 1990. She has not been convicted of any crime but has been held as a threat to national security. Faced with having to release her, even under its own draconian security law, the regime has now brought spurious charges relating to a minor incident. Aung San Suu Kyi has been formally charged with breaching the terms of her detention because a US citizen intruded into her compound. There is immense concern that her arrest and current trial is simply a device to extend her detention. This trial stands condemned by the international community. I welcome the strong statements in this respect from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and its member governments. This latest outrage shows yet again that the Burmese regime remains utterly indifferent to the views of the international community and human rights standards. The military regime continues its brutal domination over its people. Numerous governments, non-government organisations, United Nations bodies and international organisations have documented Burma’s widespread problems: intense human rights violations and the complete deterioration of health care, education and a functioning economy. The world further witnessed the Burmese government’s human rights violations in September 2008 during the ‘saffron revolution’. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in peaceful demonstration, led by Buddhist monks, demanding peace and freedom in their country-only to be countered with force. Thousands were imprisoned, hundreds were killed and monasteries were raided. The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma reported last year that MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Opinion No 11 2005 Union Of Myanmar
292,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (7.25 Pm),"My voice tonight is somewhat diminishedhe had received information indicating that the military regime had destroyed, forcibly displaced or forced the abandonment of more than 3,000 villages in eastern Burma, where ethnic minorities predominate. At least one million people fled their homes as a result of the attacks, escaping as refugees and internally-displaced persons. Organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First and Amnesty International have reported on the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed under the rule of Burma’s military regime, including the recruitment of tens of thousands of child soldiers and attacks on ethnic minority civilians. In December 2008, the UN General Assembly adopted by a vote of nearly four to one a resolution calling on Burma to free all political prisoners, including detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and criticising the human rights record of the Burmese regime. I raise my voice in support of that resolution, in support of her release from detention and in support of the release of all political prisoners in Burma. In closing, I will refer to the recommendations of Amnesty International in its report, Crimes against humanity in eastern Myanmar: Put an immediate halt to all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by government forces and aligned militias, including the targeting of civilians and civilian objects for attack, indiscriminate attacks, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings … Ensure that all acts violating international human rights and humanitarian law are subject to prompt, independent, and impartial investigations, and that suspected perpetrators, including those suspected of ordering these acts, regardless of rank, are brought to justice(Time expired) expired.

Poland Debate resumed from 16 June, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) 4 June 2009 was the 20th anniversary of the first post war free elections in Poland, and that these elections marked the end of undemocratic communist party rule in Poland; and (b) the example of free election in Poland led to the overthrow of all the communist regimes of central and eastern Europe, to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, and eventually also to the dissolution of the Soviet Union; (2) congratulates the people of Poland for their unbroken record of struggle over more than 60 years against both Nazi and Communist occupiers to regain their independence and restore democracy and freedom; and (3) notes that the restoration of democracy and a free market economy has led to the increasing security, prosperity and freedom which Poland has enjoyed since 1989, culminating in membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union. has been an enigma to many of us.

294,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (7.31 Pm),"Poland is one of those countries which, over the years,is appropriate in the Australian parliament, particularly given the fact that we have so many Australians of Polish origin living in our country, for us to pause for a moment on this 20th anniversary and give thanks to God, to Solidarity and to the collective democratic will of the Polish people for their capacity to throw off the yoke of communism and adopt a democratic system which for us in Australia is something which comes as second nature. We often take democracy for granted in this country, and yet in many parts of the world it is an aspiration which, in many cases, has been extraordinarily difficult to implement. I think that the late Pope John Paul II, as a Polish pope, was a role model and he assisted, along with the Solidarity forces, in bringing about democracy in Poland. Poland is a wonderful country. It has the capacity to make an incredible contribution to making the world an even better place. The fact that the people of Poland now have the democratic rights that we take for granted is something that we all ought to give thanks for, but the whole world benefits from the fact that we do now have a democratic Poland, able to take its place as an equal partner in the world community. In Australia, we have a Polish embassy that is highly respected and interacts well with the Polish community and the Australian community at large. Polish Australians have told me that, during the dark days of communism, the embassy of the so-called People’s Republic of Poland was seen as a place of repression. It was seen as a place that spied on Australians of Polish origin. Under successive ambassadors in Australia, the Embassy of the Republic of Poland has interacted with the Polish community but, more importantly, has interacted with ordinary Australians who are very keen to foster the wonderful relationship that now exists between the Republic of Poland and Australia. Australia is often referred to as ‘the lucky country’, and we are in many respects. We might differ in our politics but then, of course, we will have a cup of coffee or a drink or something like that and politics tends to be a contest of ideas. We all accept that every three years we have an election and the people of Australia or the state, as the case may be, determine the government that they are going to have. In Poland, for approximately half a century, the people did not have that right. They had more religious freedom than some other parts of Europe but less than we have. I believe it is appropriate on this 20th anniversary that we salute the government and the people of Poland and we ought to wish them well for the future. (Time expired) bringing forward this motion. Having been adversely affected by two world wars and fighting and struggling for the last 60 years, it is good to see Poland developing as a country in the way it is at the moment. Poland suffered for 40 years under a communist regime and prior to that it was, as we all know, invaded by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It is important to note the spirit of the Polish people. The Polish people in about 1980 brought about the formation of the independent trade union Solidarity, which became the pinnacle body in establishing democracy in Poland. Lech Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, went on to become the first elected President of Poland. They are the things that we should be celebrating today. This reform was not something that just happened by chance; it was designed by the Polish people themselves. This reform movement that ended communism in eastern Europe started in Poland. MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Opinion No 11 2005 Union Of Myanmar
295,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (7.35 Pm),"I want to start by thanking the member for Fisher forSince the end of communism Polish democracy has developed rapidly, despite various difficulties. In 1991, as part of its involvement with the European Union, Poland was one of the first to sign its agreement with Hungary, making a significant change from a communist state involved in a determined economy to an open, free market economy-and that has continued. Thanks to those pioneers, since 2001, 85 per cent of the Polish trade is on a bilateral basis. In 1999 we saw Poland make attempts in terms of its involvement with the Western Europe allies in becoming a valued, strategic partner of NATO. In 2003 the Polish people supported the US-led military intervention in Iraq and became one of the largest European state unions by 2004. Unfortunately, the Polish people feel that a lot of their more recent history has gone unnoticed. That is why in 2009 they embarked on having a national celebration of the Polish 20year anniversary since their first postwar elected government. At the celebration Lech Walesa said: We managed to end an era of divisions, mistakes and confrontation. No other generation had a chance to try to achieve that. I think that was very pertinent. The first Polish Prime Minister, Mr Mazowiecki, said: Twenty years ago, what seemed impossible became possible. These are not things in our distant past; they are things in our very, very recent past-and these are things that we should be celebrating. I think it is appropriate at this particular point in time that we remember the struggles that the Polish people endured to deliver a free and open society-a society which is now one of Europe’s leading economies. The date 4 June 1989 marked a decisive victory for democracy in Poland and, ultimately, across eastern Europe. Regrettably, 4 June 1989 also marked the terrible atrocities and sacrifice of Tiananmen Square, when China crushed the peaceful pro-democracy protest. We have a duty to bring the joy of freedom and democracy to others and this means supporting the courageous efforts of individuals, notably Aung San Suu Kyi and her battles as Burmese opposition leader. I also think this anniversary of the Polish liberalisation is an opportunity to send a sign of solidarity to nations struggling for freedom, including North Korea, Cuba, Iran and Burma. that notes the 20th anniversary of postwar free elections in Poland and the part played by Poland in the collapse of communism in eastern Europe. There are more than 164,000 people of Polish descent living in Australia and almost half of them were born in Poland. Reflecting the existing and developing relationship between Australia and Poland, apart from the embassy in Canberra, consulates or honorary consuls are maintained in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria. Indicative of the heritage of the strong Polish community in Australia, on 6 June this year the 41st convention of the Polish Community Council of Australia and New Zealand took place. Committed to the promotion of Polish-Australian matters and interests, the convention decided to create a team with representatives across the country whose task will be to respond appropriately to any anti-Polish activities. MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Opinion No 11 2005 Union Of Myanmar
296,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (7.40 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motionWith regard to the motion before us, it would be absolutely correct to say that Poland has always played a significant part in European history. As this motion properly states, Poland, in many ways, led the way out from underneath the communist shadow that had enshrouded eastern Europe following World War II. The communism brought to bear by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had proven to be a spectacular economic failure and the eastern bloc of nations could easily see the significant difference between standards of living in countries across Europe. It was in 1980 when dissatisfaction with pay and other conditions under the communist regime resulted in the independent union, Solidarity, being established. Solidarity’s origins were in a strike at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, with Lech Walesa becoming its leader. The strike led to more strikes in Gdansk and then to strikes across Poland. The communist government agreed to legal organisations and Solidarity began. In 1981, however, martial law was declared on 13 December. On the same day, Walesa was arrested. After being jailed for 11 months, he returned to the Gdansk shipyards as an electrician in 1983, the same year he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. From 1987 to 1990, he again led Solidarity, which assumed the position of the opposition. The opposition provided by Solidarity to the communist regime allowed the people of Poland a focus on the pursuit of democratic reform. Another occupational strike in Gdansk led to the government agreeing to the legalisation of Solidarity and the free election of 36 per cent of seats in the Sejm, the Polish parliament. In 1989, Solidarity won all of the 36 per cent of free election seats available in the parliament and all but one seat in the newly created Senate. After that victory, Walesa was able to create a non-communist government by persuading the allies of the Communist Party to desert to his opposition group. Under Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, these conditions then allowed the reformist government to pursue a market based economy. In 1990, Lech Walesa became President. It is widely considered that, as a result of those changes, the Polish economy is one of the best in the old eastern European bloc of nations. The advantage ex-socialist states have is that they have the capacity to privatise a significant number of enterprises. Even now, I understand that the government is in the middle of floating a number of publicly owned businesses and the Polish stock exchange has been thriving, although the world financial challenges have damaged the Polish economy. Nevertheless, admission of Poland to NATO in 1999 and, in 2004, to full membership of the European Union clearly represents the progress that has been made. There is no doubt that the democratic spirit is strong in Poland. The events of history had caused it to be interrupted in the last century, but it is nevertheless a tradition of Poland. As fearsome as the USSR and its satellite communist governments were, the actions of the Polish people have shown courage and fortitude. They adopted a position of leadership and clearly they were the first of the eastern bloc nations to realise the democratic dream in the contemporary period. I will conclude by speaking briefly of the Polish community in the northern and northeastern suburbs of Perth. I recently attended a function at the Cracovia Club in Beechboro. It is clear that, although there are not very large groups of Poles in Perth, the culture and the sporting traditions of Poland are strong. The Poles who live in my electorate have embraced Australia, but they retain their feelings for their mother country and a strong cultural heritage. MAIN COMMITTEE The Polish people have done well in Australia, and I am confident that they will continue to make a strong contribution into the future. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (7.45 pm)-I stand to also support the motion by the member for Fisher that the House recognise the 20th anniversary, on 4 June 2009, of the first postwar free elections in Poland, which marked the end of Communist rule in that country. As has been noted in the debate, this precipitated the overthrow of all the Communist regimes in central and eastern Europe, finally leading to the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the progression of Poland to the modern, vibrant country it is today. Indeed, before the impact of the global financial crisis, Poland had one of the fastest growing economies in central Europe, with an annual growth rate of over six per cent. I suppose that there, as in many countries, they have suspended that sort of growth, but that will return. The marking of this anniversary will be of great significance to those of Polish heritage living in Australia. In the 2006 census, almost one per cent of the population of Australia claimed Polish ancestry and, of those persons who were born in Poland-and the majority were-most arrived pre-1991. It is obviously a good sign for Poland that fewer people are emigrating to Australia now. Newcastle has a proud Polish community, with a higher than average percentage of the population of Newcastle being of Polish ancestry. The strong and thriving Polish community in Newcastle is just one of our many ethnic communities. Having always been a city that prides itself on its multicultural background, it is of particular importance to note that next week the Ethnic Communities Council of Newcastle and the Hunter Region will hold the official opening of its new premises, Diversity Learning and Community Centre. This centre will play an integral role for the multicultural community of Newcastle, providing a unique location for the extensive work of the Ethnic Communities Council of Newcastle and the Hunter Region, as well as providing an invaluable community asset which will serve as a focal point of current and future community initiatives. As the executive officer of the Ethnic Communities Council of Newcastle and the Hunter Region, John Gebhardt OAM, recounted to me, ‘This event is of great significance because it is a milestone in the evolution of an active and vibrant multicultural community which has been part of Newcastle and the Hunter’s history.’ I must also compliment Mr Gebhardt: he is of Polish descent and a great dancer-I have seen him in action-but he has also talked to me on many occasions of his time as an early immigrant in Australia in the Greta Migrant Camp, quite a huge postwar camp. Those experiences tested those communities, and strengthened them, in many ways. It is always lovely to share in their recollections; some of them are very tough and others are joyful. SoI do thank John Gebhardt for all the help he has given to me as the federal member. Immigration has been a significant element in the social, cultural and economic growth of the area of Newcastle and it continues to make a major contribution to our region. The Diversity Learning and Community Centre further represents the productive partnership between state and federal governments and the input of volunteers in not-for-profit community organisations like the Ethnic Communities Council of Newcastle and the Hunter Region. What began as a modest, meagre shell of an old bowling club has now been transformed into a facility that houses the functional offices of the organisation, driving valuable and essential community projects, one of only a few such facilities in the state of New South Wales. MAIN COMMITTEE This has come about through an investment of hundreds of hours of volunteer service from a band of dedicated and motivated individuals, and has resulted in a new home for multicultural communities in Newcastle. Along with the then Minister for Employment Participation and now Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Brendan O’Connor, I visited the centre to see the results of this hard work from the individuals involved, who were ably assisted by a federal government Work for the Dole scheme. I must say I was impressed with the good old fashioned elbow grease that had gone into fixing up the place-obviously, elbow grease and a lot of commitment. The graduation ceremony for those Work for the Dole participants, many of whom had stayed on to continue their work voluntarily, allowed me and the minister to see how the development of the centre was progressing, helped of course by $85,432 provided by the Rudd Labor government towards that project. I am sure the finished project will be even more impressive when it is opened next Monday. Let us hope that the centre will be a heart of the community for all ethnic groups in Newcastle. I wish the Ethnic Communities Council of Newcastle all the best for the future, recognising the important part it plays. But I also wish the Polish community great joy in the continuing success of Poland under democratic government. expired.

After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well”; and (b) that the Turkish nation is now a friendly power and members of the Turkish community have now successfully integrated into Australian society; (2) celebrates and commends the achievements and contributions of the Turkish community here in the Commonwealth of Australia in the 42 years since their arrival; (3) acknowledges the unique relationship that exists between Australia and Turkey, a bond highlighted by both nations’ commitment to the rights and liberties of our citizens and the pursuit of a just world, highlighted by the statement of Ataturk “Peace at Home, Peace in the World”; (4) commends the Republic of Turkey’s commitment to the shared values of democracy, the rule of law and secularism; and (5) on the 42nd anniversary of the Formal Agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Turkey concerning the Residence and Employment of Turkish Citizens in Australia, pledges our friendship, commitment and enduring support to the people of Turkey as we celebrate this important occasion together.

297,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ar Bevis),"Order! The time allotted for this debate hasMs VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (7.50 pm)-I begin by congratulating the member for Melbourne Ports on his private member’s motion. It is a timely motion and one that I am very pleased to speak to this evening. My electorate of Calwell has the largest Turkish-speaking constituency in Australia. In the 42 years since the signing of a formal migration agreement between Turkey and Australia, significant communities have grown throughout the country but it is Melbourne that boasts the highest number of Turkish Australians. Let me say a few words about Australia’s relationship with the Republic of Turkey. Our two countries share a unique bond. We have a common history of significant loss and supreme sacrifice. Thousands of young Australians lost their lives in a place very far away from home. Today Gallipoli is a sacred place visited by many Australians across generations, particularly on ANZAC Day. It is also a sacred place for the Turkish people and we remember those events together each year. I want to pay tribute to Mr Ramazan Altintas, who is the founder of the Turkish sub-branch of the RSL. As Ramazan once told me, it was not easy initially to convince the RSL to establish a Turkish sub-branch, but he persisted and eventually won the support of Bruce Ruxton, who was himself a regular attendee at the ANZAC Day event until his retirement some years ago. This is a significant measure of the maturity of Australia’s relationship with Turkey but also a sign of the successful integration of Turkish Australians in the broader community. Today the Republic of Turkey is a friendly power and enjoys the status of warm, peaceful friendship and mutual respect with Australia. Our relationship is a result of 42 years of migration between Turkey and Australia. The Turkish community proudly commemorated this milestone with a year-long cultural and artistic program. I was fortunate enough to attend some of these activities and they were very impressive indeed. Now in its second to third generation, the Turkish community can rightfully claim success stories in all fields, especially education and commerce. One example in particular stands out, and tonight I want to pay tribute to the late Mustafa Ilhan, better known to us as John Ilhan of Crazy John’s fame. His is the consummate migrant success story, and no-one tells it more proudly than Mr Ali Ilhan, the patriarch of the Ilhan family. Ali is my constituent and over the years I have come to know him well. He brought his young family-two sons and a daughter-to Australia many years ago, settled in Broadmeadows and went to work at the local Ford factory, an employer of many Turkish migrants. I know that Ali is proud of his family and in particular his late son Mustafa, who not only was a spectacular success in business but also gave back to his local community, never forgetting his roots and humble beginnings. Tragically, Mustafa died all too young. A park at a sporting facility in Broadmeadows has recently been renamed in John Ilhan’s memory and honour. Broadmeadows has a very special place in the history of Australian Turkish migration. Many of my constituents tell me that, when the first plane load of Turkish migrants arrived at Tullamarine airport following the 1967 agreement, they went straight from the aeroplane to the Maygar barracks in Broadmeadows, which had become a hostel for these new migrants. If Broadmeadows has the largest concentration of Turkish Australians, it is precisely because most of them did some time in the barracks and then chose to settle in and around the local area. They built a strong presence with mosques, schools and shops, just like any other large migrant community that came before them. MAIN COMMITTEE But, like so many of us, Turkish migrants encountered much prejudice in the early years. They worked hard to overcome stigma and embrace their Australian-Turkish identity with pride. They have come a long way, with the current Prime Minister of Turkey, Tayyip Erdogan, visiting Broadmeadows a few years ago. In his speech, Prime Minister Erdogan affirmed how far those in this community have come and congratulated them on their achievements. The leadership and strength shown by the Turkish community, during trying times, is exemplary. None of us can forget the repercussions of September 11, 2001: overnight, law abiding community members were suddenly seen no longer as Australians of migrant background but primarily as Muslims. I know the angst this created for many. I also know that it was the local Turkish community who rose to the challenge and helped build bridges through interfaith and intercommunity dialogue. It is appropriate at this point to commend Mr Ibrahim Delal and Mr Orhan Cicek for their efforts in that venture. I also want to warmly thank the local Turkish community for the support they have given me over the years. To be of Greek origin and represent in the federal parliament the largest Turkish-speaking community in Australia is an honour and a rare phenomenon. It says a lot about the cohesiveness of our multicultural society, its diversity and indeed its strength. the motion put forward by the member for Melbourne Ports. I note the member for Calwell’s comments about the Turkish RSL sub-branch here in Australia. I visited her electorate, when I was Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, to attend a very large Turkish function. We have had a unique relationship with the Republic of Turkey. Today we celebrate and once again commit ourselves as a nation and as members of parliament to continue to build on that relationship, which established itself not necessarily 40 years ago but following the First World War. The immortal words of the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, ultimately gave rise to the friendship we have with the people of Turkey as Australians and in this parliament. Australia lost more than 8,000 young Australians on the shores of Gallipoli. The Turkish people lost something like 80,000 of their population. British, Indians, French and South Africans were also lost. It is very hard to comprehend the loss and sacrifice on both sides. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk said these wonderful words in the 1930s: You the mothers who sent their sons from far away countries wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. Having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well. I think those words are what started to grow the relationship and break down some mistrust and bitter memories of the loss on both sides at the time of the First World War. When Australia landed on Turkish shores at Gallipoli in the First World War as part of the ANZAC forces, as a young nation with less than five million people it was a time in our history when we lost our innocence forever. As Minister for Veterans’ Affairs from 1996 to 2001, I had the great privilege of travelling on a number of occasions to Turkey and to Canakkale, the region where Gallipoli is located. I was able to establish a new site for the dawn service to be held outside of the Commonwealth war grave. Imagine going to another country and seeking some of their sovereign land to place a memorial where Australia as a nation could commemorate our landing on their shores during the First World War. I had great cooperation from the governor of the Canakkale area MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Opinion No 11 2005 Union Of Myanmar
298,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (7.55 Pm),"I rise with great pride this evening to supportand from the minister and from the highest level of government in Turkey. That site has become a place of pilgrimage for so many young Australians, reinforcing the relationship between Australia and Turkey. I am told that the majority of Australians who were at the dawn service at Gallipoli this year were under the age of 25. What that says to me is that the relationship will only strengthen, given that a younger generation has now taken up what is their gift forever, the touchstone of what it means to be Australian, the place where Australia came of age as a nation and where that ANZAC spirit was born. Since the start of Turkish migration to Australia, the Turkish people have brought an enormous amount to our country and contributed in so many ways, not only making us a more culturally diverse nation but bringing with them things that have only made Australia a better place. Of course, from the trade point of view, our trade with the Turkish nation grows year on year, and that is another positive. I also want to mention the great embassy that they have established here in Canberra. The ambassadors and their staff and spouses have also made a great contribution to the community here in Canberra. It is not just about the relationship and the celebration of the 42 years since those agreements were signed but about the fact that the Turkish people and the Turkish nation have a real commitment through the embassy to build and grow this relationship. (Time expired) Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (8.00 pm)-I rise tonight in support of the motion before the House, which, rightly, celebrates and commends the achievements and contributions of the Turkish community to our nation. We are celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the agreement between the two governments in regard to the residence and employment of Turkish citizens in Australia. It is the case that our two countries have established a unique relationship and bond based upon the sacrifices of the young men of both nations at Gallipoli. In commemoration of that bond I am proud to recount tonight the details of a ceremonial event that has been conducted in my electorate of Throsby since 2005. The event is known as the Friendship for Life ceremony, initiated by the Port Kembla RSL sub-branch in conjunction with the local Turkish community. The annual ceremony offers a unique opportunity to not only honour our fallen war dead but also celebrate the notions of mutual respect and friendship between the two nations. The acknowledgment that these values can be attained and strengthened even in times of conflict is a crucial lesson for our children and society in general. We will continue to promote the desire for peace and understanding among all people. The Friendship for Life ceremony was the idea of a young Turkish woman, Songul Demirci, who was touched by the famous words of the first president of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, when he stated of the ANZACs fallen at Gallipoli: After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well. Those very famous words, of course, are recounted in the motion in the House this evening. The words of this pledge of friendship promoted the creation of the Friendship for Life association, with the support and guidance of the late Ray Wetherall, president of the sub-branch, and that tradition has been followed on by his son Terry and family. The event every year continues in association, as I said earlier, between the Port Kembla sub-branch and our local Turkish community. Since 2005 we have held the annual celebration at the RSL club. This celebration has included local politicians, representatives of the RSL and representatives of the military; comMAIN COMMITTEE munity groups, including the Wollongong Brass Brand and the Wollongong Harmony Chorus; and local school students, including students of Turkish descent who attend Sule College and students from our public schools in that local area. Most importantly, the ceremony commits to the bonds of friendship in our local community. We have also seen very high-level representation, including the Turkish military attache, the Turkish consulate general from Sydney and the president of the New South Wales Turkish RSL, who have all at different times since 2005 participated and paid their respects to this shared heritage between our two nations. Friendship for Life celebrates the mutual respect and friendship between Australian and Turkish forces that transcended the Gallipoli campaign, and we hope to continue to expand upon the stated values of the organisation-that is, the values of friendship, respect, peace, honour, goodwill, humanity and tolerance. To this end, plans are afoot to introduce the Friendship for Life ceremony nationally over the years ahead. This year at the local ceremony we were pleased to have been joined by Don Rowe OAM, Deputy National President and New South Wales State President of the RSL. To aid in achieving its goals, the Friendship for Life association is intent upon maintaining and building relationships with the RSL of Australia, other multicultural and religious groups, businesses, government and the community at large. I am sure that the success of the ceremony and the message it brings will be further strengthened by the strategies for future growth and the ongoing support of our community and local politicians. It is cause for great pride to me that this ceremony had its inception in my electorate of Throsby. The association has done a fine job in conceiving the ceremony, and it is proof of the drive, initiative and activism within the electorate and within my local Turkish community. Hopefully, with continued support, the Friendship for Life ceremony and the values it represents will become celebrated around the nation. cant statue, and it is of course of Ataturk. It is at the base of that statue that those famous words that the member for Maranoa repeated in this chamber earlier tonight appear. But not too many people know that there is another statue of Ataturk on a headland overlooking the sea in Australia. You might ask: ‘Why is there a statue of Ataturk? Where is it?’ Western Australians will know: it is in Albany. And why is it in Albany? That statue and its commemoration of Ataturk tells part of the story of the special relationship between Australia and Turkey. On1 November 1914, 30,000 Australian and New Zealand troops departed from Albany. They were the first ANZAC convoy to leave Australia and were bound for training in Egypt and then on to Gallipoli. Many of the soldiers who left Albany that day would never see Australia again. Over 8,000 Australians died at Gallipoli. Ataturk’s famous words, ‘After having lost their lives on this land, they have become our sons as well,’ also now appear on the Kemal Ataturk Memorial on ANZAC Parade here in Canberra. The City of Albany remembers the words and the actions of Ataturk. He is commemorated by the statue on the headland as well as by Ataturk Channel in the Princess Royal Harbour. There is nothing quite as special as having the privilege of being at ANZAC Cove on ANZAC Day. This was the day in 1915 when, many historians argue, Australia finally stepped off the coattails of Britain and became a nation in its own right. Both Australia and Turkey regard the 1915 Gallipoli landings as an event of particular significance in their modern histories. Every year, a growing number of Australian and Turkish citizens attend commemorative services at MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Opinion No 11 2005 Union Of Myanmar

Debate resumed from 15 June. That grievances be noted. Maranoa Electorate: Roads very important highway in my electorate. It is a national highway. It is the Warrego Highway. I have just come from a meeting with senior people from British Gas, who hold the tenements around Chinchilla for coal seam methane gas, which will all be part of a huge development over the next four to five years to send coal seam methane gas compressed to Gladstone, where it will be exported as liquefied natural gas. Why do I talk about the cultivation of the Surat Basin and its important link to the Warrego Highway? The Warrego Highway starts just west of Brisbane, just after the Ipswich Bypass. It travels through Toowoomba and goes all the way west to Morven. This highway across the basin is a major national arterial road. It connects the port of Brisbane right through to Mount Isa and on to Darwin. It is a major trade route, if I could put it that way. The coalition, when we were in government, started to put significant sums of money into this highway. We duplicated the Gatton Bypass east of Toowoomba. It is two lanes each way and a divided highway. We bypassed the town of Oakey. Prior to that, the Warrego Highway went through the wonderful and very beautiful Oakey, but it went through its main street. We then realigned the highway west of Dalby to get away from flood prone areas. Then we upgraded the highway from Morven, at the western end, right through to Mitchell to allow type 2 road train access east of Morven through to Mitchell.

302,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Je Moylan),The question is:,179,Grievance Debate
303,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (8.30 Pm),"I rise in this grievance debate to talk about aWhat is a type 2 road train? It is a road train that has three trailers and they are configured going both ways. The main ones coming east will be bringing live cattle to the major centre of Roma, which is the largest store cattle selling centre in Australia. These cattle, which are on these type 2 road trains-three trailers pulled by one prime mover-could have come from Kununurra in Western Australia. Does that sound incredible? It is not. It happens quite regularly. They come in from the Barkly Tableland. They are coming from around Cloncurry and up in the Gulf. They are coming to the largest store cattle selling centre in Australia. The beef producers and large parcel companies make these decisions because that is where they get the best rate for the cattle. We did a great deal whilst we were in government and we would have committed some $128 million had we been re-elected at the last federal election. I acknowledge that the Labor Party has committed some $55 million to the Warrego Highway, $40 million to upgrade Mitchell to Roma and some $15 million for the highway east of Dalby through to Toowoomba for passing lanes and rest areas. The urgency, and why I am in this grievance debate here tonight, is the development, and the escalation of development, in the coal seam methane gas area and the electricity generation construction that has gone on, tapping into the gas of the coal seam methane resource in the Dalby-Chinchilla-Miles-Roma area. The amount of freight on that highway is escalating day by day. According to the Queensland Department of Main Roads, the traffic volumes on the Warrego Highway vary from about 23,000 vehicles per day near Toowoomba to around some 600 per day at Morven, which is right at the western end of this highway. WhilstI acknowledge that the government has put forward $55 million, my plea to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government is to bring forward the money to upgrade the Warrego Highway as a matter of high priority because, in many areas, this road is going to deteriorate rapidly and before that $55 million can be spent over the next five years. It is in urgent need of that money right now. Also complicating and adding to the pressure on the Warrego Highway is the announcement from the Queensland government that they are now going to be moving out of Queensland Rail. Already we see nearly all the grain that is grown in the Darling Downs and the western Darling Downs carried by road. It is madness, but that is what is happening. We are now also seeing coal from the coal mines in this coal seam methane gas area-Acland, McAlister and Peabody-going to power stations at Swanbank and down to the port of Brisbane by road. As a motorist, it is not unusual to find yourself driving east of Dalby and seeing half a dozen trucks with trailers behind them carting grain through to Brisbane, when it should have been on rail-a bulk commodity that could have been transported by rail rather than by road. We will see increased pressure on this highway and increased pressure on the travelling motorist-people on business trips, tourists and school buses. They will be at real risk as the density of the transport sector escalates because of the development of the coal seam methane gas industry and also because so much of the grain and coal that could have been carried on Queensland Rail is now starting to move by road onto the Warrego Highway. I will just give you some idea of the cattle wagon capacity that Queensland Rail once had and the points that Queensland Rail used to transport cattle from. There used to be some 300 points where they would load and unload cattle-obviously at markets-and they are now down to 17. The number of wagons to cart these cattle-what they call K wagons-have been MAIN COMMITTEE halved to just around 500 across the length and breadth of Queensland. Queensland is the largest cattle state in Australia. By value of export from the state of Queensland, the beef industry ranks No. 2. That gives you some idea of the importance of the beef industry to Queensland and the national economy. So much freight that could have been carried by rail is now moving to road and putting increased pressure on many roads-but, in this case, the Warrego Highway. We are going into winter and, by the look of the plantings that have gone on, we are going to have another good crop-I hope a record crop-of winter grains. Sitting in pads and silos across the Darling Downs and right out to Roma is the grain that was harvested last year, in 2008, and, in some cases, the sorghum that was harvested in early 2008, and we are on the brink, perhaps in six months, of another wheat crop, which will add to the volume of freight that has to be transported out of the area to the destination. And, of course, Queensland Rail are not going to be in the market to do this. In fact, I think their grain trains have gone from five to about one operating at the moment. So, compounding the problems for the Warrego Highway and the urgent need for this money to be brought forward is the volume of freight that is coming off rail and onto road and the development of the Surat coal seam methane gas area, where we have some major companies-British Gas, ConocoPhillips in partnership with Origin through Australia-Pacific LNG, Santos and Dutch Shell with Arrow. They tell me that, in the coal seam methane gas area, there is more potential gas in this region than there is the North West Shelf of Australia. Complicating that of course is the Xstrata coalmine. They propose to be exporting coal out of the Wandoan coalmine by 2014. It would be the second largest coalmine in Australia, with an export capacity of 30 million tonnes per year. These are all resources that create great wealth for our nation, but we do need the infrastructure-in this case, the road infrastructure-to make sure that we can realise the full potential of these industries, whether it is in the agricultural sector or the minerals from coal and the development of the coal seam methane gas industry. Of course, also coming on the back of that(Time expired) Throsby Electorate: Higher Education Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (8.40 pm)-My contribution to the grievance debate tonight mirrors an issue I raised in the very early days following my election to the federal parliamentnamely, the underrepresentation of children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds in higher education. Back in 2003, I argued that, despite the fact that greater numbers of young people were completing year 12, in my view: … there are systemic problems which continue to deny students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds the chance of obtaining a university education. I pointed out that the younger generation in the electorate of Throsby did not ‘appear to be getting significantly better opportunities and outcomes than their parents did’. I looked just recently at the 2006 census data, and I want to rely on some of that data to make my point this evening. The data shows that, in my electorate, 2,113 persons were attending university either as full-time or part-time students, but they in fact were a mere 2.2 per cent of people aged 15 and above in the electorate. Another 3,144 were enrolled at TAFE, but in that cohort they were overwhelmingly enrolled as part-time students. When you look at the MAIN COMMITTEE composition of people in Throsby with a university qualification, there are some 5,120 people who have a bachelor’s degree, or 5.3 per cent of constituents, and overall 7.8 per cent of constituents over the age of 21 have a university qualification at either bachelor or a higher level-some 6,706 people. When looking at higher education participation rates of persons aged 17 to 22, the census data revealed some interesting statistics. The rate of participation in my electorate was 14.8 per cent. In fact, the electorate of Throsby, when we looked at the rankings of all electorates, ranked 133rd out of the 150 federal electorates. If the rate of participation in university education in Throsby is around 15 per cent, let us look at how that compares with the highparticipation seats. In the seat of Curtin it is 49 per cent. So, in 2006, 49 per cent of all people aged 17 to 22 in the Curtin electorate were participating in higher education. In Kooyong, it was 48.8 per cent; Bradfield, 47½ per cent; Higgins, 47½ per cent; Ryan, 45½ per cent; North Sydney, 44.9 per cent; and Wentworth, the seat of the Leader of the Opposition, 41.7 per cent. I think those figures speak very clearly for themselves and point to the huge inequity in regard to the life chances of people and their options to participate in university. Back in 2005, on figures supplied in reply to a question on notice I asked, it was estimated that 16 per cent of domestic students at our local university, the University of Wollongong, were from a low SES postcode. In fact, only around 12 per cent of all the undergraduate students enrolled at our local university were resident in my electorate. I was heartened recently to read some of the data produced by the Bradley review of higher education. I am pleased that the Bradley review investigated in some detail this issue of inequity in higher education participation and concluded-and I quote from the report: Australia has not provided equal access to all groups in our society. Definitely the findings confirmed the concerns that I have always held and about which I have had the opportunity to speak in this House. The Bradley review pointed to the underrepresentation of not just people from lower SES backgrounds but also young people from regional and remote Australia and, very obviously, the low participation rates among Indigenous Australians compared to the general population. The Bradley report showed that the participation rate for low SES students overall in Australia was 15 per cent-pretty close to the figures that I referred to earlier from the University of Wollongong. That was much lower than the overall 25 per cent representation of people in the general population. The Bradley report argued that a student from a high socioeconomic background is about three times more likely to attend university than a student from a low SES background. It went on to show that the participation rates have remained relatively unchanged since 2002. WhatI found interesting among the data was that, once at university, it appears that a student’s background does not negatively affect their chances of completing the course they undertake. Quite distinct differences exist in low SES participation by type of institution or university, by the courses undertaken and by the field of study. Not surprisingly, low SES students are poorly represented in the Group of Eight universities, poorly represented in the fields of architecture and law, and grossly underrepresented in the fields of medicine, dentistry and economics. I found this general situation applied also in the data and figures I obtained in MAIN COMMITTEE response to inquiries about which faculties the students from Throsby ended up in. That general finding applied there as well. Not surprisingly for all of us, the statistics also confirmed that Indigenous people are vastly underrepresented. While access rates for Indigenous people remain well below the levels required to achieve equitable representation, an equally important issue for Indigenous students is that of success and retention once enrolled. The Bradley review concluded that: … social inclusion must be a core responsibility for all institutions that accept public funding, irrespective of history and circumstances. I agree. Very importantly, our Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister, has made the issue of equity in higher education a key concern in the reform process that she has commenced in the tertiary sector. The Deputy Prime Minister has made it clear that she will vigorously pursue the ambition that by 2020 20 per cent of all higher education enrolments should be people from low SES backgrounds. That would require some 55,000 additional student enrolments on top of the current 92,000 students from low SES backgrounds to meet the goal. So it will require a quantum leap in the number of students if that ambition of the Deputy Prime Minister is to be fulfilled. Evidence from the Bradley report suggests that patterns of social and educational disadvantage are experienced well before people reach the point of considering whether university is possible and relevant for them. It follows therefore that programs focused solely on the higher education sector can only partially influence the problem and come up with the solutions. We know that endemic educational disadvantage begins in the earliest years of schooling and is often reinforced by low achievement and parental influences. We need improved efforts to increase school retention and student achievement and to raise aspirations in regard to the chances of people going on to higher education. We need more outreach programs and pathways that circumvent competitive entry based on academic achievement alone, such as teacher recommendations or other forms of interview that I know apply in some of our tertiary institutions. Certainly more scholarships and other financial incentives for students from rural communities and for Indigenous students will also be required. I end my grievance on a positive note. I am delighted that the concerns I have raised since being elected to this parliament have now been taken seriously by the Rudd Labor government. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister on her committed stand on this important national issue. Wimmera Mallee Pipeline Project Youth Allowance time permitting. The first of these is the piping of the Wimmera Mallee stock and domestic system-a huge project entirely contained within the federal division of Mallee, which is well over 100 years of age now. It is the largest open-channel water supply system in the world. We are so close now to having it completely piped, with pumping and a much more efficient use of water. It is a scheme that wasted enough water in one year to fill Olympic swimming pools stacked end to end all the way from Melbourne to Darwin and back again. It served its MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Grievance Debate
304,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (8.50 Pm),"I rise in this grievance debate to raise several matters,purpose. It was an engineering achievement at its time, at the start of the century, and it took 60 years to build; but it badly needed to be piped. Prior to the last election, it was decided that there was a need to complete the rest of the project, because it is quite comprehensive and covers one-third of the geographic area of Victoria, and that a further $372 million was needed. The project has been funded in a three-way partnership, with the Commonwealth, the state government of Victoria and the community meeting a one-third cost share each. It was quite a significant issue in the 2007 election down our way, and I was quite pleased to have achieved a commitment from, at that stage, the pretenders to government-an announcement by the member for Grayndler, in his capacity as the shadow minister for infrastructure, to share the cost on a one-third basis for the completion works, and an announcement made that the Australian Labor Party would fund another $124 million. This was matched by the coalition parties. I said to my constituents: ‘We’ve got both options covered now. Please re-elect me to make sure either party honours its commitment.’ It was an enormous disappointment for me to discover, since the election, that the Commonwealth Labor government has sent down only $99 million and it sent a very strong message that it does not intend to fulfil its election promise. So we are still $25 million short. It uses the argument that the state government was willing to contribute only $99 million-why should the Commonwealth go further than that? I was so incensed by this broken election promise that I placed a question on the Notice Paper to the Prime Minister in May this year. He has had 38 days to respond to that and he has 22 more days. My constituents are burning to know whether this election commitment is going to be fulfilled by the Commonwealth government regardless of what the state’s position is. It is a tremendous project that has sent an enormous signal of encouragement to my drought-stricken constituency, all of which has been covered under an exceptional circumstances declaration for the last four years and some of which has been covered for longer than that-up to five years. Water for stock and domestic purposes and firefighting purposes is a very critical issue. I am expecting the Prime Minister, who boasts boldly about committing to his election commitments, to send a signal to my constituency that he intends to honour that election commitment and come up with the balance still owing on that commitment of $25 million. Fire services costs have escalated threefold because of increasing expectations, and that $25 million would go a long way to assisting those local government councils, of which there are nine who have to meet that cost and find it through the resources of their struggling ratepayers. There is also an irrigation region associated with the provincial city of Horsham that has had irrigation support for almost 100 years but, because of the challenges and issues with water and the reconfiguration of the channel system into pipes, there is a raging discussion now as to whether that irrigation district ought to be made obsolete. But whatever the outcome, whether or not there is some sort of adjustment to the irrigation district, it is going to need more finance. Certainly, compensation will be needed for those irrigators who have legal water entitlements which they pay for. The government waxes lyrical about the need for stimulation of the economy; well, there is $25 million that could be spent very quickly. The designs are all complete, job ready, and some of them are already under construction. We had a very serious fire in the bottom end of my constituency. Although we say that we were fortunate there were no deaths associated with that, it was the most frightening fire the MAIN COMMITTEE region has seen in a very long time, getting into the suburbs of the provincial city of Horsham. SoI challenge the Prime Minister to recognise the significance of that question I put on the Notice Paper and to respond positively to it and send a message to my constituency that this is a Labor government that does care and does have the interests of western Victoria at heart. The second point I wanted to make was just how significant the changes to Youth Allowance have been in my constituency. You can tell by the jamming of the switchboard and the numerical strength of the emails that this is a huge issue affecting thousands of potential university students across north-west Victoria-and other rural constituencies have felt the same. In fact, it is estimated that something like 30,000 potential tertiary students right across the nation have been affected by this shifting of the goalposts. After the plans they made, following their year 12 VCE qualification, to defer their university course for one year in order to accumulate some money to assist their parents to pay for their tertiary education, the goalposts have been shifted on them. They are now being told they are expected to work up to 30 hours a week prior to their university course, which would require them to engage in that work during their important year 11 and year 12 years, which are horrendous years for students today. I remember my own children going through those challenges. It is just completely unreasonable. We have now got a Senate inquiry up to investigate the matter and get the concerns of some of these youngsters on paper as evidence to convince the government that it needs to make some adjustments to this policy position announced in the recent budget. Some of the intent of the budget announcement might have been a noble one, which was to ensure that youngsters who have the advantage of living in the big cities and can continue to live with their parents did not take advantage of the system, but that opportunity is not available to country kids. They have usually got to travel hundreds of miles to attend a metropolitan or provincial based university. And in these circumstances, where drought has taken an enormous toll on the finances of their parents, particularly if they are primary producers, this shift has enraged them completely. As I say, there have been an enormous number of representations, and I am hoping that the findings of the Senate committee will assist in nudging the government to tweak this budget announcement so that country students are not substantially impacted. I heard the member for Throsby speaking earlier in the grievance debate about university opportunities, and the figures she mentioned for the participation rates of rural students are just deplorable in a nation that needs to encourage youngsters across the board, no matter where they live, to engage in tertiary education. With regard to the children of the families that I represent, the expectation is that, because they have committed to rural lives, they will return with qualifications-whether they are in teaching, nursing, agriculture or business-and work in their local communities, because that is where they were born and raised and are used to a lifestyle they can enjoy. So the challenge will be for the government to respond to this need, and I am hoping that government members who represent rural constituencies will get in there and support the students they represent and convince the government it needs to change this policy, not shift the goalposts for desperate country families. MAIN COMMITTEE Building the Education Revolution Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (9.00 pm)-I am pleased, I must say, as a great advocate of education in our society to see it dominating so significantly in the grievance debate tonight. I have enjoyed the contributions of both my colleague the member for Throsby and the member for Mallee on the importance of education, and I also want to address that to some extent myself in the grievance debate tonight. What has particularly roused me to speak in this debate is the fact that there has been an increasing incidence amongst the senior journalists in this country to comment on the Building the Education Revolution program in a very disparaging way about the importance of capital injection into schools. SoI put aside the partisan debate that we are having about the rollout of that program and the issues that people may want to debate about particular projects and will deal more broadly with the importance of the environment in terms of educational delivery. I spent quite a number of years as a secondary school teacher and, as a parent-as most of us here would be-have also experienced through my children their direct experience of school. It is absolutely true that the most critical factor in a young person’s success or, sadly, lack of success in school is the teacher in the classroom. There is no doubt that that is the most critical factor. It is also important that the curriculum is appropriate, modern, relevant and engaging. But that does not mean that the environment that we provide for young people to learn is an inconsequential or unimportant aspect of their engagement in their education. On SundayI was watching the Insiders programquestion said that the spending of money on capital in schools was not a major issue for improving educational outcomes. I do not think they could be more profoundly wrong. There is no doubt that the quality of the environment that you send your young people to learn in sends them a message about how their community and their society value the education they are receiving. If you send young people into classrooms that have carpet that is torn, that have paint peeling off the walls and that have problems with leaking into light fittings-all of these things I have seen in my own electorate and I am sure all members have seen in their electorates-there is absolutely no doubt that a young person going into a physical environment like that will take away a message about how we as governments and as a society value the place we are sending them to and therefore value what they are achieving in that place. It is absolutely true that the quality and commitment of the teaching staff is paramount. It is absolutely true that the curriculum that is delivered in those classrooms is significantly important. But it is no less true that the physical environment we provide for our young people is just as important a component in terms of their educational outcome. AndI was particularly disappointed to see that the nature of the debate that is going on, particularly in the media, on this issue undervalues the significance of the message that we are sending in upgrading the facilities. My colleague the member for Throsby and I attended a school in the member for Throsby’s electorate to make announcements around the Primary Schools for the 21st Century first round of funding. The school we visited is 150 years old. They have fantastic staff, and they MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Grievance Debate

There is no doubt at all that the teaching staff can take so much credit for what they achieve. That school had not had a significant physical upgrade in as long as anybody could remember. When we went back after the announcement of the National School Pride program money and the money from the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program there was a buzz in that school and much excitement. They have a band, they have dance classes and they have some martial arts classes where kids learn all those skills. Having an actual place where they can give presentations and performances for their community and their families, instead of being outside waiting for a non-rainy day to do that, was really important to them. I think it is pretty sad if those who provide commentary at the top levels of our media cannot understand or come to grips with how important that is and how important the rollout of that capital expenditure is to all of those schools. 66. give way? order which creates a sense of interaction within the chamber. Would the honourable member accept that the Investing in Our Schools Program abolished by the current government also provided incredible facilities for many schools which had been starved of facilities by state government funding policies? Our Schools Program, which ran out before the 2007 election, was an important component and that is why I have addressed my comments tonight in a very non-partisan manner: because I am actually recognising that both sides of the chamber understand the importance of capital and the environment we provide for young people in our schools. My complaint tonight is that I do not know that the national media, in commenting on these issues, absolutely understand why that is so important, as the honourable member says. I also want to take the opportunity, because sometimes the vocational education sector slips through the gaps and does not get the attention it deserves, to acknowledge that my own local TAFE last week were successful under the infrastructure program set up under the higher education fund for TAFEs in getting a project up that is going to upgrade the Illawarra Institute’s mechanical engineering, manufacturing and environmental technology training services from a model based on large-scale driven training for discrete training areas-that is, the old industrial model where all the workers were lined up on a factory floor on their particular machines; which does not happen in many workplaces now-to one which anticipates customer needs by working with customers to develop workforce capability through customised, flexibly delivered training attuned to the needs of specific enterprises. To put that in layman’s terms, the TAFE engineering section is going to be restructured to module based problemsolving units where the young people will work in teams to design a particular solution to an engineering problem. They will be able to build the prototypes on computer based systems. They will be able to take that, transfer it to a production unit and actually find a solution-and MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Grievance Debate

311,Ms Bird,"I thank the member for his intervention. I certainly agree that the Investing inthen take it to another section and test it and see how it goes. That is something which reflects much more the modern workplace rather than the mass production of hundreds of people lined up on a factory floor all doing one section of a job and passing it along. I visited the TAFE the other day. I am a bit biased, having taught there for seven years: I think TAFE is an absolutely fabulous world-class institution that this country sometimes, at its own peril, undervalues. They were extremely excited by this $9.8 million available to them to upgrade their facilities. This is another example where the physical environment in an education situation supports the curriculum-supports a modern, meaningful education being experienced by young people-and also enables teachers to stretch their wings and be excited themselves by what they are delivering in terms of education. I know the TAFE engineering facility is a microcosm of how our manufacturing base is changing from mass production to really specialised problem-solving solutions. Our young people will now walk into a TAFE that reflects the modern workplace and reflects the challenges they will face in the modern workplace. When I walked through the doors to make the announcement it was a bit like the old metalwork and woodwork roomyou walk in there and you feel like you are stepping back 50 years in time. They just look like you know they have looked for all the years since they were first built. It was very exciting for them and very exciting for me-in a region like mine which relies on manufacturing modernising to meet modern needs-to see that investment and to see the enthusiasm of those young people as they undertake their training. I just want to say: Barack Obama sought $16 billion for his capital investment in education. He got $12 billion. We have got more than that with far fewer students and institutions. I think that is a great outcome. Fisher Electorate: Queensland Government government facilities, I must say that I hold a fairly old-fashioned view. I believe that Australians, regardless of what state or town they live in, are entitled to a reasonable level of infrastructure and facilities and that just because an area at a certain level of government may well have voted for, say, as in our case, the Liberal-National Party as opposed to Labor that area ought not to be treated as an area not worthy of government support. I was extremely disturbed at the announcement by the Queensland Labor government in its budget recently that the desperately needed hospital that had been promised by the Labor government in 2005 for Kawana Waters in my electorate has become the victim of yet another delay, with the government announcing a further two-year wait for this vital infrastructure. The hospital was originally due to be opened in 2012. That was changed to 2014. Now the government has announced that it will be delayed until 2016, which is seven years away. The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia. In fact, it is the most desirable area of our country in which to live, and people move from the rust belt areas of southern Australia like South Australia, Tasmania and other places to come to the Sunshine Coast. In fact, those who do not move there go there to holiday because it is a wonderful area. It has a tremendous environment, a welcoming people and warm and welcoming weather. But we do as a consequence have increasing infrastructure needs. The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia and our population will double over the next 10 to 15 years. We are desperately short of hospital beds, and the provision of those beds to meet what is essentially everyday demand has slipped well down the state Labor government priority MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Grievance Debate
312,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (9.10 Pm),"With respect to the provisions of infrastructure andlist. This is unacceptable for the residents of the area, those of the Kawana Waters area and the former city of Caloundra in particular, who, like other Australians, deserve the provision of appropriate health services. A report entitled Sunshine Coast-Wide Bay southern cluster projected inpatient bed requirements 2009 also strongly suggests that the region needs more hospital beds. The report goes so far as to predict that, if current growth trends continue, by 2016 more than 300 local patients daily will be spending nights in Brisbane hospitals due to massive local bed shortages. The news of the delay for the new hospital was accompanied by the state government’s announcement that it is now seeking an investor to build a private hospital, with the government to rent beds in the new facility for public patients. However, this remains a stopgap measure that will not satisfy local needs and will also not address the real likelihood that more and more local patients and their families will be forced to travel to Brisbane for treatments that require hospital stays. This hospital fiasco is one of a mounting list of problems that have festered under the leadership of Anna Bligh and the state Labor government and are now conveniently blamed on the challenging economic times. Queensland has been the engine room of the Australian economy. We have had successive governments, both National-Liberal and Labor, which in recent times have been able to recognise the fact that this is a part of Australia which is uniquely blessed. From the time of the Bjelke-Petersen government, we have had sound economic management. Whatever comments you might make in relation to other aspects of that government-and there would be a range of views on the performance of that government generally-with respect to economics what the former National government in Queensland did was outline the philosophy that governments, like private households, cannot spend more than they earn. The concept of constant deficit budgeting became extremely unpopular in the community because, if you have zero debt, it means you are not paying interest and it means that as a government you are able to meet the infrastructure costs of a growing community. But, unfortunately, the legacy of the former Liberal-National government in Queensland and also former Labor governments has been squandered by the Bligh Labor governmenting an icon for the other states to follow, we have become absolutely the worse economic performer. The honourable member for Lyons mentioned the global economic crisis, and one cannot deny that such a thing exists. However, such a thing exists and affects everyone in Australia; it is just that the Queensland Labor government’s response to that and to economics generally has been so much worse than that of every other government in Australia, whether it be the Liberal-National Party government of Western Australia or the Labor governments in all of the other states and territories and the national Labor government. The Bligh Labor government is the worse government in Australia, regardless of politics. I do not want to be party political about this matter but, where Queensland was once the trailblazer for the rest of the country, we are now the basket case. For many years, people suggested Tasmania was not viable, that it was a basket case. However, Tasmania is now performing in a wayMAIN COMMITTEE",188,Grievance Debate

If you continue to spend more than you earn as a government and you move into deficit budgeting in a constant way then essentially you become a state which is probably the only Third World state or country where you are able to drink the water. Mr Craig Thomson-What about infrastructure in Queensland? ments in Queensland provided that infrastructure. Unfortunately, the state Labor government with respect to infrastructure has not really been anywhere near as good as it could be. I spoke at the commencement of my speech about the Kawana hospital. Kawana, a state electorate which had the temerity to vote for the Liberal National Party at the recent state election, has been penalised as an area because they did not vote for the incumbent Labor government. Right across the Sunshine Coast, which was virtually a clean sweep for the Liberal National Party, we are suffering because we did not vote for the incumbent Labor government. The incumbent Labor government has entirely squandered the economic security and economic benefits that it inherited, and we now have a situation where the Sunshine Coast hospital at Kawana fiasco is simply one of a mounting list of problems that have festered under the current state Labor government. It has been put to me, including by the member for Lyons, that these matters can be blamed on the challenging economic times. But the reality is that our problems do not stretch from the economic crisis; they really stem from Labor’s complete and utter inability to manage money. Of course, it is the rest of us, and our children, our grandchildren, our greatgrandchildren and beyond, who will have to carry this serious and unacceptable burden. I am someone who tries to give credit where credit is due. I am not saying that just because someone happens to be on the conservative side of politics they are a person who is worthy of support. I have seen Labor governments that have been good-not many, mind you-and I have seen Labor governments that have been bad. I have seen conservative governments that have been good and some that have dropped the ball. But in Queensland, with the Bligh Labor government, we have a government that no-one could defend as having any solution to the global economic crisis, and the reason that Queensland is suffering so badly and that we are not getting the health infrastructure that we should on the Sunshine Coast is that the state Labor government has indicated that it is totally, completely and absolutely unable to manage money. That is really sad for the people on the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast is barely an hour’s drive north of Brisbane. We have got 260,000 people; we will have 500,000 people in 10 to 15 years time. We are a diverse community. It is much nicer than the Gold Coast. We are the area where you would like to bring up your children. The area stretches from Noosa to Caloundra. We have got every possible sort of community. We have got five-star tourist resorts and we have got places where families can go and have holidays. It is an absolutely tremendous area, and I would recommend that any honourable member who has the time visit the Sunshine Coast, because it is an absolutely wonderful place to be. But, as the population grows, we need infrastructure. The fact that, at the state election, people on the Sunshine Coast chose to vote for the Liberal National Party ought not to be a reason to deprive us of health infrastructure, particularly the Kawana hospital. It is completely unacceptable, and I condemn the Bligh Labor government. MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Grievance Debate

There have been some severe misunderstandings regarding the issue of forestry as it relates to many of the issues being discussed today, including resource harvesting, biomass for energy and climate change. Senator Bob Brown’s call for an end to the harvesting of native forest is part of an anti-forestry agenda rather than a genuine desire to reduce Australia’s carbon emissions. Ending harvesting does not enhance Australia’s overall carbon position. It will, in fact, make it worse. membertion? his seat. than unmanaged forests. It is noted in Australia’s state of the forests report, an Australian government publication, that carbon sequestered in native forest plantations and in new wood products offsets 8.4 per cent of Australia’s carbon emissions. We know that fossil fuels and energy intensive industries are the biggest contributors to climate change. Energy, for example, contributes 70 per cent of the national emissions, while agriculture contributes 16 per cent and transport 14 per cent. Forestry Tasmania is a leading authority on measuring carbon in native forests. It has measured its own carbon inventory over a 50-year time frame. It took into account the effect of harvesting and net growth in both commercial and non-commercial forests maintained by Forestry Tasmania, together with carbon stored in wood products derived from those forests. This research predicted a 17 per cent increase in above-ground stored carbon. It also indicated that these managed forests offset about 24 per cent of Tasmania’s total carbon emissions. Forestry in all its guises-native forestry and plantations together-is a solution to climate change; it is not the problem. The CSIRO has shown that planting trees on nine million hectares of agricultural land had the potential to abate about a quarter of Australia’s total emissions each year. The point is that there are many opportunities across Australia to establish new forests for multiple benefits and to mitigate risks. Senator Bob Brown-and I have to give him his full name, as we also have Senator Carol Brown, who is also from Tasmania and would not want to be associated with anything that Senator Bob Brown says or does-has successfully confused the Australian public into believing that the forestry industry is responsible for deforestation, a major contributor to climate change. This is not only wrong; it is mischievous, like much of the debate about forestry in Tasmania lately. It is misleading a lot of good-intentioned people who enjoy looking at the magnificent vistas in Tasmania. They think that Tasmania is being stripped of all its trees. When I am flying backwards and forwards to Canberra, I come across people who express huge surprise when they fly into Tasmania, because they see trees, lots of trees-and that is just down the Tamar corridor. They see a lot more trees when they drive around the great state of Tasmania. MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Grievance Debate

323,Mr Adams,"Managed forests producing wood products store and sequester more carbonMost people do not know the difference between an old growth forest, a regrowth forest and a plantation forest while they are driving past them, and it confuses them when they hear that all forests are being cleared. Bob Brown’s campaign is skilful propaganda that might have had a shred of truth in it 30 years ago as it related to some early private forest activities, but nowadays the only thing he is generating is a myth. Nowadays, with the regional forest agreement in place and a very rigorous process by which people can gain approval to harvest, Tasmania has some of the best kept and managed forests in the world. And you do not have to take my word for it; there is ample proof of this, as Tasmania is lauded amongst many other countries that have similar forests and those who are seeking help with theirs. It is hard to get the general public here to understand that, whenever a native forest coupe is harvested, it is regenerated using techniques that mimic nature. Seeds collected from the harvest coupe are dropped from a helicopter into the ash bed of that coupe. This sort of forestry is not deforestation; it is managed harvesting that is then regenerated to maintain a healthy and sustainable new forest. Tasmania has a lot of good forest and will have the same amount of forest in 90 years time as there is today and probably a lot more if we can continue to ensure forestry can continue in my state. Deforestation is the permanent removal of a forest, which occurs as a result of land clearing for agriculture or expanding urban development in this country. In other countries in the Third World there have been some devastating impacts on native forests, and our foresters are at the forefront in trying to help some of those countries to develop their industries sustainably. Through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry and Resources, we are getting a lot of interest in how farmers can best adapt to climate change. The committee is to hear from Dr Christine Jones who, in her submission to the committee, highlights the importance of soil health in agriculture. She says: In addition to enabling the farming community to more effectively deal with warmer, drier conditions, the restoration of landscape function will result in the active drawdown of excessive CO2 from the atmosphere via stable biosequestration soils. I know that forestry is one of the few industries that is actively sequestering carbon, and the committee is keen to explore how this can be done in conjunction with agriculture. Forestry Tas has already recognised this. Senator Bob Brown has deliberately overlooked the scientific fact that sustainably managed forests sequester carbon, which balances that emitted in harvesting, when he has been complaining about regeneration burns. In fact, research from many other credible sources acknowledges forestry as the only carbon-positive sector of the Australian economy. Another area we are looking at in Tasmania is using the forest waste matter that is currently burned. It is being suggested to run a wood-fired power station in the south of the state. It would not lead to extra harvesting, but would use the residues left on the forest floor that would otherwise have been burnt during regeneration burns. This would reduce the amount of smoke released during those burns and generate sufficient green power for all homes in the south of Hobart. This wood from sustainably managed forests is a fuel for electricity generation, representing a renewable energy source which is eligible for renewable energy certificates under the Australian government’s national mandatory renewable energy target. This would be a significant opportunity for Australia to address the reduction of carbon emissions. The biofuel harvest from state forest also represents zero net emissions, because MAIN COMMITTEE annual growth in the forests replaces the carbon that is emitted when the biofuel is burned to produce renewable energy. But, for some reason, forestry is again being attacked by the Greens for being part of the climate change problem and they are totally opposing biomass energy. If they seriously wanted to reduce carbon emissions in regeneration burns, they would be campaigning to force Forestry Tasmania to pick up some of the residues, put them into an energy plant and replace some of the fossil fuel electricity coming across Bass Strait. There are many good things coming out of the work being done by Forestry Tas, Private Forests and others involved in the timber industry. It seems unjust and very misleading to have this constant attack going on, without any real proof whatsoever of mismanagement. The quixotic and misguided people of this world pick up the Greens’ constant harping and add to the public debate in the most bizarre and inaccurate statements, adding to this ridiculous myth that forestry activity is no good for Tasmania. They want to make 4,000 workers redundant and, at the same time, worsen Australia’s greenhouse gas performance. This would be bad for the economy. It is bad for Tasmanians and it would be bad for the planet. say how despicable it is thatgranted? Leave not granted. sumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

(2) Will the fees for Veterans’ Home Care be increased in 2009 or 2010. (3) Will Veterans’ Home Care be merged with the Home and Community Care program. (1) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) commissioned the University of Wollongong in March 2007 to independently review the Veterans’ Home Care (VHC) program with the aim of identifying what changes may be necessary to ensure that the program continues to meet the needs of the veteran community. The review was finalised in March 2008 and the report is available to the public via the DVA website at www.dva.gov.au/health/homecare/mainvhc.htm. Overall, the review found that the VHC program is well targeted and accepted by the veteran community but there are some opportunities for improvement. The Government is currently considering the findings of the independent review. These considerations may result in changes to the VHC program. The Government has ruled out reducing services or scrapping the VHC program. The Government has already addressed one of the key findings of the review by deciding to revise the VHC assessment instrument to improve the way veterans and war widow/widowers are assessed for VHC services. This instrument is being validated by an independent expert and is expected to be implemented in late 2009. The Government also announced an initiative in the recent Budget to improve and better coordinate the assessment processes for the HomeFront, Rehabilitation Appliances Program (RAP) and VHC programs. The aim of these programs is to help veterans and war widow/widowers maintain their independence, stay in their own homes for longer and delay entry into residential aged care. This initiative will further strengthen the assessment process for VHC services and ensure more targeted referrals from VHC to programs such as RAP and HomeFront. (2) DVA sets the fees paid to VHC service providers under its contractual arrangement with them to deliver VHC services to veterans and war widow/widowers.
