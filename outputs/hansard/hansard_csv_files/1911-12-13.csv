Elliot Johnson","As the House has recently been sitting any. number of hours, from twelve upwards, and the Prime Minister has expressed the determination to make us sit still longer, I ask him whether we may take it for granted that the Government and the Labour party have abandoned their belief in the eight hours principle, Mir. FISHER not abandoned its belief in the eight hours principle for others, but Ministers are prepared to sacrifice themselves when necessary in the interest of the country. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the newspapers that the trawler Endeavour has returned to Port Adelaide after an unsuccessful search for the reported derelict, and that the Minister has not given in structions for sending her out again, although the derelict has again been reported within the last few days, and is a great menace to shipping.

14,Is Mr Fisher,"I have neither seen normember wishes to know how I would treat such a resolution if it were presented to me, let me say that I would treat it as I would treat a similar .application from him. the Prime Minister would treat it. Minister of Home Affairs proposes to have works carried out by the Commonwealth, instead of by the State officials who have hitherto supervised them. In what States does he propose to establish the new system? South Wales and Victoria. works undertaken in these States be supervised by Commonwealth officers, or in outlying districts will inspections be undertaken by State officials co-operating with Commonwealth officials? sible we shall use the State officials if that should be necessary. Prime Minister whether his attention has l>een called to a Melbourne telegram in Monday's issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph which refers to the position of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to private institutions, and concludes in these termsAs the Commonwealth Bank cannot be taxed by the State or municipality, it should deduct from its earnings the sums it would have to pay to taxpayers if it was a private institution. The Prime Minister says that he does not think much of the suggestion. "" We have not provided for any such thing in the B ill , "" he said, ""but he was rather surprised that the Opposition did not make the point. The only comment I need give is that the Commonwealth Bank will be the people's bank."" Does not the right honourable member recollect that during a speech which the honourable member for Darling Downs delivered on 24th November, he made reference 'to this matter? member asking a question ?

I ask honourable members generally to put their questions in a more direct manner. may I ask what chance Oppositionists will have of correcting statements of alleged fact made by Ministers of the Crown in regard to our procedure in the House, unless we can produce public records to show that we have taken the steps which we are accused of not having taken ? point out to the House generally, and it will apply to the honourable member's question, that if I were to enforce strictly the rules of parliamentary procedure many ot the questions which are asked would be ruled out of order. For instance, honourable members have no right to found questions on paragraphs in the press. The honourable member has asked me to state what opportunities honourable members would have to correct any statements which might be made. I would point out that if an honourable member is affected, he can take the proper course of making a personal explanation, which gets over the whole difficulty. It appears to me that a bad practice is growing up. A question is asked without notice, and a reply is given, and then a number of questions are founded on the reply. So far as I have been able to gather from reading and the records of the Parliaments with which I have been connected, I have never known so many questions to be asked without notice, nor have I found a record in any Parliament of so many questions being asked without notice, as are asked in this Parliament. I must confine honourable members to asking questions in a legitimate way. of order, sir.

In Committee of Ways and Mians (Consideration resumed from 12th December, vide page 4183) on motion by Mr £12,000,000, whilst for the current That ScheduleA to the Customs Tariff 190819.10 be amended as hereunder set out, and that en and after the first day of December, One thousand nine hundred and eleven, Duties of Customs be collected in pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended. withstanding the fact that there are some seventy items of the Tariff of a technical character included in the amended schedule submitted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and that they have been classified in their proper sections, the amended Tariff proposed is not quite so innocent as it looks. I stand here as an out-and-out Protectionist, even to the point of prohibition, and as such, though it is rather late in the day, I welcome the amendment of the existing Tariff which has been proposed. It is agreed that Australia has endorsed the Protectionist policy, and I venture to say that there is no member of this House who has the courage to object to the principles of the new Protection. The honourable member for Ulawarra has claimed that the Liberals are entitled to be considered the fathers of all the advanced legislation passed by this Parliament. I remind the honourable member, however, that if it had not been for the support given by the twenty-seven Labour members to the Liberal party much of this Liberal legislation would not have been passed. The Leader of the Liberal Government had only twelve direct folseven Labour members he commanded the necessary numbers to carry this advanced legislation. The measure to give effect to the principle of new Protection was one of the most important measures passed by the Liberal' and Labour forces combined.. It is remarkable that, although the Government party was composed of many men of legal ability, they were unable to foresee that the High Court would later on decide that the principles of new Protection were ultra vires of the Constitution. My idea of scientific Protection is that, as industries grow under its operation, the reiceipts per head from the Customs should decrease. We find that the contrary has followed the operation of our Tariff. In 1904-5 our receipts from Customs amounted to over .£8,000,000; in 1905-6 they were increased by .£300,000. They were further increased in 1906-7, and in 1910-n they had increased to over financial year the Prime Minister has estimated the receipts from Customs at £13,800,000. From the Protectionist point of view, therefore, there must be something radically wrong with our Tariff. Either our manufacturers have been unable to get the necessary labour to extend their industries or our Protection has been ineffective. Last year our imports reached a total value of £60,014,000, or an average per head of the population of the Commonwealth of £ 1 3 . Such a record of importations is absolutely absurd for a Protectionist country. If we turn even to Free Trade Great Britain we shall find that the imports per head of the United Kingdom amount to only £ 1 1 19s. n d . In the United States of America, a highly protected country in which a permanent Tariff Board is established to look minutely into all questions affecting the Tariff, the imports average £ 3 3s. 4d. per head; in Germany, the average is £0"" 6s. id. per head; Austria, £ 2 2s. i d . ; Italy, £ 3 9s. 5d.; and France, £ 6 18s. n d . We naturally expected that under the operation of a scientific Tariff our revenue per head would decrease. As a matter of fact, whilst six years ago it was £ 2 3s. 5d., last year it was ,£2 18s. 9|d., and during the current financial year, according to the estimate of the Prime Minister, it will be £ 3 2S. 4^d. I am anxious that Australia should be self-contained. In order that",15,Postmaster General S

44,Mr Ozanne (Corio) [N.50],"Notshe may become so we must establish our own industries, so that we may be able to' make in Australia all that we require to supply our wants. apply ourselves to the task. We have the ability, the land, climate, and natural resources necessary for the purpose, and it is absolutely essential that we should place our Tariff on such a basis as will encourage our manufacturers to extend their industries, and, at the same time, see that the workers engaged in them are given a living wage. The honourable member for Parramatta told us that when the present Minister of Customs was not in office his chief concern was the Tariff. I think that to-day the honourable gentleman is just as anxious as he ever was that we should have an effective Protectionist Tariff. From conversations I have had with him, I believe that he has a very thorough grasp of the situation, and I know that he is very anxious indeed to see the principles of the new Protection fully carried out. WhilstI do not agree with all that he has proposed, I am satisfied that he is still trying to do his best in the interests of the manufacturers of Australia. The honourable member for Parramatta told us that the Sunshine Harvester Works. He pointed out that the endeavour to bring him under the operation of the principles of new Protection would be a failure. honourable promise given to the Tariff Commission, but we should not sacrifice the innocent with the guilty. There are numbers of manufacturers in Australia who are dealing fairly and honestly with their men. I know, from conversations with men engaged in industries in my own district, that they are getting a fair deal from the employers. sacrifice manufacturers who treat their men fairly because one manufacturer broke his word. tories in Geelong? Let me say that even the duty imposed to dustry on a better basis has served a useful purpose. It is only necessary for honourable members to travel on the Bendigo line to see the gigantic works established by Mr bers, I believe that we are taking a step McKay. the Tariff has enabled him practically to establish another town in Victoria. workers. We can do so if we the honourable member to talk in that way, but at the present time the men engaged in the works referred to are being paid the wages fixed by a Wages Board. I have his word, but I still contend that if we had not granted the protection which was given to the industry it would not be in the position it occupies to-day. The honourable member for Parramatta appeared to be very, anxious about the welfare of the workers. It is remarkable that when these gentlemen are in opposition they suddenly awaken to the fact that the workers of Australia are the producers of the Commonwealth, and should be recognised as such. It was all very well for the honourable member to speak sarcastically of the efforts made by the Minister of Trade and Customs on behalf of the workers; but when the honourable member for Parramatta was in office, he seemed not only to forget that we require a Protectionist policy, but to overlook the needs and requirements of the workers themselves. The policy of Protection has an important bearing on that of immigration. 1 endorse the view that we need a larger population. Australia, which is a continent as big as Europe, has a popuI quite lation of only 4,500,000, whereas she ought really to be carrying a population of over 80,000,000. If we are going to endorse Free Trade principles, however, our population, instead of growing, must decrease. There is one matter which, if dealt with in a scientific manner, would tend to increase the number of our manufacturers. We have in force a Patents Act, in which it is provided that if an article patented in AusI say that we should not tralia is not manufactured here within four years of its registration, it shall be open for any person, irrespective of the patent so granted, to enter upon 'its manufacture in Australia. A large quantity of goods now coming into Australia might well be made here, and next year perhaps we might take steps to make our patent laws still more stringent so as to compel those who obtain patents in Australia to manufacture here the goods in respect of which those patents are granted. In that way we should keep the money in the country.

In order to give effective protection to some of our local industries, it may be necessary to raise the duty to 50 per cent. The cement industry is making rapid strides in Australia, and the proposal now before us to impose upon cement a duty of 2s. per cwt. will, if adopted, lead to its making still greater strides. Then, again, the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on oil paintings, whilst not affecting the importation of real works of art, will have a very valuable influence in shutting out the "" daubs "" which are being introduced at the present time, and are purchased by many men who, by reason of their training, are unable to distinguish between them and true works of art. This duty will confer a benefit on Australian artists, and will enable them to obtain a fair return for their work. I am pleased that it is proposed to increase the duty on strawboard to 2s. per cwt. Mr J. H . CATTS -The proposal is an outrage. honourable members, I have received a circular from P. J. Firth Limited, cardboard box manufacturers, of Sydney, who, instead of seeking to advance good reasons why the duty should not be imposed, make a scurrilous attack on local manufacturers of strawboard. boxmakers have as much right to be considered as has a strawboard manufacturer down Geelong way. point I make is that this firm which objects to the imposition of the duty, instead of attacking a local industry, should have attempted to show good reasons for its opposition to the proposal. cular before me it is stated by P. J. Firth Limited that a local firm which is desirous of receiving this protection would not concede to its employees the principle of the new Protection. an occurrence of some years ago. briefly explain the reason why the proprietors of the Australian Paper Mills then opposed the granting of a Wages Board in respect of their industry. At ""the time in question they were the only manufacturers engaged in the industry in Victoria, and therefore under the State Act would not have been entitled to representation on the board proposed to be appointed. In other words, the employees would be represented, hut the manufacturers, since they comprise only one firm, would not. Wages Board now? going to get one. ditions are not too good. a minimum wage of 7s. a day, even although there is no Wages Board in the industry. Mr P.. J. F'irth asks why a Wages Board was not appointed years ago, and why a certain proprietary petitioned the Legislative Council of Victoria against the appointment of a Wages Board. I was present at a recent meeting of the proprietors and the men of the Australian Paper Mills, at which the employee's said that they weresatisfied with their present condition, believing that the industry was paying then as much as it could pay under existing conditions. With this duty, however, it would be possible for the mills to pay a higher wage, and the proprietors have no objection to their emploves formI n common with other ing a union, and obtaining the appointment of a Wages Board. Mr J. H . CATTS -Ho w many men are there in the industry? not very many. Mr J.

Wages Board system carry out the honourable member's idea of the new Protection ? In the cirreferenda campaign the honourable member for Parramatta toured New South Wales in opposition to our request that the Parliament should be granted power to carry out the policy of the new Protection, and since That is a reference to we have not that power, the next best thing I may for us to do is to accept the Wages Board system. I believe that Wages Boards have done a vast amount of good. the honourable member's idea of new Protection ? must be content with them until the people of Australia give the necessary power to carry out the principle of new Protection.",17,Tudor

I think the Minister has made a slight mistake in regard to it. Gramaphones are protected to tbe extent of 35 per cent., but all machines under £ 5 in value are admitted free. It is possible, in my opinion, to manufacture gramaphones in Australia, and those in more general use are the cheaper varieties. I do not believe in making any class distinction, but such a ^distinction is certainly made in this instance ; and all these machines ought to be subject to. the duty. Pianos and pianola pianos are dutiable in the general Tariff, and subject to a duty of £ 1 4 and £ 7 , or 35 per cent., whichever rate returns the most revenue; and the Minister was wisely advised in having a fixed duty, though it is possible that it is not high enough. The other day 1 saw in an English journal an advertisement-that of new pianos, which looked very well indeed in the illustrations, at £ 1 0 each, walnut overmantles at 12s. 6d., suites at 30s., and extension tables at ios. UndeT our Wages Board system and the conditions here, it is absolutely impossible for any manufacturer to compete with such cheap productions; and it is necessary that our protection should be -made effective. The Minister has, however, taken a step in the right direction, and, perhaps, next session he will find it advisable to increase the duties. Another item of importance to Australia is that of hides, which, limed, fleshed, or snlit, are subject to a duty of 5s. each. This is a heavy impost, but it is necessary; and in this connection I have received a circular from the J. P. Howe and Companv Proprietary Limited, containing the following :the imposition of a duty such as is proposed will prevent the further importation -of anv hides in the condition above referred to, regardless of the consequences. In my opinion we ought to absolutely prohibit the importation of hides Mr Knibbs informs me that in 1909 there were imbook covers, and so forth. ported into Australia 136,375 hides, and limited quantity of brown paper is manuin 1910 .the number was 119,408. It will factured, but, as I say this is being gradu'be seen that, notwithstanding the fact that ally driven out of the market. Australia is one of the leading countries been complained by several honourable memfor the production of hides, the importabers that they are practically in the dark in tions are very large. The circular further points outwe can assure you that the cost of unhairing, fleshing, and splitting hides does not exceed the sum of is. gd. per hide, and this work could be carried out. by our present staff. If all this work were done in Australia it would certainly be necessary for those engaged in the industry to increase the number of their employees. At present, throughout Australia, there are only 179 tanneries employing 2,980 persons; and that seems ridiculous in a country of the size and possibilities of Australia. Notwithstanding the heavy importations, Australia, in 1909, exported hides to the number of 286,973, valued at £239,539; and it ought to be possible for this raw material to be turned into the finished article in Australia and sent out to compete with the productions of other countries. We have only £484,859 invested in plant and buildings in connection with the industry; and the total number of hides dealt with last year was 1,148,000. As a matter of fact, there ought to be £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 invested, seeing that Australia is considered one of the chief countries in the world for the production of hides. Another item to which I desire to refer is that of Kraft brown paper, which does not appear in the Tariff proposals before us. The honourable member for Ulawarra pointed out that whereas a few years ago about 150 persons were employed in this industry, there were now over 200, and submitted the fact as proof that this could not be said to be languishing. In my opinion, however, the small increase in the number of employees shows that there must be something radically wrong. In Geelong, owing to the insufficient protection, one mill, where this brown paper was manufactured, has already been closed down; and the output of the Australian Paper Mills Company has decreased from 1,800 tons to 1,400 tons. I can assure the Minister that if sufficient protection is not afforded Australian Kraft brown paper will be driven out of the market. those mills manufacture? such as that used in the Electoral Branch, Only a It has",18,Tudor

So far as the Australian Paper Mills Company is concerned, the paper is manufactured out of imported pulp. The cost, delivered to the mill in Australia, is made up as follows:-Cost, insurance, and freight, pulp, jQ8 ios. per ton; wharfage, ios. per ton; other costs, 5s. per ton. from ? So that the total cost of the raw material delivered at the mill is £ 9 5s. per ton.

Now the Australian paper mills are selling their paper at £ 2 3 per ton. ported Kraft brown paper pays in freight 22s. 6d. per ton of 40 cubic feet. On the other hand, a ton of pulp occupies 80 cubic feet, which is equivalent to 2 tons ot space from the stand-point of thefinishedarticle.

There are a great many other matters connected with the Tariff with which I might deal. should be sifted by a board. orable member. There are a number of However, I have the data in items in the schedule before us which I ' intend to support simply because I am a Protectionist and have confidence in the Ministry. But, as I have already pointed out, the protection which is afforded to certain industries is not sufficient. We have heard a good deal about Wages Boards and the new Protection. We have been told that the Wages Board system has not resulted in any good. But whilst that system may not be perfect, I claim that it has brought about infinitely better conditions than obtained in Australia prior to its introduction. Despite the fact that Wages Boards have increased the cost of production, I believe that the condition of the worker in Australia to-day is 25 per cent, better than it was ten years ago. If one travels round Melbourne he cannot fail to be imThe impressed with the fact that it is a paradise now compared with what it was then. These improved conditions are the result of the introduction of the Wages Board system and arbitration. Of course, we cannot hope to secure perfection in a day. I would rather see the workers of Australia in receipt of good wages and paying big prices for their comDeducting the modities than I would see them getting poor wages and cheap goods. No body of workers is justified in complaining of the cost of production in other industries while But when we take into they themselves are getting high wages. No body of employers is justified in sweating their workmen in order to produce cheap I know that in many industries> manufacturers are making a larger profit than they are entitled to make. At the When we realize that referendum we were refused power to deal with them, so that, at present, we have The honourable member for Parramatta referred last evening to a delegation of British workmen which visited the town of Gorz, in Germany, ditions which' obtained there. He stated that one section of that delegation had reported very adversely upon those conditions. I wish to say that I saw the report of a section of that delegation, and it was of a very eulogistic character indeed. It practically endorsed the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne that"" it was impossible to find slums there, and the",19,Tudor

73,Mr Ozanne,"I agree with the honworkers were living in comparative comfort. Of course, we must all recognise that the Tariff is a very complicated piece of mechanism. We cannot hope to sift all the questions relating to it in a day and to arrive at a correct conclusion. Although we may have every confidence in our Minister, it is absolutely essential that we should have some body which can watch the operations of the Tariff, see if the protection is effective, or if it is too great, take care that the manufacturer is not fleecing the public, and that goods are not being dumped into Australia to the detriment of our own industries. We, as members of Parliament, cannot know all about these things. Personally, I have done my best to ascertain what anomalies exist in regard to the various industries mentioned in this schedule. In some cases I have succeeded, but in the great majority I am working in the dark. To the Geelong Chamber of CommerceI sent a letter asking to be provided with a list of anomalies, but even that body could not name one. We should follow the example of America, which has a permanent Tariff Jioard to go into all these questions. So successful has it been that, whereas in Australia the value per head of imports is £ 1 3 on a very small population, in America it is only £ 3 odd with a population of about 110,000,000. It would be to the interest of the Government and the people to have a board with the Minister as its head, to sift Tariff evidence, and place it before members, as I Have done in the case of Kraft brown paper. I have here quite a number of letters from manufacturers, particularly in Victoria, one manufacturer making one statement, and another making a statement diametrically opposed to it. When manufacturers disagree in that fashion, it is no wonder that honourable members, not having the information, cannot arrive at a just conclusion. this side are absolutely in favour of the principle of new Protection, although some of them may be divided regarding the old Protection. When the Leader of the Opposition the other night stated as a Protectionist that the Tariff now before the Committee did not go far enough, the honourable member for Lang, the Opposition Whip, absolutely repudiated the Protectionist principles of his leader. He was very honest in his announcement that he would not accept from the Leader of the Opposition dictation as to how he should vote. Subsequently the honourable member for Ulawarra and others with Free Trade views also attacked the Tariff amendment now before us. The honourable member for Wilmot interjected last night that all the members sitting on the Government side of the House were "" drivers."" I agree with him' to this extent, that we have no time for a "" passenger."" Notwithstanding the taunts of the Opposition that we simply follow the dictates of our leader, and must do whatever the Government tell us to, the fact remains that every man on this side of the House is entitled to express his own opinion on all questions outside the platform. I have this morning endorsed the Advisory Tariff Board principle. A number of other members may not favour it, but I believe it is absolutely essential in the interests of the Protectionist policy of Australia. I hope the Minister before the Tariff passes from this Chamber will take into consideration the item of Kraft brown paper which I have brought before him. I am specially interested in the matter from a Protectionist stand-point. It means much to the industries of Australia, and the industry in my electorate. pinches. also exists in New South Wales. I may tell the honourable member for Fawkner that I want to see our own men employed, and not walking about the streets doing nothing, while men in Scandinavia are getting the benefit of the energy of the Australian public. We want to see the population of Australia grow. Instead of being a little over 4,000,000, we want to see it 80,000,000, because it is absolutely necessary if we desire to keep our own country that we should build up manufactories and secure a large population. Members sitting on [11.38] -From the nature of the proposals which we are now considering one would imagine that we were at the beginning of a parliamentary session instead of nearing the close. I do not think there is another instance on record of a Government introducing a new Tariff measure, ripping up whole sections of the Tariff under the guise of rectifying anomalies, and thus creating material for an extensive debate, in the closing days of a session. The Government appear to have gone out of their way to invite those who hold differing fiscal opinions to extend the session",20,Tudor

It is practically a ripping up of the whole Tariff, because the whole Tariff may come under review. The Minister may not have had that in his mind at the time, but as soon as we begin to rip open the Tariff, even under the guise of correcting anomalies, what happens? self has had some experience. been deluged with deputations. They have come upon him like an avalanche, asking that this little industry or that big one, as the case may be, shall receive special consideration. There is no end to the appeals that will be made for alterations of duty through the Tariff. We might very well be kept employed for twelve months dealing with nothing else than the correction of anomalies. party at the present time, I suppose, wants to maintain the unenviable reputation that it has succeeded in establishing all over Australia as the heavy taxation party. It is astonishing that a party which might reasonably be looked to, if we may judge from its name, to lighten the burdens upon the people, has, in our experience of it, always been the party that has been associated with the imposition of the heaviest burdens upon those who are least able to bear them-the workers of the community. On every side we hear protests and agonizing cries going up about the increased cost of living. That heavy cost has been brought about by the Labour party in this House. Yet we have proposals made now which will certainly not tend to diminish the cost of living, which has been increased to its present limit largely through the action of those who were returned as the direct representatives of Labour. If it had not been for the votes of members of the Labour party we should not have had the present Protectionist Tariff in operation. candid admission. if, again, it had not been for the Protectionist votes of so-called Free Trade members of the party the cost of living would not have increased to the present abnormal proportions. The workers have little to thank the Labour power of their wages, that to-day it costs 30s. to buy goods which a few years ago would have cost only a pound or a little less. A man or woman-and , unfortunately, it is the housewife who feels the pinch, because she has to manage the domestic purse -find s as a consequence that the weekly earnings do not go nearly so far as they did before the cost of commodities was increased all round. He has had better square his opinions with thoseof his leader. leader has his own opinions on these matters, and they are diametrically opposed to mine. Honourable members opposite, however, are in the same unenviable position. Some of them hold extreme views on the fiscal question, which are directly But the Labour opposed to those of other members of the party. Even members of the Ministry are in that position. Some are extreme Protectionists, and others are extreme Free Traders. Yet they sit side by side in the same Cabinet, and are co-responsible for bringing in these alleged protective duties. I say "" alleged "" advisedly, because Protectionists say they fail in their object, and we have here Tariff proposals which are repugnant alike both to honest Free Traders and honest Protectionists. ber give us some items in regard to tiie cost of living? honourable member has only to examine any grocery and clothing lists, for example, to find sufficient facts to satisfy even his rapacious appetite. The party in power, notwithstanding that there' are intheCabinet men holding opposite fiscal views,, are responsible for this attempt, which I am afraid will be only too successful,, still further to increase duties which are already abnormally high.

Free Trade is the policy which I have supported ever since I began to take an interest inpolitical questions, and I stand for it now. I have no use for the Customs House; I would sooner see all revenue raised by direct taxation. That is the more honest and proper form of taxation. Under it every member of the community knows what the Government of the State costs him, but with indirect taxation, although the people know that money is niched from them, and that at the end of the year they are poorer than they were at the beginning, they do not know how much they lose, because it is taken from them by stealth in purchasing commodities. ber vote against the land tax? not consider that a land tax should be imposed in addition to Customs taxation; it should be in substitution of it, and that is the only land value taxation I favour. class tax. is so. No one has the right to answer for me on the fiscal question, nor to control my speeches or votes in regard to it or any other matter. free. No doubt on the other side there are wide differences of opinion on the fiscal question. That is made evident when we see the honourable' member for Calare and the honourable member for Capricornia sitting together, or the Attorney-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs. Yet the Minister, speaking the other day for his Government and party, declared to a deputation that they were Protectionists. That makes me wonder whether the Free Traders in the Labour party have recanted their fiscal opinions. If he spoke for the whole of his party, I take it that they must have recanted their Free Trade principles, notwithstanding that they had been very strong. I desire to refer to some statements which have been made by honourable members on each side. honourable member for Kooyong said he thought that there should be an inquiry into the operation of the Tariff. We had a Royal Commission appointed for that very purpose. months, went carefully into the pros, and cons, of almost every industry in Australia, and drew up a voluminous report. But with what result? Although the report was made available before the revision of the Tariff in 1907, and had cost the country an enormous sum, yet the Ministry of the day set it on one side, and took its own course, with the honourable member for Hume in charge of the Trade and Customs .Department. I do not know whether if another Royal Commission were appointed we would get a different result. The honourable member for Kooyong also said that the revision of the Tariff is neverfinishedwith, but that rectifications must go on all the time. That shows very clearly that there is no finality to this Protection. When first we heard the cry for Protection the argument used to induce Free Traders to vote for Protectionist duties was, "" We only want a small amount of protection just to give the industries a start. As soon as they get a fair start they will be able to stand alone, and to be quite independent of the Tariff, and then we can afford to get rid of the duties."" The cry used to be the same when proposals for the grant of bounties were brought down. A bounty was only wanted for the purpose of tiding an industry over the preliminary stages, and then it could be done without, but in both cases our experience, and, I believe, Every man on this side is the experience of the world, has been that, so far from' any industry being satisfied, the Tariff protection which it received in the beginning has always created an appetite for more assistance, so that there never was any limit to the protection which an industry, once it was stimulated and spoon-fed by a Customs duty, would be able ultimately to demand and absorb. Duties have been raised and raised until the power of the public to bear further taxation is pretty well exhausted. I think it will only be a very short time before we shall find that the whole of the public will be so incensed at this continual increase in the cost of living which is so largely contributed to by Tariff protection that there will be a reversion once more to something in the In the course of his speech the nature of Free Trade, at any rate there will be a pretty universal demand by the consumers-by the term consumers I mean largely the wage-earning classes who after all are the majority of the consumersI t sat for a great many for at least a very substantial reduction in the rate of duties.",23,Tudor

ELLIOT JOHNSON I am quite sure, that I made my attitude quite clear. The honourable member for Hume stated that if we did not have Protection we should approach to the level of the blackfellow. might remind the honourable member of the days when he was a Free Traderthough not, of course, since he has been in the House-and held very different views. When Sir GeOrge Reid was Premier of New South Wales he practically abolished the Customs Housej he only retained the duties on narcotics, stimulants, and a few other items. During his tenure of office we had as near an approach to absolute Free Trade, coupled with the principle of land value taxation as has ever been known in Australia. There never was up to that time a greater period of prosperity. People got more for their sovereign then than they can possibly get to-day. There was a general lowering of prices, a general increase of the amount of employment available, a general increase in wages, and a very much greater degree of domestic comfort, especially among the poorer sections of the community than can be found anywhere in Australia to-day. answer to the honourable member for Hume in that regard. Furthermore, I would call his attention to the fact that Free Trade British wages are very much higher than Continential Protectionist wages. compare wages in Great Britain with the wages, not in a new country like Australia, America, or Canada, but in some of the older countries in Europe, where the comparison will be much fairer; if we compare the conditions, the wages, the general cost My speech would show of living, and the general comfort of the working classes of Great Britain with those of the working clasess in the most highly' protected Continental countries, the answer is one unmistakably in favour of Great.

So much for that illustration. are 1,000,000 people within reach of starvation. as much of London as the honourable member. I regard his statement as I a fanciful exaggeration. Speaking just now, the honourable member for Corio said that if it were not for the monopolies existing in Australia we could manufacture more cheaply than is done. I would remind the honourable member that the way to establish monopolies is to create vested interests, and that we could have no better way of creating vested interests than that of giving Customs Tariff privileges to certain manufacturers, who will profit thereby at the expense of the rest of the ccanmunity. Protection is the father of monopolies, trusts, and combines of that injurious character which the honourable member himself so heartily condemns, and he is helping to build up monopolies in Australia by supporting the imposition of protective duties. What is the underlying principle of Protection, save that of preventing free competition? If free competition is destroyed, monopolies must be created, and the more we increase our protective duties That is my the greater will become monopolies in Australia. The honourable member, and those associated with him, in helping local manufacturers to secure a monopoly of the home market, are doing their very best to build If we up the very monopolies against which they are making such an outcry.

It was able to do so, however, only by adopting the very process that tends to build up ""monopolies' in America.

What are the workers to receive as the result of this Tariff revision? What is the consumer to get out of it? The consumers generally, whether; they are. workers or not, are going to pay more than they pay already for their goods. Unless prices are to be increased, the imposition of these duties cannot be of any; advantage to the rnanufacturers concerned, This is, therefore, a proposal to take more money out of the pockets of the workers .to benefit the manufacturers. There is no stipulation that any portion of the benefit to be conferred on the manufacturers, by means of this Tariff, is to. beshared by the workers. What are the Ministry going to do about it? Despite their professions of friendship for. the worker, all' that we find in. this Tariff is an advantage to the employers and absolutely none for the employees. party took care that we should not obtainpower at the recent referenda to protect theworker. if the referenda proposal had been carried, the Government would have had no more power in this regard than they possess to* day, and any power which they do not enjoy themselves their confreres in. the State Parliaments have.

I am fighting now, and intend to continue to fight, against any attempt to give one section in the community an advantage at the expense of the rest. In my opinion, it is not the function of any Government or Parliament to legislate in the interests of any one section or class in the community. It is their function, on the contrary, to see that no obstacles are placed in the way of equal opportunities to all to earn a living, and to carve out their destinies in the way which may seem to them best. But the party at present in power in this Parliament are prepared to go out of their way to use their powers to legislate in the interests of one class in the community at the expense of all the rest, and to depart from those sound principles of freedom by which I have always been guided in connection with any legislation m which I have taken a part. In order to give honourable members opposite an opportunity to rectify an oversightI trust it is only an oversight, and not the result of deliberate action on their part-in excluding the workers from any benefit under the Tariff now proposed, I intend to move later on an addition to the motion now before the Committee in the following words:Provided that increased rates of duty shall cease to operate after a period of three months from the date of their imposition unless satisworld with agricultural products for the factory evidence shall be forthcoming that wages production of which they offered such have been increased in industries in respect to which increased Tariff protection has been indicated. I have no wish to restrict discussion at the present time, but later in the debate I intend to move this addition to the motion now before the Committee. It will give honourable members opposite an opportunity to show their sincerity. It wiil enable them to show that in providing all these special advantages for the employers of labour they have at the same time done their best to secure for the operatives in the industries specially protected a share in those advantages. I do not know that much is to be gained by embarking upon a discussion of the abstractions underlying Free Trade and Protection. I quite agree with the honourable member for Lang, that if we were to do that we should have to consider that Protection is really a breach of the general principle of human freedom. It is an attempt to control people in the expenditure of their own money, by saying that if they spend it outside their own country, as distinguished from inside the country, they must pay a penalty. I agree that it is inopportune now to go into the principles of Free Trade and Protection, and that at this stage of the session it would be merely a waste of time, but I wish to say, in answer to a number of statements made as to the conversion of the Opposition to Protection, that I do not give up one jot of my convictions as a Free Trader. Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Professor Fawcett are just as sacred to me now as embodying the truth in human affairs as they ever were. I can say candidly that if I had an opportunity to-morrow, without injuring vested interests, to bring about a return to absolute Free. Trade in Australia, I should take advantage of it. I believe that every country passes through a series of stages, beginning with the pastoral and agricultural, and passing when that has been exhausted to the manufacturing stage. England did not become a manufacturing country until she had almost ceased to command the market as a pastoral and agricultural country. She resorted to manufacturing, which draws the people from the free air of the country into crowded towns, very much to the detriment of their health, when the great territories of America and Russia had flooded the splendid facilities. England then resorted to manufacturing, with the result that the people, instead of living in the free air of the country, were brought into great .towns like Manchester, Liverpool, and London, where, amid the smoke and fumes of manufacturing industries, their vigour and physical condition generally became enormously deteriorated. I recognise that for a time Australia is committed to Protection, though I remain as ever true to my own convictions. Just as we all have fiom time to time become reconciled to the existence of a popular opinion different to that which we entertain ourselves, so T have to be reconciled to the popular view on the fiscal question. I befieve that the fiscal belief of the people of Australia has been largely influenced by .what I shall always characterize as a great breach of faith on the part of the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. Everyone will recollect that",26,Maloney I T Has Increased The Is No Necessity To Override State Rights In
118,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [12.23].,"when Mir., now Sir Edmund, Barton went to Maitland before this Parliament first met, he assured the people that we could have neither the Tariff of New South Wales, the oldest State in the Common-, wealth, nor that of Victoria, but that we must adopt some compromise between the two as tlie ultimate policy of the Commonwealth. -He came down to Melbourne, and told the people of Victoria that it was quite impossible to adopt the Tariff of either State referred to, and that we should require to adopt a compromise between the two. At that time. I know, from personal acquaintance of the men connected with Sir Edmund Barton's Ministry, that the inclusion in the first Government of the Commonwealth of as many Free Traders as Protectionists was contemplated. But the honourable member for Hume, who had the first call on the position of Prime Minister of Australia, handed over the commission to Sir Edmund Barton, stipulating that he should have a place in the Ministry. We all know very well that the first Prime Minister of Australia chose for his Government the strongest Protectionists in the Commonwealth, including the honourable member for Hume, who had been Premier of New South Wales, Mr Kingston, who had been Premier of South Australia, and Sir John Forrest, who had been Premier of Western Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE tectionist. prohibitionist, but he is a Protectionist in the sense in which some of the great Protectionist writers are Protectionists, because none of them is a prohibitionist. Sir Edmund Barton included in his Government the strongest Protectionists in Australia, and"" introduced a Tariff which, as I showed in TQ02, was 6 per cent, higher than the highest Protectionist Tariff that had ever been passed in Victoria. It is impossible to go back to the figures now, but I laid myself out to show that, instead of compromising between the Free Trade to which the people of New South Wales had been committed for so many years, and the Protection of Victoria, he had gone one better than the Protection of Victoria. I charged the honourable member plainly on the floor of the House with having obtained his majority by political false pretences.

South Wales have changed' since then. honourable member that in New South Wales there are just as many staunch Free Traders now as there were then, with the exception of a number, who were importers and who have found themselves forced by the Tariff to become manufacturers, and have set up their personal interests against the interests of the country. A few months' ago I said to one of the largest manufacturers of New South Wales, "" Have you changed your politics""? He replied, "" No ; if you ask me what I am from an Australian point of view, I am a Free Trader, but if you ask me what I am from the point of view of my own pocket, I am a Protectionist."" Sir WILLIAM LYNE T h a t is what most people are ! are a few-indeed , I think there are a He is not a great many-wh o look at public affairs apart from the interest of their pockets.

I wish to remove an idea that some honourable members opposite seem to have obtained from observations made on this side, that Free Traders here have become Protectionists. ber desire to convey that Free Trade and patriotism are synonymous terms? are. However, I do not desire to go into the philosophy of the question. My general view of politics is that life is a race, and that if our race, in the other sense, is to be dominant amongst the races of the world, we must cultivate the best form of citizenship.

Judge Cohen undertook the first arbitration case in New South Wales some years ago, he discovered at the end of his inquiry that the Steamship Company with whose affairs he was dealing, had ,£2,000 to the credit of some of their reserve funds. He said, "" If that is the case we shall have to go into the matter further,"" but it was pointed out on the other side, that if he were to raise the wages in that particular business because the employers had made more profits, it would be necessary to lower wages when he came to his next arbitration case, if he found that the employer was losing.

Why have pianos been selected as a subject for increased duty? Why has one of the amusements of the people been singled out ? I remember being told, not personally, but by deputy, that one of the manufacturers of pianos in this country, when embarking upon the industry, wanted no duty at. all. only taken the 20 and 25 per cent, but wants more now. Why should the duty on pianos be increased? Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. is of great importance that we should, so far as possible, have certainty in regard to the Tariff; it is undesirable, in the interests of importers, manufacturers, and the community generally, that the duties should be constantly changing. I remember a great Judge once saying that it is more important that the law should be certain than that it should be wise, the logical application of the remark being that when a law is certain the people get to know it, and understand it, and adapt themselves to it. The observation applies with great force to a Tariff. Bearing in mind the myriad ramifications of trade and commerce, and the enormous trouble involved to all classes by alterations of duty, we should hesitate before amending a Tariff. The schedule now under discussion may be divided into two parts: the proposals for the correction of anomalies, to which, if they are obviously needed, there can be no objection, and the proposals relating to a number of items which have been picked out of the former Tariff to be altered, as though the industries to which they relate have special claims for consideration. In regard to the timber duties, I happen to know that, by reason of the difference 'between the duty on dressed timber, which is 2s. 6d. per 100 feet, and that on undressed timber, which is 6d. per 100 feet, a large number of persons are now engaged in this country in dressing imported timber for the various purposes for which it is used. timber is 2s. 6d. super, face, which is equivalent to 5s. increasing the duty on undressed timber as now proposed will be that 200 or more men in New South Wales alone employed in dressing timber will be thrown out of employment. Whether a difference should have been made originally between dressed and undressed timber is a matter that does not concern me now; I merely point out that the effect of increasing the duty on undressed timber will be to throw a large number of persons out of employment, and to largely disorganize trade between New Zealand and Australia. No doubt 'However, he has not many arguments can be advanced in support of the proposal of the Government, but a great many more can be urged in rebuttal of them. With regard to anomalies, where the Minister satisfies me that adjustments are required to give consistency in the administration of the Tariff, 1 shall vote with himj but I shall oppose all alterations of items not involving the rectification of anomalies. -It is to be regretted that the Government did not introduce this Tariff schedule earlier, to give honourable members more time in which to make personal inquiry regarding its probable effects. Of course, we have been deluged with, information, from many sources, but men of experience know that such information must be taken with a pinch of salt, and I shall hesitate to support proposals of the reasonableness of which I am not firmly convinced. Probably it would have been well for the Government to confine its attention this session to the rectification of anomalies. Where a Customs: officer finds it extremely difficult under the law as it stands to deal justly with importers and the public, there should be an alteration of the Tariff, because our law should be as clear as possible, in the interests of the community and of the revenue.

There are, however, one or two items to which 1 wish to draw attention. In the first place, 1 desire to point out that the manufacture of superphosphates is not .sufficiently protected, local factories not being kept fully occupied. That is the case in South Australia. the Adelaide Chemical Works, has. made an enormous fortune, which the honourable member would make still bigger. What aho.ti;t those who have to pay the duties?' of superphosphates into South Australia amounts to 35,000 tons, 11,000 tons coming from Japan, the value of the importation being £41,000; 7,000 tons, valued .at £28,000, coming from.

This is nearly double the capacity of the South Australian works, of which there are two in Adelaide.

The Victorian plant of the Mount Lyell Company is: a paying concern; because it is worked up ,to iits full capacity; but the South Australian works have an output equal to only half itfaeir capacity, and as one of the conditions of success in manufacturing is the keeping of plant fully employed, they are not so profitable as .they should be.' I would not be a party to increasing prices to the farmers. With me the interests of the consumers, as well as those of the workers, have to be protected. In the days of Gladstone and Bright, and the great Free Traders of England, it used to be said that a study of the interests of consumers would settle this question.. The founders of Free Trade laid that down as a dictum, but it is one with which I do not agree. The interests of the workers are surely of some importance,, and we have to remember that all consumers are not workers. If they were there might be some force in this FreeTrade dictum-. consumes the most works the least. Bismarck accurately put it on one occasion, all that the man who consumes the most usually does is to cut coupons and sign receipts. He may be in some cases avery hard working man, but as a rule he is not.

I have no desire to talk at large on this question, but there are in this schedule one or two items which I cannot support. For instance, I object to the proposed duty on American stoves and heaters. When a man is able to say of his own knowledge that the course proposed by the Government in respect of one item is wrong he might be inclined, following a rule of thumb, to say that he can place no reliance on other proposals affecting matters of which he knows nothing. position, I should like to know on what grounds this duty on American gas stoves and heaters can be justified. They are not made in Australia, but are imported very largely. marJe by the Standard Oil Company of the United States of America, but they are used for cooking purposes in nearly every small household during a season of the year when a fire is not required to warm a room. Every economic housewife knows their value, yet it is proposed to impose a duty upon them because in some obscure part ot Australia there may be four men and a boy employed in making a certain class of stove. I am not now referring to the stoves m which wood and coal are burnt, or which might be more correctly described as consuming wood and coal, and consuming I do not object to a duty in order to protect an Australian industry, but where there is no competition, and the proposal amounts to a revenue impost, I regard it as a big mistake. As to flannelette, I should like to see the last yard of it imported, because I regard it as the mostdangerous fabric that could possibly be worn, and in our climate it is absolutely necessary that woollen garments should be worn next the skin. We are told that there has been discovered a process to makeflannelettenon-inflammable. the flannelette is washed. like to see the importation of flannelette prohibited, we have to recollect that, it is worn by the poorest of our brethren; and, therefore, I shall be no party to any increased duty. Personally, I should not, under any circumstances, wear a garment made of flannelette; but I refuse to inflict a great injustice on tlie poorest of I trust that the Minister Australians, because of my strong opinions or prejudices. There are other items to which I might refer, but I have no desire to prolong the debate. I hope that, in the future, the Minister, when seeking information, will see that no industry is handicapped by the withholding of Protection or increased Protection, simply because no representations are made to him by those concerned. I regret that the Minister of Trade and Customs did not introduce this Customs schedule at a much earlier stage. He has had some eighteen months in which to inWhilstI do not take up that vestigate the matter; and, as a fact, inquiry into Tariff anomalies was begun immediately after the passing of the Tariff of 1907-8. Inquiry has proceeded continuously ever since; and, under the cirI t is quite likely that they are cumstances, this proposed revision of the Tariff should have been submitted, at the very latest, at the beginning of this session. Its introduction at this late hour is unfair both to the industries concerned and to the members of this Parliament; and it is particularly unfair to the people of the outlying States. In Victoria, when a revision of the Tariff is introduced, those engaged in the industries affected are able, in a day or two, to come here and interview members personally; but the case is very different with Western Australia and Queensland. I doubt whether in the northern State the people have yet realized . that the new Tariff is in operation. In them with a vengeance.

185,Mr Groom,"The only notice was that they are not in a position to form any final opinion upon all the varied subjects submitted. I franky admit that I approach this question considerably, handicapped in the absence of any material on which to come to a conclusion. How can honourable members be omniscient in regard to the importations and manufactures of a continent? The Minister is not able to give us that fair judicial determination suggested by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, with whose utterances I find myself very much in agreement. declares that what is required for the discussion of the Tariff is the judicial determination by some body empowered. to make investigation ; and I am sure that honourable members on both sides would welcome a non-partisan inquiry of the kind carried out on some definite principle. In this connection I should like to refer honourable members to the experience in the United States. There the Republican party as protectionists set themselves to define some definite guiding principle for the Tariff, and this is what they arrived atIn all Tariff legislation the true principle of Protection is best maintained by the imposition and it was with a knowledge of this that of such duties as will equal the difference between the late Government proposed to hand over the cost of production at home and abroad, to the duty of investigation to the Inter-State gether with a reasonable profit to American inCommission, which is contemplated by the dustries.

A proposal to that effect came before Congress, but, unfortunately, no definite Act was passed giving the complete powers desired. Congress contented itself with giving the President authority to appoint persons to assist him in the application of the maximum and minimum provisions of the Tariff and in the administration. This was followed by the appointment of the Tariff Board, consisting of Mr Emery as chairman, and Messrs. Reynolds and Saunders as members. This arrangeThat honourable member ment, though] not so complete as that intended, represents a considerable step forward in the direction of an investigation, for the first time in the history of the United States, on definite scientific lines.

It is interesting to note members should be at liberty to take that several Free Trade members on the Opposition side have stated that they recognise that Protection is the settled policy of the country. At the same time. I hope that Protectionists will not be lulled by those remarks into any false sense of security, because the honourable member for Parkes, for instance, afterwards said he hoped in his day to see Australia practically return to a revenue Tariff. If the honourable member has such a hope, he will, no doubt, endeavour to give effect to it. It simply means that the Protectionists have to trust to themselves and not to Free Traders in the administration of the Tariff, or in giving effect to the policy of Protection. member is trusting to a Free Trade Administration just now. must know that I am quite as dissatisfied with the fact that there are Free Traders on this side as with the fact that there are Free Traders on that. Government are doing a little, whereas the last Government did nothing. They told us that they would deal with Tariff anomalies, but they did not do it, and had they remained in power we should have still been in the same position. Something has been said about the appointment of a board, but we must be very careful how we hand over the government of the country to board after board. If we do, there will be no necessity for Parliament at all. While a Tariff board might be able to gather a good deal of information, I should like to know where their duties would begin and end. The honourable member for Darling Downs spoke of a. non-partisan judicial commission, but no one imagines that we could obtain any non-partisan board on the fiscal question. Every man who becomes a member of it will be originally a Free Trader or a Protectionist. What is the board to do? Is it to follow the American idea, which, by the way, the American Board did not carry out? Is it to inquire into all the minute details, comparing the effect of one duty with another, and then go to other countries to take evidence? I could quite understand a Free Trader supporting such a proposal, because it would simply mean that we should never have any revision of. the Tariff. How much of the evidencegathered by the board would be placed before the House? We are told that its evidence on oath, and be sworn to a certain amount of secrecy; but is not that just the trouble with the present Minister? Did not the honourable member for Ulawarra attack him last n^ght on that very ground? The honourable member asked, "" Where is the evidence on which the Minister hasbrought in this Tariff?"" The reply was that the Minister had obtained it confidentially, and the honourable member then asked: ""Are we not to hear it ? "" The same thing would be said when the Tariff board brought in its report. All that the board would do would be to bring in certain findings, and we should never be able to see the most important part of the evidence taken by them. If the Government accepted thefindingsof the board, we should COOK -The honourable have everybody who was dissatisfied with them hunting us in the lobbies and the halls, as they are doing now. I should be quite prepared to support the appointment of a board in order that it might get us some information, but I do not see how it is to take the place of this Parliament, But the present or how it can take away from the Government of the day the responsibility of recommending a Tariff to this Parliament, or take away from this Parliament the responsibility of passing it through. gested that. dispute the findings of the board, and are to have people waiting upon us to lay before us evidence that those findings are incorrect, while we cannot get the confidential evidence which enabled the board to make those findings, where are we to get finality ? I am sorry the honourable member for Darling Downs is not present, because I wish to refer to the question of the Inter-State Commission, regarding which I interjected, when he was speaking, "" Why did not your Government appoint it?"" The honourable member for Lang and others have spoken about what the Opposition proposed to do in vesting the I'nter-StateCommission with the powers of a Tariff' board. Why, then, did they not appoint the Inter-State Commission? That has been my puzzle to this day, and I have never heard it solved.

The honourable member for Darling Downs said, in reply to my interjection, as did the honourable member for Lang, that they were defeated at the elections. they were in power before the elections, with majorities in bodi Houses, and passing anything they liked, while curtailing all discussion by the use of the "" gag."" What is the-use, then, of their saying they could not appoint the Inter-State Commission? The Inter-State Commission Bill, which provided for all the things for which they say they want to provide now, was read a first time in the Senate on the motion of the honourable member for Kooyong, who was then a senator, and Vice-President of the Executive Council, on the ist October. On the 6th October he moved the second reading, and fully explained its principles. It was then debated for one hour and forty-five minutes. On the 13th October it was further debated for three hours thirtyeight minutes, and on the 14th October it was considered from 6.13 p.m. until the Senate suspended its sitting at 6.30 the same night. After that it was never heard of , although Parliament sat until the 8th December-two solid months. important matters were in the meantime forced through both Houses, by the Government then in power by the use of their majority and the ""gag,"" yet this Bill was never touched. What is the good of their saying that they could not have put it through if they liked? If they were sincere or earnest in what they say to-day, the Inter-State Commission would have been an accomplished fact in 1909, but they did not pass the Bill, and now they tell us, ""We would have done it if we had been returned to power after the elections."" Judging by what happened that year, if they had been returned to power we should have been no further forward than we are. I mention these facts because I am tired of hearing of what they are going to do. It is useless to prolong the present discussion. We cannot cure the position, but must deal with the proposals before us. The honourable member for Darling Downs said that the schedule is so unsatisfactory that we might as well leave it alone, to which two pronounced Free Traders on this side of the House said, "" Hear, hear."" They are in favour of any course that means leaving the Tariff alone. I agree Mr Wise. that the schedule is unsatisfactory, but we ..must either make the best of it or throw it aside. Personally, I am thankful for small mercies, and I shall be very much surprised if next session a thorough revision of the Tariff is not proposed. When that revision has been made, the Inter-State Commission I am referring to the time when can be appointed, with authority to watch and investigate tlie operation of the Tariff, so that in the future Parliament may have more information. To-day we are dealing with the Tariff as we have dealt with former Tariffs, introduced when some of those who are now in Opposition were in power. This Government has not acted differently from its predecessors. culty, and we wished to remove it. carried out. recognises the need for what we proposed? to have more information, but Parliament cannot shift its responsibilities on to a commission. It is not to be expected that the finding of any commission or board will be accepted as absolute by Parliament or the people. honourable member for Gippsland is always Plenty of interesting upon these occasions, because he can always be counted on to hide the reasons why he supports a Government which is doing nothing by asserting that if the other party were in power it would do nothing. I shall not address myself to this question from a party stand-point, because its consideration breaks up tlie normal party divisions. On the Government side, the most intelligent member of the Ministry claimed, a year or two ago, to be a Free Trader. Other Ministers, only less intelligent, have similarly described themselves, while others again are Protectionists. We have the same differences amongst the rank and file, getting down to those who, like the honourable member for Melbourne, proudly vaunt themselves as prohibitionists. On the Opposition side, different Tariff views are held, but the opinions are not so extreme. Here there are no such wild prohibitionists as the honourable member for Melbourne announced himself to be, and none so hopeless of Government action as to suggest, as do Ministerialists, that it is impossible under the existing Constitution to do anything in regard to Tariff management.",39,William Lyne I Shall Withdraw

I do not claim that nothing can be done to develop industry by means of a Tariff. You can get almost anything done, if you pay for it, though it is rarely worth paying excessive prices. For that reason, I have always resisted the proposals of prohibitionists and high Tariffists, and see no reason at this juncture to alter my attitude. The discussion on a Tariff is sometimes made an opportunity to denounce the country in which we live as incapable of anything, or to denounce that Old Country sprung as decaying, because of its faulty fiscal system.

Whenever an honourable member has 'gone beyond the limits of an incidental reference to a subject which is irrelevant, I have drawn his attention to the fact. for Melbourne last night spoke for forty minutes almost wholly upon such subjects as that on which I have just touched. It is difficult to ascertain whether this schedule has been introduced for the protection of industries', or the increasing of the revenue. There are proposals for increasing the protection of highly successful industries, while other proposals jeopardize industries. I believe that no Ministry will ever be able to pass what has been spoken of as a scientific Tariff. Three Tariffs have been passed since I became a member of the House, but never before has a Tariff been introduced at the close of a session, Minfrom which our people have isters having to rely on the shades of night to clothe their actions in a suitable darkness Hitherto Tariff discussion has been hope much from its developin the light of day. Measures involving I have the taxation of the people have never before been forced through in such a manner as to make it impossible for their criticism to be heard and felt. Parliaments are not fitted to deal properly with Tariff revision. Especially can this be said of a Legislature in which every member is paid, and in which Tariff questions must be considered largely in the light of votes. An industry may be important to the country, and yet have few votes, whilst another, absolutely unimportant to the country, may have manyvotes. What happens in such circumstances ? We find that the industry having the votes Great Britain's industrial and gets the most Protection/ whilst the industry that has the greatest claim upon the country gets none. buried I shall appeal to the honourable member for help,, but until then I hope that he will allow me to proceed. mark. by constantly interjecting, has been trying to turn my remarks into a little pleasantry.

224,Mr Kelly,"If you, Mr Chairman,things for the country in this regard, unless you start from the absolute basis of the raw material. The existing Tariff does not start on that basis. Looking through its innumerable items, one finds countless items dealing, for instance, with the iron and machinery trades, and yet the machinery trades are importing almost every pig of iron used in these protected industries ! The machinery trades employing men in handling iron imported from oversea can bring influence to bear upon these great Australian patriots, who now talk of prohibition, to make them keep a duty off pig iron, because pig iron from oversea, if you please, is the raw material of the Australian ironworker 1 In the same way we find the man who is working in woollen mills-and in my humble judgment the wool of Australia ought to, and would under natural cond'tions, leave Australia's shores in finished form-gettin g 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, on the product of his labour, whilst evervthing that he has to huv-fro m hoots and clothing for himself, and swaddling-clothes for his children, down to coffins for his parents-is taxed at infinitely higher rates. Thus, on the net balance we find that by giving 40 per cent, duties on everything that a woollen worker wants, and 25 per cent, on the product of his toil, we are actually hampering one of the great industries within the Australian Commonwealth ! Generally speaking, we find throughout the raw materials of the worker-hi s actual living necessities-invariabl y taxed up to the hilt. Tn the proposals now submitted to us, not only is there no provision for the alleviation of that position, but we are to go a little further down the bad road of unscientific Protection, along which we have hitherto travelled. In the past, I believe an effort-if I may associate that term with the honourable member for Hume-ha s been made to arrive at a scientific Tariff. The honourable member for Hume brought in. the existing Tariff, and I am the more ready to believe that there was, perhaps, something sensible in it, because he had such infinite difficulty in explaining it to the Committee of those days. If it was a perfect instrument, as first introduced, it had -certainly ceased to be anything better than a mere nest of anomalies by the time it left this Chamber. That was due to the fact that the same persons were not dealing with the Tariff from the time that it was introduced until it left our charge. HonorMr Kelly. able members who are new to this business will see the same thing occur again in connection with the schedule now before us. Afull Committee deals with one item, and the will of the Committee is therefore obtained in regard to' it.. On the next item, which, perhaps, is closely related to it, however, a catch division is. taken-and so the clumsy machinery of Government control of Tariffs goes stupidly upon its way. The pressure sought to be exercised by mere voting strength upon what ought to be the national intelligence of this Chamber blocks a scientific Tariff in one direction; and parliamentary methods of procedure have blocked a scientific Tariff in another. In my humble judgment we shall never obtain from a House of Parliament anything approaching a scientific Tariff, even if the whole of the people of Australia unanimously declares that Protection is the only salvation of this country. This question needs to be dealt with by a board whose whole business in life it shall be to examine into what industries require; a board that can be relied upon not to divulge trade secrets; whose integrity can be relied upon not to give undeserved profits to manufacturers at the expense of the people, and whose fairmindedness can be relied upon not to be swayed by mere hatred of oversea products. Such a board would inquire constantly into what was necessary if we wanted the Tariff what I might call Protection for some of the industries of the Australian people. Such a board would send out a Tariff based upon an analysis of human reason, and not Tariffs as those now submitted to us aremere playthings of party prejudice and catch divisions in this House. This Tariff is, in a sense, something worse than anything we have had before. It is a small, puny thing, but is handled worse than any Tariff has been dealt with in the memory of honourable members. It has been introduced practically without explanation. The Minister is unable to tell us whether the industries helped really require these duties; he is unable to tell us whether the industries helped merit that help, or whether the men operating them are observing -good conditions 'of labour and paying good wages. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -He will tell us that later on. MrK ELLY -Afte r we have dealt with the Tariff? That is the way honourable members opposite have of dealing with public business, and it shows a contemptuous disregard of the possibilities of this House as a debating chamber. member is not in order in referring to honourable members as showing a contemptuous disregard for the House. plete obedience to your wishes, sir, I shall say that the Government sought to show its tremendous appreciation of the high dignity Of Parliament; its overwhelming sense of responsibility as His Excellency's advisers in this Chamber, and its extraordinary sense of the eternal fitness of things, by introducing, this Tariff Bill without any explanation whatsoever ! We now have the promise of the honourable member for Robertson Mr W. J. mise; I only anticipated that .the items would be explained when we came to deal with them individually. anticipates, but cannot promise, that after the whole matter has been dealt with we shall have an explanation from the Minister. Mr W. J. JOHNSON I said that the Minister would, I supposed, explain eachitem as we came to it. able member is wrong. Chairman will keep the Minister just as strictly to each item as he is now keeping me to the second-reading consideration of. the Tariff. the Minister religiously to the consideration of the item immediately before the Chair, how shall we be able to understand how one item is inter-related with another, as we should have been if the proposals had been dealt with now as a whole. I am willing to discuss the items seriatim later on, but if the honourable member for Robertson finds in this Tariff schedule before us two items, one of which relates to the finished product and the other to the raw material of the finished product, surely he will want to know from the Minister--and we ought to know now-ho w those two proposals affect each other. The Minister in introducing the Bill, should have taken it item by item, and have said, "" We want a duty on this item, but not on such and such an item, which is the raw material of the finished product covered by such and such another item,"" and in that way he could have run broadly through the whole gamut of human industry represented in theseproposals. Asit is, the Minister will not be able to give us later on -a comprehensive explanation of every sepaThe honourable rate item in this Tariff in such a way as to commend' it to equity, and; I tRinkI may say, without offence, to good conscience. The honourable member for Capricornia, who is so persistently interrupting, was at one time in a position of some prominence in another place.

I naturally thought that, before the Government tried to place, say, an additional 150 per cent, of the duty, at current prices, on the tyres used by the members of the Australian Workers Union, they would have found out whether the industrywas languishing and required assistance. So far as I can find out from the public press and from the Stock Exchange list,, there seems to be no ground for that apprehension, for the big company manufacturing tyres in Australia has recently increased its capital, and is doing very well.

It would appear, therefore, that the company is making reasonable profits. I desired to know what share in the Australian trade was being done by this company, and I ascertained that some 20 per cent, of the tyres used here for motors, and over 80 per cent, of the bicycle am glad to be able to inform honourable tyres, are made locally. If we suddenly increase the duty, not by a straight-out ad valorem duty, but by the devious poundage means proposed, I suppose an opportunity will be afforded for honourable members opposite to pretend to their supporters in the Australian Workers Union that the duty has not really been raised, although this monopoly will practically be given vastly enhanced profits. This is a company of which we ought to be proud, but it is not necessary to load its shareholders up with wealth at the expense of the Australian people, and especially of the members of the Australian Workers Union. I made further inquiries, and found that the company does business beyond the Commonwealth. I was unable to obtain the information I desired in regard to the prices of bicycle tyres, but I can submit some comparisons in relation to motor tyres. These will show conclusively that the company can export and pay freight and sell motor tyres in New Zealand at a much less price than they ask in Australia. have found out these simple facts for himself? The price-list shows that for one of the smaller tyres sold here at £5 7s. 6d. the people in New Zealand are asked to pay only £4 16s. 6d; for a tyre which costs here £7 4s. the New Zealand people pay £6 2s. 6d. Another tyre is sold here for £8 2s., and in New Zealand for £7 5s.; and a large tyre sold here for £10 7s. 6d. is sold there for £9. Perhaps the motor tube may give an indication of the possible comparative prices of the bicycle tyres. A small inner tube for a motor tyre is sold here at £1 12s. 6d., and in New Zealand for £1 11s. j another is sold here for £2 3s. 6d., and in New Zealand for £1 17s. 6d.; another is sold here for £2 3s. 6d., and in New Zealand for £2 os. 6d.; another is sold here for £2 15s,. and in New Zealand at £2 12s. persuaded the .Government to give this deservedly successful company additional prowith the raw material of this indusMr Kelly. fits.

However, I tendered my shilling, and examined the share register of the company; and I members that I do not think there is any justification for the rumour I have indicated.

There must be some ground for the duty in the Minister's mind, unless the absence of grounds was the excuse he had for not addressing himself to the items when introducing the Tariff.

Then there are what the Customs Department calls "" masticated "" rubber, and a rubber of a smoother type. This ""masticated"" rubber is prepared between rollers with rough edges, and hence the appearance which gives rise to its name, while the other is prepared between smooth rollers. The Customs Department has found out some extraordinary difference between the two, and is going to endeavour, by means of a duty, to arrange that all the rubber from the Straits Settlements shall pass through one patricular sort of rollers. I suppose that Australia takes under 1 per cent, of the total rubber output; and yet every factory in the world is to be called upon to install new and uniform machinery for the sake of a share of this 1 per cent. The thing is ridiculous! This is not only to the damage of an industry, but, worse of all, to the damage of an industry that is centred in Melbourne.

I place this proposal before honourable members in all its native ugliness. Every single item of this Tariff must be carefully scrutinized if that is the way in which the Government have proceeded in regard to one which affects the members of the strongest union supporting my honourable friends opposite. Another extraordinary proposal is shown in the item of strawboard. Some 5,000 persons in Australia make their livelihood by manufacturing boxes and other articles of this material, and some fifty people, in what I may call the national city of the south, are engaged in making strawboard. I am told that the strawboard manufacturers cannot supply the orders they have now; but, because they live in the south, or, perhaps, because they happen to be in the Minister's constituency, this duty is to be imposed. There must be some reason, good or bad, for this item. We find now that 5,000 men are to be driven out of employment for the sake of fifty in the city of Melbourne. are women. women, of course, for one of the features of all protected industries is the large number of women employed. I suppose that about the same proportion of the fifty employees in Melbourne are women. will, I hope, give us a lead on the subject of strawboard when the details are reached. We find the same sort of foolishness in connection with white pine, and even the realm of music is not left untouched. We are to have a big duty on talking machines, which is arrant selfishness on the part of my honourable friends.

Oil and water colour paintings other than those by Australian students, 25 per cent."" The best of our artists have gone abroad to study, and the Government are going to prevent their works being sent to Australia. We are to have here only the works of art of the Sydney Bulletin and of the Labour weeklies!

I have not gone generally into the items of the schedule, because I refuse point blank to do so at this stage, until we have had from the Minister some explanation of how their effects are inter-related. I have shown conclusively that the Minister is imposing duties which have not been asked for by any Australian industry, that he is detripower to do all that Parliament can do to mentally affecting Australian industry by means of some of his proposals, and that Parliaments generally, and this Parliament under present management in particular, are not capable of giving the country a scientific Tariff. I appeal now to the Government and to the Committee to say that the next Tariff introduced must give us the combined wisdom of persons specially appointed to consider the needs of Australian industries. I appeal to the Committee to see that the Australian people have a chance to realize that their Tariffs must not be the mere playthings of catch divisions and party prejudices in this Chamber, or of influences even less worthy. The whole question must be looked into scientifically and seriously, and the result of the investipracticable and unworkable, and not a live gation must be placed before the Australian people. The policy of this country has been declared by an overwhelming majority to be Protectionist, and I appeal to honourable members, if they wish to give effect to the people's will, to give effect to it sanely, after mature, impartial, expert We spent a great deal of time on the preconsideration, and not in the ineffective, helpless, htipeless manner in which these proposals have been submitted by the Government. this debate convinces the Government that it would be very unwise to touch the Tariff at all next session, the time may not be wasted. plenty of time next session. ing the Tariff at all until we can do justice all round. I am not surprised at the atiiture of ithe Opposition when we remember the names of the gentlemen who took a hand in welding them together. Naturally, the manufacturers, having secured a very fair Protectionist Tariff, and having rendered new Protection unattainable, are quite content and happy with things as they It is not on that ground that 1 oppose dealing with the Tariff. We have learnt, since the Tariff of 1907-8 was introduced, that the Constitution does not give us power to protect the workers or the consumers, and that there are in existence monopolies, combines, honourable understandings, and similar schemes, which those who have the control of industries, and make things to sell, use in order to fleece and exploit the public, who, of course, include the wage-earners. I am opposed to touching the Tariff any more until we have deal with the wages of workmen. Under present arrangements, I do not think we have power to do that properly, even by means of the State machinery. It has been said that the State tribunals should control wages; but I do not think that fair competition can be assured between manufacturers, except by a Federal tribunal. We want to give our Federal Arbitration Court power to deal with industries in the Federal sense. Those who want to prevent that Court being clothed with the powers which we seek to give it, and which the Constitution at present denies to it, always propose some other method. The Opposition now favour the appointment of an Inter-State commission ; but their scheme in that regard is imissue. We have the machinery of the Arbitration Court, which is well fitted to cope with that kind of work; but, at present, the Judge, able and fair as he undoubtedly is, is hampered by constitutional limitations. vious Tariff, which generally turned out to be very workable from the .Protectionist stand-point.

We have had the usual circulars sent to us, containing ex parte statements from those interested persons who, whenever a Tariff is before the House, tell us that they are going to be ruined if additional duties are not imposed. Some of them, to judge by their balance sheets, .are not in very much danger of ruin. Others are opposing the imposition of additional duties j and, altogether, the schedule now before us seems so unsatisfactory, that probably it is the most uncomfortable kind of measure that any. Minister could take charge of. Fortunately, both the Opposition, and members on this side, seem to have great faith in the Minister's ability to explain things. that they do not understand the items, and. expect the Minister to explain every one of them satisfactorily as they are reached. Probably the Minister will be able to satisfy them. I have been surprised to hear some honourable members on this side apparently advocating the revision of the whole Tariff before we obtain power to deal with the many evils that undoubtedly exist in regard to wages and conditions of labour generally. I do not admit that the imposition of a duty necessarily raises the cost of an article. end of the session, when matters of great, When in the Old Country, which is allegedly Free Trade, I found very few things that were any cheaper than in Australia. Therefore, we may dismiss the statement that Tariffs raise prices and Free Trade reduces them, since they are determined chiefly by other factors. Whether wages be high or low, and whatever the duties may be, sellers try to make the highest profits they can obtain. Our endeavour should be to protect the worker from the practical reduction of his wages by the increase of prices. He should be paid his share of the value of the production of the industry in which he is engaged, and as a consumer should not be charged so highly for the commodities which he uses as to cause his wages to be materially reduced. I do not agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh about Courts having power to hear evidence regarding the profits of industries. Mr Justice Higgins has very properly declined to accept such evidence. Following other Judges, he has expressed the view that if an industry cannot pay fair and reasonable wages, it should close. Profits are to be considered in connection with the Tariff, when it may [^53] be shown that, owing to the high rate of duties, or to some combination, they are unreasonable. Parliament has now no power to deal with combines, and I am opposed to any alteration of the Tariff until the people give us the power to deal with them. According to the Minister, who made a long and elaborate explanation of the schedule, most of the proposed alterations are required to improve the administration of his Department. The debate may show that some of these alterations are unnecessary, and that the Tariff might very well remain as it is for a long while to come. My desire is that there shall be no alteration until Parliament can protect the workers and consumers, as well as the manufacturers. I shall be no party to legislation, which, while raising wages, They confess say, is. directly, indirectly reduces them by 2s. 6d., and I hope that the Tariff will not be meddled with until the Constitution has been altered, so that we can deal effectively with economic conditions generally. Government that is afraid to face the fiscal question is not worthy of the confidence of the people. Australia has declared for Protection, but the schedule now under discussion, has been introduced at the fag though not of greater importance, have to be dealt with, and there is not sufficient time for its proper consideration. Had it been introduced earlier, we should have been able to obtain more information regarding its proposals, and had an advisory board, or commission, inquired into and reported upon Tariff reform, we could have had a Tariff revision which would have done justice to the subject. While I believe in Protection, I do not hold the view that duties must be imposed on everything. We have to consider, not merely the benefits to be obtained by an industry by the imposition of protective duties in its interest, but also whether those benefits counterbalance the injury done in some other directions. In a young country like Australia, Tariff revision must be a periodical thing, because we are making such advances that we soon outgrow any given set of conditions. The object of duties is to encourage industries, which must subsequently be protected. We are not now in a position to give the people a fair and square deal.

251,Mr Sinclair (Moreton) [4.36],"Af r u it will receive some consideration, but I regret that the great banana growing industry has been overlooked, and will be forced to continue to compete with F i j i , where labour is cheaper, one of the States having committed the un-Federal action of subsidizing a line of steamers to bring cheap fruit here from that country. The alteration of the flannelette duties is absurd. The object of the Minister is to prevent accidents from the use of inflammable material, but, with a duty of 35 per cent, on ready-made clothing, it will be cheaper to import it than to pay 20 per cent, on raw material to be made up here. The alteration of duties may prevent the importation of piece goods, but will not keep out made-up goods, and an article which is used by thousands of persons will be increased in cost by about 2d. a yard. I have been informed that it is possible to treat flannelette chemically with alum, borax, and other things, so that it will pass the departmental test, but that these things are injurious to health, and that after repeated washing the treatment is likely to prove ineffective, and of no protection to the wearers of flannelette. If flannelette were displacing flannel, then, thought that he was trying to evade answerin order to protect our woollen industry, I should be prepared to support the imposition of a duty on it. But notwithstanding this duty, which, on the average, will mean an increased price of 2d. per yard, people will continue to use flannelette, and will still be exposed to the danger of wearing this inflammable material. I believe, however, that as a result of this impost the people will turn their attention to imported flannelette garments instead of buying the raw material, or flannelette garments made up here. Prior to the introduction of this schedule, leather cloth was free. I do not object to the proposed duty of 20 per cent., but it is just as well that we should know what the duty means.

I should like now to ask the Minister why vinegar has been selected for special treatment. In 1910 we imported 271,000 gallons of vinegar, valued at 2s. 5d. per gallon.

A great proportion of the vinegar used to-day is a by-product, and it does not appear, from the figures I have quoted, that the local manufacturers require further Protection, seeing that the local article enjoys an advantage of something like 100 per cent, in price as comRecentlyI asked the Minister of pared with the price of the imported article. A duty of 6d-. per gallon is almost equal to 50 per cent, on the price of the local product, and I fail to understand why it should have been thought necessary to make this further imposition. The duty in the schedule now before us will not prohibit the importation of vinegar. It is not likely to reduce the quantity now coming in.

Then the proposed duty on the lines included in paragraphs 2 and 3 pf sub-item D, which cover felloes and rims of hickory, should be at least 15 per cent. These felloes and rims can be made in the Commonwealth in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the whole trade, and I do not think that a duty of 15 per cent, is too much to ask in support of an industry which has to work under Wages Board conditions here? hickory in Australia, and local firms are prepared to cater for the trade if they receive anything like reasonable protection. Considering that many of the industries which use spokes, felloes, and rims as their raw material are protected by duties ranging from 25 to 35 per cent., they should not object to the manufacturers of this class of hardware being protected to the extent of a duty of 15 per cent. At the very least there should be a duty of 10 per cent, in respect of imports from the United Kingdom, and a general Tariff of 15 per cent. I am afraid that the proposed alteration, making white paper dutiable, will lead to great hardship so far as many of the poorer classes are concerned. a duty on white paper. printing is to be free under departmental regulations. used for other than printing purposes?

Since this is the only class of paper dealt with in the schedule now before us, it is interesting to note the importations of paper under all other headings. According to the official statistics of Customs and Excise revenue in ioro, the importations of paper bags not printed, and which are dutiable at 8s. 6d. per cwt. under the preferential Tariff, were of the value of £ 1 2 , 6 5 4 ; £ 1 2 , 1 2 7 worth of bintting paper, dutiable at 4s. 6d. per cwt. under the preferential Tariff, was imported in 1910; whilst other imports of paper were as follow-Boards, coated, n.e.i., dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent., £ 1 5 , 6 7 9 worth; browns and sugar, f r u it bag paper, & c , dutiable at 5s. and 4s. 6d. per cwt., £ 8 9 , 7 5 4 worth; cardboard and pasteboard, dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free in the case of imports from the United Kingdom, £ 2 0 , 6 9 9 worth; cartridge paper, dutiable at 5s. and 4s. 6d. per cwt., £ 7 , 3 0 3 worth; gummed paper, n.e.i., dutiable at 20 per cent., £ 4 , 3 3 0 worth; manufactures of paper, framed and unframed, having advertisements thereon, dutiable at 35 per cent., or 6d. per lb.. £ 5 9 , 2 5 7 worth; millboard, greyboard, leatherboard, Manilaboard. and woodboard, 5 per cent., and free, £ 3 6 , 7 7 4 worth; paperhangings dutiable at 20 per cent, arid 15 per cent., £6.1,701 worth; and printing paper, which was previously free, but which is now to be free subject to departmental by-laws, £ 7 3 1 , 1 9 6 worth.

The duty on strawboard is, I think, is. 6d. per cwt., and there was imported £ 2 8 , 1 5 1 worth. On toilet-paper the duty is 25 per cent., and the quantity imported was £ 3 , 5 4 8 worth; on writing and typing paper, plain, in sheets, not less than 16 inches by 13 inches, the duty is 5 per cent, and free, and the importations represent £ 2 3 1 , 9 8 5 ; on paper n.e.i., including pulpboard, cloth-lined boards, cloth-lined paper, and floor paper, the duty is 20 and 15 per cent., and the importations represented £ 7 3 , 3 5 5 ; other paper is admitted at 5 per cent, and free, and the importations represented £ 1 1 5 , 6 5 8 . It will be seen from these figures that, notwithstanding the heavy duties, there are large importations, and that the white paper is not the serious competitor it is claimed to be, especially in view of the compensating advantages. It is evident that the paper mills of Australia are not yet capable of coping with the demand j and, if it is necessary to protect the mills against white paper, it will be necessary to protect them against other paper by increased duties all round. I am pleased to see that there are already two piano factories turning out splendid instruments, and, I understand, doing remarkably well. I am informed that, before there was any Protection at all, one of the firms managed to make a very decent return. fixed duties on pianos. afford to buy an instrument at any price ranging from £45 to £100 he can well afford to pay an ad valorem duty; but there are many poorer people, who, perhaps, desire to have a piano, if only as a piece of furniture, at, say, £12, and they should not be called upon to pay an extra £6 or £7. in ail valorem duties, when they can be imposed without any serious difficulty in arriving at the values or in the collection. I have seen pianos exposed for sale at £6 in Melbourne; and-it is very hard that a poor person, who requires one of these, should have to pay an equivalent of the fixed duty. The only other item to which I desire to refer is one that does not appear in the schedule, but in regard to which some honourable member. may be Mr Sinclair. inclined to submit a proposal. I refer to That, so far, he has failed cheese caps; and possibly each honourable Then, again, we find that member has received a circular dealing with this item.. Much as I am interested in all rural industries, particularly the dairying industry, I should not ask for any consideration that I would not support in the case of any other industry. There are factories in Australia manufacturing cheese caps at the present moment, and, amongst a few items of cotton goods which are protected, are cheese caps. These can be made with advantage here; and now it is proposed, I understand, by persons interested in obtaining a cheap article that the duty shall be removed. I hope, however, that, in all fairness, the duty will not be interfered with. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [5.9] I deny the statement that the last general election was fought on the issue of Free Trade and Protection, though I do not deny that some honourable members may have madeone or other policy the main plank of their platform, and have been returned to the House on the single issue. So far as my electorate is concerned the Tariff question was not raised to anything like the same prominence that other questions were; indeed, I cannot conceive of the Tariff being made the leading issue By members of the Labour party at a general election at any time. We are seeking to improve the position of the great bulk of the people, who are the workers; and we know that, under either Free Trade or Protection, they can be sweated, and have their conditions made most unpleasant. It would be foolish for honourable members on this side to imagine that there is any reality I must say that I object to the in that issue alone so far as the great bulk If a man. can of the people are concerned. I admit that the fiscal question forms a subsidiary part of our general policy ; but I deny that at the general election it had any more prominence than had the nationalization of monopolies, the institution of a Commonwealth Bank, or the imposition of a land tax. As a matter of fact, we had just previously I am a great believer dealt with the Tariff exhaustively, and generally, satisfaction had, I think, been given to those clamouring for protection for industries said to be languishing. The proposal put forward by the Labour party was an absolutely national Tariff, based on new Protection. We were to take steps, side by side with the imposition of Customs duties, to provide that the workers should receive their share of Protection, and that consumers should be protected against the rapacity of combinations which were raising prices to the general community. The question was discussed on the Address-in-Reply and I stated my position then. In Hansard, of 8th July, 1910, page 224, I amthus reportedThe question of Tariff anomalies is, of course, -a non-party one. 1 do not wish to commit myself finally at this moment, because I may not have all the facts before me that I should have, -and the Ministry will perhaps have facts to put before the House, but I certainly do not feel favorable at this stage to any further Tariff Protection without new Protection. A number -of us voted for high duties throughout the recent Tariff discussions on the distinct understanding, -and indeed on a pledge given by the late Prime Minister, that new Protection was to be associated with the Tariff, and that otherwise the Tariff would not be carried. I , for one, feel inclined to refuse to give Protection to a small section of the people, who in turn deny it to the great bulk of the workers in their factories, and am inclined to resist to the utmost any further Tariff Protection unless it is associated with new Protection. That was the position I placed before mv constituents at the general elections of 1906 and 1910. I am sorry that this Tariff revision should have been introduced, since it seeks to re-open the Tariff generally. It is quite justifiable to introduce a measure for the rectification of anomalies as shown in the definitions, and so forth, which harass, not only importers, but the Customs officers in the administration of the Department. A pure machinery Bill, designed to reduce friction, is, of course, acceptable; but, so far as the present proposals go beyond that, I regret they have been submitted. First of all, I contend that there has been no demand for a re-opening of the Tariff; and I represent an electorate in which there are as many factories and factory workers as can be found in any other electorate in the Commonwealth. But I have not received a single request from my electorate for an increase of duty. I therefore conclude that my constituents do not want it, because I cannot believe that the manufacturers there are dead to their own interests. Tariff matters stir up the liveliest feelings in those upon whom they operate, and the experience of all Parliaments has been that manufacturers and importers are not slow to place their interests before honourable members. therefore, that there is no demand in my -electorate, nor do I believe there is any general demand in the country, for a general re-opening of the Tariff and a general increase of protective duties. I honestly believe that the revision of the Tariff now before us, so far as duties are increased by it, has come about through the influence of a certain paper in Melbourne, which is, as it were, hanging over the House, and slogging, away at this joss of its own. that the Ministry are influenced by that paper? I hope not. Mr J. H . CATTS -There are members on both sides who take a little too much notice of the Melbourne Age. The,. Leader of the Opposition is certainly affected by it. It has only to publish an article pulling him to pieces, arid his knees begin to knock, and he runs in, wanting to know what can be done. So far as the daily press, which is absolutely antagonistic to the Labour party, influences the party, so far, I believe, the party is wrong. The best thing we can do is to "" paddle our own canoe,"" without any reference whatever to these journals. The Melbourne Age seems to have no cry but "" more Protection."" For every ill that affects the body politic, its remedy is the same. Of course, it has its followers in the community who think that if high duties are imposed everything is right with the world, and that if low duties are imposed everything is wrong with the world, and destruction stares us in the face. Peculiarly enough, this very paper which is clamouring for higher duties, and more of them, admits, in this morning's issue, that there is a shortage of labour, that the manufacturers cannot supply the market, and that we depend upon importations. Referring to textiles, item 106, wool and silk, and to the increased duties proposed on them, the Age saysThe importation of this class of goods from the United Kingdom alone amounted last year to 192,000. An additional duty,_of 5 per cent, may exercise some check on this vast influx of ready-made goods, but local manufacturers are doubtful on the point. Wages of tailors and dress makers have gone up considerably during the last year or two; in fact, it is impossible to get hands to supply all the demand. Importation is inevitable to supply the requirements of the market. If importation is inevitable for that purpose, the increase of duties on those goods simply means increasing the price to the general public. crease of duty on that line. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Age says there is an increase of 5 per cent., but I have not checked it with the schedule.",49,Johnson I Did Not Prochanter Th E Honourable Member Must

271,"I Take It, Mr Tudor","There has been no inThere are other duties in regard to the textile industry, but I know for a positive fact that the distributing houses in Sydney and Melbourne are two or three months behind in the receipt of their stocks from the manufacturers. Recently a Royal Commission inquired in New South Wales into the question of shortage of labour, and the manufacturers of Sydney stated before that body that it was impossible to secure labour to supply the local market. The honourable member-for Hume, who is an extreme Protectionist, and will vote for higher duties on any pretext whatever-h e feels like going down on his knees to worship the mere name of Protection-state d last night that Vicars Woollen Mills, at Marrickville, found it impossible to fill the demands made upon them by the business houses. With regard to the Parramatta Woollen Mills, Mr Sparks, the secretary of the Protectionist Association in New South Wales, informed me only recently that it was impossible for them to get labour to fill their orders for goods. He said it was of no use their taking any further orders; they could not go looking for business, because they had not the labour to manufacture the stuff. That is the general position to-day in Australia. I have said before, and say again, to our friends on the Labour side in politics, who have had their misgivings with regard to the introduction of desirable immigrants, that it is of no use for us to carry our feelings in the matter to an undue extent. We are compelled to acknowledge that there is in Australia at present a general shortage of labour. I admit that we find men out of work, but that is caused by our unscientific system of managing the labour market. We have no machinery to bring men who are out of work in touch with the work that is waiting for them to do. They have to lose time looking for it, but I honestly believe that there is anotherplace vacant for every able-bodied man and ordinary tradesman in Australia who is out of work. amongst coal-miners; they are not working more than half time. Mr J. H . CATTSI am not talking about a particular class of labour. In every country, no matter how prosperous, it is always possible to find a calling in that position; but in other directions there is a shortage of labour, and, if it suited the conwe can manufacture, but, of course, the venience of coal-miners to take railway construction or other work of that description,, it is certainly available for them. It may not be suitable for them to do, but there is work available for those who are able to adapt themselves to conditions a little different from those to which they have been accustomed. On the 12th October of this year, Hansard, page 1370, I discussed the question of the shortage of labour, and took up the position that I take up now. I have pointed out to several honourable members of the extreme Protectionist type that in the textile industry the distributing houses cannot get their orders filled. I put the question yesterday to the; honourable member for Kooyong, and to one after the other of what I call the extreme Protectionists, who will vote for higher dutieswithout any justification, and they had no answer to it. In fact, it cannot beans wered. An increase of duty on those lines where manufacturers are unable to supply the local market means nothing but. raising the price to the users throughout Australia. The Minister of Trade and Customs asks me to point some out. I can refer him for the facts to my brother, who is connected with the London Stores down the road. I understand that the Minister admits that the factories in Australia really cannot supply the local market. there has been.no alteration of duty in the line of which the honourable member speaks.. Mr J. H . CATTS I understood that there had been. My first point is that there has been no demand for the re-opening of the Tariff in the direction of .increased protection, and my second is that, if it is re-opened in the peculiar circumstances in which the manufacturers find' themselves in regard to the labour market, the only effect of increasing the duties must be to increase the price of commodities to the consumer. I disagree with the increasing of any protective duties at present, for the further reason that it is bad policy for the Labour party. At the last general 1 election we asked the country for authority to place upon the statute-book a thoroughly national Tariff on the basis of the new Protection. We said that if we could carry out the new Protection idea we wereprepared to give this country such a Tariff that the most extreme Protectionist would: never complain about it. Personally, I would have been prepared to go as far as absolute prohibition of those goods that labour v-vild have to be supplied to>",51,Johnson I Did Not Prochanter Th E Honourable Member Must

CATTS -We were in such ;a hurry to give effect to our policy that we did not want to wait' until the next general election. We wanted the Constitution altered to enable us to give effect to the new Protection during the lifetime of sthe present Parliament. The referenda were defeated, and we know the factors that operated to secure that defeat. the light of that knowledge, we are not justified in increasing the old Protection. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were -spent by manufacturers in defeating the new Protection, and preventing the workers and cons.umers from sharing in the benefits -of the Tariff. If we increase duties under present conditions, we shall encourage the manufacturers to continue their fight against the new Protection. If they get all that they need from us now, they will, at the 'next election, spend the money obtained from the higher duties in bringing about the defeat of our policy. We should show them that their interests are linked with those of the general community. they find that they cannot get higher duties -unless they consent to the protection of the wage-earners and consumers, they will not oppose the alteration of the Constitution necessary to provide for it. Therefore, the proposed alteration of duties is a mistake -from the point of view of policy, as well as being without justification for other reasons. I am prepared to go before my constituents at the next election in advocacy -of a Tariff on new Protection lines. I do not feel upset because the referenda were -defeated in my electorate. I should prefer to be out of politics to having to legis'late 011 lines which I considered 'wrong. If the referenda vote represented the mature opinion of the people of Australia, and is confirmed at the next election, my opponent will probably succeed in winning the seat which I hold. We The appointment of a tribunal to investigate the claims for higher duties has been proposed,' and without committing myself to details as to constitution and powers, I am in favour of the proposal. Parliament is not capable of dealWe took the earliest opportunity ing on lines of equity and justice with alterations of duties, not because of want of intellectual capacity, but because its constitution prevents it from judicially examining the facts, and determining how alterations will affect industries generally. selected the Of course, Parliament must in the end be responsible for every Tariff. It cannot hand over its legislative power to a tribunal, and must be responsible for the exercise of that power. I should like to see the manufacturers placed in a position similar to that of the workers. They demand that bodies of workers, claiming increases of pay, shall submit their claims to a Court, and justify them by evidence, which is subject to cross-examination. The eviIn dence for and against is sifted by a Judge of expert training and judicial mind, and judgment given accordingly. Similarly, manufacturers asking for increases of duty should submit claims for judicial investigation.

CATTS I am inclined to give more consideration to such cases, but there are the interests of the consumers and the general community to be regarded as well. I have known employees to ask the assistance of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney, in fighting employers who were sweating them, and a month or two afterwards have found these men lobbying for an increase of duty. What we need is to get at the truth, instead of legislating in the dark. Some of the "" pure merinoes"" of Protection here tell us that the schedule will create as many anomalies as it will cure.

CATTS -That cheap claptrap interjection, borrowed from the Melbourne Age, is no reply to my argument. What is necessary is to show that the present state of affairs is better than what I suggest, or that my suggestion can be improved on. Dealing with the schedule as a whole, I find that it embraces 130 items, exactly one-half of which consist of a mere rectification of Tariff anomalies. By an alteration of the wording they will enable the Department to more smoothly administer the existing Tariff. No one can find fault with alterations of that character, which have been found necessary to improve the existing Tariff machinery, and I am prepared to give them my hearty support. In the case of fiftysix items, we have a proposed increase of Protection. As to six other items, I find that they consist of proposals to place upon the free list goods that are now dutiable, and I am prepared to support them, since I find that the duties inquestion are purely revenue imposts. Every proposition to place on the free list goods that are now subjected to purely revenue duties will, on all occasions, receive my hearty support. In the three remaining"" cases the only alterations made are with a view of granting a preference to imports from the United Kingdom as against those coming from foreign countries, and I shall always be prepared to grant a substantial preference to goods imported from the United Kingdom. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer, and it relates to the speech delivered last night by the honourable member for Parramatta. We hear that honourable member from time to time deploring the introduction of class: feeling into politics. It amounts almost to a political crime, in his mind, to attempt anything of the kind. he deplores such appeals. Mr J. H .

Protection had been honestly placed before the people, instead of being involved with other questions, there, might have been are affirmative answer. The honourable member for Parramatta showed that the proposed increases in the Tariff will simplyput money into the pockets of a few manufacturers, leaving the working men without any share. What is the use of honourable members opposite trying to gull the public by talking about new Protection? There is sufficient legislation now, both Federal and State, to procure the working man a fair remuneration for his labour. There is the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and, in most of the States, Wages Boards; so that, as a fact, there is no need for new Protection. These increased duties are imposed ostensibly for the purpose of enabling employees to obtain higher wages, but r as in the past, they will fail to achieve that end. The honourable member for Cook has stated that he will not support any further duties unless they are associated with new Protection.

I -did not approve, however, of that part of the honourable member's remarks wherein he said that if it could be shown that the 'workmen would get a fair share of the -duties under the new Protection policy, he would be in favour of absolute prohibition. -Such a position is ridiculous, because prothe details later.

For a short time a certain section of the workers might reap some advantage, ""but ultimately they would be brought face to face with ruin. Under prohibition, large factories might be built, .and vast quantities of goods turned out, but this could only mean that, with our small population, production would in a very short time overtake consumption. We should then be faced with two alternatives -eithe r to export the surplus and compete with the goods manufactured under quite other conditions in other parts of the world, or close our factories. I have heard people, who do not think deeply, say that it would be a good thing to have large factories here, such as they have in England, where, for instance, a mile of tweed is turned out in a day. -rate, how many weeks or months would it require for the production of tweed to overcome the consumption? As to exporting and competing against foreign labour, we should find that absolutely impossible with our current rates of wages. I am not a rabid Free Trader, and I know that we must have some revenue from our Customs. It is an absolute mistake, however, to bolster up and spoon-feed industries by means of a highly Protective Tariff. I do not wish to go into details, but I must say that I do not think there is any necessity for an increase in the duty -on pianos. There are two firms manufacturing these instruments in Australia, the principal one of which, I take it, is that of nor a manufacturer. Instead of considerBeale and Company, who undertook to -spend £100,000 in establishing a factory under a duty of 25 per cent. They have -spent, I think, £70,000, and, turning out an enormous number of pianos, are doing very well at the present time. Their pianos, I understand, are manufactured at a cost of £ 1 6 or £ 1 7 , and are sold at prices ranging from forty to sixty guineas. Under these circumstances, there does not -seem any justification or excuse for an increased duty. It is not only the rich who use pianos; and there is no doubt that in the home of many a small farmer and selector a musical instrument of this kind is a great means of entertainment and comfort. Why should not the daughter of the poor man be able to learn to play the piano in the same way as the daughter of his luckier neighbour? The increase in the duty is equivalent to about 5 per cent, in each class of piano; but I shall deal with building purposes is dutiable at altogether too high a rate; and I see no reason at all for an import duty on New Zealand timber. Any one who has done any building lately, especially a long way from railway communication, must realize that timber is a very serious item. Pine boards are at the outrageous price of something like 25s. per 100 superficial feet-a'pric e never dreamed of a few years ago. This is a serious handicap to those who are settling on the land. bark. huts are all right, but people desire a few boards here and there; and at present a decent weatherboard cottage means a considerable expenditure. T should like some At that information from the Minister as to why New Zealand white pine, undressed, for butter boxes, is free, subject to departmental by-laws, while timber, undressed, cut to size for making boxes, is subject to a duty of 4s. per 100 super, feet. For the life of me I cannot understand what this means. Experts say that this duty of 4s. means nothing; but, if that be so, why is it provided in the Tariff? Perhaps it is one of the anomalies that we hear of. If it is, I am not going to support it. The consumer in this country deserves consideration. We are doing everything for the worker, but we forget the interests of the general consumer, who may be neither a working man, nor an employer, ing him, we are increasing the cost of living day by day. What is to be the end of it? We should have been given some time to consider these proposals, and, if we had had a commission or board of some sort to thresh the matter out and supply us with expert evidence on it, we should have been-much better able to come to an accurate decision. I shall deal with the items as they are called on separately, but my main reason for rising now was to prevent any misapprehension as to the attitude of myself and other Free Traders on this side.

[6.19] I regret that a measure involving such large and important interests should have been brought in at this stage of the session. When, in previous Parliaments, we have been invited to consider Tariff proposals, it has been under conditions that permitted fair discussion, and gave us a reasonable opportunity of considering their bearingsI t is not so in this case. We are led to suppose that we are almost at the end of the session, a large amount of other business is awaiting our attention, and it is not fair to expect us to wedge in the consideration of a Tariff schedule. We are told that it means the rectifying of anomalies, but the whole Tariff issue is involved by it . If we are to believe the reRepresentations were made to me, which I presentations made inside and outside this Chamber, it appears that in the rectification of one anomaly from the Ministerial stand-point, two or three others are being created, necessitating a succession of similar Tariff amendments in the future. I am not sure that the whole of this schedule is merely in the direction of rectifying anomalies, unless the items are based on the definition of "" anomaly "" given by no less an authority than the Secretary of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, as "" Any item upon which the Tariff does not give effective Protection."" It seems to me that, under the guise of rectifying anomalies, we are being asked to accede to requests that have been pressed time and again upon the attention of previous Parliaments. I remember the severe struggles that took place over the timber duties, the strawboard duties, the piano duties, and other proposals. Those interested now come along once more with their claims, and the Government ask us to concede them under the guise of rectifying anomalies. In reform, we have a number of intricate interests to consider. generally divided into those of the manufacturer, those of the work-people, and those of the consumer. liament, in order to do justice, must not be satisfied merely to consider the interests of the manufacturer or of his employees. It must take into account the wider interests of the general consumer, who is vitally concerned in these taxation levies. It is impossible for any Parliament to have that intimate .knowledge of all the variousramifications of industry which is necessary to enable it to arrive at just and f a i r the short time at its disposal to engage in the consideration of all these questions,, which are presented to it for the first time in a B ill , and to arm itself with the information necessary to enable it to do justice to all the interests concerned, is to place us in an unfair position. We cannot deal with them properly in a piecemeal and incomplete fashion. ber is in favour of a board to investigate Tariff matters ? member the experience I had when the first Tariff was submitted to this Parliament. took honestly as being correct statements of the position, but, as I found afterwards, they were so coloured and biased, and so ignored the other issues which had to be considered, that I was often placed in a very unjust position. I had not available the means of obtaining correct information, and as the outcome of that experience I strongly urged that, before any further Tariff proposals were submitted to this Chamber, they should be thoroughly investigated by a tribunal, which could do the work as this House cannot do it. Before the last Tariff was tabled we appointed a commission, which carried out a very exhaustive investigation. Although we did not accept all its recommendations, we had before us the evidence on which they were founded, and we were in a better position to deal' with 'the items, and to judge fairly between the conflicting interests, than we otherwise should have been. Because an industry comes along and asks for a duty in the name of Australian industry, it must not be concluded that its all these matters of Tariff claim is necessarily well founded. The effect of giving that particular industry theThey may be Protection for which it asks may be tohandicap other industries which are as. much Australian as it. is. Take, for in A Parstance, the item of strawboard.

313,Mr Thomas Brown,"Yes. Thereon the part of those who have been pestering this House all along to place flannelette on the prohibited list to really secure its prohibition under the guise of rectifying an anomaly. I regret that in this, as in some other cases, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who ought to represent the great Labour movement of Australia, is allowing the Tariff to be used to place unnecessary and undesirable burdens upon that section of the community which the Labour party represents. I find that the piano manufacturers are again coming along, and seeking further concessions under the guise of remedying an anomaly. There is quite a number of these hoaryheaded old anomalies about which Parliament has been pestered from its inception, and my surprise is, not that we should be asked under the guise of rectifying anomalies to place increased duties on flannelette, pianos, and other items, but that we have not been asked to place a further duty of £12 each on stripper harvesters. I am not going to vote to increase taxation upon the masses. The taxation which they contribute already represents more than their from the very first, to the appointment of fair proportion, and I am not going to add to it. I am prepared to rectify anomalies as such, but a demand to increase a duty under the guise of rectifying an anomaly does not appeal to me. Whilst this Parliament has power only to confer Tariff advantages on the manufacturers, and no power to enable their employees to participate in those advantages, I am not prepared to consider any proposal to give further favours to that section of the community. I do not pin my faith to it, but I am prepared at least to give a trial to the proposal to give a fair measure of advantages to those who work in factories, and, at the same time, fair protection to the ferred on a' protected industry can be ronsumers who have to use their products, so that we shall not have repeated in Australia the experience of the United States of America. In America, where Protection has been applied to a greater extent than it has been in any other civilized counonly to say, in conclusion, that on every try, it is found that the most highly protected industries sweat their workers to a greater extent than do any others, and that they sell their goods to the foreigner at a much cheaper rate than that at which they offer them in the Home market. I shall not be a party to the creation of such conditions in Australia. I battled with the Labour party to secure such an extension of the powers of this Parliament as would Mr Thomas Brown. enable it to protect the workers in the factories, as well as the employers, and to safeguard the interests of the consumers, and from my point of view the Ministry are now cutting from under their feet the very ground that would have enabled them to secure that great reform. These protected interests will, in this way, secure piecemeal all the protection that the most logical Protectionist would give them, whilst their poor sweated factory hands will share none of the advantages of that protection, and are debarred from such advantages by the active and passive opposition of their specially favoured employers. The Government are making a serious mistake in giving anything in the nature of substantial protection to any industry before this Parliament is able to protect the interests of the workers in that industry, and the consumers of its products. WhilstI shall be prepared to consider every anomaly on its merits, and to endeavour to rectify it, I am not prepared to remedy a so-called anomaly by granting more protection to an industry such as that of strawboard making, which has been opposed a Wages Board to regulate the conditions of labour. The employers in that, industry petitioned the Legislative Council of Victoria not to allow its employees an opportunity to secure a Wages Board to fix fair and reasonable conditions of labour, and only last year, a Victorian senator stated that it neither paid fair wages nor gave fair conditions to its employees, notwithstanding that it had received a considerable measure of protection. We are now asked, under the guise of remedying an anomaly, to increase the protection granted to that industry. The most serious anomaly of all is that this Parliament cannot devise machinery whereby any of the benefits conshared by the workers employed in it, and to protect the consumers of its products from burdensome charges. I do not desire to debate this question at length. I simply wish to make my position clear, and I have proposal of a Protectionist character, I shall be found voting with the ""noes"" if a division is called for.

In making that statement, however, I do not refer to those who were closely associated with an earlier Deakin Administration.

Many of them have enumerated the enormous profits that manufacturers making. the particular friend of the manufacturers? to show that whilst I am not posing as their particular friend, the manufacturers will look upon the Opposition as their friends, and will continue to do so, notwithstanding what has been said by them during this debate. While they may differ on the fiscal question, they are agreed in preventing the employees from getting fair wages and conditions. The party that the Age has now taken under its wing, is not composed of the Protectionists we might expect to see. Those honourable members, with all the Free Traders on their side, are very keen on the appointment of a Tariff board or permanent Tariff commission. Of course, we have heard that sort of proposal before ; but this is the first occasion on which I ever knew the Age to be converted by ]>oliticians, as it has been by the Opposition, to their way of thinking. While a board to consider the Tariff in detail, and report to this House, is now the objective of the Age, it was not always so. ported the appointment of such a board. 1910, just prior to the last general election, which I am sure all members of the Fusion party remember with regret, the Age leading article contained the followingThey are Conservative fusionists sinking The Age charges the Labour Tariff amendment by an ingenious device of relegating Tariff anomalies to a tribunal not yet in existence, and of whose fiscal composition no safeguards are to be taken.

349,"Mr Frank Foste R (New England) Afraid To Place A Duty On Diamonds, Seeing","have passed the stage when anything Australian can be laughed at for long, because we are taking our place as manufacturers and producers in the markets of the world. There is, however, a tendency to laugh at Australian productions, and I find that travelling diamond experts for foreign firms take it upon themselves to decry Australian diamonds at every opportunity. here some expert opinion which,will show that our diamonds have gone through the proper tests, and have come out equal to the best in the world. It is as follows:The introduction into this country of a diamond cutting and polishing works would do more than anything else to establish a regular market for our diamonds. Upon reliable authority we are told that Australian diamonds, although small, are of good quality. Diamonds won from the alluvial deposits here do not differ to any great extent, as regards colour, from the diamonds found in other parts of the world. Whites and straws are the prevailing shades, and occasionally pale blue, light green, pink, red, cinnamon brown, and black (boarts) are met with. In order, to test the quality of the Australian diamonds, and to establish, if possible, a market for our gems, a parcel of diamonds was forwarded to London and exhibited in the New South Wales Court at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. These diamonds were obtained from ""The Streak of Luck"" and ""Crown Jewels"" mine at Copeton. The diamonds were minutely examined by Messrs. Ford and Wright, the London diamond cutters. M i . Atkinson (the manager) in furnishing his report to the Mines Department of New South Wales, says :"" No. 2 parcel, one cut and polished, the other left in its rough state to show the difference; the one cut and polished proves a brilliant of the finest water. "" No. 3 parcel, containing one diamond. When cut and polished is about as fine a brilliant as it is possible to get, be it from Glenconda, Borneo, Brazil, or Jagersfontein."" Further on in his report Mr Atkinson states : "" If it were possible to pick out an African and an Australian diamond, exactly the same size, weight, and appearance, and give it to one man to cut and polish the African stone would be finished in six days, while the Australian stone would take eight, with this vastly important difference, the Australian stone would be of greater brilliancy."" Mr Atkinson says :"" In proportion to their production, Australia finds the most white diamonds. There is always a good demand for white stones, as being small they are the most suitable to set around other coloured gems."" Mr Thos. Davis, F.G.S., and Mr E. Etheridge, in furnishing the report to the Mines Department upon the submitted parcel, say :"" i.' The diamonds of New South Wales, in their physical character, are more nearly allied to those of Brazil."" "" 2 . They have been largely sold in London as such."" Mr Frank Foster. On page 11 of this report we firia these words :"" In fact it appears from information gathered from a most reliable source, that a large proportion of New South Wales diamonds reach their way to the London market as Brazilian stones."" that report? which is from the Inverell Argus, is dated 7th April, 1911, but I cannot'tell the date of the official report. many years ago. better, because the diamond matrix has since been found there. pipe. pipe or a dyke. Up to a certain period we had no evidence whatever of the existence of the matrix. when in the Mines Department, I granted a good slice of the prospecting vote for that field, but nothing came of it. time only alluvial diamonds had . been found. When their value became known, a large number of companies were formed, and prospectors set to work to find the matrix. This, as I say. has been found, and samples have been sent abroad. The following statement shows the result:The"" Oakey Creek"" mine joins "" Kirk's H ill "" on the west. Here the diamond matrix has been located in a dolerite dyke or pipe. Specimens of the rock, containing an inclosed diamond, have been exhibited before the leading scientists of the world, and the find has been pronounced thoroughly authentic. I saw the reports of four or five scientists on these diamonds in their matrix, and they all spoke of the possibility of a Kimberlev in Australia. obtained there now? but, as the experience of the Kimberlev field in South Africa shows, a large amount of capital is required to develop a mine, and a great deal of heavy work has oftento be undertaken without any return. large American company was started onthat field. to work the alluvial diamonds.

This discovery absolutely alters the position, and that is why I appeal to the Minister to impose a duty on -diamonds. honourable member for Hume was the difficulty of collecting the duty, the departmental officers thinking that diamonds could be easily hidden. now collected on jewellery and other small articles which, are not half so valuable to Australia, and that could be smuggled in by the tubful. whose report the honourable member quoted ? able member for Werriwa informs me that he is an expert in the New South Wales Mines Department. A man who has spent years in prospecting and finding a dolerite or diamond dyke, has approached various capitalists with a view to its development, but the invariable reply is that they do not care to do anything while diamonds are on the free list, but would do something if there were a duty on diamonds. I merely wish to make a statement of the position, and to urge Australians to have more faith in the diamonds produced here. It would be a splendid thing if we could open up a big diamond field, and develop it with white labour. Another matter to which I ask the Minister to give attention is the prevention of the importation of lucerne seed. At the present time French seed is being sold as local seed, to the serious injury of growers of lucerne, who ask for a reasonable duty on lucerne seed. Those who have battled on the land know how serious a matter it is to be supplied with bad seed. The honourable member for Parramatta made some wild statements concerning the Tariff, and a good deal has been said against Free Traders on this side who are prepared to vote for duties if they can get the new Protection. A Free Trader who does that is on sound economic ground, and deserves all honour. But what is to be thought of those who, as Free Traders, fought the last Tariff, and are now sinking their Free Trade views in the endeavour to oust the Labour party from office? The honourable member for Parramatta said last night that new Protection would not be effective able member told me, when I asked if he not; but if the consumers feel that the shoe was in favour of nationalizing distribution for the protection of the consumer, that that could not be done without the nationalization of production, too. I challenge him to tell the people of Parramatta that the municipality could not carry on the work The objection raised by the of distribution unless it owned the tea plantations producing the tea which it would have to sell. Tariffs do not protect the consumers, and it is time to tell the However, duties are people plainly that under either Free Trade or Protection they will be robbed by the middleman. As a Protectionist, I shall vote for duties where they will establish or maintain an Australian industry, but, being honest, I have to admit that the middleman robs the consumer under them. Although a hat can be produced at the Denton mills for 2s. 6d., the working man is charged 7s. 6d. or 8s. 6d. for it. I am disgusted with those who talk about scientific Protection, and pretend that the imposition of duties will make goods cheaper. That is not what happens in practice, as can be discovered by an examination of the prices prevailing in America, Germany, and Australia, while, if the conditions of Free Trade England are examined, it will be seen that living is as dear there as in protected countries. When I asked the honourable member for Parramatta to assist me in fighting for the abolition of the. middleman, he said that that is impossible, because one could not sell tea without owning a great part of China. be implied from the honourable member's remarks. He said that the nationalization of distribution is impossible without the nationalization of production, which .is piffle.

I do not care if I form a party within my party in regard to distribution. If honourable members opposite oppose the next referenda, the people's answer will be the emptying of their benches and^ the filling of our benches. The honourable member for Parramatta says that this Government has not been faithful to its trust, but he knows that they could not do more, because of the success of his party in causing have taken.

He thinks, however, that, because we desire to pass the Tariff, we shall not answer his statements, and that they will be published duty, if effective, is not likely to produce broadcast in Hansard, and the newspapers, without contradiction. I say that the Government have gone as far as they could go under the Constitution. On the Tariff question we, on this side, are all free lances, and are not to be dragooned into voting for either Protection or Free Trade. The speech of the honourable member for Calare proved that. people of Australia to take up the cause of national distribution for the protection of the consumer. member "" stone-walled "" his own motion. initiate movements are always ridiculed and obstructed, but the more I am hindered the more I shall fight. I hope that honourable members will pardon me for having left the old economic paths. Governments often stand by Tariffs which are not purely protective, because they need revenue, and the people are thus called upon to pay taxation which they should not pay. I should be ashamed of Protectionists who would vote for a revenue Tariff. It is said that we shall need revenue if we nationalize distribution, but is. in the £ i necessary that we should have a thorough profit on goods transferred in the course of investigation and control of matters affecttrade would mean £50,000 on every £1,000,000 £300,000,000 £15,000,000. This could be obtained by raising the price of an article from is. 6d. to 2s. 7^d. That would be a more honest, straightforward, and equitable way of raising revenue than a revenue Tariff; but until we can legislate effectively, I am prepared to uphold the present Tariff. of the difference of opinion that prevails amongst honourable members, I wish to make clear my position in regard to this schedule, and to indicate that I intend to give a substantial support to the proposals of the Government. I rather regret that tlie schedule should have been introduced at the present stage of the session, because I should have preferred it to stand over until we had prepared the country for the reception of a revised Tariff. I recognise, however, that the Government have a special knowledge which I do not possess, and that they are probably satisfied that existing conditions warrant the action they of the proposed duties occasions me no concern, nor should it concern any truly logical Protectionist, since a protective much revenue. The less revenue we obtain from our protective system the better shall I be pleased. I realize that many difficulties have to be overcome, and, but for their existence, I should welcome a wholesale revision of the Tariff. Until those obstacles have been removed, we can go no further in this direction, but our national interests demand that we shall I challenge the stimulate in every possible way the development of Australia. I care not how high the Tariff is as long as we have in operation a proper system of regulation and control. Abuses are not confined to a Protectionist system. I am sure that my Free Tra'de friends opposite will admit that Free Trade of itself does not necessarily mean cheap goods. It has been demonstrated over and over again that it does not, and we must all admit that both Protection and Free Trade are open to great abuse. Unlike my honourable friend, who has just resumed his seat, I do not come forward with .any panacea, -but I feel satisfied that if we are to proceed along right lines, we must institute some system of inspection and control. The modern development of society, to my mind, undoubtedly makes it ing the Tariff.

Much of these fruits come from tropical countries, where the conditions of employment are not the same as in Australia; whereas the sauces, pickles, and so forth were likely to come from European countries; and this item is proposed in order to level up the duties.

However, I cannot honestly see how this fruit can be taken to England and preserved, because the bulk is preserved when fresh, and we do not get much of this line from the Old Country. does the old duty represent on the value of the goods? What is proposed now is an increase of 60 per cent. and over quarter-pints imported was £ 5 , 8 1 4 , and the duty collected .£218, while the value of the pints and over halfpints was £ 1 5 7 , 0 0 0, and the duty collected _£i 1,000. That, I take it, represents about 7 per cent. fied, because that means only 12 or 13 per cent. Minister has pointed out that the proposed additional duties are for the benefit of the preserved frui t industry in Queensland, which, he says, is being injured by importations from other countries, where the rates of wages are much lower. I should like to point,out that in 1906 the Queensland factories produced 2,366,589 lbs.., the whole of which is scheduled in the returns as jam, with no preserved fruit . In 1910 the factories turned out 4,626,846 lbs. of jam and preserved fruit, of which the latter represented 3,732,351 lbs. Under the old Tariff, in the course of four years, the production of preserved fruits has increased from nothing to the figure I have just stated; and, that being so, some little explanation is required in order to show the. necessity for the increased duty. I do not know from what source the honourable member for Ulawarra received his figures. cial statistics. 1906 showing a total of over 2,000,000 lbs. do not include much in the way of preserved pineapples. I presume that if the all scheduled as jam. 1910 there was a very decided migration of the jam manufacturing industry throughout Australia. Prior to 1906 there were extensive importations of southern fruits into Queensland for jam-making. The duty then imposed led the jam manufacturers to establish themselves in closer proximity to the sources of production. That gave an immediate fillip to the production of Queensland fruits for preserving, and the pineapple-canning industry practically dates from that time. up to 3,000,000 lbs. under the old duty. What necessity is there for the new ? the necessity for assisting them further. Since then they have had to pay a much I am quite satisheavier wages scale, and a higher cost of material, such as tins, labels, sugar, and other accessories. I understand that to-day the pineapple canners are in a worse position than they were when the 1906 Tariff was imposed. When, in 1906, the duty or» jams was raised, and the jam manufacturers were protected, those who were preserving frui t were left unprotected. In competition with Singapore, where sugar costs a third less than it does in Queensland, labour 80 per cent. less, f r u it fro m 50 to 60 per cent, less, wharfage and harbour dues less, and tins and printed labels much less, our own industries are languishing. There is an abundant supply of good frui t for this purpose in Queensland, but the competition of the Singapore pineapples bids fair to drive, the Queensland product completely out of the southern markets.

The Government intend to alter item 59 of the old Tariff by making the duty on bananas is. 6d. per central instead of is. Flannelette is to be withdrawn from this schedule, because, as I stated a fortnight ago, the alteration was proposed, not for revenue or protective purposes, but in the interests of human life, and we find that, under the Customs Act, the Minister may prohibit its importation The Committee as being harmful to the community.

I suppose this item is intended to protect the ostrich industry; and I should like to know whether there is any considerable number of ostriches reared in Australia, and whether protection is really needed? Feathers are the raw material of several large industries in which great numbers of girls and women are employed.

The item under discussion is intended to protect the very industry as to which the honourable member is concerned. The dressed feathers, which have to pay the higher rate, include feathers made up into trimmings, and also natural birds and wings, which are subject to a higher rate, with the object of discouraging their importation. surprised that there are no ostriches in Victoria, and seems to be under the impression, therefore, that there can be none in Australia. I understand, however, that ostrich-rearing is largely carried on in South Australia, and also in New South Wales.

Australian birds which leave Australia are prohibited from being returned ; though, of course, there are certain birds in regard to which no prohibition is necessary. If it is desired that no natural birds and wings shall enter Australia either from abroad or after having once left this country, I can say that I am personally in favour of such a step; and that can be done by proclamation independently of this item.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE who carry on the ostrich farms in New South Wales have some difficulty in selling their feathers, and have to dispose of them out of the country, because people seem to think that the articles from abroad are better than those grown locally. South Africa prevents the exportation of ostriches to Australia, I think we might well prevent South Africans interfering with our feather industry. A great number of exceedingly beautiful feathers are produced here; and the industry is one that ought to be assisted as far as possible. South WalesI could not procure a feather. Sir WILLIAM LYNE from the ostrich-farmers themselves that they have great difficulty in selling their feathers, beautiful as they are; and I desire to call the attention of the Minister to the matter. What the honourable member for Hume has said in regard to the ostrich farms in New South Wales is very largely correct. desire to point out, however, that, for some extraordinary reason, a duty of 15 per cent, is placed on feathers, which may be described as a luxury, whereas a bonnet, which may be regarded as a necessity, is charged 30 or 35 per cent. There is no doubt that ostrich feathers are produced in Australia; and I can assure the honourable member for Balaclava that there is some difficulty in getting rid of the product,, mainly, I fancy, because the public do not know where to obtain them. The main trouble in connection with small industries is to find a means of distribution. will not deal with the ostrich farmers. can be so, though it may be that the business houses require a continuity of supply on certain terms. However, it is a deserving industry, and what the honourable member for Hume has said with regard to South Africa's treatment of us in this connection is worthy of the serious consideration of the Minister and the Committee. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Hume, and regret that it is not possible now to put a higher duty on undressed feathers. I can also endorse his statements regarding South Africa. That country has already placed a prohibitive duty on the exportation of birds and eggs, and it is really impossible for us to get The persons the new strain of blood we require to develop our Australian industry. There has been an ostrich farm on the Murray for the last forty years; they have upwards of 100 ostriches there, and the production is equal to the best of South Africa. The climate When is specially suitable. The African ostrich industry is one of the most important there, yielding thousands of pounds of revenue. Australia is quite capable'of developing an equally important industry, and if the Minister cannot do anything on the present occasion to help it, I hope he will consider the matter in any future adjustment of the Tariff. I have heard ister and Treasurer) [10.48] -The question raised by the honourable member for Hume touches only incidentally the point raised by the other speakers regarding the possibility of developing the ostrich industry in Australia. Reference has been made to South Africa.

It would be just as well for honourable members to recollect that it is the second industry in South Africa, and while we are blessed with much good land, I cannot say, as far as I saw that country, that they are in the same position. They certainly safeguard their ostrich industry to a greater extent than any other country protects any of its industries. their wool industry by means of sheep obtained from Australia. while discussing the matter with the Prime Minister and other Ministers. I said Australia granted freely of its best sheep, cattle, and everything else, to. enable them to make the best of their country. thought I spoke for the people of Australia when I said they gave them their best gladly, and as their birds are supposed to be the best in the world, and are properly looked after, and are undoubtedly bred for the production of the very best feathers, I thought they might very well reciprocate with us as far as possible by letting us have birds of the same quality to place on some of our lands, and thus promote a healthy rivalry and competition. sible for the Prime Minister to make further representations on the authority of the Parliament ? rocity will undoubtedly come up sooner or later, and communications will be made on that subject. Undoubtedly, Australia is a country well fitted for the cultivation of ostrich feathers. I may as well say, .while on my feet, that a civilized people ought soon to put an end to the importation of natural birds and wings. This is not so much a question of duty as a question of fashion. lished in South Australia several ostrich farms, and are now absolutely independent of South Africa. We do not require another bird or another egg from there, and if any other part of Australia, wants an improvement in the breed of its ostriches it can get all it requires from South Australia. is simply one Of continuous demand.

Better blood is continually required, and that is why we want ostriches from South Africa. are developing change with them. They want new blood just as much as we do.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE If the honourable member had .been in London this year he would not have said so, so far as that part of the world is concerned. I quite concur in what the Minister has said.

557,Dr. Maloney,"No . If any one had-the item with reference to flannelette, the Minister proposes to issue a departmental 'by-law prohibiting the importation of the material. I should like to know definitely whether that is meant, because it appears to me that such would be rather a peculiar way of dealing with the matter, especially if there is a majority of the Committee who are in favour of permitting the importation of flannelette. If the Minister, before any such by-law is promulgated, would bring the subject before Parliament, so that it may be discussed, I shall be perfectly satisfied. There has been a good deal of ill-considered talk as to the danger -of flannelette. I should offer strenuous -objection to the withdrawal of the proposal if it simply meant the issue of a departmental by-law involving prohibition while Parliament is not sitting. For instance, a by-law issued at Christmas would run for six months before Parliament had -.an opportunity of discussing the matter. -and Customs) [12.25 a.m.] -There appears to be an outcry against the use of this 'particular material, not only in Australia, -but ""-considered to be a dangerous mate-rial, especially when used for the clothing of infants. On obtaining further informa-tion, however, and not being sure of the itests which had been resorted to, I have -consented to withdraw the item. Before :.any proclamation is issued prohibiting the importation of flannelette, I shall take -good care that Parliament has an opportunity of considering the subject, so that I may be informed as to what honourable 'members generally think about the issue -of such a proclamation. -Something more is required than a mere notice of Ministerial intention. We require an inquiry of an expert character before the Minister takes any action. If flannelette were dangerous to infant life -it certainly ought not to be used, and -should, indeed, be prohibited. But as far as I can ascertain, and I have made personal tests during the last few days, flannelette seems to be just about as inflammable as ordinary cotton. dence of its being particularly inflammable. -flammable as muslin. not in the habit of allowing babies to go sround clothed in muslin. I suggest that the Minister should take action only after a most careful examination of the subject. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [12.28 a.m.]. I wish to inform the Minister that, owing to' complaints regarding the use of flannelette in Great Britain, a Commission was appointed, which reported on 23rd August last year. I give the honourable gentleman the reference so that my honourable friend may look into the Commission's report, which, no doubt, is available to him. a.m.] A great deal that is unfair has been said about flannelette. I was waited upon by a shipping clerk representing one of the large warehousemen, and after some conversation with him he undertook to supply me with twenty or thirty samples. I said that I would place them in the Opposition room and give honourable members an opportunity of trying whether the material was inflammable or not. He sent up a parcel of extensive samples, containing something like twenty pieces of flannelette. Lighted matches were applied to every sample. In only one case would the nap also in Great Britain. It is run, and then only to the extent of one inch. I was assured by this gentleman that these were samples of the whole of the kinds of flannelette that his firm had. in stock, and that they were sold at 6d. and 6£d. per yard. I am aware that other members of the Opposition have purchased for themselves samples of flannelettes at a much cheaper price, because it was alleged that the poorer qualities would burn much more freely. They inform me, however, that these cheaper qualities would not burn at all. Not one of these flannelettes was chemically prepared, and I am informed on, I think, very good authority, that the chemical preparations which are used to neutralize the inflammability are injurious to the skin. I should like to have demonstrated the inflammability of this material as it is made to-day. I do not like to see cheap material of this kind, which poor people use very largely, libelled. I am told that although the flannelettes which used to be made years ago had the drawback of being inflammable on the nap, which I saw -no eviwas very long, they are made now with short nap, and are not inflammable. I have seen to-day the report of a Select Committee which was appointed by the House of Commons to investigate the question of the danger of flannelette as an article of clothing.

In regard to its inflammability, it is all very well to take pieces of dress goods out of a ware.house and test them with a match. What ought to be done is to take the goods, use .them, and wash them. It is the dressing which prevents the material from burning.

The use of flannelette is not confined to children. It is People use the article, not got up so attractively, and the colours are so cunningly blended, that at very large number of women wear it, believing that it is wool, or contains a large percentage of wool. There is the danger to health as well as the danger from burning to be considered. I heard what the honourable member for Parkes said about the tests which he applied. The materials he had would be admitted upon the proposal of the Minister, because they would be non-inflammable. After being thoroughly washed however, .they would become very inflammable indeed. But even if the Minister were to maintain his first proposal-that is,, to admit non-inflammable flannelette, When the dressing goes out, the but to place such an impost on inflammable flannelettes as to virtually prohibit their use he would render a distinct service to the community. If the It would save them from a swindle and a fraud, and would protect a large number of persons from an ever present danger. -a.m.] I can endorse most of the remarks made by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. Flannelette, when very dry, burns like tinder, but new flannelette will not burn as readily as will old flannelette, if both be equally dry. Had the Minister insisted upon the retention of this provision, he would have found it necessary to forbid the introduction of made-up flannelette garments, and I hope that, upon consideration, he will recognise that he could forbid its I could take honourable introduction altogether as ""flannelette.""

The honourable member for Melbourne is one of the most consistent advocates of Australian industries that we have in this House, and I am sure that he would not desire to injure any local manufacturer, but I cannot accept his amendment until I have had an opportunity of ascertaining how far-reaching it would be in its effect, not only upon industry, but mitted to the Parliament show that thereupon the revenue.

The item particularly relates to mantles and women's dress goods, which are largely made in Australia, from such materials as are enumerated in the amendment. At present, those materials are subject to a duty of 30 per cent., which is also imposed on woollen piece goods. It cannot be said, however, that cashmeres and delaines enter into seri(United Kingdom), 10 per cent.,"" with a view ous competition with such goods. If I thought that they would, as the result of the adoption 'of this amendment, I should not feel inclined to support it. These are special materials used in the manufacture of ornamental goods which cannot come into competition with woollen piece goods. The Minister has not proposed any increased duty upon ready-made clothing. On the other hand, the manufacturers complain that they have to pay a duty of 30 per cent, on their raw materials, so that they have a protection of only 10 per cent, against the ready-made article. Further, under this schedule, it is proposed to increase the rate of duty upon braids which are largely used in ornamenting the readymade goods that are placed on the market by local manufacturers. These braids cannot be tested, I am informed, by their width, of one inch, because many braids used in the making of ladies' garmentsexceed that width, and no increased dutyis demanded in respect of them. The Minister says he sympathizes with this proposal, and he should show his sympathy byvoting for it. He says, however, that hemust consult the Treasurer as to what would be the effect of the proposed reduction of duty on the revenue. Figures subhas been an expansion of revenue, and 1 there is no cause for anxiety in that regard. We have had an unexpected increase of revenue from the Customs, and! no spectre of a loss of revenue should induce the Committee to refuse to reduce duties on raw materials that are the basicfabric of Australianproductions. . [12.57 a.m.] I am glad to find myself at least on one occasion able to support the honorable member for Melbourne on a-. Tariff question.

662,Mr Fisher,"I did not come down atitem, and that he is compromising with the revenue. Since this matter has been placed on a Protectionist basis I would point out that the honourable member for Melbourne is as good a Protectionist as is the Prime Minister. The former was agitating for Protection long before the latter thought of it ; in fact, he has been a real tiger for Protection, and to give him a little has been only to whet his appetite, and make him roar for more. He is a lifelong Protectionist who will be trusted by the Protectionists of Australia, and when he moves not to reduce the general duty on woollen goods, but to place certain items under a lower duty, we are thoroughly justified if if importunity. is necessary to have some Protectionist justification, in accepting his proposal. The Prime Minister stated that nearly every Item in the Tariff could be called a revenue item. I think that that is perfectly true. I believe that the Tariff, as it stands, was framed as much for the purpose of producing revenue as for the purpose of giving Protection, probably more so. I have my -doubt about the present proposals. I believe it will be found that their, incidence will be to bring in more revenue. able member is wrong. Mr J. H . CATTS -That is my -opinion.

One of my aims, as far as revenue is concerned, is to wipe out taxation on the masses, and to tax those who are best able to bear the burden. I am prepared to wipe out this item and others. I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne will stick to his proposal. 1 would rather see him and others defeated on it than give way. take a vote. Mr J. H . CATTS I would prefer the honourable member to stick to his amendment, and to let each honourable member take the responsibility for the vote he gives. I understand that the proposal before the Committee has emanated from the honourable member for Melbourne, and not from the Government. The latter have submitted certain proposals, but the former wants to reduce the duty on an item which has been dutiable for some years. I shall strongly oppose any reduction of the duties on woollen goods, unless we have the best expert and most reliable information possible that they cannot be manufactured in Australia. I am not at all satisfied that these articles cannot be made here. I am not prepared to accept the ipse dixit of the honourable member for Melbourne on that point. I was surprised to hear the Prime Minister say that he would concede anything. It reminded me very much of the story of a judge and a widow who received a concession because of her I hope that that will not be the position to-night. What the honourable member for Cook has said about these being revenue duties may be accepted. I hardly expect that we can have any system of Protection which will not bring in a certain amount of revenue; but we can have a system which will bring in a minimum amount of revenue, and that is what I wish to see adopted. The position is not at all clear. No one has a right to say that it is so-and-so, because he does not know. That brings me back to the point I mentioned earlier to-day, namely, that we want an authoritative body to inquire into these proposals. But the fact remains that it is proposed to decrease duties which have been operating for some years, while the industries affected have certainly not been ruined. That does not appeal to me. I give The prices of these goods, the honourable member for Melbourne credit for being actuated by the best intentions, but a man with his temperament may be biased or influenced, perhaps unconsciously, by local views. I intend to support the existing duties. [2.45 a.m.] I ask the Prime Minister to name a single member in the House whom he has ever heard say that woollen goods cannot be manufactured in Australia. The right honourable gentleman has been making statements with a recklessness that does not do him credit. I challenge him to name one honourable member who has ever said in this House that woollen goods cannot be produced in Australia. If he cannot name one, let him be man enough to admit that he has made a misstatement to the Committee. No such assertion has ever been made in this House.

I have information in my possession to the effect that these braids are used, to a large extent, in manufacture, and that they are not made in Australia. Under these circumstances, I think that they may very fairly be exempt from duty. and Customs) [3.9 a.m.] -The reason underlying this proposal is that, some three or four years ago, trimmings and ornaments, n.e.,i., for bonnets, hats, shoes, and other attire were made dutiable at 25 per cent, under the general Tariff, and 15 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. It is impossible to distinguish between some of these braids and the articles which are used for trimmings under 134A of the Tariff. Consequently, it is proposed that they shall be of a specific width. All braids over that width will be dutiable and the balance will be admitted free. Some of these braids cost more than ios. a yard, and are used only as ornaments for the very finest dresses. I do not think that all braids should be admitted free, seeing that some of them are of many colours and fancy patterns. As a matter of fact, they become a trimming in themselves 0 and should, therefore, be subject to a duty. However, I am willing to. exempt all braids under 2 inches in width. a.m.] I have already pointed out that this duty will be oppressive on the manufacturers of goods in Australia. These braids are necessary accessories to a madeup garment. They are not, strictly speaking, 'ornamental, in the sense that trimmings are ornamental, and I fail to see why a revenue duty should be placed upon braids which are necessary to the completion of a garment. I think that there is a well-known trade definition of braids which is sufficiently comprehensive to admit of a distinction being drawn between them and trimmings. Trimmings are distinctly ornamental and decorative in their character, whereas braids are necessary to the completion of garments. It is absurd to impose a duty upon an article which is a necessary component .part of a finished garment. I would point out to the Committee that many of these braids are plain, and are manufactured up to 3 or 4 inches in width. They are used as bindings upon ladies' dresses.",96,Pairs

Mr J. H . CATTS -Twenty per cent, is a revenue duty. could never understand why Australian ingenuity has not been sufficient to invent a similar stove. A 20 per cent, duty would give Australians a show to do so. For that reason 1 urge the honourable member for Cook to withdraw his amendment. I have no particular love for the Standard Oil Company, to whom the stove belongs, but, while seeing that justice is done to our own people, we ought to give the Australian mechanic a chance to do something in this direction. -The two speeches to which we have just listened prove the desirability of continuing the discussion of the Tariff on some occasion when we are a little more awake. The honourable member for Hindmarsh proposed a reduction of the duty because the articles are not made here, and then he said the duty must not be abolished altogether because that would prevent them from ever being made here. The bigger the duty, the sooner things will be made here, if they can be. This way of dealing with the Tariff is ""over the odds."" Is this a deliberative assembly, or is it a farce? Members are asleep all round the chamber. I cannot see why the user of an artificial stove in the city should be asked to pay a heavy price, while the user in the country is allowed to obtain it free of duty. The honourable member for Hume ought to be able to inform the Committee whether these articles are being constructed anywhere in Australia; but, under present conditions, we do not know enough about the item to pass it. Why should we not go home instead of passing items with half the Committee asleep, and the Government not caring, and prepared to compromise whenever any suggestion is made by a Government The Government would not supporter? The Vacuum Oil Company has writtenICerosene cooking stoves and heaters are not manufactured in the Commonwealth, so that no Kerosene stoves local industry is affected by the importation of same. The manufacture of kerosene cooking stoves and heaters can only be carried on under enormous expense in providing suitable plant with which to manufacture the goods, and which goods are manufactured by the thousand in the United States of America, and, we believe, elsewhere. No attempt has ever been made to manufacture kerosene cooking stoves and heaters in the Commonwealth, because the demand for same would not warrant the necessary expenditure in providing suitable plant for the manufacture of these goods, and as there is no local industry to protect, it seems somewhat of an anomaly to further increase the rate of duty on these goods, which are principally used by people of moderate means throughout the Commonwealth, and in districts in which it is practically impossible to obtain wood, except at a prohibitive cost. We should know what the price of these stoves is. It may be fair to tax them if they are a luxury, but they should not be taxed if used chiefly by the poor. Mr J. H . CATTS A standard heater costs about £ 2 ios., and a half size about £ 1 ios., with the present duty of 20 per cent. probably increases the price by 30 per cent, to the purchaser. Probablyi f admitted free the stoves would not cost more than 36s. I regret that the Minister is willing to allow kerosene stoves to remain at a duty of 20 per cent. There are two kinds of these stoves on the market in Queensland. Australians, as a rule, are inclined to purchase the imported, rather than the locally manufactured article, and a higher duty would give a stimulus to the local manufacturers. I should like to see the duty increased by at least 5 per cent. The makers of the ordinary fuel stoves also deserve consideration. 30 and 25 per cent. cause of the competition of America and England they are not in a happy position.",99,Divisi On Vi Metal S And Machinery

I shall not support the reduction of the duty even on Primus stoves, but I think that we have a right at this hour of the morning to protest against needless waste of time. I did rather resent the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton, because the honourable member for Cook was in a very difficult position. He moved in good faith for the reduction of the duty. He was given to understand by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and also by the admission of the Minister, that no such stoves to support his proposal to remove the diffiare made in Australia. He did not move against an industry in existence here but against a revenue dutya duty which would never have any Protective value.

Melbourne. knows they are made in Australia? been that we cannot get this information from the Department. I do not blame the Minister, who is infinitely preferable to his predecessor in conducting a Tariff through the Chamber. If there has been any waste of time it has been due to the fact that the Department has failed to supply the information to which the Committee is entitled. Like the honourable member for Bourke, I have been practising a good deal of selfrestraint. With the exception of one or two amendments I should have been prepared to allow the remaining items in the schedule to pass. on the item before the Committee the Minister has seen his way clear to follow the lead of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. becoming one of the most serious items in domestic economy, and the Primus stove is -Does not the Minister think that it will becoming a necessary article in every home, be a fair thing to adjourn now? particularly in the summer months. I am pleased that the Minister has seen his way to make the duty as low as possible. If any firm or inventor who can provide a AmericaI shall be prepared to vote for a duty to help a deserving industry.

[4.47 a.m.] I object. If the honourable member for Cook is serious I am prepared culties which are proposed to be placed in the way of persons getting these stoves at a reasonable price. The only effect of the duty will be to enhance the price of the article to the working classes.' The Primus stove has been found to be very handy, and very economical in places where cheap gas and other cheap fuel are not available. These stoves cannot be and are not manufactured in Australia. This is purely a revenue duty. Again, there is no anomaly to be rectified. I marvel' that the honourable member for Cook should seek to withdraw the proposal which he made in face of his declaration that he would not support any revenue duty. He has declared that this is a pure revenue duty. Mr J. H .

We are making envelopes and, even more important, boxes, and dextrine is a raw material in both industries, which are dependent on the Tariff for their existence.

T. Union of Melbourne and Sydney writesRiley, E. Notwithstanding any assertions to the contrary, Roberts, E.

Unfortunately, the majority of the employers in this industry are indifferent as to whether the profit is made by the imported article or the locally-worked. Whilst 40 per cent, may be a high duty in some cases, in this it is a very moderate one, and is not as much as desired. At the present time the large furniture manufacturers, including the Chinese, import table tops largely. . . The whole of this work should be done here. The coloured marbles of which we have large deposits here, are provided for in the old sub-items (A), (U), and (c). We are of the opinion that if the foregoing subitems and the increase on the wrought to 40 per cent, are carried, the workers will benefit to a considerable extent, and the polishing branch will be quite a flourishing industry in itself. These requests come from practically all the States, and from both employees and employers. Whatever our fiscal faith may be, we ought to give reasonable consideration to such representations as these. I appeal to honourable members to assist me in this matter, and hope that the Minister will take into consideration the suggestion made in the document I have quoted.

We had a strong fight about it when the last Tariff was being debated. man to whomwe were chiefly indebted for information respecting white marble was Mr Summers, of Melbourne. At that time certain white marhle quarries at Bathurst were being developed. This stone is not at its best when obtained near the surface, because it is discoloured by percolations from ironstone and other earths. At the time to which I refer it was not known whether the quality of the marble would improve as the quarries were worked further down. Since then they have been developed to a considerable extent, and I am informed that tbe marble obtained is as pure as any that can be found at Carrara or elsewhere. This marble is being used very largely in Sydney. The only man whom I have found to be against a good Protective duty is an importer in George-street, who does a great deal of marble work, and who finds the Carrara marble softer, and therefore easier to carve. however, is much more durable. A good deal of it is being used for tombstone and monumental work, for which purposes it is far better adapted than Carrara marble. Mr Summers furnished a report, which the Minister can get, on the marble obtained on the Murray. were magnificent quarries of marble of all colours, in addition to white marble. find, turning up Hansard, that when the existing Tariff was under consideration we had a strong fight on this question.

Amongst the majority were the honourable members for Cook, Macquarie, Parramatta, Swan, Darling Downs, Bendigo, Melbourne Ports, Wimmera, and Laanecoorie, as well as Mr Watson and the late Mr Batchelor. The of the protection will be removed, because the marble quarries have been developed to such an extent that the industry may now be considered to be established. There is no question of their member for Boothby in regard to the MinI f honourable members can see taro slate. I believe it to be one of the finest slates in the world, and if, as he says, the industry is languishing through-the competition of imported slate, I shall be very pleased if the Minister will include a Protective duty in his next Tariff, even if he is not able to provide for it on the present occasion. I have personal knowledge that the slate is of first-class quality. and Customs) [7.8 a.m.] -With regard to the point raised by the honourable member for Boothby and the honourable member for Fremantle, if they will turn to item 264 of the existing Tariff, they will find that slates are there made dutiable. Practically the slate duties are on a par with the marble and granite duties. I think, however, that the marble and granite duties should be higher in proportion than those on slate. As to the point raised by the honourable member for Maribyrnong in conJiexion with the raw material for monumental masons, I may state that I made inquiries when the last Tariff was under discussion, and I was strongly supported by the honourable member for Hume. I voted against him in connection with the marble duty.

The Minister has stated that ""the reason for proposing an increase is that --the Department cannot distinguish between -the good article and that which we all ad-mit to be. bad.

That proves its efficacy. To Teduce the duty by 50 per cent, will facilitate the introduction of the very thing we want To keep out. My second objection is --that the present rate of duty seems to have no prohibitive effect so far as local manu' fact'ure is concerned. Messrs. R. W. ""Thurlow and Company, of Brisbane, are -not, by any means, the only manufacturers -of vinegar in Australia. Australian manu' facturers are able to supply an article of ,-good quality at a reasonable price, and they ; say that they are doing sufficiently well not -to need an increase of the duty.

[7.30 a.m.] I regret that the Minister has decided to drop the item because of silly arguments advanced by several honourable members. I would suspect any manufacturer who told me that he did not want more duty. He must have some reason for saying that. Either he does not want other competitors, or he imports more largely than he manufactures. I under stood the Minister to say that, he would withdraw the proposal. at what it was before, and try to get a Government certificate as to the purity of the vinegar. member can do that I think that he will collect an enormous amount of revenue, because most of that which is imported is not made from malt but from some concoction, and is passed off as malt vinegar. Many honourable members will, I suppose, hold up their hands aghast at that reference by me to a so-called reputable firm. In Victoria we had to pass Food Acts to stop the use of a lot of imported stuffs. It is quite likely, as the honourable member for Richmond said, that while the Australian vinegar is offered at 6s. per dozen quarts, imported vinegar is sold at 9s., and that more of the imported article is sold. In Australia we have people who would buy bread from a baker in London every morning if they could get it telegraphed out. I hope that if the Minister has agreed to allow the item to drop with a view to making better provision in the future to protect fruit vinegar from any other, he will be able to do so, but I think that it is rather discrediting the officials.

The honourable member is now supporting this Bill despite that declaration. I claim his %'ote against the proposed tax. Again on page 201 of Hansard of the present year he is thus reported:'I desire to say to all manufacturers that I am as good a Protectionist as ever I was, but I do not intend to vote for any more protection until I am assured by the men employed, through their organizations, that the wages paid are suffidrugs packed for use in the household, n.e.i."" cient to keep them in a civilized state.

It declared that New Protection was given by means of the Victorian Wages Boards and similiar tribunals in other States. I denv that the WagesBoards, as they exist, give protection to the workers in anything like the same sense that the manufacturers are protected by the Customs duties. In the face of these declarations I would like to know whether the honourable member is still of the same mind. Upon that occasion he took up a very heroic stand, but has he the courage to abide by it, and to refuse to sanction the imposition of an increased duty either upon this or any other item of the Bill until he has been assured that the employees in any industry thus protected shall share in the benefits which flow from that increased protection ? a.m.] I should like to know from the Minister whether any great quantity of formalin is being manufactured in the Commonwealth at the present time. To myf mind this is one of the most important; items in the Tariff, seeing that it pro* foundly affects many branches of our pri« mary industries. I wish to remind honourable members that: formalin is used largely to prevent thespread of disease.

ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [10.34 a.m.] I am informed by those interested in the timber trade that the effect -of this proposal will be very injurious to their interests. I propose to quote some advantage passages from a circular issued by the Sydfeet. The above figures refer to 4 x £ lining, ney Timber Merchants' Association, which, which is very extensively used in the SydneyI suppose, has been sent to every member Building Trade. of tEe Committee, and which states the case used from the point of view of the timber merand seasoned in Sydney for at least six weeks . chants of the Commonwealth, who are before being dressed, and, therefore, gives adthoroughly conversant with the requirements ditional labour. of the tirade. They sayWe employ approximately 3,600 bands. We pay in wages yearly between ^455,300 and ^470,000. We estimate the cost of labour in converting rough timber into dressed at is. 6d. per 100 feet , -super. F if t y per cent, of the work done in Sydney Mills is in New Zealand white pine and Rimu' timbers' in the shape of dressing and re-sawing. This timber is imported in the rough, and is -dressed in Sydney. Should the proposed duty of 2S. 6d. on New Zealand timbers remain, this 50 per cent, of our Sydney work would be lost to our workers. Notwithstanding the duty of 3s. per 100 feet on dressed timber for the past 10 years the importation has increased in some States, so 3s. is not enough to stop timber coming' in dressed. There is an average loss of 25 per cent, in s -converting rough timber into dressed flooring and lining, add _ 25 per cent, to the proposed duty of 2S. 6d.,""this will bring the duty on rough . timber higher than the duty on timber dressed. Although we lost this 25 per cent, of rough timber we have to pay duty on it . It takes 112.5 feet of rough timber to produce what is known in the trade as 100 feet of 4 x J dressed flooring, the duty on this 112.5 feet at 2s. 6d. would be 2s. g f d. The super of inch measurement of this 100 feet of dressed flooring is 87.5 feet, and would pay if imported dressed, under the 3s. duty 2s. 7£d., so the duty is less by 2^d. per 100 feet on the finished article than would be paid on sufficient rough timber to manufacture the same quantity. If 2s. 6d. duty is imposed on rough timber, then we ask for a duty on rough box timber, cut to size, 8s. per 100 feet super, of inch, and 16s. on tbe same timber dressed. We wish to draw your attention tp the following facts referring to Imported Dressed Timber, and showing how Sydney trade will be at a disadvantage should the extra 2s. be placed on white pine and Rimu timbers :s. d. Duty on Sawn Timber (raw material) a 6 (It takes 140 feet sawn timber to produce 100 feet super. 4 x jr lining.)

This timber is stacked With regard to timber for butter boxes, there is this further statementBox-makers in the Commonwealth are in the habit of manufacturing butter boxes out of ia and 14 x § timber. Should there be a duty put on all timber other than these sizes, it w ill necessarily follow that the New Zealand millers will have to charge a higher price for this timber than the other timbers of smaller sizesAny man with commercial experience knows that that is no exaggerated statement. The timber suppliers are not going to suffer any loss, but must necessarily charge a higher price to their customerson which it is proposed to place a duty of 2s. 6d. per 100 feet, because taking into consideration that the log will only produce at the most 50 per cent, of this butter box size, they wil l have to find a market for the narrower sizes, so that they will be forced to ask 2s. per 100 feet more for the butter box size to enable them to self the small sizes on the market at the same price as at present. I am credibly informed that after all the best of the timber is used for making butter boxes, whereas the refuse or dead pieces, unsuitable for such a purpose, are used for making fruit cases, rabbit crates, and similar articles. This really gives the butter industry an advantage at the expense of the fruit and other industries which have to pay the extra duty on the timber used in making the casesThe Sydney box trade use quite 70 per cent, of the imported white pine and rimu into ordinary boxes, and so find a market for all the white pine produced that is not fit for butter box making, and we are firmly of opinion that if the duty remains as proposed, it will have the effect of increasing, not only the price of the ordinary boxes, but more especially butter boxes. Here is a table showing a comparison of prices, and how timbers are affected in connection with the duties. As to American timbers we are toldAmerican To import rough timber in sizes 12 x 6 and upwards, the duty is Re-sawing into sizes 6 x 1 , cost Loss in sawdust, ia£ per cent, at gs. per 100 Duty at 6d. on 12^ per cent, loss Duty on ordinary rough timber is This will show that there is nothing gained by taking advantage of the sixpenny duty on sizes 12 x 6 and upwards. Sellers of American timber, if asked for all large sizes of 12 x 6 and upwards, leaving out the smaller sizes, ask is. 6d. per 100 feet super. advance. As a matter of fact, this advance is recognised in the trade. New Zealand Timber. To import rough timber in sizes 12 x 6 and upwards, the duty is Re-sawing into sizes, 6 x 1 , cost Loss in sawdust, I2£ per cent., white pine and rimu, at 12s. ... This shows that it is cheaper to import rough timber in smaller sizes, and only pay the duty of 2s. 6d. The above examples should demonstrate the fact that 3s. on dressed timber is not enough. The average log brought to any mill in the world would not yield more than 56 per cent, of sizes of 12 x 6 and upwards, and the miller must naturally dispose of his smaller sizes. White pine makes the most attractive box of any timber known. It is free from any woody odour, takes print like paper, brands show out well, and our exports packed in boxes made of this timber have a good start in any market. ber explain how only 12J per cent, is allowed for waste in saving in one case, while 25 per cent, is allowed in the other?

The circular I read a few moments ago is from the Sydney Timber Merchants' Association j and I quote it because I think that association is in the best position to give correct information. A great deal more might be urged; but I content myself with asking the Minister to carefully reconsider the whole question of New Zealand timber in the light of facts which may hitherto have escaped his notice. I do not suppose that it is the honourable gentleman's desire to place any industry at a special Timber. disadvantage, or that it is the will of s. d.

This timber is of such a fine nature and quality that it is far loo good for such common purposes as box-making, and it is a shame to use it for such. Furthermore, the demand for hoop pine has been so great for a long time past that suppliers are not able to f u l f i l orders. I think that that is a well-known fact. Queensland timber is recognised as one of the very best for certain purposes, and I understand that the merchants can obtain from 5s. to 7s. per 100 superficial feet more than is paid for New Zealand pine.

The New Zealand saw-miller will say, "" I have to send to Australia the very best cuts out of the log for butter-box purposes. am I going to do with the off-cuts?"" ' If he cannot find a ready market for the offcuts, the chances are that instead of. our receiving a benefit by the removal of the duty on the timber for butter-boxes, the New Zealand miller will have to charge more for his best cuts because he will not be able to find so ready a market for the off-cuts. It is further statedRe Tariff Item 303 (v) :-"" Square timber rough sawn into sizes suitable for manufacture of broom handles, which means any length timber ii by ii inches square."" We consider that this item should be recast and placed on the free list instead of 20 per cent, ad valorem. Because we ourselves cannot get sufficient supplies from seven Queensland mills to keep us going. We Bought from Queensland this year, January to October, 356,000 pieces, we wanted at least.600,000. Because this size is really an off-cut, i.e., small widths that cannot be used any other way. Because no mill in Australia will cut planks or logs up into broom squares, we, as manufacturers having the necessary machinery, are unable to do it on account of the advancing cost of all lines of Australian timbers. Because not one timber in a 100 varieties is suitable for so small diameter. Because we are not able to import New Zealand white pine in manufacturers size, viz., 3 f t . 6 in. in length for household brooms at tbe present on account of the duty which is equal to 3s. per gross on broom handle squares. Unless the New Zealand miller can sell practically the whole log, he will not sell us the best at the present rates, and allow the rest to rot in his mill yard. Grave consideration should certainly be given to these representations. an export duty on white pine logs, with the result that all the white pine we import from that country is already cut up. Naturally the New Zealand millers want to sell all the sizes they cut out of the log, and unless the Australian importer is prepared to take them, the millers will raise the price for the parts which he does take. It is quite possible therefore that, instead of the removal of duties on white pine used for butter-boxes benefiting the butter-producing industry of Australia, it may work out the other way. ber want all New Zealand pine admitted, When a New Zealand white or only New Zealand white pine? pine, which is used principally for making butter-boxes, crates, and fruit cases. The only Australian timber so far as we know suitable for this class of work, and What growing in any quantity, is the hoop pine. It is a splendid timber, but owing to the great demand for it for house-building purposes and joinery work, the supplies are not sufficient. If we admit New Zealand white pine free, it will not embarrass any Australian industry. If I thought it would, I should refuse, as a Protectionist, to have anything to do with it. leave the duty at 6d. on the lot as it is now. The Minister has already stated that he intends to alter the sizes specified in the schedule. I have here a statutory declaration by the manager of the Co-operative Box Company of New South Wales, which supplies eighty co-operative factories with butter-boxes, and uses from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 superficial feet of timber every year.

I am not at all certain that the proposed re-arrangement of duties will benefit the butter industry, and it will certainly penalize the fruit, rabbit, and other industries. I oppose the proposal to allow any New .Zealand timber for butter boxes to come in free. It is somewhat disconcerting to find that there are still some members in the Committee who are only one-sided Protectionists. of which are merely used in the interests of certain industries in their own electorates. timbers in yours? certain industries, among them that of timber, but I doubt if the honourable member can find a single industry throughout Australia to which I have not voted to give the most ample protection possible. If it were proposed to remove the present duty of 3d. per lb., or 25 per cent., on butter, or the duty on raw and preserved fruits, the honourable member for Maribyrnong would be up in arms. He wants, however, to allow New Zealand timber to come in free for fruit boxes. Some time ago, when Mr Justice Isaacs was a member of this House, he was censured by the Fruit growers' Association in his electorate for voting for a duty on timber. If there is anything in the Protectionist idea, all industries ought to receive adequate protection. I do not claim that Protection is a panacea for all the ills that flesh Is heir to, but it is a method of enabling the Labour party to carry out its ideals in Australia. If we take the duty off timber for fruit and butter boxes, other consumers should have the same consideration extended to them. The removal of the duty which it is proposed to levy on butteri . 6 x f, box timber will not increase by a single copper the amount which the dairy farmer will receive for his butter, nor will the removal of the duty from timber for fruit boxes help the fruit-grower an atom.

It is only because of the wealthy and prosperous co-operative .companies mentioned: by the honourable member for Richmond, that the farmer is now getting something like a fair return for his labourThe wealthy co-operative dairy companiesare well able to pay an import duty on timber. The one-sided Protectionists of whom I have spoken have short memories and queer methods. When it was proposed some tune ago to put an import duty on New Zealand pine, so that Queensland timber might be used for butter boxes, we were told that that timber was not suitable, and when we proved that it was, the objection was raised that it was too good. In our big cities tlie public is charged 5d., 6d., and even 8d. a lb. for apples, and when in London recently I saw white grapes marked up at 8d. and black grapes at 7d. a lb., while as much as 9d. each was being charged for pears, and rod., for peaches. ber wish himself back in Australia? my return to Adelaide how reasonable, incomparison, are the prices charged here.

He showed that the New Zealand suppliers of pine would have to charge higher prices if they could not dispose of the smaller portions of the log, and the honourable member for Richmond has expressed a doubt as to whether the proposal will do what is aimed at. Zealand timber on the same footing as other timber. a very intricate one, and I do not feel competent to express an opinion, except generally, on the Minister's proposal. been freely stated that fruit-growers and others engaged in rural industries, whom we wish to encourage, will be injured by what is proposed. anything is done, the Minister should obtain the opinion of those engaged in the timber business in Melbourne and Sydney. As the representative of a large dairying district, I am very pleased that the Minister intends to make butter boxes as cheap as possible, but, although I amglad that my constituents are to be assisted, I do not desire that the fruit-grower shall suffer. We should try to deal justly with all. The manager of the company to which the honourable member for Richmond has referred saysI f the intention is to remove the 6d. duty now charged on butter box timber, and this concession is granted as well as on the smaller sizes referred to, it should make a difference of something like f d . per box. Butter boxes are made in a number of sizes, and the timbers in use are 12 inches by }, 12 inches by 14 x boxes with the sides, ends, tops, and bottoms in one piece. use of improved tonguing and grooving and gluing machines, and the making of the sides and bottoms in two pieces, is an advantage, and enables smaller sized timbers, which must be purchased at the same time as the others, to be used up. manager saysWe do not think the Tariff mentions anything Minister's proposal will not work in the below g inches by J inch. To use the size in direction he desires. the side or bottom of a butter box, we would dairying industry, it seems quite clear that need also to attach thereto another piece of the fruit-growing industry will, under this -5-inch by f in order to make a f u l l side or proposition, have to bear a heavier burden bottom. According to Mr W. M. Pearson, of Pearthan son's Proprietary Limited, who are very very bad time for some years past. Any big people in the city of MelbourneThe operation of the revised tariff on New Zealand white pine for butter box purthe statistics of the State will find that at poses is likely to prove the opposite to that in the present time there are about 3,000 acres tended by the Government. Hitherto New Zealand pine, undressed, of all sizes, has been dutiable at 6d. per 100 super, feet. It is now proposed to make sizes suitable for manufacture into butter: boxes free (that is not less than gin. x f in . , and not exceeding 12m. x 2in.), but to make other sizes dutiable at 2s. to 2s. 6d. per 100 super, feet. These other sizes, or offcuts, which constitute about 60 per cent, of the original timber, have to rely upon Australia as a market, being sold as a by-product. But while off-cuts will become dutiable at 2s. to 2s. 6d., instead of 6d., it is feared that the extra duty cannot be recovered, as they have to be sold in Australia, in competition with spruce and hardwood. In this case, therefore, the net return to the New Zealand saw-miller will be reduced, and in order to obtain the same total It has amount from the whole log as before it would be necessary to obtain a higher price for the butter-box timber. Some of the leading sellers from New Zealand are asking an advance of is. per 100 feet, and it is thought possible that a I suggest that, before greater advance may have to be asked, the resuit being that the concession represented by the Government proposals will be more than neutralised. I have also before me a report of the annual meeting of the Kauri Timber Company Limited which was held recently. The chairman of the company in his report to the shareholders saidThe Federal Government, in bringing in a Bill to do away with the anomalies of the Tariff, had made a considerable change in the duties on New Zealand pine, this being practically the only alteration in timber. While the B ill was supposed to do away with anomalies, it only served to create bipper anomalies than existed before. The Minister of Customs, in introducing the B ill , said that he recognised something had to be done to assist the butter industry, and this he proposed to do by remitting the present duty, equal to is. 3d. per ton on butter value £112To make up for this, however, he proposed to tax the fruit growing industry to the extent of 4s. 6d. per ton 12 inches by if , 14 x f, value £14, so that the fruit-growers would have to carry the impost for the benefit of the butter and 14 x if . This is timber for factories. As a matter of fact, however, the price of butter boxes would not be reduced by It is found that the the alteration, but the effect would be to raise the prices, as in producing the better grades for the butter business, they were compelled to make a large quantity of sizes suitable only for fruit cases, and if the market for this line was to be restricted or taxed so heavily tbe better qualities would have to be raised in price to compensate for the loss on the lower grades.

It stands to reason that if a saw-miller can only sell the principal article which he is producing, and can do nothing with the by-pvoducts -becaus e the off-cuts or small cuts are the by-products of the timber trade-the consequence must be that he must charge more than he otherwise would do for the more bulky timbers. able to sell these off-cuts at a profit, as New Zealand does, purchasers would reap a great advantage all round.

New Zealand has imposed an export duty of 5s. per 100 on logs cut into halves. I presume that that means sawn straight down the centre. But she has also imposed an export duty of 3s. per 100 on flitches 12 inches in width and 4 inches in thickness, or its equivalent, or less than the equivalent of 10 x 10. Those timbers would be dutiable at our 6d. rate. The object of New Zealand, in fact, has been to prevent work being done in Australia. They want the whole work to be done there I find no fault with them for that. Batchelor, while member for Boothby, raised the question of reciprocity with New Zealand with regard to wine, the Dominion, did not respond, but charged 2s. a gallonon South Australian wine. We have noreciprocity with New Zealand. If we treat her timber as we have been doing, we shall have nothing to give away when we begin to talk about reciprocity. We shall not beable to negotiate on reasonable terms. New Zealand will say to us, "" Thank you for nothing'; you have given us what we want under your Tariff; your Parliament has decided that our timber* shallenter the Commonwealth at low If our saw-millers were rates."" The New Zealand Tariff also gives rebates for kauri exported at the same rates as applied to other timbers. If the Committee chooses to decide that New Zealand pine, whether for butter boxes or otherwise, shall come in at a lower rate than any other timber, it can do so. But let us thoroughly understand what we are doing. We can do that, not necessarily by fixing the size, but by saying that New Zealand white pine, which is used for this particular purpose, shall come in at a certain rate, and all other New Zealand pine at the ordinary rates which are fixed for other timbers; or alternately we can say that New Zealand pine for the manufacture of butter-boxes shall come in at a low rate, but that all other New Zealand pine in sizes less than 12 in. by 6 in. shall come in? at the rate of 2s. or 2s. 6d. per 100 super., feet. If it is desired to give an advantage to New Zealand let the Committee adopt some other rate, say, is. or is. 3d. Or is. 6d., or any sum it likes. I have heard,, and no doubt other honourable members have heard, that this item, if passed, will interfere with our timber mills, which are used"" for the cutting and dressing of timber. If what we consider justice, or to put them on their old footing, we can increase the rate on dressed timber, so that they shall not suffer any hardship as compared with their previous position. I admit that it is a difficult question to deal"" with. I believe that the best diing which the Committee could do would be to say that New Zealand white pine of any size, and that alone, shall come in at the former rate, namely, 6d. per .100 feet super., or any other rate which it might care to fix, and' that all other New Zealand pine shall fall under the ordinary rates for other timber.: The anomaly which the Ministry tried topine differently from other timber.

CATTS -Does the honourable member know what is the right thing to do? Mr J'. H . CATTS -Then I shall resume my seat, and allow the honourable member to explain the position. I am very pleased to find that the Minister has been doing all that he possibly can to meet the views of those who represent -the dairying and fruit industries of Australia. The honourable member for Capricornia has adversely criticised the attitude Which certain Protectionist members' of this Chamber have adopted towards this proposal. But I contend that the question of the admission of New Zealand white pine free of duty is one which stands entirely by itself. The' Minister, strong Protectionist though he is, will recognise that a special case can be made out for the free admission of that timber in connection with our fruit and butter industries. We must recollect that the great bulk of the cases which are used in those industries are used for the purpose of packing our products for despatch to the Old Country -There seems to be a strong element of It is not as if the timber imported from New Zealand competed with our own timber. Most of the former finds its way to London in the form of cases, where it has to compete with timber from all parts of the world. It has been said that we -should not attempt to introduce New Zealand white pine free until our own resources had been exhausted, and we 1 were thoroughly convinced that we could not supply a single butter-box from our own timber. But if honourable members will read the. evidence which was given before the Tariff Commission in 1906 they will see that it is not possible for us to produce butter-boxes 'from our own timber as cheaply as it is to produce them from New Zealand white pine. The estimates which were presented to that body showed that the use of the hoop pine of Queensland would cost at least i d . per box more than would be involved by the use of the white pine of New Zealand^ Seeing that the great majority of these boxes are forwarded to the London market, it is plain that we are now called upon to deal with quite a special case. Under these circumstances, I hope that the Minister, who has already intimated that he is partly favorable to the idea which has been put forward by several honourable members, will reconsider this matter during the luncheon adjournment, with a view' to submitting a 1 proposal which will enable New Zealand white pine, for use as boxes in our butter and fruit industries, to be admitted free. I am not sure that it is necessary at this stage to make any distinction between New Zealand importations and importations from the Baltic, the United States, and other places. I believe that much can be said in favour of timber being regarded as a raw material. After all, there is a great similarity between a national asset, such as a large timber supply, and a national asset such as a coal supply. Zealand measures are taken to preserve the young timber. A splendid system of afforestation has been adopted there upon which I would like to dwell. But time forbids that. I think we should provide that New Zealand white pine for use as boxes in our butter and fruit industries may be imported into Australia free of duty. doubt in the minds of the Committee in' regard to this item. In these circumstances, especially as we have not time to enter into the question thoroughly, and also because of the great demand which exists for timber, I think the wisest plan for us to adopt would be to retain the old duty. Consequently, I suggest that the Minister should withdraw the item. The more the last Tariff is discussed the more I am satisfied that it reflects great credit upon the Commonwealth Parliament. Hence the necessity for great care being exercised in tinkering with it. I urge upon the Minister the advisableness of withdrawing the item.",131,Division X Wood Wicker And Cane

1050,Mr Archibald (Hindmarsh) [12.27].,"I join with the honourable member for Hindmarsh in asking that more time should be given to the consideration of these important duties. I was very much relieved to hear the Minister say just now that he and others who have had an opportunity of going through the previous Tariff have always experienced great difficulty in understanding the timber duties. I have been struggling with them during the last two or three days, and the more I wander into the labyrinth of this forest the more I am bewildered. anything about the question which is before the Chair at the present moment, nor do I quite appreciate the alterations which the Minister has outlined. I rose chiefly to voice, in a few brief sentences, a protest which has been sent to me from South Australia. distinctly understood that I hold no brief for the timber merchants who have forwarded thek protest say that I think the timber industry of Australia is deserving of consideration and of protection. What that measure of protection ought to be, I am not prepared to suggest at the present moment. timber merchants of South Australia wish to enter their protest against the proposed alteration of this duty. that on apple cases the proposed extra duty will amount to 7s. 6d. per 100 cases, and as many thousands of these cases are used yearly they urgg-thaf the impost will be a very serious one. thatCabinetmakers and other large users of this timber will also suffer, because there is no other timber so suitable for cheap articles of furniture not been considered successful. At one time that can be obtained at equal prices, and the merchnnls submit that there is no justification in making the alteration, because the duty is not wanted for revenue purposes, nor is protection needed for Queensland p'ines, seeing that the sawmillers in that State cannot supply much, if any, beyond their own State requirements; and South Australia has no timber of its own. They further claim that the matter should be reconsidered with a view to retaining the old duty; the Tariff in their opinion being already sufficiently high to afford adequate protection to, without interfering with, these rural industries. think that the Government would be acting wisely if they withdrew this itern, because there is not a city in Australia to-day in which there does not exist an urgent demand for timber. I am a Protectionist, and I do not wish honourable members to think that I am in any way a renegade to my fiscal principles. The representatives of Queensland have no need to worry about the admission of New Zealand white pine into Australia free of duty, because all the timber which Queensland can send to New South Wales, that State can take from her. At the present time the demand for timber is so active that it is being taken out of. the ships' holds, placed upon the wharfs, and carted direct to the buildings in which it is being used. No attention whatever I certainly do not understand is being paid to the seasoning of timber., As honourable members apparently cannot make up their minds upon this question, the Minister should withdraw the item and allow us to deal with it when our thoughts have clarified somewhat. In doing so I wish it to be consider that the discussion upon this item has proved that, so far as the timber duties are concerned, we made a good job of the I merely wish to Tariff when we last considered it. The Tariff on that occasion was given more con* sideration than we are able to give to this proposal. . I believe that it would do no harm to leave white pine dutiable at 6d. per But the 100 superficial feet, as it is at present; but I hope that whatever is done will benefit the producers of butter and fruit alike. I They contend think there should be 110 distinction made between them. I have a communication from the Western Australian Fruit-growers'' Association in which they strongly protest against any extra duty on timber for fruit They also point out cases. They contend that it is . almost impossible to secure satisfactory cases from the use of the local hardwood. I know that the attempt has been made, and that it has I thought it might be better, in dealing, with this item, to make provision for rebates, but I am afraid that that would cost too much for supervision. I direct attention to the reference in this item to hickory felloes. I have seen hickory rims, but I never knew hickory to be cvi into felloes. If honourable members are prepared to come to a vote I shall not speak at greater length, but I hope the Minister will state that it is his intentionto retain the present duty on white pine. I oppose the proposal to admit New Zealand' white pine free of duty, for reasons other than those which have so far been advanced.!

The party on this side of the House are anxious that the workers in industries receiving protection under the Tariff shall share in the profits derived from the prosecution of those industries. I think that we are agreed that an industry which does not give the workers engaged in it a fair return for their labour is not entitled, at least, to further protection under the Tariff. To show how little the dairying industry is entitled to any consideration in the shape of a remission of duties or increased protection, I submit for the consideration of honourable members the following figures for 1909 taken from the Commonwealth Year-Book No. 4. It will be seen that I have compared the dairying industry with groups of other industries whose output is approximately of the same value, and I ask honourable members to study the contrast which the figures disclose :Factories. Value of 1. 1 Butter, Cheese and densed Milk Factories . . Saw-mills Woollen and Tweed Mills 1,308 6,694,704 2,162,973 24,381 Australia Agricultural Implements Engineer and Ironworks Hat and Cap Factories.. 73 985 6,623,252 2,257,007 23,324 tralia.

It will be seen from these figures that the dairying industry sweats its employees and pays them miserable wages. It does not, therefore, deserve consideration from this House. There is no industry in Australia that is more in need of reform in regard to its wages, hours, and conditions of labour than is the dairying industry. I am not prepared to vote to-day, or on any other day, for further assistance by means of the Tariff to this industry until those engaged in it pay fair wages and give reasonable conditions to their employees. It is somewhat disgraceful that this is about the only industry in connection with which .there is no Wages Board to fix rates of pay and conditions of labour. Those engaged in this industry strongly object to their employees forming themselves into a union. I suppose it was more difficult to organize the Rural Workers' Union than any other body of workers in the Commonwealth, and yet the employers in this industry come to this House and ask for the remission of a miserable duty of 6d. per 100 feet on butter-box timber. 2 Number ot es Oi output . considers that the dairying industry is of employees. 01 i little value to Australia? £ it as one of the most beneficial and useful industries we have. reason the honourable member is trying to 550 6,727,324 295,826 3,283 help it? industry gives a better return for their 24 labour to those employed in it, it is not deserving of protection from the people of -Before this industry can make a legitimate claim for Tariff assistance, it 148 should put its house in order and be prepared to give the employees in it reasonable 764 wages and fair conditions of labour.

Most of the mills in southern Tasmania have been sold within recent years, or are being offered for sale. After a long struggle we have obtained a Wages Board for the mill men. This will be a great boon, but those of us who have had the facts brought under our notice know that the timber industry of Tasmania is not to-day in a position to pay the wages which honourable members would like to see paid. Were it a Melbourne or Sydney industry it would be But because it is a bush industry, and its representatives do not fill the Queen's Hall, lobbying for assistance, it does not receive the attention which is its due. When the proposal of the honourable member for Hume was under discussion, the Prime The largest and one of the best Minister saidI f we are to have Protection, let us have Proattention to the pioneer who is doing so much to open up the country. I ask him if the pioneer has ceased to do this ? I ask the Minister of Home Affairs, who then pleaded so eloquently for the industry in his district, what has changed his attitude? The honourable member for Herbert then urged that the men working in the bush should receive as much consideration as those working in the factories. The timber used in Broken Hill alone, if produced in Australia instead of being imported, would be sufficient to give constant employment to 1,000 men. We have been dealing with various anomalies, and have been granting Protective duties to assist such magnificent industries as those of vinegar making, and cardboard and matchmaking. We spent some hours early this morning in Every bit of timber in the determining what encouragement should be given to the great industry of hemming pocket handkerchiefs, yet we find many honourable members are unprepared to give any consideration to a great rural industry which, if properly developed, must provide employment to many thousands of men.

These men, as the result of the imposition of Protective duties, have to pay increased prices for everything they use, yet are denied a full measure of Protection for the industry in which they are engaged. Last year we imported timber valued at over £2,500,000. Such an importation in respect of any other industry would have led at once to an outcry that Protection had failed, and that increased duties were necessary. With the exception of tobacco, spirits, and one or two other items, in no case did our importations last year reach this level. Our own timber getting industry is being practically knocked out by the imported article, and yet the Committee, apparently, is not prepared to grant assistance to it.

As was pointed out on a previous occasion, to comply with the request of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat would be to penalize the mining industry, which is of far greater importance to Australia than is that of timber-getting. The honourable member, for Darling, who is familiar with the timber-getting industry of Tasmania, and also with the mining industry, tells me that even if we granted all that the honourable member for Franklin has asked, we should not benefit Tasmania to the extent of a pound, whereas we should seriously penalize the mining industry-of the Commonwealth. The use of Oregon in the Broken Hill mines is a matter of life and death to the miners concerned, yet the honourable member for Franklin would have a heavy duty imposed upon it. A special class of timber is necessary for making butter boxes. It must be free from resin In Tasmania, for seven or eight and sap, which would be quickly absorbed by the butter, and it is found that New Zealand white pine is the most suitable. Then, again, the fruit-growing industry requires special consideration. Whilst fruit growers are too individualistic to reap the full advantage that is obtainable from a little co-operation, that is no reason why we should punish them by placing a heavy impost on the timber they require for fruit cases. Large quantities of timber are also used in making the crates in which rabbits are exported, so that we should penalize yet another industry by complying with tlie request made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. would be only about i d . per box. tional impost would make a very serious engaged in the timber trade in that city",137,Tariff

Hudson Brothers were the pioneers of those enterprises, and other firms have developed a large trade. Now it is proposed, by means of the Tariff, to penalue, not only these firms and their employees, but the poorer sections of the community who are endeavouring to get homes of their own. A t the same time, it does not appear to me that the Tariff will confer £ 1 of benefit on the mill-owners of Tasmania or elsewhere. I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of making some further concessions. The original Tariff permitted the development of new interests; and, if a great injustice is not to be done, we shall have to allow the duties to remain as they were. If the Minister cannot be brought to take that view, I hope the Committee will give me their support. sire to say a few words in case the Minister or the' Committee are influenced by the Statements of the honourable member for Franklin. There are many reasons why Tasmanian hardwood cannot be used at BrokenH ill , Kalgoorlie, and other inland places. The first is that the weight makes it impossible to pay the freight with profit, and, further, the cost of handling in the stopes is too high. The mine-owners are to-day paying a bigger price for oregon than for Tasmanian hardwood; and that fact, in itself, is sufficient proof that the market is open to the latter at any time. Tasmanian hardwood shrinks f-inch in 10 inches, and twists into all shapes when exposed to the heat of the sun in the interior. I am speaking with authority, since, for a period of two years, I had the contract for timbering the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company's mine. During that time, owing to a scarcity of Oregon, Tasmanian hardwood was tried; but the expense proved so great that the mine-owners never desire to see it again. The honourable member for Franklin has told us that the men who procure this wood are wet through from morning until night; and we may well ask ourselves what sort of haulage this means and over, 2s. per 100 feet. to the horses and bullocks. We cannot expect work to be done at reasonable rates in a country like that, and, therefore, the Another point to be remembered in mine-owners, in view of the nature of the wood, cannot afford to pay the price. The honourable member also told us that some £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 00 worth of soft wood is imported each year; but we must remember that this wood is used for ceilings, linings, 1 floorings, and a variety of purposes for class now under consideration. which Tasmanian hardwood is entirely unsuitable. The difference in the railway freight alone would make it impossible to use Tasmanian hardwood for the mines at BrokenH ill ; and if honourable members had the handling of a 7-ft. length of 10 inch x 10 inch in a mine, they would realize the truth of what I am now saying. I hope the Minister will not be influenced by "" h if a l u t in "" or pathetic appeals. This Tasmanian hardwood has been produced for thirty or forty years; and yet we are told that last week one of the biggest mills was sold at 7s. in the £ 1 . lian firm has bought the mill in order that this hardwood may take the place of jarrah. they have purchased the mill for the sake I deof the machinery. I hope the Minister will revert to the old Tariff, which was carefully thought out, and not press his proposal on the Committee. the representative of, perhaps, the largest timber district in Australia, I should like to say a few words, more especially as I have been referred to by more than one member as advocating a higher duty. When the timber duties were being considered in the first Tariff. I contended that some Protection was necessary to put the industry on its feet, and keep it there. At the present time, although I represent a. timber constituency, in which, beyond Cairns and along the coast, there are many millions of feet of pine, hickory, and so forth, I do not advocate a higher duty. This timber is the raw material of several other trades; and it cannot be made dutiable without penalizing those trades. The building industry, at the present time, is suffering heavily; and all the timber and saw-mills in Queensland are unable to supply local requirements, much less develop an export trade. During my last election campaign I visited Atherton, and some people interested in the numerous saw-mills there were in favour of the imposition",138,Tariff

I understand that the interests affected are going to be protected by the Minister, but the point I wish to urge is that honourable members representing butter -districts and timber districts where the mills are not able to supply existing requirements combined to ignore the requirements of the building trade of the great cities of Australia. The positions of tens of thousands of workmen in those cities will be jeopardized as the result of the callous selfishness displayed by those gentlemen during the last few minutes. Under the arrangement I made with the Minister the idea was to test the question as between the old Tariff and his present proposal; but it was denied all over the Chamber that the division was being taken on that point. I protest against that way of transacting business. Some honourable members appear to be anxious to take a vote immediately on the Minister's amendment, and one urgent reason why it should be assented to at once is that, if it is not accepted without delay, We. shall have some more whispers going round the Committee to mislead members, and, perhaps, jeopardize still further the interests of the workmen of Australia.

Under paragraph B of. the old Tariff all New Zealand pine was allowed to come in at the 6d. rate. By the vote just taken, that is limited to New Zealand white pine, and all the other pines which have been coming in heretofore, and being used by fruit box-makers, and in the housebuilding trade,, and in a hundred and one other industries, have been shut out. The butter men, as soon as they secured the admission of the particular white pine in which they were interested, went over to the other side and knocked out all the other interests which I have enumerated. I am' disappointed that men should be so selfish as to consider only their particular interests, and to refuse consideration to much bigger ones.

Speaking for myself, I know nothing of it. I came into the chamber only just before the vote was taken, and asked you, Mr Chairman, what the question was. You said that it was the acceptance of the proposition made by the Minister some time this morning in connection with white pine. I therefore gave my vote without consulting any one.

The Minister said at the opening of the discussion that he believed that the proposal I before us would give effect to the intention of Parliament when originally imposing timber duties. We cannot get locally timber suitable for the purposes for which New Zealand white pine is used. That is the true Protectionist stand-point, and I gave a Protectionist vote.

In those days we had practically no building industry in any of the States, whereas we now have all-round prosperity. It is true that people are building largely in the suburbs of Sydney, as well as in practically every large city in Australia, but the demand for more house accommodation, is due to the fact that, as the result of our Protectionist policy, ample employment is offering. A great deal of our increased prosperity is also attributable, as I am reminded, to Labour legislation, and that legislation would not have been possible without a Protectionist Tariff. I hope that honourable members will adhere to the item. honourable member for Capricornia is quite right in attributing the great increase in the building trade in the capital cities of Australia to Protection and Labour legislation. The Almighty has been encouraged by Tariffs and Labour legislation to grant beneficent seasons to Australia, and, in that way, production and enterprise have been increased throughout the Commonwealth. Buti f we are to have Protection, why not have it all round ?

Having .already voted on this question, it is really, in my opinion, a waste of time to pursue it further. the honourable member is in order in saying that I am wasting the time of the Committee in moving an amendment which is to test the opinion of honourable members on a question which it is claimed has not been properly decided. tary to say that an honourable member is wasting the time of the Committee.

1143,Mr Sampson,"We ought to haveask honourable members on his own side ! given to us on this point during the debate; posed, and another wants more protection. and we ought to be very careful before we impose a duty of this kind. There are quite enough revenue duties at the present time. The Protectionist section of the Tariff Commission investigated this matter very exhaustively, and, only three years ago, they came to a unanimous conclusion that they could not recommend a duty on spokes and felloes. What has transpired since to warrant a 10 per cent, duty on such an important item of raw material? and Customs) [5.1.5]--The rate has not been imposed by the Government as a revenue duty'. There is a carriage woodware factory at a place called Nundah. near Brisbane. seventy men are working there under good conditions, and turning out a first-class article. I'admit that the company are not satisfied with the duty which has been imposed, but the Cabinet considered that as they had made a start without any protection, a duty of 10 per cent, would give them a chance of becoming established. The Government think it would not be fair to impose the duty of 25 or 30 per cent., which the company desired, as they would not be able to turn out all the matemill there, working, I believe, full time, rial required in the near future. am surprised that, when we ask for a small duty to develop our industries, Victorian members should object to it as a rsvenue duty. mation. given it. If the honourable member is in want of any of the articles of which he spoke, the manager of the establishment, who will be passing through Victoria shortly, will take orders for any number of spokes, felloes, or other carriage ware. They are manufactured at the factory, under the very best conditions of labour. Principally Australian timber is used, or, at any rate, they are anxious to use it. While the duty is not as large as I wanted, it is something. The company would be quite satisfied with a duty of 15 per cent. Will the Minister make the rate 15 per cent. (General Tariff), and 10 per cent. (United Kingdom)? [TS6]-2 cannot do so. member says the duty ought not to be imThe industry is developing, and will grow, and, no doubt, it will come again. cannot be considered high. The industry is growing very slowly. Will the Minister put on record his interpretation of the words "" in the rough,"" in paragraph DD?

He never uses a stick of it until it has been reasoned for three years, and that is why his undertaking has been so successful. The forest covers 70,000 acres, and comprises asfinetimber as exists, perhaps, 111 the world. Although it is a long way from, the market, there is a sawmaking felloes, oars, and other articles for which timber which can stand a great strain is required. The undertaking has to compete against a great deal of opposition, and carts its supplies immense distances, but still it survives, and is the commencement of a great industry in Australia. I understand that a similar industry has been developed to a great extent in Queensland. The honourable member for Wimmera need not be at all alarmed about our not having timber to take the place of the imported. We only need railway communication and quick transit to make our timber as cheap as it can be obtained from any part of the world, and then, with a good duty placed on imported timbers, the industry would be a good thing for the country. Neither in America nor Canada did I see timbers to be compared with those of Australia. We have not commenced to realize the valua of our timbers. We do not prize them, and do not stop their destruction as we should-. It was a crying shame that an immense quantity of beautiful timber on th?.

In the last Tariff, Parliament altered the term "" superface "" to ""super, feet"" everywhere, except in paragraph T of item 303. We propose to put the whole of *he timber duties on a uniform basis, and, instead of having one kind of timber measured superface and all the others measured super, feet, we have made paragraph T subject to super, feet measurement, and increased the rate from, 2s. 6d. to 5s., which brings out exactly the same effect, because we are going to measure now only one side, whereas previously in that case we measured on two sides.

I think that dolls, dressed and undressed, should be admitted duty free, because there is no factory here for the making of dolls, and none for the making of dolls' clothing. The departmental officers have had a great deal of trouble, and many disputes with importers, because of the difficulty of determining whether a. doll is dressed or undressed. A duty of 1.00 per cent, on dressed dolls would not prevent their importation. dolls are imported undressed, because children like to make dresses for their dolls. thing is gained by levying 25 per cent, on the remaining 10 per cent, of the dolls which are brought here.

This is a very unwise proposal. These musical instruments have done much to educate our public, and give a great deal of pleasure in domestic and social circles. When honourable members are worked up -to a white heat, as they were for a short time this afternoon, the playing of a Melba or Dani record would have such a soothing influence that an atmosphere surcharged with electricity would soon be peaceful and calm again. Music, by touching the sensitive chords of our nature, awakens its better feelings, and elevates our sentiments as nothing else can.

I therefore move:Taat the following words be added to subftem D :"" and on. and after 14th December, 1911, 5 per cent, and free."" wish only to suggest to the Minister one or two considerations that may have escaped him. First of all, the proposal to differentiate between gramaphones, so as to bring the better class under a duty equal to that applying to furniture generally, and, on the other hand, the cheaper articles, which are not brought out in cabinets, may lead himi into an error. The importation of the higher priced talking machines is not very large, and it is questionable whether it would be worthwhile collecting Phonographs, and what is undoubtedly a purely revenue duty. The better the gramaphone the better the investment, and wealthy people are not the for Talking Machines, only class who invest in the better class of instruments. About 25 per cent, of the total purchasers are buying high-priced machines on the deferred payment system. As Postmaster-General the present Minister of External Affairs was frequently met with', requests for a telephone to be placed on the back door of every settler. The mere fact talking machines, that a man was a pioneer, or an out-back' settler, in .the opinion of many persons, entitled him to a telephone. But as a solace to a man in the bush, which is likely to be the better acquisitiona reasonably cheap gramaphone or an expensive telephone? This is an item that affects the working community, and I suggest that the Minister might well allow it to remain as in the existing Tariff. This will be a purely revenue duty, and, according to the honourable member for Hume, a revenue duty is an anomaly. does not protect is an anomaly. view will only support my request we shall have no further difficulty.

IRVINE I advise the Minister to take what power he thinks necessary for ascertaining the actual value of the cases, quite independently of the estimates of the importers; let him preserve to himself by regulation, or otherwise, the fullest authority in this regard.

The Minister would be perfectly safe to make the duties on ordinary bicycle tyres what they were previously, at the ad valorem rates. I come now to motor bicj'cle tyres, which are also at fixed rates. A tyre' like the Triumph, 26 inches by 2% inches, weighing from 6 to 7 lbs., has a wholesale value in London of 15s. The duty on that cover, at is. 6d. per lb., would come to at least 9s. under the general Tariff. Those t5'res are now sold to the trade in Australia at 23s., or less than cost and duty amount to. The ad valorem rates previously worked out at 3s. 3d. (United Kingdom), and 4s. (General Tariff), on a 15s. tyre. It would be desirable to have sufficient competition with motor bicycle tyres from abroad to regulate the price more or Jess. It would be advisable either to reduce the poundage rate on them, so as to arrive at a reasonable fixed duty, for it will be agreed that 9s. is not a fair duty on a 15s. article, or impose ad valorem rates.

The fixed duty will shut this. SQit of tyre out. The public interest requires that we should endeavour to make some industrial use of the motor trade, which, in Australia, is at present almost entirely a luxury. In every old established country in the world the motor trade is of great industrial value. A census recently taken in London showed that 97 per cent, of the traffic in the biggest thoroughfare was motor traffic. With a due regard to Australian industries, such as the Dunlop Rubber Company, we ought to keep our eyes constantly Open for means of making extensive but I am afraid the tendency of the poundage rate will be to keep out the pioneers of the cheap resilient tyres. I am pleased to be able to endorse almost every remark of the honourable member for Wentworth regarding pneumatic rubber tyres for the push bicycle. It would be far better for the Government to revert to the old rates of 25 per cent. (General Tariff) and 20 per cent. (United Kingdom). The average weight of covers is from about i j lbs, to 2 lbs. The item, as it affects -motor tyres, can be left as it is. My information regarding the weight of motor bicycle tyres is somewhat at variance with the case quoted by the honourable member. He spoke of a certain standard tyre that weighs a little heavier than the others, but some motor bicycle tyres run about 4 lbs. in weight, which would lessen the amount of the fixed duty. The honourable member and I were evidently making similar in-quiries in London regarding compositions for tyres. I was able to render a slight service to the representative of a big American firm, Who are exploiting a deposit of what is known as mineral rubber, and he told me that a compound of three-quarters mineral rubbei and one-quarter pure Para rubber'gave better results than Para rubber alone, although, in certain cases, it could not be used. He estimated that ultimately the compound would be sold to the world at 2^d. per lb. At present, its price is 6d. per lb. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p-m. [7.45] -It seems to me that we are on the -eve of big deveioomenrs in connection with powdered motor traction, not only for the conveyance of goods on streets and roads, but for ""Surgical"" the word "" ;ut-sheet"" station and farm work. In this matter we are far behind the Old World, where motor traction has largely replaced horse traction, and, being a country of magnificent distances, anything that will enable us to get from point to point more quickly and cheaply will be of great advantage to the community. I am afraid that the Minister, in providing against administrative difficulties, may be penalizing the users of push bieycles and motor bicycles, these vehicles having been largely substituted for horses by shearers and many other workers. According to the honourable member for Wentworth, the riders of push bicycles will be penalized to the extent of is. 8d. or 2s. a tyre, and of motor cycles to the extent of use of motor traction, about gs. on the cheaper tyres. The position might be met by imposing a duty of so much a pound on motor car tyres, and an ad valorem duty, as at present, on bicycle and motor cycle tyres. and Customs) [7.49] -The suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth is, I understand, that bicycle tyres shall be charged ad valorem, and other tyres over 2J lbs. in weight, and tubes over i lb. in weight, at a fixed rate of so much a pound, or ad valorem. have to be much reduced if it is to apply to bicycle tyres, unless they are.to be taxed out of the market. they will not be seriously affected.

The Protection now afforded by the Tariff on rubber goods is not great, having regard to the wages paid, and the duties on chemicals and other ingredients used in the process of manufacture. A duty on reclaimed rubber would seriously affect our manufacturers, and, as reclaimed rubber is practically on the same footing as masticated rubber, it should, like it, be admitted free. Dunlop Company is turning out tons of reclaimed rubber every week. and reclaimed rubber are imported from the plantations, and I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the advisability of placing them both on the free list, as the statements which I have made are based on good authority. -This seems to be a revenue duty rather than a proposal to give any encouragement to the production of rubber in Australia. I shall not, however, discuss that phase of the question. Papua efforts are being made, with considerable promise of success, to develop the rubber industry, but that imports from that territory are treated as if they came from a foreign country, no preference being allowed in respect of them. There should be a closer commercial relationship between the Commonwealth and Papua, and, since it is proposed under this item to allow a preference of 5 per cent, in the case of imports from the United Kingdom, I suggest that a similar preference should be allowed in respect of imports from Papua. ports from Papua free? were in need of revenue from this so: , e,and therefore did not ask for more :han a preference of 5 per cent. amazed at the remarks of the honourable member for Calare. It would seem to me that we need a political schoolmaster, whose task it would be to inform honourable members of their duty to the Commonwealth, the Labour party, and the wage earners' interests. I do not understand how those who believe in keeping Australia for the white races could possibly favour the free admission of the black-labour products of Papua. Those who go to Papua to exploit the native labour should be called upon to pay the highest duty on their products when they are brought into the Commonwealth. The minimum rate of wages paid to the natives is ios. per month, and rations. They are paid, however, only once in two years, and the natives sometimes are so badly treated that they leave their employment at the end of twelve months, with the result that no wages are received by them. The adoption of the suggestion just made would mean the thin edge of the wedge for preferential rates in respect of the produce of those who were recently described as our fellow British-Indian subjects. Hoards of Indians are employed at 3d. per day in producing certain commodities, and some gentlemen who have extraordinary ideas concerning Imperialism would ask us to allow those commodities to come in under the preferential rate. alogy between Papua and India. am' not prepared to grant any preference to the product of an. industry in which I understand that in the rates of pay and conditions of labour are not the same as those which' Australian employers are called upon to observe. Whilst our Tariff has been responsible for a good deal of our prosperity, it will have to be increased to the verge of 100 per cent, before we shall be able to keep out black-labour commodities produced by capitalists who go to India, China, Java, and Japan to secure cheap labour. to endorse the views expressed by the honourable member for Kooyong in reference to",151,Division Xii Leathe R And Rubber

The amount of work expended on hides to bring them into the condition specified under (he proposition of the Government is very small and usually considered unimportant, but to our industry and the public the imposition of such a duty is very serious. To our industry, because we have put in an expensive plant, erected extensive buildings, and laid in f u l l stocks of materials for the treatment of such hides, which embraces the tanning, currying, and enamelling :Why the Minister should aim a destructive blow at an established industry in his own State is more than I can comprehend :To the public, because they will be forcedto pay higher prices for an inferior grade of leather to that which we have been able to put on the market, whilst such hides have been imported free of duty. The benefit to be conferred upon the worker by the imposition of such a duty is hardly worth consideration, for we can assure you that the cost of un-hairing,. fleshing, and splitting hides does not exceed the sum of is. gel. per hide, and this work could be carried out by our present staff. Our reason for not doing this class of work is that the selection of hides in Australia (where no regard is paid to the branding or the flaying of the hides) is such that it practically makes it impossible for an industry like ours to be carried on successfully. This forced us to investigate the matter and ascertain what could be done in New Zealand, where more care is exercised: in the branding and flaying, and the hides are I only hope his attitude to-day is also more uniform and freer from other defects, such as scars, cuts, & c , and after incurring;",153,Division Xii Leathe R And Rubber

The fact of these hides being duty free has also enabled us to supply very large quantities of the finished article in competition with the outside world to the various States and also New Zealand. The imposition of a duty as proposed by the Ministry means the annihilation of our industry, for it will be impossible for us to carry on as the average Australian hides offering at the present time will not suit our purpose, having far too many blemishes owing to being badly and excessively branded, carelessly flayed, and f u l l of cuts, scratches, and scars, and until legislation is brought into existence compelling greater care in connection with this-on e of our natural products-a n alteration cannot be hoped for. Therefore, to impose this duty can hardly be considered iii the interests of the public, as it will confer an advantage on no one, but will force out of existence a growing industry and compel the users of high class leather to import their requirements. The labour expended 00 these hides after we receive them from New Zealand costs considerably over 15s. per hide in wages paid, which are based upon rates much higher than those determined uppn by the Wages Boards in connection with the Tanners and Curriers! industry, and the proposed duty means sacrificing the whole of this, besides preventing the public from obtaining the high-grade leather we are enabled to manufacture by virtue of being able to secure a special selection of skins, for practically no gain to the worker, seeing that, as previously stated, the amount of wages paid for the preparing of the hides in the mannei referred to in the proposed Tariff does not exceed is. gd. per hide.

I have not seen the writer, nor do I know any member of the firm personally.

Of late, we have heard him pleading for the poor tenant, the poor tenant farmer, and the poor widow, but we are getting used to it. The people the honourable member really has in his mind are the poor importers. These hides are at present being brought largely from New Zealand, fleshed, haired, and limed. I should like the honourable member for Hume to hear the other side of this question, because I am surprised at such a staunch Protectionist saying that this duty would mean the crushing out of people engaged arid splitting hides in Australia, and therefore likely item, than there are people who will be injured by it. greater care and regard for those engaged in the work of this country. The importations of hides from New Zealand, limed, unhaired, split, and ready for tanning, does away with the lime-jobbers and beamsmen, and throws out of employment pit and tan-yard hands. tanneries in Victoria which have spent thousands of pounds on machinery for the splitting of hides. According to the memorandum read by the honourable member for Lang, the.hides needed for special work cannot be obtained in Victoria and New South Wales; but I know several tanneries which for many years have used such hides exclusively. about every 150 local hides, some fifty are described as culls. pickled hides from New Zealand will throw out of work the men who are employed to prepare these culls. According to the honourable member for Lang, the work done 011 the imported hides costs only about is.. 6d. a hide. ninepence. ficial view shows that it costs more like 4s. appeal is in the interest of an established The tanneries I have in mind pay their industry.

To allow only 2d. Minister to reduce it to 2s. or 3s. for the labour on limes and other treatment would be absurd, but this would bring the total to over 3s. In my opinion, the lowest rate of duty should be 4s. I know that the proprietor of a tannery offered to let a contract to another tannery to do certain hides for 3s., so that obviously they cannot be done for less. It is the hide-tanners principally whom the proposal affects, and whom we, as Protectionists, should consider, seeing that they employ twice as much labour as the side-tanners. More harm will be done by injuring those engaged in the' tanning of hides than by injuring the handful engaged our industries. We have more in the tanning of sides. My opinion is that in hairing, fleshing, any duty that does not protect is an anomaly, and I hope that the Minister will to benefit by the reconsider his proposal. In my introductory remarks, I selected this industry to show how difficult it is for the Committee to deal with conflicting statements. The remarks of the honourable member for Lang were based on good authority, and similar information was supThere are plied to me, but they were flatly contradicted by the honourable member for Indi. According to the representations made to me, the duty would strike a blow at a well established industry, employing a large number of men. It would seem strange that our tanners should have to import hides from New Zealand, but the fact is that the legislation of the Dominion regarding the branding and flaying of hides prevents scars and blemishes. Government is now taking the matter in hand.

1249,Mr Parker Moloney,"The Victorianone will accuse me of inconsistency in regard to Protection. I believe in Protection which protects, and in dealing fairly with all concerned in an industry. I would not play into the hands of a combination which was taking all the benefits of an inthat special purpose, and can use the dustry and crushing out others. I have known the head of the firm to which reference has been made for twenty-five years, and can thoroughly rely on the information that he gives me. There is no better Protectionist in the country than he is. There are in existence two other firms which I am credibly informed are in combination. Mr J. P. Howe, the gentleman to whom I refer, was originally employed by one of them, and was subsequently induced to accept employment with the other firm, and helped to build up its business. Later on, he entered into business on his own account, and in competition with the two firms with which he was formerly associated, and which carry on business at Beechworth and Preston. mand of capital, they have introduced into their tanneries what are known as splitting machines; but the struggling firm has not sufficient capital to be able 1fo do so. It speak, of each other, and they talked for will, consequently, have to pay this duty of an hour over it. 5s. per hide, whereas its competitors, having their own splitting machines, can bring in the hides whole, and split them here. A duty of 5s. per hide would absolutely destroy the struggling firm. I am credibly informed that it would mean, with respect to that firm, an impost of about £,7$o per annum. I am also credibly informed that the Beechworth tannery was established because the proprietors knew that by going into the country, they would not have to observe the award of a Wages Board. They thought also that since rents would be cheaper in a country town, it would not be necessary to pay dieir employee's such high wages as must be paid in the metropolis. worth before the Wages Board was appointed. posed to a Wages Board being appointed. The process of splitting is a very simple one. A hide having been limed, fleshed, and haired is put through the splitting machine, and the cost of the labour involved is very trifling. Under this item, a hide introduced into the Commonwealth in two portions is dutiable, but if it is brought in whole, it is free. The struggling firm to which I have alluded deals with only one particular class of manufacture, and any portion of a hide not required for that special line 5s absolutely wasted. The combined firms, however, can utilize whatever proportion of a hide they require for balance in the production of other qualities of high class leather. They are therefore in a better position than is the other firm. The honourable member for Indi and the honourable member for Kooyong said that the cost of the labour involved in splitting these hides varied. Mr Howe states that it costs is. 9d. to lime, flesh, hair, and split a hide, but the honourable member for Indi has produced figures showing that the cost amounts to 3s. or 4s. per hide. me, and practically agreed, as a compromise, to a duty of 2s. or 3s. member will agree to a reduction of the duty to 2s., 1 shall have nothing more to Having comsay. 2s. per hide, and the other a duty of 3s. I brought them within a shilling, so to the interview, but Mr Thomas Broadhurst, a tanner in a large way of business at Murray-road, Preston, writesI have seen the pickled hides under discussion, and I reckon the cost of labour on the same to be amply covered by is. 9d. or is. iod. per hide. Mr W. Braithwaite, another tanner, carrying on business at Preston, writesRe cost of lining, splitting and pickling hides I have had experience only with sides, and the cost incurred for labour is about one shilling per hide-certainl y no more. Whole hides I should estimateat from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, extra. If I had a splitting machine of suitable size I would certainly like to undertake the work at that price. Those letters are an answer to the honourable member for Indi. So far as I know, the two firms to which I previously referred are the only tanners in this State who have splitting machines, and they will not sell split hides to the third firm, save at such a price as renders it impossible to buy from them. The net result of the passing of this duty will be that Messrs. Howe and Company, who are employing twenty-three hands, will have to close down, and the public will not be advantaged, since the other two firms will have a monopoly",156,Tariff Amendment Divisio Nxii Leather

1256,Mr Chanter,"I was not present atof the business. I do not agree with the honourable member for Lang that we should make the item free, but if the Minister would agree to reduce the duty from 5s. to 2s. per hide, I should be satisfied. It would be an act of justice to this firm, enhere and buy our best hides. The Minister abling A. to expand its business, and to increase the number of its employees. is involved in the work of preparing these hides. during the temporary absence of the honourable member that having explained the matter to the Committee, surely does not intend to go over it again. for nearly thirty-six hours. before during this debate, and I do not think the Prime Minister ought to chide me. I have given the Government every assistance, and this, perhaps, is the only item in which I take a special interest, because of my own personal knowledge of the facts. Will the honourable member for Indi guarantee that these two firms will not only split these hides at is., but will supply J. P. Howe and Company? Is it not part of the game of these two firms to prevent Messrs. Howe and Company continuing in competition? This duty is not protective, though it may bring in a certain amount of revenue, and with that I do not quarrel; but, in fairness to myself and Protectionists in general, the Minister ought to reduce this duty to 2s. There is a good deal more in this question than the splitting of hides. The remarks of the honourable member for Indi only go to show that we should be very careful in accepting statements made by parties interested. I am as anxious as any one to assist industries by means of protective duties; but I can remember a deputation of the tanners and curriers of Queensland waiting on the then Prime Minister, the honourable member for Ballarat, with a request for an export duty on Australian hides, and a subsequent deputation to the rjresent Minister of Trade and Customs with a similar request. years ago, during my previous term of office. complaining of the price of hides; and certainly not long ago I saw paid for one. Of course, I rejoice at this state of affairs so far as rural industries are concerned; but we are told that the tanning industry is languishing, and that the Japanese come of Trade and Customs now proposes an import duty on the tanners' raw material. -with no work done on them they are admitted free, but they pay a duty if any work has been done. tion ! I believe that both the honourable member for Indi and other honourable members who have spoken are perfectly honest in their representations; and they are only getting a little of the experience we had over the first Tariff. This is a most unsatisfactory method of dealing with Tariff questions; and I contend that there ought to be some sort of tribunal for sifting statements of the kind. particular trouble to myself is that the conflicting elements to the dispute are in my constituency. A little matter of that kind, however, does not affect my judgment, because, with all other honourable members, the only considerations that weigh with me are national and patriotic. The honourable member for Calare thinks there ought to be a Tariff board to consider the facts and give a judgment, by which this Chamber would loyally abide. But would it? Not in the least. We should dispute the judgment of the board just as we are disputing the judgment of the Minister. I have been surprised at the attftude of the honourable member for Kooyong right through the debate, for he appears to be a very different person from the Robert Best who at one time dealt with Tariff questions in Fitzroy. The disputing parties are both manufacturers, and solid Protectionists, but one desires a duty, while the other does not. Their statements having been duly weighed by the Minister, he originally proposed a duty of 5s.; but, having heard other arguments, he comes to the conclusion that he had better split the difference, and make it 3s. Men who are most intimate with all the details of the situation, and whose interests are bound up with the industry, cannot agree: and how can we be expected to agree? Under the circumstances, the Minister, like a Solomon, splits the difference as best he can, only I think he",157,Tariff Amendment Divisio Nxii Leather

Will not the duty, be higher on the raw material ih;::r on the manufactured article? come out in the bulk, and be cut up here, boxes, except a few folding boxes, cannot be imported, as a general rule, and the bulk of the boxes used in Australia are made in Australia. They have a natural Protection, which the strawboard industry does not possess. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [9.43] Strawboard is in a somewhat similar position to several other items that have caused a good deal of trouble. We were faced with a similar state of things in regard to hides, which were the raw material for a local industry, and which are also produced in Australia. There was a desire to impose a duty on the imports from New Zealand for protective purposes, and a consequent conflict between the two interests. A similar position arose in the case of New Zealand timber, which was the raw material used in the fruit case and butter boxdown by the importer from whom he making industries. Although the timber resources of Australia are almost unlimited, New Zealand white pine was specially dealt with in the interest of those two industries. Strawboard is the raw material of the cardboard box-making industry, which employs about 5,000 persons in Australia, whereas the making of strawboard employs only about fifty. The duty of 2s. is equal to 40 per cent, on lined strawboard, and to 50 per cent, on unlined strawboard, while the duty on cardboard boxes is only 30 per cent., so that the finished article has from 10 to 20 per cent, less protection than the raw material. Mr the existing McDougall, the managing proprietor of the Broadford Strawboard Mills, when examined before the Tariff Commission on the 16th March, 1906, admitted that the cost off importing a ton of strawboard was 32s. It has been said by the Minister that the duty on cardboard boxes is almost nominal, because it is practically impossible to import-them by reason of their bulkiness, and"" their liability to be damaged by handling. If the price of cardboard boxes was increased to any extent, the confectionery shops, pastry cooks, and other businesses, would cease to use them, and would take to paper bags instead. I had samples, which I have mislaid, of imported and local strawboard, and there is no comparison between them. strawboard was shown to the honourable member by an interested person. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member will, no doubt, have something to say on behalf of other interested persons, and he may be able to show a better sample. The makers of cardboard boxes are put to so much expense and inconvenience in importing strawboard, that they would use the local article if it would in any measure serve their purpose. They have suffered great annoyance and incurred considerable expense by reason of the fact that, at times, importations which they thought would be dutiable at certain rates have been declared by the Customs authorities to be dutiable at other rates. A little while ago I saw the Minister, in regard to a, decision about the classification of a certain importation, and found that the Australian representative of the foreign firm, who had sold it, had afterwards secretly given the Customs Department another classification. In reality the cardboard box-maker concerned was being taken bought, and a good deal of fraud takes place in connection with the importation of paper generally. watched.",159,Dlvisiox Xiii

The ex-Leader of the Labour Party, the Honourable J. C. Watson, is a high Protectionist, but, speaking on this subject on the 19th September, 1906, he saidI think that the Minister might consider whether there is not room for an amendment of this item in regard to strawboard. Only a few minutes ago he stated that a very large proportion of the strawboard which is listed as coming from Great Britain is of Continental manufacture. I am informed upon very good authority that absolutely the whole of it comes mother country, I understand, there is not a single factory which produces strawboard. These are reasons why we should defer the consideration of this question until the recommendations of the Tariff Commission are before us. If strawboard were manufactured in Great Britain, I should be quite willing to support the imposition of a preferential duty. ment proposal as an instalment of justice to the combine? ing justice now. I think the Minister ought to reconsider the matter; and if he is not inclined the price of those goods to the users. In to do so I shall most decidedly vote against the item. In August, 1907, again dealing with the matter he saidThe Government proposal is to increase the duty on strawboard from is. per cwt. to 2s. against the United Kingdom, and 2s. 6d. against the world. There is no strawboard manufactured in the United Kingdom, and we can therefore consider the item merely as a proposal that there should be a duty of 2s. 6d. per cwt. against the world. I should not object to the increased duty on strawboard if the local manuintroduced, up went the price of this strawfacturer, and there is only one in the Commonwealth, was content to supply his goods at the same price as he previously supplied them. He opposed the increase of the duty on representative of the Broadford factory, was before the Tariff Commission, he gave a solemn assurance that if he received the duty for which he asked,, he would be able to supply strawboard at the then prices. which he asked ? Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes. Before the introduction of the Mr J. H . CATTS -Tw o shillings and sixpence. The moment the Tariff was introduced, he put up the price of his strawboard to the extent of the higher duty. When the item was knocked out, he had to bring down his price once more. man who gave the honourable member that information told a lie. they are three Mr J. H . CATTS -My information is such that I am prepared to accept it. .1 I understand that have no desire to detain the Committee. Thirty-sixhours have elapsed since I entered this chamber, and I have been going pretty, constantly ever since. Indeed, I may say that I was afraid to go to sleep, because 1 thought that this item might be reached at any moment. I represent an electorate in which there are many factories ; but the proprietor of a cardboardbox factory was the only one to approach me in regard to this Tariff, and he begged me to ask Parliament to leave.them alone. I have been challenged regarding the stateprice of his strawboard to the level of the increased duty. merits of the duty? Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes. If we give an increase of duty to a manufacturer who already has sufficient Protection, and the moment he receives that increase he makes a corresponding rise in the price of his goods, the result is that we simply increase this case the action of the strawboard manufacturer in increasing his prices in many cases sent his goods out of use altogether. In reply to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, let me say that my authority for the statement.

When this matter was under consideration in the Senate in 1910, Senator Barker, of Victoria, who is a sound Protectionist, opposed an increase of duty on strawboard, upon the ground that the employees in the Broadford factory were not being treated fairly, and he stated that the owners of that factory had opposed the constitution of a Wages Board to regulate the conditions of the employees in the industry. According to Senator Barker, the employees in that factory are not being paid a fair and living wage at the present time. made? Mr J. H . CATTS -On 23rd November, 1910. the position is now. Mr J. H .

Is not the honourable member a believer in new Protection? Mr J. H . CATTS I am, and when we have power to provide for new Protection I shall be prepared to vote for Protection to the point of prohibition, in respect of anything that can be made in Australia. But the idea of new Protection is not to give the manufacturers statutory Protection, and to allow their employees to submit their claims to Wages Boards, where the factory owners will fight them to the last ditch, in their effort to obtain a bare living wage. Speaking in the Senate on 23rd November, 1910, Senator Barker saidI cannot support the Government proposal. to the forcing of this question by the GoI believe in the new Protection pure and simple. vernment. I rose to let the House know The less that is said about the condition of those who work in these mills the better. They are not getting fair wages, nor do they labourunder reasonable conditions. I shall vote against extending increased protection to our paper millsuntil they give their employees better treatment. To my own knowledge, they have refused to pay them a fair remuneration. They also opposed the establishment of a Wages Board in connection with the industry, and when the Wages Board Bill was before the Legislative Council of Victoria they petitioned it not to grant their employees a fair measure of justice. Senator STEWART -Perhaps they cannot afford to pay fair wages. Senator BARKER -But they can afford to pay good dividendsalthough it was in a position to do soAs a party the Labour party desire to give effect to the new Protection, which seeks to extend protection alike to the employ^ and the consumer as well as to the manufacturer. But here we are asked to grant an increased measure of protection to manufacturers without any regard to their treatment of their employees. I will not vote for increased protection to any industry in which sweating occurs. I have pointed out that this industry enjoys a considerable amount of natural protection, and that we are imposing duties up to 40 and 50 per cent, on the raw material of cardboard-box manufacturers, whereas the finished article is dutiable only at 30 per cent. I have pointed out, further, that, for the sake of fifty employ6s in one manufactory, the interests of 5,000 in the cardboard-box making industry are to be prejudiced; and my own knowledge of diat industry leads me to believe that, if we agree to this duty, we shall probably be putting 500 persons out of employment merely to grant increased Protection to a factory in which only fifty are employed. As there is a general desire to proceed toa division on this question, I shall resume my seat, knowing that, if necessary, I shall be able, at a later stage, to speak, again; but I appeal to honourable members to leave the Tariff as it is with regard to the item under consideration. [10.15] I believe that this item relates to the raw material of so many industries that it would be just as well not to interfere with the duty for which the existing Tariff provides. I should like, further, to say that I do not thank the Government for sopersistently forcing upon the Committee its own intentions and desires.

The Australian Paper Mills has an authorized capital of .£150,000; £107,000; 107,000, paid up to the limit of 20s.; the reserve fund is ,£15,769; the last dividend paid was ro per cent, per annum; and the share value, when this book was published some months ago, was 31s. A company like that must be regarded as being in an eminently nourishing position; and I think it highly desirable that these appear in Hansard. 1901-2, we had a close division on a motion ployment of 4,000 men will be jeoparby myself to make this duty 9d., as against dized. a proposal for 2s. The votes were thirty-three on each side; and if this Chamber was so equally poised, with all the facts We are often told that Protection raises before it, I hope honourable members will prices; but, as a matter of fact, prior to hesitate before they add 33 per cent, to the establishment of the Australian Paper the present rate.

To-day, however, the imported strawboard ? conditions are totally different, as is shown by the fact that the wages paid for a week of 48 hours are as follows : Machine men, 60s.; beater men, 60s.; breaker men, 48s.; the imported strawboard is very cheap.

1321,Mr Fenton,"I have no doubt thatwould be large customers of our farmers, who sometimes find straw a drug on the market. The honourable member for Corio says that there are 220 men employed; but we know that there are many indirectly connected with this industry. Like many others, I was not satisfied with the conditions at one time; but I would not be taking the stand I am to-night were I not satisfied that the employees now work under better conditions than previously in the paper mills of Victoria. industries of this class, those employed in strawboard making occupy a very good position. While we are advocating the interests of one particlar industry, we should be careful not to cast aspersions on other industries which it is our duty to also foster. I hope that in the next two or three years there will be sufficient mills to supply .other manufacturers with all the strawboard they require. The duty may induce other persons to invest in this industry. [10.28] -The honourable member for Cook seems to think that the best way to defeat this duty is to abuse the industry it is intended to assist. I might just as well retort that the cardboard industry he is trying to bolster up is one of the worse paid. Mr J. true if the honourable member did say so. ber objects to assertions of that k in d ; but he is not so particular about making them. The honourable member told us that there are thousands engaged in the cardboardbox industry, while very few are employed making strawboard. Is there any reason why the few should not be assisted if they are not interfering with the thousands? The honourable member contended that the strawboard made at the Australian Paper Mills is not as good as that imported. I doubt whether he is a judge. If he stays here during this week end, we shall give hun an opportunity of seeing the stuff produced here. Why should the box manufacturers and others object to encourage the local manufacture of strawboard, when they admit that it takes themall their time to import it? We have already one factory, and the Minister has assured us that machinery has arrived to start another. The honourable member for . Cook tried to make out that, after the duty was increased, the prices were raised. It is quite possible that at the start the imposition of a duty may raise the price, but it afterwards brings it down. I have here the price lists issued by the Australian Paper Mills Proprietary Limited, which have evidently not been prepared for tlie occasion. The first was issued on the 12th August, 1907, prior to the imposition of the duty in the last Tariff, and the figures prove conclusively that, from then until 1911, the prices, as a matter of fact, have come down. The Amongst the honourable member for Cook has accepted the statements of individuals who, out of sheer pique, are trying to bolster up their own industries at the expense of another. The most inveterate Free Trader would not refuse to assist an industry when it did not raise the prices. If we are only to protect industries in our own constituency, or our own State, we shall get into a very peculiar position. The honourable member attacked this industry, because it did not happen to be in New South Wales. It is nothing but a case of Sydney prejudice. The Victorian box-makers are not doing the growling, but we have had a gentleman from Sydney in the lobby all the week. The Sydney box manufacturers do not want to encourage the local product, and the honourable member for Cook believes anything they tell him. I hope the Committee will always give assistanceto an industry when it can be proved, as I can H . CATTS -It would not be prove in this case, that prices Save not been raised. should not have spoken, but for the extraordinary statement of the last speaker that an attempt is being made to ruin the strawboard industry. This is not a question of imposing a new duty in order to establish an industry. There is already a duty of 30s. per ton, and the shares of the company, which are of a nominal value of 20s., were selling yesterday at 27s. 3d., while the last dividend was 10 per cent. The Minister told us that, before a new company had any idea that an extra duty might be imposed, it was prepared to establish another mill. I am credibly informed that there are only fifty men employed in the existing mill in making strawboard. The others are engaged in paper making. We are, therefore, asked to give an increased duty to an industry for employing fifty men on a raw material that is used by cardboard makers who employ thousands. The proposition is most absurd, and I confidently leave it to the Committee to reject the increase.",163,Elliot Johnson H E Is So That The Firm Refused To Pay Good Wages

I desire to see ample Protection given to the manufacture of Australian pianos, but I do not think It seems ridiculous to protect the we ought to be asked to go on increasing duties without rhyme or reason. I hope that tlie Minister will be able to justify this item. It is not sufficient that we should keep on piling up duties unless they are serving some useful purpose, and I should like to know what is the necessity for the increase proposed in this case.

CATTS I might quote the honourable member on pianos. On a previous occasion he gave us some illuminating remarks upon the subject; and if his speech on that occasion were measured, it would be found that he occupied more time than I have taken up in dealing with this question. We should place on pianos and pianolas a sufficient Protection to enable the local industry to be thoroughly established and to carry on; but an absolutely prohibitive Tariff ought not to be imposed. musicians get more pleasure from certain makes of pianos than they do from others, and we should be taking a rather extreme course if we said to them, "" You shall be compelled either to buy a.make of piano that does not please you or to pay a heavy penalty for miking your own choice."" There are in Australia to-day two piano factories. New South Wales by Messrs. Beale and Company was established under Free Trade, and without any Tariff protection at all it has built up a very considerable business. There is good evidence that this industry, at the time when it first received Tariff assistance from this Parliament, could have carried on without any Tariff. The Government of the day, however, proffered assistance with a duty, and handicapped its competitors very considerably. Messrs. Beale and Company conducted their business for a few years under the operation of the first Federal Tariff, and expanded it to an almost unprecedented extent. Their balance-sheets, which have been quoted, show them to be in an exceedingly flourishing financial position, the result of the trade done by them in Australia. Tariff revision, the industry received the benefit of a 5 per cent, increase of duty; but it was granted on a very narrow voting margin. There seems to be some power behind the throne, and if it keeps on barracking and barracking for this factory, it will be absolutely impossible presently for some people to buy any other make of instrument. I have here a report of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the question of shortage of lahour in New South Wales, before which Mr Beale, the New South Wales manufacturer, gave evidence that there was a shortage of labour. My impressions from a hurried glance at his evidence are that he could not cope with any more business in his factory with the labour that he then employed, and that he could not get any more labour in Australia. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not know what he says now. We must remember a Tariff schedule is before Parliament. factory is capable of coping with a lot more work. Mr J. H . CATTS -The statement to which I have referred was made by him as Some recently as 27th June last. Why are we asked to increase the duty on pianos ? Is it because the industry is languishing?

The position, however, will be that, whereas the talking machine itself will come in at a lower rate of duty than the case in which it is contained, the whole of the piano will be charged at the higher rate.

I agree with the honourable member for Cook that there must be some curious secret influence at work enabling these two manufacturers of pianos to obtain special concessions, and win considerable advantages at the expense of the community. Why is it that Mr Wertheim and Mr Beale have their tools of trade admitted free, while the tool of trade of the music teacher is taxed 35 per cent. ? Right through the schedule the tools of trade of individuals are admitted free, or at a very nominal rate. music teachers who earn less and woVk longer hours than the poorest paid labourer in the community. Why should those teachers be taxed extortionately in order to add to the enormous profits of those two monopolists? They come to this Chamber with absolute lies, as can be proved. One of them says in his circular that he is paying in wages on a piano more than the total cost of the article elsewhere. As a matter of fact, there is no very startling difference between the wages here and in Great Britain. I have it on information that cannot be attacked that piano stringers here are paid 2s. 9d. an instrument, and that not more than three instruments can be dealt with by an operative in one day. In Great Britain a similar workman is paid 40s. to 50s. a week; polishers, 35s. to 40s.; markers off, 40s. to 50s. j finishers, 50s. to 60s.; regulators, 50s. to 60s. ; and fitters, 50s. to 60s. One of those piano manufacturers started under a Free The Trade Tariff, and was able to make enormous profits; and we ought to have some information as to why both he and the other can come to this Parliament and secure, without inquiry, increases on the. substantial Protection they have already received. Why should we tax the tools of trade of thousands of music teachers in order that those men may become millionI cannot now make a aires ?

In conclusion, I ask the Committee to remember that these rich men who are making enormous profits out of their business get every tool of trade free of duty, while we are taxing the tools of trade of thousands of music teachers, who must have tlie imported pianos. Hpnorable members may say what they like about the local instruments, but people engaged in music want the best, and will have it, because otherwise they will drift into a position of inferiority as compared with musicians in other parts of the world. Paragraph c, "" parts thereof, n.e.i. . . ad valorem 20 per cent. (General Tariff), 15 per cent.

Under this item a piano might be brought in almost completed at those rates of duty, and assembled here without much labour. I object to the specific duties.

H . Soutar, and others-in which they desire to record their opinions that it is to tlie interests of Australia that recognised examples of fine art should be admitted free. Under the item before us they will not be free. If it be carried, a very heavy duty will be collected in respect of an expensive picture brought into the Commonwealth. The writers of this communication go on to sayWhile we are in general agreement with the desire of the Government to impose a Tariff so as to check the influx of indifferent work, we fifty guineas to the Victorian Law Library suggest that the work of Australian artists abroad should be added to the free list. Under the item as it stands, I do not think that the work of Australian artists abroad would be free, but the Minister of Trade and Customs has expressed his willingness to accept an amendment making it clear that they will be. I have prepared such an amendment, and shall submit it to the Committee after we have decided the general question as to whether or not any duty shall be imposed. If we are to interfere at all in this direction, it should be with the object of preventing the introduction of cheap pictures; but the item, as it stands, whilst blocking the importation of expensive pictures, will prove no barrier to the admission of inferior ones. The Prime Minister has spoken very strongly on the necessity of protecting Australian artists. I fail to see why he should not go further, and propose a duty to protect native-born politicians. If such a duty were in force, the Prime Minister and some of his colleagues, as well as a good manyother honourable members who are recent importations, would not be in this Chamber at the present time, without having paid duty before landing here. Such a proposition would be just as sensible as is that now before us. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [12.5 a.m.] -The Prime Minister has chosen to make a speech in which, referring to my statement that this is a ridiculous proposal, he declared that it was no more absurd than is the protection of lawyers.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -Every one has to do that. The honourable member is indulging in a very cheap kind of criticism. The Government cannot accuse me of having taken up much of the time of the Committee during this debate, and I should not have said a word more on the subject if the Prime Minister had not thought fit to use what I may describe as a catch-penny illustration about lawyers. Every profession and calling imposes its own obligations, its own duties, and in almost all cases the community charges certain fees for the admission of persons to the practice of their professions. case of the lawyers. ' Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes, the community ; or, in other words, the charge is made under the law of the land. The honourable member knows nothing whatever of what he is talking. Since the Prime Minister has chosen to refer to this matter, I repeat that it has been the pride of this, as well as of every other British community, that we throw open our doors to people from other places to whom no exception can be taken. If we are to exclude productions of art because they happen to have been produced by persons other than Australians, we might as well exclude books that are not written by Australians.

He pointed out that we had ample raw material for the making of good jokes; that the making of jokes was a struggling industry, and that persons who were engaged here at very poor pay in working out jokes for the entertainment of the community should be protected just as well as any other class. This proposal stands on no higher plane. It stands, indeed, on a lower plane, because the Government are trying to exclude works of art that are for the benefit of all, and especially for the benefit of Australian art students themselves.

This duty will increase the price of bananas, and it is ridiculous to say that Jd. per dozen is any protection for the industry.

That is altogether wrong. Some years ago, there might have been some foundation for the idea, but every successive year shows a marked diminution in the number of Chinese growers. now about 130 of them to over 300 European growers. Since 1906, when a cyclone devastated the northern banana plantations, the Chinese have been gradually going out of the business. Last week, a Bill passed the Queensland Parliament limiting to 5 acres the amount of land that may be leased to an alien. This will practically eliminate the Chinese banana-grower. An increasing acreage is being planted in bananas in the southern part of the State, and the centre of the industry is now in southern Queensland. It is going to be a white man's industry, and honourable members must choose whether or not they will protect the white man against the black. -Surely the Queensland banana industry does not depend upon a duty of Jd. per dozen. farthing. I shall be very pleased to do anything I can to encourage the banana-growing, or any other rural industry, but my objection to this duty is that it is imposed on a food supply, as bananas are becoming an article of almost daily diet.

I have since gone into the matter, and ascertained that instead of New South Walesgetting anything like its proportionate share, it gets only about one-eighth or one-tenth of the amount, but it is possible that if the margin of Protection is increased the amount will go up.
