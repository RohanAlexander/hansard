Several honourable members have received letters on the subject, and I should like to know whether the newspaper statement iscorrect, and, if so, what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the matter. ment on the subject in the press, and the Department has been inundated with letters asking whether artisans or other workers are required by the .

We have sent two cablegrams to the Imperial authorities asking if they need Australian artisans, but have not yet been given a reply, and, therefore, I cannot answer the honourable member's question. seen the press report of the proceedings at a dinner in London tendered by the I m perial Parliamentary Association to an. ex-Prime Minister of Australia, Mr J.

Wliere are we going to end? In the case before us a tenderer offered to -supply the Government with a certain commodity. H is tender was the lowest, ""but a higher tender was accepted on the definite ground that the higher ""tenderer employed union labour. There was no question as to the wages to be paid by these two tenderers. It may be, for all I know, that the lower tenderer paid even higher wages than those paid by the successful man. under an award, and must pay the same rates. Sir JOHN FORREST aio question arose as to whether the wages ;paid were sufficient or the conditions of labour were suitable. The only consideration that weighed w i th the Government in accepting the higher tender was that he employed union labour. been told what evidence was secured by the Government as to the class of labour that was being employed; but on the -ground I have mentioned the higher tenderer received preference and was accepted. was, in fact, given a bribe because he -employed union labour. taxpayers have to pay. -were using their own money in this matter they might have some discretion allowed them; but since they are merely guardians and trustees of the public funds I do not think there can be justification for the action they took. Such an aetion -on their part is tantamount to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth being mulcted or robbed, and a fraud perpetrated upon the finances of the country. language. Sir JOHN FORREST -the revenues of the country are provided by the people, and belong to the people. Ministers-whethe r they belong to the one party or the other-ar e merely trustees for the taxpayers, and I assert that a f r a u d has been committed upon the public finances by giving away money for partisan political purposes in a way that is wholly unjustifiable. This is a question of Ministers giving away, not their own money, but the money of the people. What else does this preference to this tenderer mean when we come to analyze it? The public revenues are paid into the Treasury, and are disbursed by M in isters, by direction of Parliament, as M i nisters are responsible to Parliament. I s it to be said in these days that the expenditure of the public revenue shall be restricted to a certain caste or class of people ? Cani t be argued that the publio funds should be specially devoted to giving preference to any industrial, social, or religious class or caste ? If there is one thing more than another that has been condemned by my The y are working honourable friends on the Ministerial bench over a long course of years, it is class legislation or class distinction. A t all events, They have argued against it ad infinitum . One of their principal complaints has been that in years gone by there were class and caste distinctions in regard to the appointment of officers, the emoluments of office, and generally in respect of We have not the expenditure of public moneys. But what shall we say of them in view of this their latest action? Honourable members opposite are "" like dumb-driven cattle."" They have nothing to say. They believe in class legislation when it suits them, and He was shown favouritism; he they believe in the policy of the spoils to the victors. I emphatically assert that For this the this action of which I complain is unjust. Tf Ministers Isi t right that any section of the community should be to l d: "" Y o u must contribute as much as we like to the revenue, but when it comes to using the.revenues of the country in providing employment, no employment will be given to any of your class. A particular section of the community who do not contribute any more than you-who , perhaps, do not contribute as much-ar e to receive the preference, and to be shown favouritism in seems to grow upon the Labour party. A few years ago there was not a man in I repeat that Australia who would have subscribed to such an unfair doctrine.

41,Mr Fisher,"In certain Conservativecase the Prime Minister must have acquired these unfair notions in the Old Country, and is trying, apparently, to carry them into effect in Australia. Such a thing a few years ago would not have been tolerated, but to-day it is approved by honourable members opposite, and our protests are jeered and laughed at by men like the honourable member for Barrier. Is this the freedom we have built up in Australia ? Is this the sort of freedom we want in this country-preferenc e to a class; favouritism to one man over another? Have we not heard over and over again that every man in this fair country is free; that all are .equal and have equal rights? Prime Minister told the people of the Old Country about Australia. them that this was a land of free people. country on God's earth. Sir JO HN FORREST I maintain .that this is not freedom, bub thraldomThraldom who walks with tbe banner of Freedom, and recks not to ruin a realm in her name. I am lost in amazement, that this policy -of preference and favouritism should find a place in the programme of a party who do not hesitate to say that those whom they claim to represent have suffered in the past from such a pernicious system. -We' now find them applying it , however, -with far greater force than ever before, -and, apparently, deriving satisfaction from this form of oppression. What could be more oppressive, and more unjust, than to force men to contribute to the public funds, and then tell them that some one else is to have tlie sole right to the employment to be paid for from such funds? If honourable members opposite are prepared to subscribe to such a doctrine, then I can only say that they are a danger and a menace to tlie country. what has gone before, this action on the part of the Government is repugnant to the principle of natural justice and to -the sacred Christian principle that -'"" we sliould do unto others as we would they should do unto us."" It is repugnant to what is just and fair as between manand man, and it must bring discredit on all those who support such a vicious and improper doctrine. One hesitatss at harassing the Government at this particular time, more especially in regard to the matter of contracts, seeing that their hands are so full with providing for the requirements of the Expeditionary Forces. One is prepared to overlook minor faults on' account of the great rush of business that has to be attended to, but at the same time the Government should not shelterbehind this hedge, and do things that arefairly open to fair attack on the floor of the House. My attention was first called to the Brisbane contract by seeing; in the Brisbane Labour daily an articlewhich reported that a resolution had been carried by one of the unions at' Brisbane, conveying its best thanks to the honourable member for Brisbanef o r having secured a contract for a unionI t is the freest shop. This struck me as being a rather peculiar affair; for in my parliamentary experience I had always regarded tendering as something that should not beinterfered with by members of Parliament, as I realized that tenderers knew tlieir own business, and that if a man's price was the lowest, and he was able to carry out the contract, he should' get it . But in this case it appears that there was political influence brought tobear from the very start. The only question considered by the Defence Department was whether the shop submitting the tender was a union shop' or an open shop. The Automatic BakeriesLimited had been supplying bread at Enoggera Camp at 12s. 6d. prior totenders being called in January for thesupply of bread from, the 1st February until the 30th June, and their tender for the further period, owing to the risein the price of flour, was 13s. 3d. per 100 lbs. A t the same time a tender was put in by Mr W. Shead, and it was a most peculiar one. I do not think that the information given to the House Coming on top of by the Minister yesterday, in reply to a question submitted by myself, covered the whole of the ground. Though the tender was at a certain fixed price, the conditions were that, as tlie price of flour rose, Mr Shead was to get ls. per 100' lbs. additional for every £ 1 per ton of",8,Moloney Ver Y Strong Employment This Sort Of Injustice

86,Mr Riley,"It is the logical confoot to the unions that support the party in power. In regard to the transaction under review, at least two tenders were submitted, and the Government, instead of following the invariable practice of accepting the lower tender, accepted the higher. It is the invariable practice in British communities to accept the lowest tender, having regard to no other circumstance than the capacity of the tenderer to carry out the contract. Tenders are invited in order that the Government may have its work performed with the utmost efficiency and economy in the interests of those who provide the public revenue. ever attached to the acceptance of a tender is the efficiency of the tenderer. A l though in this case it was desirable, in tlie interest of the public nnances, that the lower tender should be accepted, and there was nothing to lead to the belief that the lower tenderer would not perform the contract effectively, the work was not given to him, because he would not bind himself to employ only members of trade unions. What are these trade unions i They are merely the units of the militant organization that keeps the present Government in power. Even could it be claimed that the people sanctioned to the fullest extent the principle of preference to unionists, I should not, so long as I remained in public life, abstain from showing the danger, folly, and wrong embodied in it . As I stated on a previous occasion, to use the money subscribed by the whole people to give employment to the members of the unions that keep the existing Government in power Sir members to the House. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE And actumany of them there are not even the very ally nominate members, Ministers themselves'being nominated by the nominees of the unions-for the Government to devote public funds, subscribed by the whole people, to giving employment to the members of the unions that support them, imports into this country, which has hitherto been free from it, some of the worse features of the Tammany system. That statement was challenged with fierce hostility by honourable members opposite, but thefiercenessof the challenge showed that it had struck home. If there were any doubt about the correctness of it before, none can remain now. Is there any form of word that would cover up the plain, obvious significance of the defalcation of tie public funds, with whose administration the Government is entrusted? Ministers are using the money of the people to subsidize, deliberately, openly, and shamelessly, those who have placed them in power. Let me try to remove a film that may rest on the eyes of some members of the public in regard to this particular matter. Honourable members opposite are fond of suggesting that the trade unions are identical with the associations registered under the Arbitration law, and are, therefore, entitled to the preference which Parliament -conditionall y 'only, after judicial investiThe only condition which is gation-ha s allowed to be granted to those associations. HadI been in this House at the time, the provision in the Arbitration law which, under certain conditions, permits the granting of preference to registered associations, would have been opposed by me, because I hold that neither by a judicial tribunal nor by any form of legal compulsion should free men be prevented from exercising the right to join or abstain from joining what profess to be voluntary associations. orable member knows, I have never concealed my views on this subject. It may be remembered that all that the law sanctions is that a registered association shall be entitled to claim preference for its own members. Under the Act, with all its faults, only associations which have complied with certain conditions-whic h are not half rigid enough-ca n obtain preference. The trade unions to which the GoJOHN EOBREST -And nominate vernment gives preference are of all kinds, some being registered and some not, and on slight restrictions embodied in the Arbitration law. Before sitting down I wish to ask one or two frank questions of this very candid Government, and very candid Minister. We are now beginning to feel, in"" the increase of unemployment, the effects of a drought and of war. We all hope to Heaven that this will not. increase to any large extent. But it may become double or treble what it is now, when the large amount of borrowed money which is being spent by the Oommonwealth and the States has been exhausted.

We were returned, and are now here carrying out the policy then determined on, and the Minister has said that he sees no reason to apologize for th« action of the Government in connection with this particular contract. A tender was accepted on certain terms and conditions, as against another tender that was only a shade less. Eveni f we admit that the difference in the tenders was of some importance, we must not lose sight of the fact that honourable members opposite, in this very House, were instrumental in passing an Act establishing an Arbitration Courti n order to prevent-industrial disputes, and to give reasonable condiW ill the honourable tions of employment. Surely, by the establishment of that Court, we at once placed the brand of unionism on our legislation to a certain extent; and are we to permit an Act of Parliament to be overridden by employers who are not prepared to tolerate arbitration, and who definitely state that they will not employ unionists? Such people are actually defying the very Act passed, not by this side-thoug h certainly supported by this side-bu t by the Deakin Government, with the present members of che Opposition behind h i m . If that be, so, how can we expect the great body of industrial workers outside to be loyal to a law of the land ?

122,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [4.4].,"Order! The honourable member's observations are distinctly disorderly, and I . ask h i m to withdraw them. them, but if I were outside, that is what I would say. It is an easy matter for the honourable member for Hunter to talk about past legislation for preference to unionists, but this is an attempt by a Government to put their hand into the public purse and to use public money in order to foster the trade unionist movement in this country. This aspect has never been brought, forward before. We know well that, years ago, this Parliament legislated in favour of preference to unionists when all things that should be were equal-equa l in regard to the qualifications of the labourer who was about to be employed-bu t it was never contemplated for a moment that anything would be done in justification of a Government deliberately putting their hands into the public purse, and saying, "" We are going to do this in order to foster 'our party organization."" doing here. We are told that the public justified this at the last election; but we cannot forget that when we were about to go to the country, the Attorney-General said that public attention was so absorbed over the war that no political question should be raised or discussed. Directly he discovered that there was a chance of making political capital out of the fact that the elections had not been post'ponedj he took up a different attitude, and now we are told that the public did understand the question, and returned a Labour majority on the strength of it . But we are not now dealing w it h the Subject of preference to unionists. are dealing with the subject of preference to contractors, which is a totally different thing. We are dealing with the question as to whether a Minister, as a trustee of public funds, is entitled to take money from the public Treasury, and give it to a contractor in order to bribe him at the expense of the public. Minister that there is some merit in' his blatant admission of the fact. I were robbed, it would be a matter of no importance to me whether I were robbed by a burglar or by a highwayman. The burglar would come into my house without my knowing it . But I should like to know if a highwayman possesses any particular merit because he would go about his business before my eyes? If the Minister and his colleaguesare contented to be regarded as the highwaymen of the public moneys, then they ar© welcome to the distinction between, doing what they do openly and doing it surreptitiously. The Minister may very well say that he is doing it openly, because he has been caught in the act. Nothing would have been said about this matter if the honourable member for Moreton had not exposed it , and showed ushow the public moneys are being misused. I hope the public will see that this is an attempt to use one question in order to cover up another, though one has nothing to do with the other. What is preference to unionists? I ask again. We heard the whole thing debated in this House years ago, and it was decided that when two men offering for employment were equal in their qualifications, preference would be given to the one who belonged to. a union. But if they That is what they are were unequal, preference would go to thebetter man. We have nothing whatever to do with that question now. There has been no argument on it at a l l . All we know is that two contractors are concerned, and that the Government are paying 5s. per cwt. more for bread than they might bave obtained it for, simply to help one of their own organizations.. If a union wishes to make a levy upon its members, it does not seek to make a levy upon other members of the community, because it has no right to dothat. That being the case, how can a union justify itself in putting its hands into the public funds, which belong to all We of us, and in this manner taking the money of the private ""citizens? There can be no two views on that point. ThisParliament has admittedly declined in calibre since 1901, but it never before reached the absolute bedrock of demoralization that it has reached to-day. Wehavei t revealed to the public that, when they appoint men directly or indirectly to the position of Ministers, they are giving And we are told by the them the opportunity, honestly or dishonestly, to take out of the Treasury If money which belongs to every citizen, and to us? it for their own party organization.

163,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [4.30],"the need for establishing lated horse-breeding farms in order that the Government might be in a position to supply its own horses for military public purposes, and the honourable member for Wannon followed with a very informative tion of horse-breeding generally. lieve that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth should give some form of assistance or set an example direction. about this desired result is a matter which requires very careful consideration, as do .most public questions; but I believe that there are spheres into which the Commonwealth, as well as the States, enter and render great assistance-in couraging and stimulating the breeding of horses, for instance, away that spirit of healthy emulation should generally, and which is necessary for the development animal. During the history of horsebreeding in Australia horses has increased steadily stantially. liorses in the Commonwealth. ber had increased in 1900 to 1,680,419, and in 1912 to 2,408,113. place that has shown a decline has been the Northern Territory, where the number was reduced from 21,000, in 1911, to 18.000, in 1912, but unfortunately has been a decline in most of the small industries Territory. of years we have had a very export in horses, amounting to something like 9,800 horses per annum, at an average price of £21 14s. 3d. per head. The principal places to which our horses have been exported has been India, our biggest customer, especially for Java, the Straits Settlements,' the Philippines., Ceylon, South West Africa, and Japan, showing the trade we have with the Eastern countries in this It is of importance to note, however, that from 1908-1912 we imported 15,402 horses of a total value of £1,032,000, or an average of £67 per head; while in the same period, horses, their value was only or an average of £21 14s. 3d per head. Of course, the horses imported would be mostly for stud purposes, accounting for the fact that we paid for them times the amonnt per head that we re-. Mr Sampson. properly-reguceived for the horses we exported* I believe that a thoroughly regulated system of horse-breeding, partly on the lines and suggested by the honourable member for Riverina, would make it unnecessary for very large sums of money to be sent out address upon the quesof Australia in order to bring in a conI bestant supply of imported .stock. We have it on the authority of some of the best judges in Australia, especially on the in this opinion of Dr. Cameron, the Director of The best way for bringing Agriculture in Victoria, that Australia possesses the finest climate in the world for horse-breeding, but, owing to the fact that there has been no proper system of regulation and to the absence of a stud might book in the Commonwealth, we have had"" ento keep constantly importing strains of the .best bloods from 'the Old Country and while not taking New Zealand. That necessity, I mainthat tain, could be reduced to a large extent. prevail amongst horse-breeders The question is what lines we should adopt in order to give encouragement to of that most useful the industry of horse-breeding. Owing the number of to the construction of railway lines durand subing the last quarter of a century, and toIn 1860, there were 431,000 the low price of horseflesh, laud-owners This numwithin a reasonable distance of a railway, prefer sheep-breeding or agriculture to. The only horse-breeding. Our lands close to railways are too valuable to induce peopleto go in for horse-breeding. A remount horse for military or police purposesthere must be four or five years old before it is acceptable as such, and fanners on established in the Northern high-priced land are not prepared to rear Por a considerable number, horses and keep them for four or fiveimportant years on the off chance of getting £18or £20 each for them. Therefore if we are to establish successful horse-breedingstations in Australia, we must go where land is cheap, and in this regard the Commonwealth stands in a relatively better remounts; position than do the States, because it has large tracts of country in the North-, ern Territory which might be utilized forthis particular purpose. I have seen horses direction. running on the pasture lands in the Northern Territory. I admit that those lands were not very heavily stocked, but the horses were healthy, and where wateris plentiful they thrive well there. Conthough we exported 48.952 sequently, I believe that, with proper £1,062,829. selection and with the establishment of a proper breed, we could put parts of"" the Northern Territory to valuable use in this direction. However, if we merely three confine our attention to Government action in the direction of establishing a 'Commonwealth station and State stations in the respective States, only a very small proportion of horses would be raised that should bo raised on our great stretches -of country that cannot be utilized in a better way. I do not know how far we can constitutionally legislate in respect to the regulating of horse-breeding within the Commonwealth or within the various States-w e may not have thc necessary power-bu t at any rate we can deal with our own territory, and institute an example in. the matter of regulating horsebreeding. Some people regard it as a very simple process, requiring very little knowledge, but, as a matter of fact, the establishment and development of a successful breed of horses takes hundreds of years, as has been the case in Great Britain. Scotland has taken hundreds of years to bring its strains of draught and light stock to their present perfection. There must be Government interference, in the direction of regulating a stud book. In Scotland there are corporations of. horse-breeders with proper stations. These corporations have been following that particular business for centuries. ' They have their stud books which they issue, and before any horse can be entered in a stud book its pedigree and its bona fides must be proved to the managers of these stations. Owing to our short history, so far we have had no opportunity of developing a system so perfect as that which obtains in Great Britain, especially in Scotland; but now, I think, the Commonwealth Government should step in -and I hope the State Governments will follow-and compel people who use horses for stud purposes to register them and prove the bona fides of their pedigrees. I believe that in every important district Government horse-breeding stations should be established, where imported stock of the very best class, of' both sexes, should be established, for sale at reasonable rates to private breeders. We have iu Australia a class of stock which is very useful for certain, purposes. Our draught stock carries out the work required of it iu a very satisfactory way, ' but it is only maintained at a certain standard by the constant importation of strains of good blood from, the older countries of the world. ThisI consider a very unsatisfactory position. Mr Knibbs shows tliat we have sent out of Australia over a million pounds for the purpose of importing blood stock and high-bred draught horses, whereas a good proportion of this money could have been saved by a proper scientific system of breeding within the Commonwealth. This, however, can only be done by passing laws in the States and in the Commonwealth Parliament, fixing the stud book conditions and requiring every breeder of stock who intends to use that stock for stud purposes to have the pedigrees of his stock stated in tlie stud book, after having had their bona fides thoroughly tested. information as to how much was spent on the importation of blood stock and draught stock? quantity of draught stock is imported from Great Britain and New Zealand, in order to keep up the standard of our draught stock. It is a physiological problem applying more to horses than to any other class of animals. The constant importation of a certain quantity of new blood stock is necessary in order to keep up the standard of our breed in Australia, but the trouble is that whereas in the older countries of the world they can accentuate their breeds and maintain the standards of their various distinctive breeds, in Australia we have to import draught horses of proved value, and the difficulty is that the progeny from the high-class draught horse is not sufficiently numerous to enable it to be used for stud purposes, because a number of the mares that the horses serve are not of a sufficiently high-class breed. If we are going to establish a station of that kind, we shall require, first of all, to have laws and regulations governing the breeding of horses and the publication of their pedigrees. After the establishment of a station for breeding military horses, the Commonwealth might get into communication with the States, and, by cooperation with them, it may be possible to establish horse-breeding . stations in every State, from which people of moderate means could purchase high-quality stock for stud purposes. Therefore, I believe this motion is very opportune. A very good example of what system will do was afforded us in Great Britain jus? before the war broke out.

I approach this motion in no party spirit, because, in my judgment, it involves something of more importance than the mere question as to whether parties agree or disagree. Wei n Australia are a self-governing community; we have the privilege of governing ourselves under the provisions of a Constitution which was framed and conceived by men who did not belong to the party with which I am associated. That Constitution was referred to the people of Australia on the principle of manhood suffrage, and was ultimately agreed to as the instrument under which the people were willing to live and be governed. Therefore, we have adopted, in the broadest constitutional way, a written Constitution, which is a charter to guide all those who are associated with the government of the country. Portion of that charter is section 128, which gives to the Parliament of Australia the power to consult the people by referendum on all proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. In no other way can the Constitution be amended. That section governs the particular period of the last Parliament when the Government of the day were asked to agree to the submission to the people, by referenda, of questions that had been previously subr mitted and defeated. Portion of the section statesBut if either House passes any such proposed law by an absolute majority, and the other House rejects, or fails to pass, it, or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentioned House will not agree, and if, after an interval of three months, the first mentioned House, in the same or the next session, again passesthe proposed law by an absolute majority, with or without any amendment which has been made or agreed to by the other House, and suoh other House rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentionedHouse will not agree, the Governor General may submit the proposed law as last proposed by the first mentioned House, and either with or without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the electors in each State of Bepresentatives.

In all probability, we shall never witness a similar occurrence, and I sincerely hope we never shall; but, if similar circumstances were to arise, I feel satisfied that, with the members of the late Government again in power, we should not find ourselves faced with a double dissolution. The honourable member for Swan, in a memorable speech at the Federal Convention, clearly showed what might be done under this section of the Constitution, and on that occasion evidenced much foresight and penetration. He prophesied to the letter exactly the position that subsequently arose. We found that honourable member, however, a member of the Government which committed this violation of the Constitution. He showed how it was possible for a Government, for the purpose of taking advantage of an adversary, to twist and thwart the Constitution in favour of a section of the people, .instead of using the Constitution to conserve the rights and privileges of the whole community. I do not think that the question is arguable unless there is resort to quibbling over the word "" m a y ."" Of course, such quibbling over the construction or interpretation of words in an Act of Parliament may suit the lawyers; but the fact remains that the Senate had a right to send the question by referenda to the people, and that that right was taken away by the precedent then established. The Senate may pass a Constitution Amendment B ill twice within the timel i m it laid down by the Constitution, and yet the Government of the day may refuseto permit the question to be placed before the people; in short, the Governor-GeneB u t if a Government which is ral, or the Government of the day, may prevent such a measure from being placed before the country by referendum. were afraid that the referenda would be passed. ment knew, from the figures of the voting iu 1913, that the referenda would be passed; and, because of the action of that Government, we must now have another long campaign, and consequent dislocation of the ordinary business of the country. I charge the late Government, as well as the Governor General, with inThat Government subvolving the people in an expenditure of £60,000 or £70,000 that could have been avoided had the Constitution been com-: plied with'. But there are other and more far-reaching consequences of their action. Had the referenda been put last September, we should not have witnessed the conflict tliat we now find amongst the States, one of which is, by law, regulating prices; another limiting Inter-State trade; and another allowing people to do as they like, irrespective of the welfare of Australia as a whole. H a d the late Government done their duty fearlessly, and advised the Governor General to permit the referenda to be taken, the National Parliament would have become masters of the situation with power to control internal imports and exports, and all the ramifications of our own trade and commerce. Much heart-burning would have been prevented, and we should have had, in the true sense of the word, a National Parliament. Of course, honourable members opposite contend that the late Government were quite right in advising the Governor General as they d i d ; but I remind them that the day may come when they may desire to place before the people of the country some amendment of the Constitution that they regard as vitally important, and they will then find that the "" boot is on the other foot."" The Governor General was either justified in doing what he did, or he was not; and I contend that no Governor General is justified in breaking the Constitution, whether he be so advised by the Government or not.

I am sorry that I have not time to refer to the wonderful treatise put forward in 1913 by honourable members opposite as a reason for not supporting the Government's proposals. The chief contention seemed to be that they were not against the referenda so much as against the party that happened to be their author. All through it can be found the cunning legal mind of the other side, wriggling in and out, trying to make the people believe that safeguarding themselves for any future occasion by asserting that they were practically in favour of nearly every item in them.

188,Mr Webster,"It is relevant toOommonwealth or another. The National Parliament w ill come into its heritage under a Constitution not framed by meu who have no sympathy with the people, but so framed that it w ill deal with the necessities that have lately arisen, and as desired by the people of Australia when the powers in the original Constitution are no longer sufficient to secure the good government of the Commonwealth. The referenda would never be carried if the late Government had power to do what they d i d last year, when they urged the Governor General to abrogate his functions as between the Upper House and the country. I know the Senate lodged a protest, and presented an address setting for th their intentions, but I think something more is necessary in an all-important matter of this character. This Parliament should not sit down without letting the Governor General know that the late Government worked the confidence trick on h i m ; that they humiliated h i m in the eyes of constitutional authorities, who feel that he has been made a cat's-paw for party purposes in regard to this very essential reform.

When the Senate of Australia have done certain things in compliance with the Constitution, the only they realize that obligation that remains is for the Government of the day to advise the Governor General to carry out to the f u l l the provisions of the Constitution. If the Government of the day do not do that, they are assisting the Govern or-General in an act which is practically flouting the Constitution, not in the interests of the people of Australia, but in the interests of party politicians, who use their nominal power in the Executive to thwart the will of the people and divert the whole tendency of legislation and administration, as it would have been had this referenda been put before the people. I dare say the honourable member for Swan agrees that if the referenda had been placed before the people last time, its proposals would have been on the statute-book to-day The results of the election show us that they were certain to have been carried.

193,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [5.41].,"I cannot help thinking, however, tliat it would have been better in a constitutional question like this, which seeks to censure the Governor General and to strike at the very foundation of responsible government and Ministerial responsibility, if he had stated whether his motion meets with the approval of the Government. I did not gather from anything he said that it did. If the honourable member had had the support of the Leader of the Government, and of the party with which he is associated, I think he would have said so, because the point would have been one of considerable importance in discussing a constitutional question of this kind. fore, that he has not their support. I do not want to say anything very hard of the honourable member, but when he says he does not care for any legal opinion, or for any constitutional authority, and that he is a law to himself, he takes up a position that very few of us would care to adopt. The honourable member thinks that he knows a good deal more concerning these matters than do those who are learned in constitutional law. I would remind him of that classic saying that "" A little learning is a dangerous t h in g , "" and would urge him to keep it in mind when next he sets forth to make such assertions as those to which he gave expression this afternoon. I do not think any one w ill deny that, as time goes on, we more and more realize that the more we know, the less we feel we know, and that, in regard to constitutional and legal matters generally, we must be guided, to a very larg^ extent, by those who have made a special study of that branch of learning. member was not so guided when he spoke at the Convention, and ho was right. matter of opinion. The Constitution provides that the Governor General may submit a proposed law to the people, and the honourable member would have him act in such a matter without the advice of his constitutional advisers. How the Governor General would take action in such circumstances I do not know. Having learned, perhaps from the President, that certain Bills providing for an amendment of the Constitution had been passed by the Senate, but had not been passed by the House of Representatives, the Governor General, orable member's opinion, apparently,, would have to take the necessary steps to submit those measures to the electors. The Constitution, however, clearly laysi t down that there shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor General of the Commonwealth. The Governor General must be advised by the Executive Council. In these circumstances, then, who does the honorable member say should have submitted these measures, which had been passed by only one House-the Senate-to the GovernorGenera] and have advised him as to the action he should take in regard to them? Does he think that the GoI take it , therevernment of the day should have done so, in view of the fact that this House, in which they had a majority, had refused to give them authority to do so? No authority or approval having been given by this House to Ministers to submit any of these measures to the Governor General, does the honourable member think that they should have laid them before His Excellency, and have advised him fo make the preparations necessary to ascertain the will of the electors? The Government of the day had no mandate from the representatives of the people in this House, which has control of Money Bills, to do anything of the kind. The Senate cannot provide for the spending of public moneys unless such expenditure is authorized by the Governor General and has originated and has been approved of by this House. Puti n a nutshell, the proposal made by the honorable member is t h a t . this Houseshould be subordinated to the Senate. events, is how I view the honourable member's proposal. It would mean, if adopted, that the Senate having passed certain Bills providing for an. amendment of the Constitution, it should be obligatory on the Executive to take them up, without any mandate, and, indeed, in opposition to the mandate of this House, and advise the Governor General to submit them by referenda to the people. vides for that.

200,Sir John Forrest,"We havesuch provision is made can have no bearing on the question now before us. The intention of the honourable member for Gwydir is to coerce this House and destroy its powers under the Constitution in its dealings w i th the Senate. He proposes that the shall have pendent action in regard to measures of this kind, involving the expenditure of a good deal of money, with any such proposition. We all know that the Governor General of the Commonwealth is in the position of a constitutional Sovereign. AVhat may have beeu done by the Governors of some of the smaller States, under the direction -of Downing-street, can no longer be held to be reasonable and proper so far as the Commonwealth or any of the other great Dominions of the Empire are concerned. If we are a self-governing -community-and I believe we are, although the honourable member would have it that we are not-the n the Governor General, in my opinion, is bound to act in these matters just as His Majesty the K in g would act. We have got away from tutelage. We have been able to send large bodies of troops to assist in fighting the Empire's battles, and we occupy a different plane altogether from that occupied by the separate States before tbe establishment of the Commonwealth. The Governor General exercises his powers under the Constitution on the advice of the Executive Council. exercises his powers as the King's representative in all other matters, just as other prerogatives of the Crown are exercised.. In other words, he must act on the advice of his Ministers, who have the confidence of the House of Representatives. to be said, then, that Ministers are to be coerced into giving certain advice to the Governor General without anv mandate or authority of the House of Representatives, and to give advice contrary to their own deliberate opinion ? For many generations in the Old Country, the Crown has never refused to exercise the powers of the : Crown under the advice of its Ministers. I am aware that in the smaller States there has grown up a system under which greater powers than are those exercised b v H is Majesty the K in g in the Old1 Countrv, have been used; but. in respect -of the Commonwealth-a . daughter nation of the Old Land'-m y view is that, however much we might wish on occasion in dividually that it should be otherwise, the Governor General is bound to observe the same rules as are followed by His Majesty himself. What was tlie statement made quite recently by the Secrethe Senate, without tary of State for the Colonies to the concurrence of this Chamber, Governor of Tasmania? Tasmania is power to take indeonly a small State, and if this principle was applicable to its Governor, it is. even more applicable to the Governor-GeneralI cannot agree of the Commonwealth. Mr Lewis Harcourt wroteThc observance of the principles of responsible government requires that a Governor must be clothed with Ministerial responsibility for all acts in relation to publio affairs to which he is a party. As head of the Executive he cannot, therefore, perform any such act except on tlie advice of his Ministers, and for performing it on such advice no political responsibility attaches to him personally. Tliere we have the whole position completely, and any censure such as is proposed in ' the motion of the honourable member should be directed against the Ministry of the day, and not against the Governor General. was there dealing with something that is not constitutionally laid down. able member for Gwydir is very persistent. The Executive Government of the day refused to make any recommendation to the Governor-Generali n favour He of the referenda desired by the Senate. It advised the Governor General not to do what the Senate desired. ment did advise the Governor General? Sir JOHN"" FORREST Yes ; the Ist i Executive Government advised the Governor General not to take this action, and he acted on the constitutional advice so given. It cannot be denied that a majority of the members of this House controls the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth through the Executive. The House controls the Executive, and the Executive which failed to act in accordance with its wishes would soon be displaced.

In this case, the Governor General accepted the advice of the Government of the day which had a majority in this House, supported by the opinion of the legal adviser of the Crown. He therefore adopted a strictly constitutional course. I fail to understand what the honourable member for Gwydir wants. H is motion readsThat the action of the Governor General in refusing to grant thc request of the Senate to submit the Referenda, Bills. . . established a precedent which may be irksome to thc Commonwealtli; If the Governor General continues to occupy a strictly constitutional position, how can it be irksome to the Commonwealth ? that the Governor General must act, just as His Majesty the K in g does, on the advice of his Ministers; and I fai l to see why it should be said that such an action is likely to be irksome, or in any way inconvenient to the Commonwealth. The. motion continuesand, in addition, to involving thc Commonwealth in further heavy expenditure seriously hampered the good government of Australia. I fail to understand that allusion. The Government of the day were opposed to the Referenda Bills, and refused to advise the Governor General to submit them to the people.

Sir JOHN FORREST I do not think If the Governorthey would have been carried. The honourable member is fond of tilting at windmills. He sets up difficulties merely that he may knock them down again. When the whole history of this terrible war is written, we shall realize that the statesmen, and the members of the State Parliaments generally, have their fair share of wisdom; that they have a fair idea of I what is best for their own States. No doubt, self-preservation-the preservation of the States-is with them an important consideration. I have not discovered any great cause for fault-finding with the States. Each, like the Commonwealth, has a Constitution of its own. W h y should we desire to arrogate to ourselves all the wisdom and knowledge of the country? The State Parliaments know f a r more what is best for their respective States than we do. We are, to a large extent, isolated from them; yet some honourable members of this Parliament do not hesitate to complain of their conduct, and even tp impugn their honesty; while some declare that the State Parliaments have outlived their usefulness. I entertain no such views. I believe in being loyal to the Constitution.

Mr ""WEBSTER (Gwydir) [6.2] I move That in thu opinion of this House the time has arrived when the Postal Service should be placed under a Board of Management, on tlie linos laid down in the report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services. Owing to the exigencies of our Standing Orders, and the situation that has been evolved during this session, two motions of which I had given notice appear together on the notice-paper for to-day. I would have preferred to deal with them on distinct days, but as any honourable member, if he is not prepared to move a motion appearing in his name when it is reached upon the business paper, will probably have no other opportunity of doing so, I am bound to submit this motion also, even at the risk of appearing to monopolize the time of honourable members. it now. Mr ""WEBSTER I would give honourable members that opportunity but for thc fact that there are some new members who perhaps are not seized of all thc facts. This is not a new matter. It has been before honourable members on numerous occasions since the report of the Postal Commission was drawn up. and I would not have brought it forward had I not been fully satisfied that the -recommendations of that Commission have year by year become even more justified than they were at the time they were drawn up. The members of the Royal Commission had to contend with difficulties that no other Commission has ever had or ever will have, and I have no desire to raise acrimonious discussion by referring to them now, but, having held a most exhaustive inquiry extending over nearly four years, they were unanimously of opinion that the present system of postal administration is fraught A Government that attempted with serious inconveniences, disabilities, and loss to the Commonwealth, and that, the time must come when the main features of the management of the Department would need to be readjusted. When I form an opinion, it takes something to change it, but though I entered into that inquiry strongly prejudiced in favour of the present system, bit by bit I was brought to realize the hopelessness of getting better administration and better results from it, and ultimately I was completely unable to support that opinion which I held at the beginning, and had to agree to a report of a character contrary to my former view. In the State regime the postal portfolio was looked upon as the plaything of the Ministry; it was given to the novice, though, as a matter of fact, no more important portfolio exists, which is acknowledged in New Zealand, where the Prime Minister has repeatedly combined the duties of Treasurer and Postmaster-General. Postmasters General under State control usually did not remain long enough in office to understand the basis of the postal system, and our Post Office being an inheritance from the States, we have had a new Postmaster-General almost every year. As a matter of fact, no man, however able or industrious he may be, however he may concentrate himself on the task of mastering the ramifications of tlie postal service, can do a tithe of what is necessary to grasp its real requirements, and at the same time administer the Department. The task is one that requires a large amount of thought and concentration, apart from the actual work of administration. We have had Ministers who have done their best, but how much further forward are we? In. reality we are going back every .year. More and more money is supplied, and somehow the ship has been induced to sail, but sheought to be doing more.

No business man would believe that though we spent millions of pounds sterling per annum on the Denartment, no one could tell what had been the result of the expenditure during the first eight years of Pederal control. No balance sheet, on a proper scientific basis, had been produced either by the States or by the Commonwealth. Everything had been allowed to d r if t , with the usual result that the ship was getting on the rocks. The Postal Commission, from the very incomplete data supplied to ifc, discovered that during the first eight years of Federal control £2,300,000; not during eight years of extravagance, but during eight years of, practically, parsimony. The amount was written off in 1909. Now we have the advantage of the report of the Postal Commission as a chart for the guidance of Ministers. have they copied ? tials have been adopted. Something has been done to alleviate the immediate dislocation in the Department, but the real .evil has not been tackled. A patch has merely been put over the trouble. The trouble still remains. We were told thatwhen money was provided for the Department the cost of maintenance would be reduced by the improved construction of lines, but, nevertheless, there was a loss of £407,000 last year. When the honourable member for Barrier was Postmaster-General, and practically on the recommendation of the Postal Commission, for the first time accountancy was attempted to be introduced into the Department, aud an accountant who had some qualifications to deal with the big problems before him was appointed; but that officer has been there for four years, and he cannot yet bring into line the tangled skein he inherited from those who preceded him. best. H is reports show that he is attempting to unravel the skein to the best of his ability, and that he is doing good work. In fact, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth we there has have during the last two years got to know something about our position in regard to the finances of the Postal Department. Mr Haldane, the accountant, has shown us that the deficit last year was £407,000, and that this year's deficit is £501,000-a n increase of nearly £100,000 in one year. How long is this to continue? No' Government can continue to carry a burden like that.

Instead of applying the doctrine of equal opportunity and equal right to work, the Labour party seem to be desirous of imposing another doctrine, namely, the doctrine of the right to pay to work. Under the operation of the principle of compulsory unionism to which preference is heading, it will be impossible shortly for any man to obtain work in this country with pay.

Of an approximate 1,100,000 or 1,200,000 workers iu Australia, less tlian half are members of unions; but the majority of these men support the present Government and the Labour party. That is not, however, because they favour the-doctrine of preference, as I think a referendum of the question would show. If the Government do introduce and pass measures establishing the initiative and referendum, I think that one of tlie first questions to be tested would be that of preference to unionists. prove to be so, I can promise that, so far as the Liberal party is concerned, we shall not be slow in using the machinery, if it segregate it from all otlier issues, and is not hedged with conditions that make it useless. I have a great misgiving that the ideal of the honourable member for Melbourne in this regard will never find itself expressed in legislative enactment, but that the initiative and referendum will find itself conditioned as I have indieven cated. It has beeu claimed that the Labour party and the Government have a mandate from the people on the question of preference; and had events pursued their normal course after the double dissolution, we might all admit .that tliere I were grounds for such a claim. But nobody knows better than the Attorney General that the outbreak of the war altered things altogether. gentleman himself pointed out at the time that all other issues had been brushed away like cobwebs, and that the country had only to consider the grave international complications that faced ns. He pointed to the fact that all the other British Dominions had put aside their party quarrels and all domestic questions, and he, in effect, asked Australians to forget the question of preference, and all other local issues, and remember only that dominant issue-the conduct of the present war. He also pointed out on that occasion, with great advantage to his party, the great work that he claimed the Labour Government had done in connection with the warlike preparations of this country; and. in view of the efficiency of our defences, asked the people to trust the Labour party to deal only with the great issue. I think, therefore, that the Attorney-General can well put aside the claim that the Labour party had a mandate from the people to carry intoeffect the principle of preference. for Flinders said that there was such a' mandate. afternoon, but previously. ber for Flinders made a very qualified statement. He admitted that, to a certain extent, in so far as the double dissolution was granted on that issue, tliere might be some claim. I wish to emphasize If that should once more the point that the question of preference has never yet been thoroughly tested i u this country. If we could take a referendum, the question could be settled, and whatever party won could then be held to have had a direct mandate; but until that is done, no claim can be made by either party. I know members of the Labour movement, officials, who denounce the doctrine of preference to unionists. I can understand in the larger towns where most of the Government work isdistributed that the demand for preference to unionists is the greatest. do not propose to pursue this question any further. I regret the r u l in g which you, Mr. Speaker, gave. Though you were proThe honourable bably right, it has prevented me from advancing the arguments I intended, and has circumscribed the remarks I had to make in dealing with this question to a necessarily narrow point of view. think the honourable member for Wannon has done well in introducing this question of preference to unionists. It appears to me that it is a question of sufficient importance to justify a general analysis, particularly as such an analysis has not been effected in this House or outside in recent years. It is perfectly true that when the Liberal party first of all in their restricted way brought along a measure for arbitration, and so established the Arbitration Court, very informative discussions took place in the House, in which honourable members on both sides participated, and in which this question was. analyzed.

282,Mr Watt (Balaclava) [8.16],"Ithen vast strides have been made in the acceptance and application of the doctrine. A t that time it was tentatively held by certain men in the Labour party that a restricted form of judicial preferonce was advisable and neosssary. I doubt, after reading some of those debates, whether all the members of tlie now Ministerial party accepted the view as enthusiastically as they are now advocating it ; in fact, if one reads through those debates, one will see with what timidity and diffidence the question was approached even by the representatives of the Labour party. the Watson Ministry resigned over it . exactly; but over its application to railway employees. The question of preference to unionists was not then dealt with, but it was on the broad question as to whether a judicial tribunal should be empowered to grant preference to unionists. Since then the third-party system has disappeared. A majority has come to the Labour party. They are enthroned in office, and given the responsibility not only of administering tlieir former ideas, but of enlarging them, particularly when the demand for such an extension is made. In the circumstances, therefore, I think it is perhaps advisable that we should review the situation. look back to the original claim upon which preference based. As far as my reading goes, tliere was no question of preference to unionists before the question of compulsory arbitration arose; and when this Parliament decided that the proper way to conduct industrial arbitration, and make for industrial peace, was to encourage bodies of workmen and employers to register under an Arbitration Act, and bring their cases before the Court, this question arose: ' ' Are bodies of workmen, after undergoing considerable sacrifices of effort and money to secure benefits to themselves and coworkers, to undertake thsse sacrifices without getting any preferential benefit from the award which is obtained?"" T h a t is tlie whole basis, as far as I can see, of the argument for preference to unionists, and it seems a plausible thing that the benefits of the arbitration system should not fall like the rain upon the just and unjust alike. I can well imagine that unionists who have paid their sixpences or their shillings into the unions for years, and have waited through months of weary waiting at the portals of an Arbitratio n Court, say u> themselves, "" We have undertaken all this sacrifice and obtained this result, and yet a man who has not spent a penny is to enjoy it equally with ourselves unless the principle of preference to unionists is granted."" That is the argument on which all extensions of the principle of preference to unionists, suggested or authorized, has been based. The next step was to confer a new power upon the Arbitratio n Court presided over by His Honour Mr Justice Higgins. The strange thing about MieN o t over that point operation of the system is this: Broadly speaking, and speaking now with the memory of the single exception' to which I shall refer later on, the Judge of the Arbitration Court has declined in all cases to give preference to unionists. tion. exception, with which my honourable friend is closely associated. But, broadly speaking, the Judge, if you will follow many of the instructive judgments in which he has dealt with this question, takes this view. He says, "" I cannot Let us with justice award preference to unionists unless a majority of the workers are into unionists was side the union. It would be giving a benefit to the minority unless that condition prevailed; and if the majority of the workers in that given industry whose case is being attended to are inside the union, then there is no necessity to give preference."" So that, in one set of circumstances preference would be unjust, and, in the other, unnecessary. down. really did break down; but the remarks and observations of the Judge of the Arbitration Court are not based upon that breaking. not have had that limited application if it had not been for the fact that, it broke down. wrong.

In New South Wales majority being in a union would not affect the principle. not at all. If it is a good principle to reward these men for the sacrifices and efforts and organization which they have successfully carried out, ifc is equally good whether a majority of the workers are inside or outside the union, from the stand-point of preference to unionists; and that is why, in New South Wales, when they launched this legislation first of all, we saw some three or four cases in which, according to my recollection, a majority of the workers were outside the union, and yet the Chairman of the State Court unhesitatingly gave prefer-ence to unionists; and he made no such excuse as the learned Judge who presides over the Arbitration Court has made. However, that is the attitude of -a gentleman who, without impropriety, may be described as not unsympathetic to the Act which he is called npon to administer by this Parliament, and by the Court of which he is a member. I ought, briefly, to refer to the one exception to which the honourable member for Batman has directed my attention.

There is another extraordinary application of this principle of preference to unionists which honourable members opposite will find equally difficult to justify. If clerks are required for temporary service in the Defence Department, where are they chosen? Not at the office of the Public Service Commissioner, which the law requires and custom demands, but at the Trades Hall by the secretary to the Clerks Union. When the Minister of Defence wants clerks for extra or special work, despatch or any other class of work, he does not say to the Public Service Commissioner, "" Pick from your list the man who is first in order of priority or merit""-o r whatever the principle is; but the secretary of the Clerks Union sends down a man from the Trades Hall. Is that right? Have we so abrogated our functions as a Government that we hand over to an irresponsible organization the task of selecting from among its members, on any principle it chooses, the men who are called upon to do the nation's work? If that is so, why do we make laws and lay down the basis of a Public Service Act, compelling Ministers, through the permanent heads, to requisition for men for temporary employment, and compelling Ministers to authorize such requisitions to go to the Public Service Commissioner, and then abandon the whole procedure, and say that a union secretary at the Trades Hall shall decide who is to be employed in the Commonwealth service? All this means that honourable members are going a long way further than they ever intended, or even thought possible. In the Defence Department, ordnance men, craftsmen, men doing super-cargo work on transports and all classes of . work, not registered among the . fighting ; forces, are aplt pointed on the principle of preference to unionists, which, fact brings me to the eloquently, but briefly, by the honorahle member for Flinders, namely, that other men in the service of the Defence Department are not selected on that principle. Officers in the Forces are not given preference because they happen to be unionists. Men who volunteer to serve their country under the colours of the King in Australia, South Africa, Asia, or Europe, are not selected on that principle. I make bold to say that we get right up against this question, whether we like it or not if preference to unionists be a sound thing in time of peace for the purpose of industrial or administrative development it is equally sound in time of war for the purpose of repelling in. vasion of .protecting the liberties of the '.qountry.

357,I F ' W E Go Out With Mr Watt,"Does my honorable and legal character is necessary for the defence and preservation of unionism ? If so, why do we not pass laws to that effect? Why do we not open wide the door, and say to all men, "" You must enter through that door and he a unionist, or you shall neither work nor eat."" We do not do that, hut by small acts of terrorism and coercion, and by giving them the knowledge that they cannot get a billet unless they belong to a union, we are gradually forcing a number of men against their inclinations to join the unions in order that they may continue to enjoy for themselves and their families the comforts and privileges of civilization. had previously won for them. by aid of the laws passed by the Liberal party, which were saner, broader, and more just than the narrow views of the honourable member. I have only one observation to make in conclusion: Those men who are going away now, who are non-unionists, and who have volunteered in fair proportion to their numbers, have been called by the chartered leaders of the Labour party, times out of number, "" scabs,"" "" black-legs,"" and "" sneaks of society."" Notwithstanding that opprobrium, when the news went forth that the liberty of our people was in danger, and that they must fight if they would enjoy a continuation of it , they came out freely enough under that stigma, and aro fighting shoulder to shoulder' with the unionists, and feeling in these terrible times the spirit of the real brotherhood of man that breaks down the stupid obstacles which political' unionism fain would erect between them. When those men have come back with the glories as well as some of the scars of war, what is to happen to them ? then. they still to submit to the opprobrious epithets that have been showered upon them from time to time? What is to be the attitude of the Government with respect to these men ? A r e they then going to' say to the returned soldiers, crippled or whole, who have put up as game a fight as any unionist, "" We cannot employ you because there are a number of unionists who have returned, and they must have preference "" ? It is time the Government not only gave consideration to this question, but gave the House and the country an answer to it . when the time comes. morrow w i ll do-that is the attitude of this party towards a great principle in which the nation is interested in this time of war. Having settled the conditions under which those men fight, and the pensions they or their relatives will enjoy if those soldiers are incapacitated or killed, we should also settle the question of their employment if they return. The Government have made no suggestion of a policy to settle this problem. tion of it : Those who bave enlisted to fight with their unionist comrades abroad should, when they return covered with glory, enlist to fight with their comrades at home in the industrial army.

Mr Staniforth Smith, I am sure, would not be guilty of anything of the kind to which the honourable member has referred. would. I charged the Administration with laxity, and if the honourable member had any sense he would recognise that that is a very proper thing to do. It is comnise, of course, that the honourable member has a monopoly of the common sense of the House. I have no wish, however, to quarrel with h i m . I rose principally to refer to a matter of more importance, and that is the building of the Federal Capital. W ill the Minister of Home Affairs explain why he has failed to follow up the action of his predecessor, who, when he retired from office, was arranging to call for competitive designs for various public buildings required at the Capital? The honourable gentleman has told us that he has postponed the invitation to send in these designs, and I should like now to know when he is going to "" get a move on "" in regard to tliem. Hundreds of men are looking for employment, and there is ample scope for them. I shall be very happy afc the Federal Capital. When is the honourable gentleman going to make some serious effort to push on with public works up there? I should also like to ask him what is being done in regard to the proposed railway from Yass to the Capir l have tal and Jervis Bay.' We do not seem to be able to get beyond the trial survey stage. This railway must be made, quite apart fro m any question of whether or not it will pay, and we have now a splendid opportunity to enter upon its construction, seeing 'that many men are out of work. W ill the Minister also tell the House why'' variations have been made 1 in .the route originally proposed for the railway between Canberra and Jervis Bay. The first t r i a l survey brought the I know route of the proposed line within a few miles of the important town of Braidwood, but for some reason that I have been unable to ascertain, a variation has been made on two or three occasions, and the rights of the people of Rraidwood have been utterly ignored. I shall insist on something being done, so that f a i r and reasonable consideration as regards the route of railway shall I want that done. be given to these folks, who have I do not pioneered the wilderness and waited a lifetime for the blessings and benefits of railway communication.

543,Mr Austin Chapman,"j -I recogrumours are afloat regarding the reasons for this deviation, and, in the interests of the Department, the Minister should clear them up. It seems to me that no progress has been made with the building of the Capital since the late Government left office, and that public works there are practically at a stand-still. I wish now to bring before the Postmaster General the position of mail contractors, many of whom are being ruined owing to the high price of fodder. The honourable gentleman told us the other day that he would be glad to receive suggestions as to what should be done in the matter. I do not know that it is our mission to make suggestions to him, but I think that where it is shown that a contractor has honestly endeavoured to observe the terms of his contract, any fines imposed upon him for being behind time should be remitted. Instead of refusing to give these men any consideration, the Postmaster General should inquire fully into their position, and should give them an opportunity to throw up their contracts if they desire to do so. Many have taken contracts which, having regard to the present price of fodder, are ruinously low. Business men were induced to act as bondsmen for them, and are now being called upon to pay. I have a case in mind. It relates to the mail contract between Cooma, Nimmitabel, and-Bega. The contractor^ a, Mr A,h Kin,was n backed by two reputable residents, Mr that they are^in a tight corner. They Keys and Mr Gorman, and they were called upon to complete the contract. They carried it out; but the Postmaster General, who professes to be a generoushearted man, has refused to remit the fines that have been imposed on the contractor and paid by the sureties, although the rates that are now being paid under show that the mails were being carried under the old contracts at practically one-half the price that ought to be paid. It is easy for the honourable gentleman to sit back in his comfortable chair in the Department and to invite us to make suggestions; but I would remind him that when he was on this side of the House he was ready enough to talk for these men. Let him do something more than indulge, in mere talk His Department seems' to me to be reeking with r trouble,...and some change must be made. ber is now on a good wicket. so. At the same time, I recognise that it is an easy matter to criticise the administration of a Department, and hard to find a remedy. I would also bring before the Postmaster-General the case of a Mr C. Wiley, a respected resident of Kangaroo Valley, who was promised by the Hon. George Fuller, when he held office as Minister of Home Affairs, a sum of £50 for additions to a post office in the district, but who, because that promise was not put into writing, is refused this payment by the present Minister. Mr Fuller's personal word is as good as a bond, and, as he admits the justice of Mr Wiley's claim, the Minister should honour the ex-Minister's promise, avoid repudiation, and do justice to Mr Wiley by paying what is due to him. The honourable gentleman has a big majority behind him; but he is not likely to endear himself to the people in such a way as to retain that majority if he continues to take up this attitude. Whilst speaking in this way, I am free to confess that it is very difficult for the honourable gentleman' to acquire a personal 'knowledge of every small matter relating to so big a Department as that over which he presides; but I appeal to him to play the game, more particularly in regard to mail contractors, and to realize tendered for ""the carriage of mails at a time when fodder was at about one-third its present price, and many of them now have ruin staring them in the face. When asked to relieve them of their contracts, the Postmaster-General says that to do so would be to create a bad precedent. The necessities of the situation, new contracts however, demand that action should be taken, and the honourable gentleman ought not to hesitate, in the circumstances, to set up a new precedent. I make these observations in no carping spirit. The matters to which I have referred may seem to be of small moment so far as Ministers are concerned; but they are momentous issues to the persons directly interested.
