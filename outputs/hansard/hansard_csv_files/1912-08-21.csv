Doors between the office and residential ciuaiters of postal buildings are provided, where special circumstances are held to justify it. It is not considered advisable to do this in every case. master-General, upon noticeWliether the proposed regulation imposing a I'ate fee on letters posted at railway stations in Victoria will be laid on the Table of the House, and will the House have an opportunity of reviewing such regulation when approved ? The regulation imposing a late fee on postal ister, upon noticearticles posted in the Commonwealth has been in operation for years. No new regution lation is proposed, but the arrangements in the State railways for the transport of troops of Victoria are being brought into line with all grades, including cadets, as also naval offithose obtaining in other States of the Comcers, men, and trainees, at any and all times monwealth. Postmaster-General, upon noticeWhether it is the intention of the new regulation relating to late charges on letters 'posted at railway stations that such charges should be enforced at places where there are no post offices apart from the railway station itself? At a place where the post-office is at the railway station, a letter posted after the closing time of the mail, and deposited in the box on the train, or in a box giving it the benefit of a later clearance than is B effected at such post-office, would require to bear a late fee. General, upon notice1. Is it correct, as stated in tbe Melbourne Argus of Monday, iQth August, 1012, ""That Mr ufon noticeJ. M. Crawford, who is not nn officer of the PubMc Service, has beenappointed, without examinationor probation, to the position of assistgard to his attendance and actions at the Imant electrical engineer, on the Central Staff of the Postmaster-General"" ? 2. Where does Mr Crawford, come from, and are his qualifications? 3. Was there no officer in the service fitted fbr over for Mr Crawford? The Commonwealth Public Service Com1. Yes 2. Mr Crawford occupied the position of an electrical engineer in the British Post Office, and was attached to the Central Metropolitan District, London. He is an associate member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, and has had twenty-six years service in the British Post Office, embracing all-round experience in telegraph, telephone, and other branches of P ost office electrical engineering. For the past fourteen years he was exclusively engaged on duties covering the requirements of the position to which he has been appointed. 3. The appointment of Mr Crawford was effected under the provisions of section 31 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Applications were invited for the position, and only two officers of the Commonwealth applied. There was no officer available in the Public Service who possessed the qualifications regarded as essential for the appointment. 1. Whether,, under paragraph XXXII . of sec51 of the Constitution the Commonwealth Government is authorized to assume control of when the transport of such troops or naval men may be necessary for training or other purposes? 2. If the Constitution does confer such power or powers upon the Commonwealth Government will the Government take control of the railways of the States whenever such control may be deemed necessary or expedient? ment of the Commonwealth has power to make laws with respect to the control of railways for naval and military purposes.

If I may give a few figures to suggest the significance of the position to which my prefatory remarks are applicable, I find that the national expenditure of the United Kingdom in 1895-6 was Â£ 9 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; in 1904-5 it was Â£ 1 4 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and for 1912-13 it is estimated at Â£187,000,000. Then, if we take the naval expenditure, we find that, in these years it has been _Â£i 7,.000,000, then. Â£ 3 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and is sonally, I have no fear of the result if we now Â£44,000,000 odd. I have heard it stated in this House that all the money required at Home for defence is, as it ought to be, perhaps, spent out of revenue. But it is a little significant that, chiefly under Conservative management, as a recent White Book shows, for the nine years ending 1909, there was borrowed Â£28,000,000 for defence purposes. Liberalism, which is always enterprise coupled with economy, no less than .Â£78,000,000 of the public debt has been discharged within the last three years. We have also to remember that there are conditions, healthy in their significance, of unrest at Home which may make the nation divided in itself. I say "" healthy,"" because there is a class of discontent which shows a. legitimate dissatisfaction with existing -conditions, and, ultimately, when manifested with sufficient strength, becomes the precursor of reform. But this unrest has to be taken into account; and the very last Times that came to hand shows what it may amount to in case of war. I find that the International Conference of Miners indicated in a declaration the probability of a general strike should war be declared by any nation against another. ject of the strike? do not justify that attitude one way or the increase in the expenditure since. Federa-other, but am merely dealing with condition was inaugurated. tions that may at -any time arise. I say is that, if such a strike did take by a general fulmination thrown at place, it is not always the nation that our heads concerning the alleged excessive leads in morals that succeeds; one nation Federal may refuse to act, and another will act; and we know what the result will be. The Dominions, of course, are deeply interested in the strength of the central power. We have an interest arising from sympathyan interest connected, I should rather say, with citizenship rather than with race, because we are, to some extent, a composite people out here-and we If the honourable member have an interest arising, from interdependent security. What this means is suggested by Captain Mahan:, who says that, so long as the Imperial Fleet is maintained, there will be no danger to the territories of the British self-governing Dominions. The point of these observations is. that we must,viewing this matter from the Imperial point of view in which we are so interested, endeavour to economize our resources against the strain, which may, perhaps without anticipation,, arise; and, perdo that. With, as the Budget-papers show us, an external trade of Â£146,000.000 , a production which is not given, but which amounts to something over Â£200,000,000 , theinvestment of something like Â£200,000,000 of the public debt of the States in reproductive works, which return, But, happily, under in round figures, a revenue of Â£ 8 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, or more than sufficient to cover the necessities of working expenses and interest-wit h a remarkable power of recuperation, which Australia always shows after a stroke of disaster, with a people homogeneous in character applyingtheir eager energies to many varieties of soil and climate, and, above all, with the liberal character of our institutions, I say that, so long as we do not mistake prodigality for enterprise, or niggard parsimony, that restrains and paralyzes, for that proper economy which renders all things possible, we need have no fear or deep-seated anxiety for the future. Were it really germane to the matter, I might say that Australia can give as good an account of itself in finance, and show, on the whole, as economical management of its resources, as any other part of the Empire.

37,Mr Glynn,"ment of comparative figures is utterly meaningless Tlie estimate of Â£300,000, with a margin of Â£54,000 in .respect -of new expenditure, which was given to the Federal 'Convention in 1897 was confined to the cost of the machinery which at the start was absolutely essential to get the Federal machine going. Honourable members will also find that the estimated transferred expenditure was the minimum of what, at the time of transfer, would have to be met by the Federal Treasurer, and that was fixed at Â£1,550.000. The largest outlay was in respect of defence, which., as far as T can remember, was then something like Â£750,000. Since then, expenditure has undoubtedly gone up. If honourable members turn again to the Budget figures and other data, they will find the increase dates from the year after the great depression of .1902.' It has really succeeded the disappearance of'the depression and also the establishment of the uniform Tariff. Let us take a few of these figures and see what their significance is. Our .production :of wheat, in 1902-3, amounted to 12,378.068 bushels; in 1910-11, it amounted to 95.111,983 bushels; and, in 1911-12,'to 71,664,97,1 bushels. During the same period, the area under crop has increased from 8 472.000 acres to 12,105 000 acres. The production of wheat per acre, under better methods of tillage, the application ofphosphates, and so forth, has also, I believe, largely increased, and increased, I think, even on the average of all the acres under crop. Our wool exports have gone up in value from Â£12,744,000 in 1902 to Â£26,000,000 in 1911, and the deposits in the banks of issue have increased from Â£'89.705.000 to Â£147,103,000. Wages in factories-anothe r sign of our increasing prosperity, and one that we all welcome-hav e risen from Â£14,139.000 to .^""2^,874.000. Our exports of the principal articles of Australian produce have likewise increased from a value of Â£45.658.000 in 7Q03 to Â£76.482.000-and that notwithstanding the. fart that our increase of population since Federation has only averaged 1.77 per cent. Curing the same period, the State expenditures and revenues have also largely increased. They balance each vear, so that T am able to give the expenditure in 1903-4 as amounting to S2Ki.KK2.2i2; whilst, in IOIO-TT. it by the Government; and, in the long run, amounted to Â£-77.240.315. Our critics it would have paid the Government to havemust remember the fact that, rightly or constructed the lines for itself. wrongly, progress is always .accompanied unless it is analyzed. by an increasing expenditure, because it renders possible enterprises, works., and a policy that otherwise could not be carried out. Let me make a comparison of our position with that of Canada. We hear a great deal said to our detriment as to the marvellous effect of enterprise in the sister Dominiona Dominion to which we must always refer with respect, and of whom we must 'only speak in terms of generous and inspiring emulation. I find that the population of Canada, as given in the Budgetpapers, is 7,192,338., whilst the population of Australia is 4,588,70,7. The population of Canada, therefore, is nearly double that of Australia. Coming to external trade, we find that that of Australia, as I have already mentioned, is of the value of Â£146,000,000, whilst that of Ca.nada -is >of the value of Â£158,000,000. There is not a .marked difference, and I believe that in recent years the two countries were practically equal in this respect. member's figures include Canada's trade with the United States? M. GLYNN I assume that they include all external trade. In regard to alB other sources of production, save wheat,, the Commonwealth is ahead. I do not wish to dwell much upon the wheat outlook, but honourable members will recollect that recently immense .areas have been suddenlythrown open in Canada, and lhave led to a reversal of the state of .affairs that existed* in about 1905, when, I believe, -there were some 1,200,000 native-born Canadians in the United States. In the Commonwealth, we have 18,013 miles of railway open to'traffic, while in Canada there are 25,400miles open. The difference, however, is-very significant. I find that, in thirty-fiveyears, the Government, the provinces, and! the municipalities of Canada have given to companies 202,000,000 dollars in aid of railway construction. A portion of the 25,400 miles of railway open for traffic in Canada belongs to the Government, but 202.000^000 dollars have been given ns grants to companies. Railway bonds have also 'been guaranteed to the amount oÂ£) 148.000.000 dollars, and land grants, Dominion and Provincial, amount to-55,000.000 acres. I believe that it will be found that in Canada a great deal of the financing of railway companies was done These-",18,Budget
38,Mr Mcwilliams,"D o the honorablematters must be borne in mind in considering our comparative standing, and its chief significance in relation to immigration. At the present time, Canada is building what is known as the National Canadian transcontinental railway, at a cost of 250,000,000 dollars. five miles of that railway are being built by companies with the help of Government guarantees, and a section of 1,800 miles is being built by the Canadian Government. The results of railway construction in Australia are much better, because here we are benefited directly by our ownership of the railways, and indirectly by reason of the greater facilities we can give to the public by means of policy and administration. There is no doubt, however, that the financial pace in Australia is becoming too fast. In 1907-8. our expenditure, leaving out of account the amount paid to the States, was Â£6.162,129. In 1911-12, it amounted to ,Â£14.721,938, and in 1912-13, it is estimated that it will amount to Â£16,604,791. That is a fairly substantial increase. It must never he forgotten that your increase of expenditure, speaking generally, always remainsa fact upon which I dwelt when -discussing the Budget of 1905-6-whils t your revenue may at a sudden crisis contract. It is somewhat of a suggestion for -cautinn that, in the Estimates of 1912-13, provision is made for a draw ofÂ£2.261,000 upon the Trust Funds in respect of old-age pensions and naval construction; so that, without that draw, the Estimates for the current year could not balance without taxation. Are we to have these Trust Funds to draw upon next year, if the pace is kept up? Let us look at the chief lines of expenditure. Defence is, of course, the first of them. If I had to offer a motto to our youths for their guidance in defence, I 'should perhaps quote these words of Shaks-peareRightly to be great, Ts. not to stir without (Treat argument, Rut greatly to find quarrel in a straw, When honour's at the stake. Or. if the Minister of Defence would think that perhaps too bellicose, as we differ in (^<^r opinions of what honour is, and very often misinterpret it. perhaps a more whole-snTie one would be that from Burke, by which the Japanese, our allies, seem to be -guidedHumanly speaking, that people which bounds the last three years itf efforts only with its being must give the law :to that nation which will not push its opposition Ujeyond its convenience. The world undoubtedly is still arming. Russia proposes to spend in five years no less than Â£45,000,000 in the reconstruction of its fleet. How transitory maritime greatness may be is shown by the fact that Russia lost seventy-three vessels in the war Seventeen hundred and fortywith Japan. In 1901, the Governor General's Speech said that ""extravagant expenditure on defence must be avoided, and reliance placed to the fullest extent on a citizen soldiery."" Let us see what has occurred, and the probable cost of the citizen soldiery. In 1901-2, leaving works out of account, the military and naval expenditure was ,Â£86,1,218; in 1902-3, it was Â£734.354; in 1907-8, it was .Â£890,557; in 1911-12, it was Â£2,127,056; and the estimate for this year is Â£2,869,693; a pretty substantial and gradual increase. With works, taking only the last two years, the expenditure on defence was, in 1911-12, Â£4,080,039, and is estimated to reach, this year, Â£5,438.364. That increase we may regard, although it includes construction, as being permanent, if we are alive to our responsibilities. Admiral Henderson, assuming that his scheme is carried out, gives an estimate of annual naval expenditure, in 1922-3, of Â£4,494,000. I find, looking up the report of Lord Kitchener on land forces, that he gives an estimate of the cost of a fighting force of 88,000 men, which was the number upon which the Defence Act of the Liberal Government was based. Our defence expenditure in the last three years, it must be remembered, has been automatically and necessarily increasing under the policy inaugurated in 1909 by the Liberal Ministry. Lord Kitchener was asked to come out here by the Deakin-Cook Government to report upon the working of the Act of 1909, so that it is altogether beside the question to quote the increases of the last three years as amounting to a recognition by any Government-althoug h it is claimed for the Government at present in power-of obligations which their predecessors had ignored. more for land defence this year than Lord Kitchener said it would take. the cost of this military business, but whatever credit is to be assigned in connection with the increase of the military vote during Mr W.

40,Mr Glynn,"I should like to knowwhat was said last night in a very clever speech, which was well received by the House, by the honourable member for Corangamite. but I think he misinterpreted the situation when he assigned the increase in defence in the last three years to the credit of Labour enterprise and to a recognition, of obligations by the Labour party. the fact that we proposed amendments to your Act of 1909 which were not put in, but which subsequently formed portion of Lord Kitchener's report. tically nothing in substance. creased expenditure has not been caused by any amendment of the Act of 1909. that feature. as the recognition of our Imperial and local obligations in defence is to be assigned to the credit of any Government, it should be to the preceding rather than to the present Government. says that in seven years' time the expenditure to give a fighting force of 88,000 men would be Â£ 1 , 8 8 4 , 0 0 0 . land force, so that we may reckon in eight or nine years on a minimum expenditurebecause these estimates are always outstripped by fact-of Â£ 6 , 4 0 0 , 0 00 in round figures on naval and military defence. One significant fact is that, leaving works out of account, tbe actual increase of naval and military expenditure for the year 1912-13 over the previous year amounts to .Â£739>4Â°7> which is actually more than the total expenditure in 1902-3, when the vote perhaps was at its lowest. told us in his Budget-speech that the increase is partly caused by the necessity to provide for the largely increased staffs required for administration and instruction in connection with the universal training movement. * That is a commentary upon the anticipation of the first Governor General's Speech that under a citizen soldiery we might look to the avoidance of what the Government then described as "" extravagance in defence."" had given us materials for estimating the comparative cost, in the light even of a year or two's experience, of the present method of compulsory training. given Lord Kitchener's estimate. WhatI I only want to discount say is that we must be prepared to face these responsibilities and pay. Our economy must be directed to that certain fact, and I should like to know the comparative effiI listened to him with pleasure, ciency of the system which is costing us all this money, and its comparative cost, because we did adopt the method of compulsory training rather hastily. There was a feeling in the House a year before that, if the matter was put to the vote, the vote would have shown an adverse opinion. We had a report from some experts that went Home, pointing out the merits of the Swiss system, but it ought to have been borne in mind that Switzerland is a land power wedged in between four military Powers. It has, I believe, something like 230 persons to the square mile against in Australia My point is that the insomething under two persons to the square mile. It has had practically to defend itself against ""the aggression of European Powers since the nucleus of the first alliance, which developed into Federation, My point is that so far was formed in, I think, 1215, by three cantons, Zurich, Schwyz, and Unter-Walden. In the circumstances, it was a very false precedent to accept for our guidance in connection with the military system the Lord Kitchener's report scheme adopted by the sister federation of Switzerland. I hope our defence system will succeed. All I want, ip speaking That is for the on finance, is to have some light thrown, first upon its comparative efficiency, and, secondly, upon its comparative cost, because my opinion always has been that, if we face the facts of defence, if we had increased our defence expenditure four or five years ago to the limits it has now reached for a f u l ly trained force, we should have all that we require in the way of land defence. Defence, unfortunately, has been always the field of the empiric. Lord Curzon, speaking on "" True Imperialism "" on The Treasurer the n t h December, 1907, said that every fresh War Minister sought to distinguish himself by inventing a brand-new military system, which.commonly passed into oblivion with its author. We have had many Ministers of Defence. In England they have the "" land "" school and the "" blue-water "" school, and so have we. We have had the policy written of by Arnold Foster, who believes in a small 'army, thoroughly well paid, and well equipped. Men cannot be 1 wish the Treasurer got to fight now under the conditions that prevailed twenty or thirty years ago.

Lord Roberts, believes in an army of something like 1,000,000. There have been various estimates of the number of troops that could be landed in the United Kingdom. We have had an estimate of 5> > and an esti000 mate of 70,000, which was considered by Mr Balfour, about which time Lord Roberts stated that 150,000 fully-equipped men eould be landed on the shores of the United Kingdom within thirty-six hours, and that the force required to repel them would be 600,000 Territorials. That was an estimate of four Territorials, or partially-trained men, as equal to one properlyequipped and fully-trained man. In regard to the efficacy of our system, we must remember' what has been said by experts in regard to partially-trained men. Lieutenant Pollock says thatHistory may be searched in vain for examples of volunteers, however brave and patriotic, defeating or holding their own against regulars, unless, having enormous numerical superiority, or the sea supremacy was lost. We were told some special advantage in. their favour. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Was that written since the South African war? the result of experience gained during the war. Lieutenant Pollock undertook to train, in six months men who would give their whole time to the work, and a. company, called the Spectator Company, was formed. It was in. that connection that he made the statement. I have read,, which, I believe, was justified by the event. We need to be sure that we are getting the best value tor our enormously increasing expenditure on. defence. Major-General Sir Edward: Hutton estimated that we need in peace 25,000 men, and in war 45,000. men. Lord Kitchener put the number at 127,000,. to make provision for reserves. He was considering, the Deakin policy, which is that, which we are now developing, and which would have given a land force of 88,000. Some years ago our Ministers were advised, apparently, that a. land force of 100,000 would be sufficient, and that for its maintenance'an expenditure of Â£1,500,000 was. required. That was in 1906-7. One of thc best foreshadowings of what was coming in defence, and what would be necessary, was made by Lieutenant-Colonel McCay, in. a speech delivered in this chamber in 1905, when he pointed out that it was certain and inevitable that our dedone by the last Government. fence, expenditure would increase. He was subsequently Minister of Defence, in the Liberal Government. He stated, that Major-General Hutton.'s estimate o4 ; Â£525,000 as the defence expenditure in 1905 for the equipment of the forts should be supplemented by additional expenditure amounting to Â£800,000; and his anticipations have heen more than borne out by the events. If,' as a non-expert, I were asked to offer an opinion, I should pin my faith to the encouragement of the Navy. We must never forget, in our military enthusiasm, that we are a sea State as well as a sea racea continent like the centre of the Imperial system, bound in by the triumphant sea; triumphant, too often, in the sense so well suggested by the ugly sights of Clarence's dreamMerhoueht T saw a thousand fearful' wracks'; A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon -, Wed""es of gold, ""reat anchors, heaps of pearl, Inrstimable stones, unvalued jewels,, All scattered in the bottom of the sea. Captain Creswell reported in 1.906tha* a land force of 40,000 would be useless until by the Prime Minister of the day that a large invasion was not to be expected; but that we must be prepared fbr sudden raids. The report of the Naval Officers in. 1906 stated, on the authority of Major-General Hutton, that in the absence of a requisite force in the Pacific, an expeditionary force of 30,000 or 40,000 men could carry with ease any of the Australian Capitals. Loud Kitchener, in a report signed 12th February, 19.10, said, "" It is. an axiom, held by the British Government, that the Empire's existence depends primarily on the maintenance of adequate and sufficient naval forces."" As long, as; that contention is fulfilled, as long as British superiority is assured, it is an accepted principle that no British Dominion can be successfully and permanently conquered, by an organized invasion from oversea. So. much for the opinion of experts. In all. human probability our defence, expenditure will be incieased. Major-General Edwards, a few years before Federation, said that the interests of the whole Continent demanded that railways to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other coloniesshould be made as soon as possible; We are beginning to expend money on one; and I hope that there will be no hesitation about commencing the other project.",21,Budget

In all probability there will be an increase in our military and in our naval expenditure, and, incidentally, in our expenditure on railway construction. will have to be spent on the Capital, though, perhaps, not large in comparison with these other expenditures. grudge the present expenditure on old age and invalid pensions, and possibly there will be an increase in the cost of the Public Service.

Personally, I disapprove of the latter. It would be far better, by our legislation, so far as this is possible, to improve industrial conditions, and to increase the means of the people, so that they may make this provision for themselves, than to debilitate character by giving monetary help in a country where it is not needed. although their earnings are poor and their conditions such as we deplore, the masses make-provision themselves for maternity allowances; and surely what is done in England can be done here. We should endeavour to increase the capacity of our people by wise legislation, co-operating with private enterprise. that? which our statesmen have to face; and it is a dimcult one. blunders, but we must do our best to approximately attain our ends. We shall never accomplish them absolutely. The aspiration' of Lear, that "" distribution should undo excess, and each man have enough,"" may never be f u l l y realized. But far more can be done than is done now, though our people will not have the spirit to accomplish it, if we debilitate their character by uncalled for subsidies, proposed, one might also say, in connection with party aims. The expenditure on the Postmaster-General's Department during the last eight or ten years has been legitimate. On the Department of External Affairs, Â£^532,000 has been spent. That expenditure could not be avoided, nor could the expenditure on other Departments A large sum incidental to our policy. We have been accused of undue extravagance, by comparing the Estimates made in 1897 with the I do not actual expenditure; but I say that the greater part of the actual expenditure could not have been avoided, because it was not intended that our policy should be stopped. Practically none of our The burden of what I have to say is that we must be cautious. When we increase our avoidable expenditure by maternal allowances and fancy schemes of that sort, we are not displaying that commendable caution which in our circumstances is These facts so necessary. In 1912 our revenue was Â£20,546,361. We must remember that The expendithe States use the same sources of taxation, excepting Customs and Exwhich falls on the same people, has risen from 14s. i d . per head in 1901-2, to 19s. per head in 1910-11. Some of the State sources, if they wish to avoid oppressive taxation, are nearly exhausted. They have nearly exhausted their stamp taxation and their income taxation-unles s it is wished to make the latter unduly burdensome-and the same may be said of their dividend Under Lloyd-George's scheme, taxes and land taxes, which, though moderate, perhaps, would reach very nearly the point of oppression if there were placed on top of them a Federal land tax of a progressive and rather severe incidence. As I mentioned, 58 per cent, of the revenue of purchasing the States is obtained from services; and they get 14 per cent, from the Commonwealth, so the shrinkage in our revenue will tell against us, and not very much against H o w can we do them. Both Commonwealth and States have to use sources of taxation that cannot be very much resorted to without almost reaching the point of We shall make many oppression.

54,Mr Glynn,"That is the problempractically the only source of revenue from the Commonwealth. In 1902-3 that revenue was Â£9,451,588, while in 1911-12 it was Â£14,710,199, or Â£ 2 8s. g\d. and Â£ 3 4s. 5^d. per head in each year respectively. There has been no substantial difference caused by any change in the Tariff as between 1906-7 and last year, so that the comparative results cannot be affected. It is significant, however, that in tralia amounted to ,Â£4,325,000, and on the ten months ending in April of this year, our imports were considerably less than the exports, whereas in the corresponding month of 1910-11 there was a substantial excess of imports over exports. The oniy conclusion I draw from this is that, inasmuch as imports are in excess now, it is almost certain that in the near future there will be a shrinkage of imports; and, if so. there must be a shrinkage in our Tariff revenue, which, as I said, is the only really was at one time a tax of 3 per cent, on the substantial source from which we can meet our largely increased expenditure. says that increased prosperity means increased revenue at the Customs House? ways considering what the character of the Tariff is. Personally, I believe that the more revenue items there are in the Tariff the better in the long run. I know there is a difference of opinion on this point, though at present we are letting the matter rest. There must be some cessation to the fight in controversial politics in order that we may push on with matters on which we are agreed. I am offering my personal qualifications of what has been said in regard to this matter; but if we are going in for a purely prohibitive Tariff, as some say we should, we shall have to find some source of revenue to take the place of the Customs; and that is one of the things to be remembered when the people are considering the parties who are entitled to their support at the coming elecmerly, and have to make corresponding tions. I do not desire to make any reference to the elections, but we heard a good deal last night on the effect of the speeches the note issue ought to belong to the bankin this debate on the elections next year. Our land tax cannot be regarded as a very reliable source of revenue. It is progressive ; and if it attains its object, it must issue was in the hands of the private banks. disappear as a revenue producing fax. It is not very productive at present, however heavy it may be in its incidence, the amount realized being, I believe, a little over Â£1,200,000. As to the note issue, I have heard credit claimed for the wonderful achievement of its introduction, and its effect on the revenue. On the 29th July, 1912, we were told in the Budget-papers that the note issue-it is called a ""circulation,"" which it is not-wa s Â£9.389,599, and that the interest on the investment, less expenses, was Â£156,880. The circulation is not given for this year; but in 1910, before the Commonwealth note issue was introduced, the note circulation in Austhis the State taxation of 2 per cent, fell, leaving out, of course, the note circulation in Queensland. This taxation of 2 per cent., together with the profits of the note issue in Queensland, realized for the States, in round figures, Â£95,000 in 1910. The circulation at the end of 1911, which, as I said, is not shown in the Budget-papers, was Â£41367,3971 or only a little more than that of 1910. There notes in one or more of the States; and it was given in evidence betore a Banking Commission some twenty years ago, that, without destroying the issue, the banks could bear such an impost. There is very little profit on the note issue as a rule, though the issue is a convenience and saving to the banking customers. The only difference made by the introduction of the Commonwealth note issue is that, instead of the States, which had not used their full power to tax the note issue, receiving ,Â£143,000 this year on the circulation of September, 1911, the Commonwealth Treasurer has received Â£156,000 at the expense of the States. As a matter of fact, this note issue is not producing anything more than it did before, because the additional Â£10,000 is more than counterbalanced by the inconvenience to the banks, which now have to keep a good deal more gold, or notes substituted for gold, and so involving loss of interest, than forcharges to their customers. It is held by all banking authorities that the profits of ing public; and, if that be true, the banking public have lost the convenience which they had in the way of profit when the note The simpler we can get results the better; and the fair way to get proper results out of the note issue was to tax it, and let it be regulated by the ordinary needs of commerce and exchange. In regard to the management of the note issue, we last year had an attempt to reduce the reserve. That",23,Budget
55,Mr Fenton,The honourable member,24,Budget
56,Mr Glynn,"It does undoubtedly, alattempt, however, has been postponed until after the election; so I suppose there is some excuse for alluding to the elections and effectively a policy of fixing prices, we endeavouring to educate the electors on the subject. I find that the reserves in all banks are increasing. I do not wish to go into the gold question, or otherwise I could quote figures which might throw some light on the export of gold this year. The latest figures I have show that the Bank of France, on the 12th January this year, had in coin and bullion Â£160,000,000, as against a circulation of Â£219,000,000, while the Bank of Germany, in round figures, had Â£59,000,000 in coin and bullion, as against an issue of Â£100,000,000. Thesefiguresare from the periodical tables published in the Economist. We cannot expect much profit on the Commonwealth Bank here, and I doubt whether such an institution was necessary as a central bank operating as the Bank of England does, if we assume that the Commonwealth Bank was instituted with a view of making it of the same type. What is going on in the Old Country is the consolidation of the banks; and I think that, during the last ten or twenty years, the number of banks in England has decreased by one-third. At the same time, however, the bank branches have increased in number, thus affording greater facilities to the public. The latest figures by mail in regard to banking profits show that thirty-nine banks in England average a profit of 15J per cent, on their capital. which the Commonwealth Rank is not to undertake-commercia l banking on a quick turnover and wonderful exchanges. On the figures published by the Treasurer last year, we find that twenty banks in Australia show a profit of 7.74 per cent, on their paid-up capital, but, taking into account capital and reserves, a profit of 5.77 per cent. There is not much scope for profit if we compare the profits of the twenty banks here with the profits of the banks, having regard to the different classes of business they do, in the United Kingdom. I notice that the Attorney-General recently spoke on the question of fixing prices; and this is another matter that may affect the revenue. I suppose that the Attorney-General spoke with Cabinet authority, and that the question has been mooted if it is not part of the policy of the Government. prices, we must either stop competitive imports or limit them. We cannot fix local prices without affecting the prices of commodities from other parts of the world, and the result is that, in order to carry out must stop imports by law, because the fixing of prices must affect Australia as a place to which the exports of other countries are sent. we can fix prices more easily. the machinery for fixing prices, but I am now dealing with the policy. The fixing of prices means making the prices lower than they are under competitive conditions; and the inevitable result must be to interfere with competitive imports. In order to make the plan thoroughly effective, we could, of course, exclude imports altogether ; and then the results would be perceptible in the Customs and Excise revenue. This brings me back to the necessity for caution in connection with our finances. Look at some of our policies which at present are not settled. The policy in connection with the sugar industry has decreased the revenue from Â£790,000, in T901-2, to Â£334,000 in 1910-11, taking into account Excise and Customs and deducting the bonus. This year, under peculiar circumstances, owing to the poor sugar crop, the position will be a little better; but the net revenue will still be only Â£480,000, instead of something like Â£1,000,000 under the old condition. Still, the sugar question is unsettled; and if , by This is commercial banking any adjustment we make, we are unsuccessful from a revenue point of view, all I can say is that our capacity to meet our increasing responsibilities will be correspondingly aftected. My whole object in speaking as I have done has been to indicate the necessity of avoiding extravagance. I do not wish to lay the blame for the figures, so far as they are the subject of blame, upon either side of the House. I do say, however, that some blame must be taken by the Government that introduces unnecessary and fanciful policies, vvhich must certainly develop our expenditure, and make the pace even much faster than it is at the present time. What we ought to do is to recognise the legitimate expenditure on defence, and obtain from the Government a report that will show to what extent the system that we are supporting by our large expenditure is successful. Having done that, we ought If we fix to see whether a modification of policy will give us, on the whole, better value for our money. I do not wish to detain honourable members any longer.

I am rather inclined to think that fhe last word has not yet been spoken in reference to the defence of Australia. There is undoubtedly a great deal to be said regarding the honourable member's remarks as to the amount that we should spend in connection with our land and sea defences. There can be no doubt that we must all look forward in the future to an increased military expenditure. It is possible that some mistakes may be made. We have ample funds at the present time, and there is, perhaps, a temptation for any Government with ample funds to be rather lavish in its expenditure. There is also a tendency, I do not say on the part of naval men, but undoubtedly on the part of military men, to magnify their office, and to be constantly going with demands for an increased, expenditure to the man who has the misfortune to be Minister of Defence There will always be a tendency in that direction, and I am afraid, whether it be popular or unpopular, that we shall have to realize that we must share in the duty of defending the Empire by providing, out of our own pockets, for the defence of our own hearths and homes. That fact, however, does not prevent honourable members and the public generally irom insisting that our money shall be spent judiciously, and upon that arm of the service that is likely to give us the best results. 1 have no desire to follow the honourable member for Angas in his criticism of the policy of the Government in regard to the note issue. The subject has already been amply dis cussed m this Parliament, and for that reason, and not because of any disrespect to my honourable friend, I shall not further allude to it, except to say that there may be a great deal of truth in his criticism that the States have lost a lot, while the Commonwealth has gained from the note issue. the States having lost. that the States have lost a lot of revenue, and that the Commonwealth has largely gained.

Yet the owners of it do not directly contribute a shilling to the fund which guards it against confiscation. "" Confiscation"" refers, of course, to the case of an invasion, when property would have to pay the war indemnity; while, of course, if the defenders were totally defeated, its value to its present owners would probably be nilThe whole case might be allowed to rest on, the statement of this pregnant fact. At4 per cent., annum. Three-fourths of it probably earns more than 4 per cent., because Government securities yield almost that rate on an 'average, anil the return from private investments is generally a point or two higher. Now, it may be admitted that if this wealth were held in equal or nearly equal shares by the units of the community, there would be no great hardship in paying for.defence out of indirect taxation. But it is notorious that the wealth of this country is held by comparatively few individuals. Coghlan points out that in 1003 half the private wealth of New South Wales was owned by some 3,000 persons. ' The figures he supplies suggest that his estimate was well within the mark. The assessment was Â£368,778,000, of which 8i per cent., or Â£300,000,000, belonged to 3,073 individuals. The rest of the population of New South Wales, numbering 1,424,269, possessed less than 19 per cent, of the wealth-unde r Â£69,000,000. wealth and population of aU Australia, it will be seen that 8,450 persons own Â£810,000,000; while the remaining Â£190,000,000 is divided amongst 3,918,540 persons. Carrying the analysis further, as Coghlan's researches enable us to do, the results are even more striking. In 1903, New South Wales contained 739,589 adults, of whom no less than 544,972, or nearly 75 per cent., possessed no property whatever. corresponding numbers for the Commonwealth would be-tota l adults, 1,308,000; adults without property, 981,000. Here it may be remarked that the word "" a d u l t "" is not the equivalent of "" breadwinner,"" since there are many breadwinners who have not reached adult age. As every 100 adults maintain 125 dependants, it follows lhat 2,635,000 persons must be deducted from the number who own the ,Â£190,000,000 worth of property. So that the anomaly may be more clearly perceived, let me summarize the position :Owned by 8,450 persons-Â£810,000,000 . Owned by 1,283.540 persons-Â£190,000,000 . Owned by 2,635,000 persons-nil. Totals-(population) , 3,026,990; (wealth), Â£1,000,000,000. It is, unfortunately, not possible by any data from Coghlan to trace further the distribution of the Â£190,000,000. A more exhaustive examination would probably disclose that the owners do not exceed half-a-million persons. Indeed, this conclusion is strengthened by a study of the annual incomes of the people, so far as statistics are available. The census of 1901 fixed the number of breadwinners in the Commonwealth at 1,652,280. Allowing for the increase in population since igoi, the total breadwinners should now be 1.684,000. As the position of the Commonwealth is substantially reflected in that of one of the older States, the statistics of Victoria, which are the completest available, may be used as a measure of the incomes of the 000,000,000 will earn Â£40,000,000 per Australian people. The standard may not be absolutely exact, but Victorian conditions do not differ so materially from those of the other States as to vitiate the estimate. As. the Victorian quota of our total population is about 30 per cent., the number of breadwinners in this State may be taken at slightly over 505,000. Yet the. last income tax returns, igoo-7, show that only 8.7 per cent, of the breadwinners, that is, 44,262 persons, earned sufficient to warrant atMr tention from the Income Tax Commissioner. This leaves 461,000, or over 91 per cent, of the breadwinners in this State, whose earnings did not reach the taxable minimum of Â£ 1 5 1 . In come tax is collected on wages, salaries, fees, profits, and other earnings-""persona l exertion"" is the orthodox term-bu t the tax is also collected on incomes from property. Now, we find Applying this deduction to the that, excluding those who pay on property income, the number of Victorian income taxpayers dwindles down to 39,753, or 7.9 per cent, of the total breadwinners. Thus we see that oa out of every ioo engaged in industry receive less than Â£151 per annum, a fact which deserves the strongest emphasis. The returns show that Â£12,709,857 earned by personal exertion was The taxed, of which 34,822 persons earning under Â£500 yearly paid on Â£5,086,688; and 4,031 persons earning over Â£500 annually paid on Â£7> 3> 9As to property, 8,348 persons paid 62 l6 on an income of Â£2,929,544. The significance of these results will be annarent at a glance. An income of over l o j millions was received by property owners and others earning over Â£500 annually; while a group nominally over four times greater divided little more than five millions. As this latter group includes all receiving from Â£151 up to Â£500, the lutter being an exceptional income, it is a fair inference that the bulk of the taxpayers in this proup earn less than Â£250 per annum. Had the statistics shown the number who pay on earnings between Â£151 and Â£300, the disparity in the incomes of the several groups would be still more pronounced. However, in the incomplete form chosen by the Government Statist, the Victorian results prove that the masses, who pay so much for the protection of wealth, possess an insignificant share of it.' In the following table, 1 have sought to apply.the Victorian data to the population of the Commonwealth.

We have seen that Coghlan estimates the capital value of land and improvements at nearly 684 millions , -which, at 4 per cent., would give Â£27,360,000 annually. of twenty ancl a h a l f million s in the annual revenue mean that three-fourths of the land and improvements earn nothing? Such an assumption is negatived by common knowledge. Or is it that ownership is spread over so many in d ividuals lhat the income of each does not reach the taxable minimum ? That theory is contradicted by the officially attested fact that 75 per cent, of the adults in t h is' community possess no property whatever. A more likel y solution, Taxable income.

From this it is clear that a tax on land and improvements throughout Australia, if based on that of Victoria, would permit five owners out of six to evade their l i a b i l it y to the community. What emerges from a review of Interesting as these the position is briefly this : T h a t a large m a j o r it y of adults possess no property at a l l ; that as to the remainder, those of small incomes are in vast preponderance; and that the lion's share of the wealth belongs to a very smal l group numerically. I have referred to that speech for the sake Does the discrepancy in the return of the data it gives. In 1903 the wealth of Australia was in the hands of a comparative few; a section of the community was possessed of property, but a much larger section had none at all. That is practically the position to-day, as is borne out by the following figures, which are to be found in Part II . of the Victorian Year Book for this year1911, BASED ON TNCOME OF IQIO .

On the occasion of the next Budget, or the next issue of the Year-Book much more information should be given on this score than we have hitherto had. present we are simply told that the income tax in Australia yields Â£ 1 , 4 3 2 , 2 7 1 . What on earth is the value of that? Such a return as I suggest could, I think, quite well be made up, and would prove infinitely useful. We ought to be told, for instance, how many pay income tax between Â£ 1 5 6 , or whatever is the minimum, and Â£ 2 0 0 , and so on, for every Â£ 2 0 0 additional income, until, perhaps, incomes of Â£ 1 , 5 0 0 a year are reached. No information is required or desired about individuals, but only as to groups and classes of individuals, in order to show by whom the income of the Commonwealth is really earned. I admit that there may be some difficulty about the matter; but we Australians are accustomed to meet difficulties. The income of Australia in 1903 we estimated at Â£1,000,000,000 , and I estimate the income to-day at between Â£ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 and work. that. This is a matter which is in no sense a party one; and in discussing this and similar questions we ought to have some source of information utterly irrespective of party. Of course, such information need not be mathematically correct, but it ought to be reliable and present the position. The incidence of taxation ought to be adjusted. From this Â£1,300,000,000 I contend that at least Â£5,000,000 should be obtained by way of income tax, relieving to that extent the pressure on those who now pay the greater part of the Customs and the Excise duties. I say, unhesitatingly, that more than two-thirds of the Customs and Excise revenue is provided by those people who do not pay any income tax. member desires to know is what proportion of taxation falls on each section of the community. we talk about our advancement and improved conditions of life, we ought, at the same time, to see that the incidence of taxation is adjusted. the view that every one should pay income [91]2 tax, but we should, as I say, look to the income tax to provide at least Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 of the revenue now obtained through the Customs House. Of course, this income, taxation is a province of the State Governments for all practical purposes; and I admit that there may be difficulties in the: In the Year-Book at way. At any rate, the information 1 have suggested should be provided, and the people of the country educated so that they may be able to say what alteration, if any, should be made. Undoubtedly there is no justice or equity in the way in which the burden of taxation is distributed at the. present time. But from time immemorial,: in various parts of the Empire, the masses, have been regarded as those on whom taxation should f a l l. Of course, in the past there have been propertied Parliaments,, composed of well-to-do people, who ran the government in their own interests, though 1 do not say that that has been theintention of the Governments of the Commonwealth. We have, however, a tendency to run on the beaten track; but the time has arrived when the people of the country should be consulted. We shall be very lucky, as Australians, if we are never called upon to make a bigger sacrifice than to proÂ£1,300,000,000. vide, out of income tax, Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 of the revenue now raised through Customs and Excise. Of course, it is not my businessto set forth in detail how this change can I quite admit be brought about, seeing that 1 have no official information, and at present am really groping in the dark. The Year-Book, for informative purposes on this point, is simply useless; everything is averaged so that, even the aggregate income of the country is parcelled out so as to make it appear that every man, woman, and child earns a certain part of it. Averages in groups is scientific and accurate, but the old method has nothing to commend it. For instance,, we are told in the Year-Book that in the year 1910 tbere were 286,831 people employed in the various factories in the Commonwealth, and that they earned an aggregate of Â£23,874,959. That is all we are to l d ; and it appears to me almost as if there had been a deliberate policy on the part of statisticians to show all the avethe honourable rages that tend to show the wealth of the community, but never any that disclose the actual conditions. I do not profess to be a statistician, but if we average that inWhen come at Â£ 9 0 a year for adult men, Â£ 5 0 ayear for adult women, and 5s. a week for the youngsters, we find that considerably, more than Â£24,000,00 0 would be required^ I do not agree with to pay them.

85,Mr Archibald,"Exactly.we are simply to have set forth the revenue and expenditure, it might as well just be laid on the table and left for us to read at our leisure. VVe hear a great deal about the increased cost of living, but we are given no authoritative information on the point. Under the British Board of Trade the prices of commodities, wholesale and retail, are shown on what is called an index number. The Board takes a dozen or more of the leading commodities, such as bread, meat, sugar, rice, and so forth, which find their way into the homes of rich and poor alike, and average the price over seven years, the price thus obtained being used as an index number by means of which the prices for fifty years past may be readily ascertained. Why should we not have a similar plan in Australia ? Of course, it may be said that the Statistician sends out a number of queries with a view to eliciting information; but everybody is not prepared to reply, if about three times as many queries as Two or three intelligent clerks, familiar with the community in which they were living, could easily, secure, within a few months, tables of these prices. authorities do not know how to obtain the information in Australia, let them ascertain through the High Commissioner how the work is done by the British Board of Trade. addition, a table showing how our progress is made up-whethe r in price increase or volume increase. need all the information it is possible to obtain. If we secure it, Labour men and Liberals alike will be in a better position to ascertain the actual position. We shall then have scientific data on which to adjust the incidence of taxation. As it is, we have none. All that we can say is that we have followed the beaten track which has been pursued for many years, and that what has been good enough for our predecessors must be good enough for us. us. that it is; nor do I think that the Opposi-' tion will say that it is good enough for them. I have no desire to reflect on the statistical information before us as to the number of horses, cats, and dogs in the Commonwealth. Such information is certainly interesting, but it does not help us much in ascertaining the real prosperity of the community, nor does it help us in adjusting taxation. One would think that the necessity for further information in regard to the estates of deceased persons would be recognised in the Government Statist's office. It would be of great value, not only to the public men of Australia, but to literary men and other inquirers, if tables were prepared showing the number of estates of deceased persons of the value of Â£500, and the number of the value of Â£1,000, Â£5,000, and Â£10,000, and upwards. We all know of many people who have but little property, and of others who have a few hundred pounds in excess of the amount at which estates are brought under review. Detailed information such as 1 have suggested would be very valuable. There aie two methods of ascertaining the wealth of the community-one , by calculating on the income tax returns, and the only because there are usually other by recourse to the value of the prothere is any necessity for. perty of deceased persons. The results so obtained should balance within a million or so. I have here some figures as to the value ot the estates of deceased perI f the sons in 1906 and 1910 which have been prepared according to the principle laid down by some of the old economists, and favoured very strongly by Mr Chiozza Money. This principle is based on the fact that there has been a demise of the Crown eight times in the past 200 years, or once in twenty-five years, and taking the mean of a large number of actual cases it is estimated that, on the average, estates change hands every thirty We years by reason of the decease of their proprietors. Taking the estates of some of the nobility in England, it is found that they change hands in this way every thirty or thirty-one years. Mr Chiozza Money, in his work Riches and Poverty, estimates that the change takes place once in thirty years, and it is assumed that there are thirty living property owners for every one who dies. The idea is not original. It was followed by some of the older economists forty years ago, and it affords a rough-and-ready method, possibly open to objection, of ascertaining the wealth of the community. I am satisfied that the income tax returns of Australia are considerably undervalued, and that the position is the same in regard to the estates of deceased persons which come under review. There must be an immense number of deeds of",31,Income From Property

All that we desire is to secure facts so reliable as to provp of considerable educational value to justify their use in making calculations. To return, however, to the system which I was describing, let me say that, in order to ascertain the wealth of the community on the principle I have stated, you ascertain the values of the estates of deceased persons in any one year, and multiply thai value by thirty, on the assumption that there are thirty living property owners tor that he has discussed a very important every one who dies. Proceeding on that basis, we find that in 1906 the wealth of Australia was Â£570,000,000. In 1910 the value ot the estates oi deceased persons was if indirect, bearing upon our nnancial disÂ£22,000,000, and that amount, multiplied by thirty, shows us that the wealth of Ausbe summed up in the Budget presented tralia ini that year was Â£660,000,000. This calculation cannot be mathematically accurate, but it shows that since 1906 there questions of the day and their relation to has been an increase of Â£90,000,000 in the value of property in Australia. Has there been a corresponding increase in the case of those who do not pay income tax? Here, as in England, a clear-cut line can be drawn between those who pay income tax and those who do not, and we ought to have information which would enable us to ascertain what has been the increase in the wealth ot both sections of the community. If the information for which I asked were furnished, as it should be, by the Statistical Department, we should be in a position to analyze tliese figures, and to prove troni them the comparative increase of the wealth of the community. I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer, and I must apologize for having read at length from the speech delivered' by the honourable member for Coolgardie. My object was to get into Hansard some data which would be useful to honourable members. There is no reason why this should be made a party question. We never know when the fortunes of war may lead to honourable members opposite returning to ofiice, and the Treasurer of the day, whoever he is, should be possessed of information which will enable him every' year in delivering his Budget statement to show the amount of wealth that has been earned in the community. Information so obtained would be valuable to us in adjusting taxation. If the community are satisfied with existing conditions, and with the present incidence of taxation, well and good; but neither honourable members nor literary men would be disadvantaged by having at their disposal valuable information of the character to which I have referred. I am confident that they would the public at large, and would save honourable members a great deal of time and labour in dealing with phases of public policy that we are anxious to bring before the people for the benefit of Australia. [4.51] I am sure that all who have listened to the honourable member will agree question. Although it may be, from one point of view, somewhat foreign to ^the Budget, it certainly has a very important, cussions. All our policies are supposed to from time to time, and 1 agree that the more light is thrown upon the economic social weltare the better it must be for the community. I should welcome nothing better than some statement such as the honourable member has indicated, and which ought not to be impossible at this time of day in Australia. I am looking forward to a great development of our statistical literature, and am one of those who believe that statistical literature can be turned into a more practical channel than that in which it is at present. I have been trying to look up some statistics in connection with the Budget, and have found it impossible to get anything later than figures some twelve or eighteen months old. One has to search and discriminate and distinguish before one can get hold of the real facts of the situation as they present themselves to-dav, and even when one has done one's best, one has to draw inferences, and, shall I say, make guesses at some of the facts. That ought not to be. We ought to get a little nearer to the time in which we are living, so far as our current statistics are concerned, than we are able to do at present. The honourable member has done good service in calling attention to this aspect of affairs, and I hope that his remarks will -bear good fruit. We have had on this Budget a number of speeches of great utility and importance, but largely of a general character. Listening to speeches like that which we have just heard, one might imagine that",32,Income From Property
90,Dr. Maloney,"In the case of Victoria,",33,Income From Property
91,Mr Archibald,That may be so;,33,Income From Property
92,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"there Svas nothing in the Budget to discuss in detail. I desire to make an effort to bring back the Committee to the details of this Budget, because, after all, that is the matter immediately important to us, and with which we have immediately to do. When the financial statement was being delivered, I remarked that it was more of a' political than a financial Budget, and despite the censure to which I have been subjected by the honourable member for to risk the surface of the political waters. I say here and now. that I think this is a political Budget, framed with an eye to the election that is so soon to come upon us. How else may we account for the belated appearance of the baby bonus ? Why has it taken the Government nearly three years to discover that it was necessary? The whole matter has been agitated for many a long year up and down this country, but only now, on the eve of the election,, does it make its appearance in the Budget, and then only in a tentative form. says the matter has been agitated in this country for years; did he ever speak in favour of the baby bonus anywhere? lighted to have a dialogue with the honourable member if time permitted, but I hope he will excuse me on this occasion, as my time is limited. The matter' has been agitated in the community for many years, aud it is only on the near approach of the general election that the baby bonus appears in the Budget. We are told nothing about it by the Prime Minister except that I think he said it was to be paid on the registration of the child. Quite a crop of questions will need to be very seriously considered before we commit the country to an expenditure of this kind. For instance, is the money to be paid prior to the birth of the child ? that will not help the birth of any more babies. Neither will it, so far as I know, tend to the birth of better babies. l t may be paid a long time affer birth, if it is to be paid on registration. What about the child which does not live at all after birth? Is the money to be paid in that case? I am only throwing these matters out because they will have to be seriously considered when the Bill which crystallizes this important part of Ministerial policy comes down. We shall want to know from my honourable friends opposite something about the non-discrimination between children. What is to be our relation to the man who is responsible for bringing an illegitimate into the world? Are we going to relieve him of his responsibility? Are we going to relieve him entirely of what he has done to put a stigma on the child? that statement, even at the the father, that places the stigma on the of ruffling, just a little, child. gesting a few of the questions that will have to be faced. Then there is the question of who is to get the money. Is it to go to the father ? Is it to go to the authorities of a lying-in home? What is to be the position of the doctor or the nurse? A group of questions of this kind obtrude themselves when we come to discuss the matter seriously. Its consideration also leads to the consideration of that larger question of eugenics, and the relation of the State to the character of the child. The Home Secretary in Great Britain has just put through a very drastic and important Bill bearing on the question of the relationship of the sexes to each other by ties of marriage. All this means that my honourable friends opposite have, in my judgment, deemed this a very good piece of business to propose to the House, in view of what is coming. Otherwise we should have known something more about it. We should have had some scheme submitted before we were asked to vote the money. vote the money. provided in the Budget; and we are asked to vote it before the Bill is passed. We are asked to affirm the principle before we know anything about the measure or its details. That is not treating the House fairly, and the fact that the proposal is so belated as to prevent the possibility of our exercising our responsibilities as guar.dians of the taxpayers' money is an indication, to my mind, that the Ministerial party think it a good proposal to make in the present circumstances. The Budget isplentifully bestrewn with other items, like the Socialistic laundry which the Minister of External Affairs is going to set up in the Northern Territory.

In addition, there are all the Socialistic enterprises in connection with the various Departments which are not intended to have any serious effect for a long time to come. They are just little bits of things dropped out here and there through the whole of the Budget, and one cannot resist the conclusion that they have been put in tor political purposes only, and in view of the election that is immediately ahead. I must, therefore, hold to my statement that I think the Budget has a very strong political significance in its make-up and presentation. I am glad, as all honourable members are, that we are living in piping times of prosperity, and that the seasons are still good, although they seem to have been modified a little, judging by the Estimates presented to us. I should like to remark in passing that already some of the champions of the Government have claimed that the figures -show the success of government in Australia as contrasted with the times of previous Governments, and the revenues earned and expended in previous years. If the Government are going to lay claim to the prosperity which has come upon the country for the last two years, surely they will take the blame of the falling revenue which they predict in this year. If they take the good years, I hope they will take the bad. If they will persist in saying that they have brought about these piping times of prosperity of Australia, with our rolling revenues and our equally rolling expenditures, I trust they will forgive us if we suggest that it is their fault that this year we are to have a falling revenue. Some reference has been made to the tremendous exports and imports of the country. I am glad to see both of them. They mean prosperity. They mean a full basket and store for all the workers and others in Australia, as far as it is possible to secure it. of the tale from yesterday I may criticise honourable members about fiscal matters, it does not lie in the honourable member's mouth to do so. members will recollect the strong Free Trader of only a few years ago, but hear him now, as I heard him at the last Chamber of Commerce banquet in Sydney, talking as though he had been a Protectionist all his life I you. there. The honourable member told those present what "" we "" were going to do in the shape of Protection, so soon as ""we ""' had taken care that the worker had got his fair share. want to do the honourable member any injustice, but the major fact remains that he promised that he would give them any amount of Protection. Whoever else, therefore, may criticise honourable members on the fiscal question, my honourable friend has done a little adjustment on his own account during the last few years. While the imports have been large, 1 fail to discover how they have adversely affected our industrial interests. I am speaking now in general terms. ferent from what your leader said yesterday. what is said. I am only putting my own reading of these facts. When I look at the industrial facts as they relate even to the State of VictoriaI have not had time to collect them, so far as the other States goI find that the factories in Victoria are full almost to bursting point. What is the use of blinking these facts? In two years, owing to nothing that my. honorahle friends opposite have done, there has been an increase in the employees in the factories in Victoria of 8,100. There has been an increase in the wages paid of Â£1,220,000. There has been an increase in the value of the materials used of Â£3,279-000. There has been an increase in the value of articles produced or work done of nearly Â£6,000,000 in those two years. The figures as a whole indicate a state of healthy normal advance all along the line. Honourable members have said that we have nothing but a revenue Tariff. That has been said a number of times over there as well as over here, and will be said again before this debate is over by the champion Protectionists on the other side, but, so far as I can ascertain, we have in Australia a Tariff that, taken Honourable altogether, is not far, if at all, behind the Canadian Tariff.

While employment outside the Service is increased, the number of public servants has also increased. Whatever other distinction this Ministry may have, it will always be remembered for having appointed a larger number of persons, at larger salaries, than was appointed by any of its predecessors. A return laid on the table the other day shows that, whereas within the last two years the Public Service Commissioner has appointed fifty-six persons, at an average salary of Â£430, Ministers have appointed 134 persons, at an average salary of Â£558. This is a matter which should be inquired into. hands a patronage such as should not exist under the Commonwealth regime. appointments have been Defence appoinments. do not think that the Defence Department is responsible for a large proportion of them. ployes of the Commonwealth Public Service have increased by 2,316, and the temporary employees by over 3,000. We have now between 37,000 and 38,000 Commonwealth public servants, and do not seem to have come to the end of the appointments. According to the Estimates, there are 112 public servants in the Northern Territory, .where the white population is only about 900. I do not say that the salaries paid It all means thut we are in to these persons are too high. said the other night that some of them are too low. ments to the Public Service should be scrutinized closely. The Commissioner is not now controlling nearly half of them. Our facHe is responsible for about 16,000 publie servants, and Ministers for 20,000. We have, therefore, to make up our minds whether the principle of control by a Commissioner is to be applied effectively, or whether the Service is to be permitted to gradually drift into the patronage of Ministers. I believe that While our revenue has been booming, our expenditure has been booming still more, and we propose to spend next year over ,Â£22,000,000, of which ^2,000,000' But that inquiry should be is a surplus from last year. turned to the States. wealth will get rid of Â£22,000,000, and the amount received by the States will only be a trifle more than they received. last year, whereas our expenditure will be increased by some millions. In times of prosperity, Governments usually put their surplus revenue out of the way, to preserve Ministers from the temptation to squander it. The money is used for purposes of liquidating liabilities, the reduction of debts, the construction of public works, and schemes of development of a special character, and is sometimes put into trust funds, so that it cannot be got at. Statutes have been passed in many of the States to enable surpluses to be dealt with Ministers are getting into their in this way. This Government does not believe in these practices. It carries millions forward year after year. If anything would tend to extravagance, it is that policy. Last year the Government collected fiom the taxpayers 9s. 2d. per head more than was needed to govern the country, money which might well have been left in the pockets of the taxpayers. From each family, 45s. more was taken than was In two years the permanent emneeded to govern the country.

Therefore, those honourable members would abolish the Customs revenue, and raise Â£14,000.000 more by direct taxation. I challenge them to put that in their programme at the next election. The same thing has been said by many members opposite, and by responsible Ministers, who have pledged themselves to go to any lengths when they can get new Protection. It is only right, therefore, that this should be in their platform, so that the people may know exactly the issues that are being put before them in regard to finance.

152,Mr Jensen,"Al l this shows that therenot; but, in any case, the interjection is irrelevant. I may say that I take these figures from page 59 of the Budget-papers. In South Australia. I find that, during the nine years, there has been an average increase of 3s. sJd. per week, and in Western Australia an average increase of is. 6^d. per week. In other words, on the average, on the figures here presented, the wages in the Service are less than in 1906-7, and just about the same as they were in 1907-8. There has really been no average increase in the pay of postal employees; there have been sectional increases of course, but, owing to the great number of people employed, the average pay is just about what it was five years ago. The deficit of the Department this year represents 6s. <gd. per head; or, in other words, it will require each family in the community to pay Â£ i 13s. 9d. in order to balance the ledger. It is said that the taxpayer must bear all this burden for the sake of posterity; but my opinion is that this Â£ 1 13s. 9d., and his share of the -surplus, of which we have heard, ought to ,go to the support of his family. I find that for the Defence Department it is proposed to vote Â£750,000 more than Lord Kitchener estimated would be the cost -of the institution of the new defence scheme. He said that when in full working order it should cost just about what I had estimated it would cost before he arrived here.

Minister, whom the honourable member praises so much, in the scheme which he detailed to the country when he was previously in office. Does the honourable member desire that scheme? If he does, I will give it to him, so that he may study it. The present Minister of Defence went into details in the scheme in question, showing that no man was to be compulsorily trained after reaching the age of twenty years. When my Bill was being put through the Senate, he did not desire that a man who had reached twenty years of age should be required to undergo more than four days' training per annum. It was his opinion some two years ago that four days constituted a sufficient training; but after Lord Kitchener came here, he became a glutton for training, and provided for the system now in force. Honourable members had better let that defence scheme alone, because before the close of the. session I intend to occupy an hour and a half in telling them the facts of the case. When I do, I shall surprise them, and surprise none more than the Prime Minister, who is now smiling. Only a few years have elapsed since the right honourable member declared that not more than Â£500,000 a year-should be spent on the land defences of Australia. We shall hear him. boasting presently all over the country what he has done for the defence of the Commonwealth; but he will never refer to his Gympie speech, or to the speech that he made in this House four or five years ago. He will take care to quote me, but will not quote his own remarks of those days. I shall oblige him, however, with a few facts. Here are three items worthy of consideration. First of all, we have the PosHere we have the statement of tal Department, which, in my judgment, is taking from every man, woman, and child in the community 6s. 9d. to square accounts.

That need not have been taken from the pockets of the people whilst the defence scheme is costing 3s. 2d., per head more than Lord Kitchener said it ought to cost.

That is one of the elements that are vitiating the finances of the Commonwealth, and have led to this burden being placed upon the taxpayers. The sooner the system is placed upon a business-like basis-the sooner the taxpayers know that they are paying more than they need for the adequate discharge of governmental functions-the better for themselves, their pockets, and their families. I say that this is extravagant finance. Time after time honourable members opposite have asked us to point to an item tnat we would strike off. Here is a sum of over Â£4,000,000, much of which, I say, is due to extravagant and unbusiness-like financing on the part of the Government. member borrow? ordinary business methods to the business of the Commonwealth. member borrow? party returns to office.

I have not time to go into all details even if I wished to do so. Indeed, I recognise no obligation on the part of any member of the Opposition to give honourable members opposite all the details of the statements we are making. It is sufficient that we make out a case for inquiry and investigation, and the sooner we have a Finance Committee the sooner will the experience of the House be harnessed'to our financial car, and the sooner shall we be settling down to a safe method of financing the Commonwealth. It is true, as the honourable member for Corangamite said last night, that a tremendous amount has been expended on the defence of Australia during the current three years. The honourable member said, "" Only Â£9,000,000 was spent in the first nine years of Federation, whereas we have spent over ,Â£12,000,000 in the three current years."" Who was responsible for the failure to spend more during the first nine years of Federation? The fact is that honourable members opposite would not permit more to be spent. They were not in office, but they were in power, and they would not permit the money lo be spent. . proposed to spend it. way which I shall set before the Committee. I do not make statements without having authority for them, and I make the broad, general statement that, honourable members opposite were responsible for the starving of the .defences of Australia for the first eight or nine years of Federation. The present Prime Minister said, in 1903Personally, I think that Â£500,000 is ample toexpend on our Defence Forces. Mr Watson, then Leader of the Labour party, took the same view. When opposing the ratification of the Naval Agreement with Great Britain, he said that he opposed it, not that he did not appreciate -the value of having a sea-going squadron here, but because in his view it was absolutely essential that all the money we could', spare for naval defence should for some time to come be devoted to putting the harbors in an impregnable state. It was useless, he said, to talk about defending the coasts of Australia with one squadron. The money which was then devoted to the auxiliary squadron, and additional money, should be devoted annually to provide a proper floating harbour defence right round the coast. These are the schemes which were in the minds of my honourable friends opposite a few years ago. They' sing a different tune now, and I wonder that they do not talk with a shamed face when they try to show that some honourable members of the Opposition have changed their opinions of recent years.

The Prime Minister himself just about this time declared emphatically in this House that he would not subscribe to compulsion of any kind in connection with the Defence Forces of Australia. I have had statements thrown at me so often that I think it about time a reply was made. I have excellent company in all these matters. Let me quote what the present Prime Minister said in the days to which I have just referred. I should not make this quotation, but that the other day the Minister of Defence quoted with great gusto some remarks that I made about the same time. He thought that he had scored a great triumph over my humble self in quoting something I had said as to compulsion. mine a few years ago, in reply to the honourable member for West Sydney, when he was agitating those crazy schemes of his, the principle of which has been adopted, although the schemes themselves have been heaved overboard. I then ventured to say that the time was not ripe for compulsion as applied to our military defences. ripe then; but it has since ripened. feel a little lonely in this regard; I need some company, and I had better make this quotation from a speech made by the present Prime MinisterThis is not a joking matter. He was chiding his then leader, Mr my honourable friend, and he can make as Watsonand I venture to tell the Leader of the Labour party that it is not a question to be dealt with without an appeal to the electors. . . . Here we have a proposal which has not been discussed by the people, but which is of the very first importance. It should be carefully put before the electors before it is dealt with by us. . . I seriously protest against the proposal to compel young men to undergo continuous training for a fortnight in three consecutive years. The right honourable member was not content with that statement, but went on to say that he would not adopt the principle of compulsion-that even after it had been submitted to the electors he would not then support the principle of compulsory training. was then no more ardent denunciator of the principle of compulsory training than was the present Prime Minister. When next his Minister of Defence sets out to quote opinions of mine in regard to defence, let him quote his own, and I shall also quote the opinions of members of his own party. No man has been more patient with this Government in matters of defence than I have. Year after year I have put up with complete misrepresentation, and have always said that, so long as the Government would carry through honestly this scheme of defence, which is not theirs, and never will be patent this scheme, because it was the late Government that put it into operation. would nail your colours to the naval subsidy. of the statements I have let go.

Next time he goes about mouthing it, will he tell the public also that I advocated at that time the beginning of an Australian Navy in I addition? That is the part they all leave out. My position was very clear at that time. I was in favour of something substantial being done immediately to meet the menace which was abroad at that time regarding doings in the North Sea. I tell much out of it as he likes, that I feel convinced that something will have to be done shortly by the Empire as a whole to meet that growing menace in the North Sea. worry about there. to worry about when your margin is reduced to 60 per cent. ?

We shall be allowed to possess ourselves in peace only so long as we can .compel it with our Dreadnoughts and our land defences. are spending too much on the defence system, or that we are collecting too much from the people of Australia for the purpose. honourable member understands that we can have efficiency and economy. That is all I am suggesting. that our efficiency is more than it ought to be. I am suggesting that perhaps it is less. efficiency with extravagance. The honourable member has had an excellent experience oi that in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department. Money is being poured out like water there. There is a debit of .Â£1,500,000 on the Department this year, and yet there is no extravagance in the paying of wages in the Department, as 1 have just shown. Whoever else is getting this money, the employees are not, and altogether in that Department there is still the most tremendous problem of management that the Commonwealth has yet faced. It is not getting any easier. It is not being solved at all. It is not even being touched, nor will it be until there is an entirely different attitude on the part of the Government in power towards the conditions that are occurring there. Efficiency does not mean extravagance. It does not require a huge spending of money. Lord Kitchener said the whole of the new land defence scheme could be carried through for practically the amount that I had already arranged for in connection with my scheme. I know of no better authority on military expenditure in the Empire than Lord Kitchener, and, in his report, after going carefully into the matter with all the officers of the Defence Department who were responsible for defence finance, he made the statement that Â£1,884,000 per annum would suffice for the whole scheme when in full working order. Yet this year no less than Â£2,550,000 is set down for land defence alone. I am not criticising these things adversely, but am calling attention to them, because they want explaining. I have an idea that a good deal of that money is special defence expenditure, which, when the scheme is in full working order, can be dispensed with. it is so, but I do not know it. Is it not the duty of the Minister, when he asks us to vote Â£700,000 more than is required for the scheme in full working order, according to Lord Kitchener, to tell us what that special expenditure is for? How much is normal? How far is Lord Kitchener out . with respect to the ordinary pay and emoluments of the Forces, and the general expense of running them? How much has been added on to the cost of running the I am not suggesting Forces, and is it necessary for the purpose of securing efficiency ? These are questions which we have a.right to put to the Minister, and a right to have answered when we are asked to vote all these millions for Defence. I hope I shall not be accused of an act of sacrilege in venturing a criticism of this kind on tlie Defence Department. Every other Defence Department in the world is raked every year with regard to its expenditures, and they ought to be when expenses are piling up in this way. It is the duty of the Government to justify every Â£ 1 they spend. If they do so, I believe that this House will always be generous in the way it votes money for Defence, because there has been an awakening in Australia in this matter. We have all changed our tune, and we may as well admit it. It does not lie in the mouth of the present Minister to quote what other people have done. We were all in that business, and none more so than members of the present Government. A word in conclusion about the policy of this Budget. The land tax, which is a serious item in the Budget, was going to do a lot of things. It is giving us this year as much revenue as it did at the beginning, or only .Â£4,000 less, with all the legitimate adjustments that have been made with a view to evading taxation. ment account for that to a large extent.

The speech of the honourable member for Parramatta, when analyzed, will be found to contain a considerable number of mistakes. VVe, on this side, endeavoured to correct his error regarding the land tax, showing him that two-thirds.of its revenue came from the country, and one-third from the cities, but he would not accept the correction.

If there is any honourable memher here who is always speaking to the electors, and playing to the gallery, it is he. He spoke of the great increase in the Commonwealth Public Service, but just before doing so, he used figures to demonstrate the manner in which the output of Victorian factories has grown, how the number of employees has increased, and how the rates of wages have been raised. Although he recognised this boom state of affairs, he complained of the increase of emploj'es in one of the bigso long as the revenue is coming in, we gest business concerns in the Commonwealth-the Post Office. In view of the extra services which have had to be given to the people, there has had to be an increase in the number or postal employees. The honourable member quoted from . the Budget-papers to show that the average salary in the Postal Service is to-day less than at the inception of Federation, ignoring the fact that of recent years many persons under the age of twenty-one years have been appointed. The young girls and -lads employed in connection with the Sydney telephone service, for instance, number scores, ancl, pprhaps, hundreds The same remark applies to Melbourne, and, in a lesser degree, to Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and other centres of populaWhen a vast number of girls and youths pass the examinations, and are engaged at 15s. a week, we must expect the figures to disclose a low average wage. gestion Pmade. that, with the increased numher of employees, a lower wage per capita was being paid; and it only needs a moment's reflection to show how fallacious such an argument is.

Of course, there is no need to give way entirely to pessimism, but rather, with characteristic Australian hope and courage, let us be ready to meet trouble should it arise. The honourable member for Parramatta made a mistake in his analysis of the postal balance-sheet. Practically there are two balance-sheets, one dealing with the ordinary service, and another dealing with new works. As to the latter, there never was.so much expenditure, and never so much necessity for it ; and I hope that, shall continue to supply the people with the services they require, even though it may mean millions of expenditure.

Of course, if , during the last four years, he included new works and buildings, a balance on the wrong side must be shown; and, while we have money to spend on new works, we ought to be prepared, for some years to come, to see a debit balance. In 1908-9 the revenue was Â£3,300,000; in 1909-10, _ it was Â£3,400,000; in 1910-11, it was Â£3,700,000; and in 1911-12, it was Â£3,948,000; and for these years the expenditure, respectively, was Â£2,918,000, .Â£3,069,000, Â£3,231,000, and Â£3,559< Â°00 Thesefiguresshow a credit balance on what we may call the ordinary revenue and expenditure for the years, respectively, of Â£381,000, Â£366,000, Â£528,000, and Â£388,000. new works and buildings? and buildings really present what I may call an extraordinary position of affairs. In recent years we have been expending freely, and the money is well spent on permanent works designed to give the public generally greater facilities. I admit that for the year ending 30th June, 1912, there is a debit balance on the ordinary revenue and expenditure; but over five years, instead of a debit of nearly Â£1,500,000, it appears to me that, on the ordinary services, there is a credit almost equal to that amount. I shall not follow the honourable member through many of the windings in which he indulged; but I was very persistent in interjecting when he said that, instead of carrying out postal and other public works out of revenue, he would, I suppose, had he been in power, have borrowed the money, and saddled posterity with some of the responsibility. As I intend to deal with the question of borrowing under another phase, I shall leave it for the present. It seemed a great cause of complaint on the part of the honourable member for Parramatta that our defence scheme is this year to cost Â£750,000 more than Lord Kitchener provided for in his report. I should say, however, that when we have an expenditure running into something like Â£5,000,000, it is quite possible that, owing to local circumstances and conditions, the defence authorities have found occasion to depart from the scheme laid down by Lord Kitchener, great authority as that gentleman is; and this may well account for the extra Â£750,000. If Lord Kitchener himself were here, and took into account local circumstances, he might see fit to depart from his scheme, not only to the extent of Â£750,000, but considerably more; and, therefore, I do not see in tlie. remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta any great argument against the proposed defence expenditure. I agree that it is time some decisive steps were taken in connection with the State debts; and I may say that, personally, I do not blame the Federal authorities for any delay that has taken place. I believe that' Sir George Turner, when Treasurer in the early history of Federation, made a very earnest effort to come to some agreement with the States, and successive Treasurers have taken similar steps; but, unfortunately, we seem to have got no further forward. It is suggested, as one reason why the negotiations have not been successful, that this Commonwealth Government, in particular, have seen fit to enter into what some honourable members opposite consider to be the peculiar domain of the States. That is not my opinion, however, for I would go considerably further in that direction. The pledge made to the people of Australia at the initiation of Federation has not been redeemed; and this is a statement. I shall make, not only in this House, but on the platform. The'pledge was that the creation of this seventh Parliament would decrease, and not increase, the national expenditure; but the expanding revenues and expenditure of both State and Commonwealth has not brought about that result. I do not know what we ought to do if the State Governments will not consider the question. Possibly they realize that if they once give up the management of their State debts, it will lead to their giving up some of their services, and that thereby their dignity will be lessened to such a degree that the people will demand .a considerable reduction in' the expenditure on the State Parliaments. The Commonwealth electors and the State electors are one and the same people; and the only question for them is which Parliament, or Parliaments, can best manage their affairs. For my part, I should say that if it were possible the Commonwealth should at onor take over the State debts of Â£270,000,000, and with them the State railways. By some it is thought that the Commonwealth ought to take over the debts without the railways; but my opinion is that the temper",45,Moloney Di D He Not Surplus Amounts To 9s 2d Per Head Of

On this debt of Â£270,000,000 .the people of Australia are every year paying interest to the extent of Â£10,000.000.

I do not know the exact policy followed with regard to immigration in other States,, but I claim to know something of what has been done in Victoria, and, if the immigration policy of the other States is being mismanaged like that of Victoria, then an undesirable class of immigrants is coming in, and an awful mess is being made of the attempt to distribute the immigrants to the places where they ought to go. Ostensibly the Victorian immigration policy was initiated to obtain people to settle on the lands of the State. and lower wages. reason, as given out officially. The latest statement made by Mr Hagelthorn, M.L.C., who has charge of the immigration business in Victoria, is most interesting. In an interview the other night, he was asked how many immigrants he expected to bring to Victoria during the current year, and his answer was 30,000. He was then asked what percentage of them would be placed on the land. Would5 per cent, go upon the land ? His answer was "" No ; I do not expect that more than 2J per cent, will go upon the land."" That the means that about 750 people out of 30,000 will be settled upon the land; and, even making a very liberal deduction for the number of children in that total, a large percentage of them are going to be kept in We asked our centres of population, aggravating the very trouble of centralization from which Australia is suffering. If anything like the same policy is being carried out in the other States, all I can say is that it is a disgrace to those responsible for it. We want people in this country, and if anything is required for Australia, it is the vigorous settlement of population upon our rural areas. We do not wish them to crowd into our already large centres of population. We want to give them breathing room on our broad acres, where they will increase the production of the country. ber knows that there is a splendid settlement going on at the present moment in Victoria.",49,Fenton I Shall Have Something

There was a hint by the right honourable member for Swan about dear money. I do not profess to be at the bottom of things in the financial world; but when the Commonwealth Bank gets into full operation, and there is anything like a tightening of the money market, I know that the people of Australia will look to this institution to get them out of any difficulty. It is the savings of the people which carry on the banks; but I shall not go into that question more than to sound a warning note. It was, I believe, the honourable member for Angas who told us this afternoon that in the Old Country the banks are amalgamating; and, in my opinion, that is what they ought to do here, with a view to more economical working. The people here are Britishers, and will not be controlled by financiers, bankers or otherwise. However, in order to show what eminent bankers think of the Commonwealth Bank, I should like to quote from the speech of Mr J. C. Hamilton, Director of the Bank of Australasia Limited, in London, who presided at the annual meeting of that institution. He is reported as sayingSo far as he knew, there was no other instanc of a State owning and conducting a bank, nnd the experiment would be watched with interest. Of course, they did not welcome a new and powerful competitorHere we have a banker, with all his shrewdness and financial ability, recognising that in the Commonwealth Bank there is a strong competitorbut if the Commonwealth Bank was managed on sound financial lines, with the intention of making profits for itself arid not of becoming a burden on the taxpayer, he saw no great reason to fear it. Such an institution, if ably managed and backed by the State, might become a source of great strength to the community, and be able to afford valuable assistance to other nnancial institutions in time of trouble. He hoped that the Commonwealth Hank might some day hold in Australia somewhat of the position that the Hank of England holds in the United Kingdom. When we have a financial expert like this, presiding over a meeting of shareholders in London, the heart of the financial world, indulging in words such as I have read, it. ill becomes croakers on this side of the water to endeavour to show that the Commonwealth Bank is not a really good proposition. At all times I would take the opinion of men like Mr Hamilton, in preference to the opinion of those who in this House profess to be financial experts. As to the Customs Department, there is a great deal of talk about the amount of revenue received; and I do not think there is anybody who deplores the fact more than myselt, especially when the revenue is derived from articles that could be manufactured here. I do not know whether the idea originated with the present Minister of Trade and Customs, or with his predecessor, the honourable member for Kooyong, but I believe that, in view of the trouble about undervaluation, officers were sent not only to London, but, I believe, to Germany and to America in order to see into the matter; and I am glad that their investigation has proved of exceptional value. So much is this the case, that I am told we are to-day receiving Â£750,000 more per annum than previously. ber for Kooyong who initiated that idea. orahle member all credit for it, and have only to say that the present Minister has vigorously carried it out. The investigations show that goods were being sent here from the Old Country, Germany, and other places at considerable under-value, with the result that the revenue was seriously depleted. Latterly, however, under the new system, it is said by some that we are benefitting to the estimated extent of Â£1,000,000 in increased revenue. eventually ? Trade argument; but if trade is to be conducted with the Commonwealth, we ask for reasonable honesty. The honourable mem-' ber for Parramatta said this evening: "" You are going to wipe out all the revenue duties and impose direct taxation."" The honourable member knows, however, that in the case of luxuries, either imported or manufactured here, there is the first right to taxation. From imported stimulants and narcotics there is a revenue of Â£3,788,000. To these duties I suppose no honourable member on either side of the House would object. From the excise duty on similar articles manufactured here we receive a revenue of ,Â£2,380,000; and if we deduct these amounts from the total revenue of Â£14,511,000, we have left a balance of ,Â£8,343,000.

331,Mr Fenton,"I know the stock Freeof Â£8,343,000, or a portion of it, at any rate, that shows an unfair competition, from the manufacturers' point of view, against Australia. I once more express my regret that we have not had an .opportunity to thoroughly analyze the Tariff, and cast it upon truly scientific lines. It is the resince the figures were supplied to me, and venue duties, which weigh so heavily on the people, that need looking into; and I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who gave us some very valuable information this afternoon. That honourable member, who endorsed the utterances of the honourable member for Coolgardie in regard to the incidence of taxation, estimated that the private wealth of the country is about Â£[1,000,000,000, of which 8,500 people own Â£8ro,ooo,ooo. The right honourable member for Swan and others have complained about the land tax; but, so far as I can gather, that tax is one of the fairest ever imposed in Australia. Some years ago in the State Parliament, Sir Ceorge Turner, as Treasurer, was criticised for imposing stamp and other similar duties, because these touch the business man, and the man with money every time; but Sir George returned the very apt reply, in the question: "" Whom else am I to tax except the man who has money?"" That is the principle on which this Government acted when the land tax was imposed; and the returns show in how few hands is the wealth of the community. The unfair incidence of our taxation is disclosed in the fact that those who own one-fifth of the private wealth contribute four-fifths of the taxation, while those who own -four-fifths of the private wealth contribute only one-fifth of the taxation. The present forecast of the Customs revenue indicates that the people with one-fifth of the wealth will contribute Â£11,600,000, while the people with four-fifths of the wealth will contribute only Â£2,900,000. orable member get those figures? when these figures were first presented to me they seemed to be so startling .that I could scarcely accept them. figures ? very best officer in the Statist's Department, and asked him to analyze them for me-h e is the gentleman who prepares some of the most intricate figures for the Victorian State Treasurer-and , after going through them, he told me that, instead of the figures being presented in lurid colours, they were presented rather in drab colours. official figures? I have worked the present figures out on the same basis. member taken into account how many men these wealthy people employ, and the money paid to them in wages ? the employed men create for the money paid to them? I support the suggestion made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and supported by the honourable member for* Parramatta, that we should be supplied with figures showing us clearly where the wealth of the country lies; because, until we are in possession of that information, it is certain that the incidence of taxation will operate harshly on a large number of people. I may tell honourable members that investigations are being made which will more than bear out some of the figures presented this afternoon. As to Federal taxation, I may say that a family of five at present pays Â£ 1 6 per annum. Tf we were to add State and municipal taxation, the amount would reach a high figure for people who, many of them, receive remuneration that enables them merely to live from hand to mouth. I am taking thefiguresgiven by the Leader of the Opposition last night, who stated that Federal taxation amounted to 64s. per head, so that, allowing for five in a family, we have a total of Â£ 1 6 per family. In conclusion, let me say that we should keenly analyze the Budget figures, and all that come before us in reference to the financial position of the various Departments. I am one of those who are not prepared to accept a mere ex -parte statement, even if it be made by a Minister. We need to delve deeply into these matters -to get beneath the surface-and to see that all is Tight. In that way alone can we hope to bring about a government of the country that will be of an equitable character. We all desire that the Commonwealth shall prosper and go ahead. I am glad that we have an abounding revenue, and that the people are now to be supplied with services for which they have long been waiting.

The concluding statement made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, that the great bulk of our taxation is borne by the poor people of the community, is a most surprising one, and requires to lie carefully analyzed. I presume that the honourable member bases his assertion on the fact that our Customs taxation is apportioned amongst every member of the community. I would remind him, however, that the real necessaries of life, such as flour, meat, going to stand on mere trifles of dignity? and tea, are free. None of us proposes to reduce the taxation on spirits or tobacco, which are luxuries, and these, or, speaking generally, stimulants and narcotics, are the great revenue-producing items ifi ""fhe Tariff. Those who consume large quantities of such luxuries bear the bulk of the taxation; but, as Sir Philip Fysh pointed out in this House some time ago, a man can live fairly well in Australia-h e can live on the lines that would be adopted, I dare say, by the honourable member for Brisbane, who is a teetotaller-withou t paying any taxation. ister of Home Affairs could do so. abnormal, and cannot be compared with ordinary men. A man can live fairly well, however, without paying any taxation, and that is as it ought to be. We know very well that honourable members generally are desirous that our taxation shall fall upon those best able to bear it. ber think that a teetotaller pays no taxation? little. In criticizing this Budget, we have to keep in mind the fact that some menacing features are appearing on the nnancial horizon. The banks are charging more for overdrafts than they used to do, whilst another very significant fact is that money is hardening. That is a world-wide movement, arising, very likely, from the fact that trade has overtaken the gold production of the world. Our enormous trade is based upon our gold production, and when that gold production is overtaken, we must experience a period of dear money. Whatever the cause, the result is very alarming, having regard to the State loans that will mature in the near future. Queensland,, for instance, has to redeem in London, in 1915, a loan of Â£11,385,000, which was floated many years ago by Sir Samuel Griffith, l t is rather significant that in the same year New Zealand has also to redeem loans amounting to some Â£9,000,000. It is unnecessary for me to mention all the State loans that will shortly fall due, and which appear in table J of the Budgetpapers ; but they certainly require our unceasing attention. The honourable member for Corangamite asked last night how it was possible for us to deal with the State debts when the State Premiers refused to make a bargain with the Commonwealth ? I would ask, however, whether we are Has the Prime Minister ever approached the State Premiers with a request to meet him on this matter? vious Government have done so. ister would ask the State Premiers to meet him in conference, I am sure he would find them prepared to fall in with any reasonable proposal. The States would have to give up the right to conduct their own borrowings, otherwise there would be no possibility of achieving the object we all have in view-the raising of cheap loans to repay those which will shortly fall due. WheneverI turn to the figures relating to the State debts, I am always impressed by the remarkably small amount standing to the credit of the Sinking Funds of the States. Our public indebtedness amounts to about Â£267,000,000, whereas we have in our Sinking Funds only ,Â£5,000,000 longs to Western Australia.. amount stands to the credit of the Western Australian sinking fund, and for this, I dare say, the right honourable member for Swan is responsible. No doubt, with his usual regard for sound finance, he intro-' duced the system in his own State. This is a very striking fact. Tlie Victorian Parliament at the present time is considering a Bill to provide for a loan of Â£1,500,000 to be spent on the main roads of the State; but so far as I have been able to ascertain, that Bill makes no provision for a sinking fund. The money will be spent, and the roads worn out, before the loan has to be repaid. From that standpoint alone, the Prime Minister would be",54,Fenton I Shall Have Something

We all naturally desire that the credit of the country shall be kept as high as possible, and that at the same time the people shall be called upon to pay as little interest as possible. We have before us in the matter of finance an exceedingly difficult time. Borrowing daily becomes more difficult, and I look forward with a considerable degree of alarm to the happenings of the future. appeal to the States to meet us. ister would make another appeal to the State PremiersI am sure that this Parliament would back him up if he failed. I do not think, however, that he should attach to such an appeal any ridiculous proposition. let the States have all their own way. for instance, that they must give up the idea of borrowing for themselves. If we are to effect any saving in the interest bill, good deal of wet weather was experienced the borrowings of the States must be conducted through only one channel. think that the States would meet us with a proposition of that kind? they would; but I certainly would not make the ridiculous suggestion that has been put forward that in taking over the State debts we should take over the railways of the States. Such a step is not necessary to secure the moneys borrowed by the States. We should have the credit of the States behind that of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth would hold each State and all it possessed as security for the bond-holder; and that being so, I see no force in the argument that these bonds should be backed up by ear-marked securities. Another matter of grave importance concerns the Minister of Home Affairs. We are to spend on new works and buildings, according to the Budget, no less than Â£3,985,921. That money is to be expended in every part of Australia; and I should like to know how the Minister, who is going to control that expenditure, can exercise any proper supervision over it. If it were his own money, he would devise some means of securing reasonable supervision. I believe that he is a young man, willing to learn, and that if he had to hire a man he would secure one of greater experience than himselfa man who had handled bigger propositionswhen he proposed to spend, as jn this case, nearly Â£4,000,000. This money is to be expended not only in an ordinary, but in an extraordinary, way, since the works for which it provides are to be carried out by day labour. Under the contract system, we should know where we were; but how is the Minister going to control the carrying out of all these works by day labour from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the southernmost part of Tasmania? Such a system is not possible, and must break down. For instance, I know that excavations at Williamstown have cost 9s. per yard. estimate ? threepence per yard. Milestone. lieve that the increase on the estimated cost is due to some extent to the fact that a in making these shallow excavations for the butts at Williamstown. Then, again, how is the Minister to control the building of the trans-Australian railway by day labour in the centre of Australia ? It can never be done. We have also to consider how these men are being taught, and what ideas are being put into their heads. Some of the men 1 have spoken to are quite as confident as I am that these works can never be carried out under this system. Mr John Curtain is not an ordinary man of the street.

He must see that what I have just read is not likely to conduce to good work. The Minister has not told us what inspection system is adopted, and I hope he will give us some enlightenment on the point, because the matter is most serious. When a work is done it has to carry its own capital, or the community has to lose its capital. If the work is badly done Australia suffers, and I am certain that no man can carry out jÂ£4,000,000 worth of work in this slipshod way with any success to the community.

Our honourable friend, the Minister of Home Affairs, does not make any complaint at all, but seems to go along with a flowing sail. New South Wales Minister of Works has adopted a system of rewarding men for getting through their work promptly. I read thatThe Minister for Works has established a system of rewarding men for getting through their and the law suits, and the extras; and we work promptly at Burrinjuck.

The proposal is not regarded favourably in union quarters. The railway workers are in a state of violent indignation. I do not believe the honest railway worker is in the slightest degree .perturbed by having to do a decent day's work for a decent day's pay, and that is all they want him to doThe matter was alluded to at the last meeting of the Railway Workers and General Labourers* Association, when the secretary ( Mr D. O'Sullivan) was instructed to write to the Minister for Works, protesting against the introduction of the piece-work system at Burrinjuck. That shows that the Labour Minister of Works in New South Wales is afraid that the day-labour system will break down with his enterprises, which are small compared with the enormous expenditure that has to be handled by our Minister of Home Affairs for works scattered all over the continent. We all wish to see our work well done, but in my opinion we are going to have some revelations out of the spending of this Â£4,000,000 that will stagger every Australian in the community. reasonable men, to look ahead a little.

I should like to see a comprehensive industrial insurance scheme in the Old Country. That is a self-respecting and all-embracing scheme, not the sort of patchwork remedy that is being applied here. The honourable member for Angas, than whom there is not a milder-mannered man in the House, said this afternoon that the maternity bonus proposal almost savoured of political corruption. That is a very strong remark, but we cannot help seeing that the sudden desire to please the mothers of the community must arise from something. mothers, not to please them. as kind-hearted as is the honourable member. We have to explain these things, and when political proposals are made, must look for motives. What is the motive for the s'udden offering of a Â£ 5 bonus for babies?

Had the honourable member for Maribyrnong quoted the whole of Mr Mackinnon's speech, it would have been seen that he is opposed to this maternity allowance. The Budget contains no statement as to future developments. Expenditure on defence is a thing which we all know must be faced. Every honourable member admits its necessity, and I hope that we shall not have any more such whining as came from the Trades Hall the other day. A deputation waited on the Minister of Defence to put forward We know-that there have been a number of matters to complain about, but both sides are doing their .best to put things right. Mr G.

446,Mr Roberts,"Then the honorablewe should be more prosperous. The last subject to which I desire to refer is the note issue. The expenditure on the note issue for 1911-12 is set down at Â£31,000; but I ascertainedI think that it. was from the Minister of External Affairsthat that amount did not include the cost of the militarv guard at the Treasury, which comprises twenty-four men. It is reasonable to assume that the cost of that guard amounts to about Â£j>,ooo per annum, so that the expenditure in connection with the note issue is thus raised to Â£36,000. Looking at the issue from the point of view of not only the Commonwealth Government, but the community as 1 whole, we find that we have not profited largely by it. We have to compare the profit made by the Commonwealth with that previously made by the States and by the banks, which are, to a great extent, the property of the community. If , as the honourable member for Angas pointed out, a 3 per cent, tax had been imposed on tlie note issue, we should have raised about Â£150,000 per annum; whereas the amount earned by way of interest on the gold reserve last year was ,Â£185,000. that amount we have to deduct about Â£36,000 in respect of full working expenses ; so that the net result is about equal to that which we should have secured by means of a 3 per cent, note tax. Undoubtedly the note issue has had a great effect in tightening up the money market in Australia. The withdrawal from the banks, which are the great advancing mediums of the community, of over Â£9,000,000 in sovereigns for the purchase of Commonwealth notes has had a very crippling effect on their lending powers. I think, therefore, that we have no reason to be proud of the note issue. . Mr VV. J. JOHNSON -That is not what the bankers say at their annual meetings. all events. strain of any financial crisis upon our paper currency system; but when such a strain is experienced we may look for stormy days in connection with it. The community as a whole has not benefited to any appreciable extent by the note issue. Mr W. J. the use of Â£5,000,000 without interest? given the Commonwealth credit for the ,Â£185.000 earned by way of interest on the gold reserve; but it must not be forgotten that the States used to collect a note tax of 2 per cent, which could have been raised to 3 per cent. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The same result could have been secured by a note tax. at the same time we should not have had that unhinging of finance which has taken place. Under the old system, it was necessary for the banks to keep what are called "" till notes "" to accommodate the public. Honourable members will recognise that under the old system a note, as soon as it was returned to the bank that had issued it, became dead, and required no financial backing. Let me illustrate the position by pointing out that if I gave any one an IO U, it would be of no value once it was returned to me. If another person held it, however, I should have to keep a reserve to meet it if I desired to remain solvent. And so with the banks. TheirI 0 U's, in the shape of their notes, became dead when they were returned. They were therefore called "" t ill "" notes, and were kept to be used when required. Directly they were put into circulation they From became subject to the note tax, because they were live notes, and gold had to be kept against them although they were a first charge on the assets. The new system means that the banks have had to part with something like Â£10,000,000 in sovereigns. wealth notes. if they do nnt require them. to carry on business, and they have to buy these notes to meet the demands of those who require them. The fact that ,Â£10,000,000 in gold has been taken from the great money-lending institutions of Australia is one of the drawbacks of the Commonwealth paper currency. To-day we are experiencing the inconvenience of a tight We have not yet had the money market, caused by a great variety of circumstances, and the note issue is one of them. As a business man who, in his time, has been in many tight places, I think i l is only right to say that we have financial rocks ahead.

455,Mr Atkinson (Wilmot) [10.5],"Ieven if I were, I should not do so at tliis hour of the night. There are, however, one or two features of the financial statement that call for special attention. agree with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat that the Commonwealth is fast running into financial difficulties, and that we have rocks ahead that it is the duty of the Government to try to avoid. A careful examination of the Budget shows that it is a mere statement of accounts. pect something more. It certainly imparts some information, but the Treasurer should have told us how he views the future, and where he expects to get the money that he will require to find during the next year or two to meet the expenditure of the Commonwealth. Our revenue since Federation has steadily increased, but we cannot overlook the fact that our expenditure has kept pace with the rising revenue, and that there are many large and serious items for which we shall have to provide, wherever the revenue comes from. The present Government came into office on the flood-tide of prosperity. moving ahead, and our primary industries, which constitute the great source of our wealth, were particularly flourishing. Our wealth is drawn largely from our primary industries, and since our exports have been very great the people have imported largely, so that the Customs revenue has been materially benefited. The history of Australia shows, however, that a serious drop in the Customs revenue is by no means uncommon, and if we have a series of lean years we mav expect a serious falling off in this, our chief source of income. In such an emergency, what does the present Government, if it remains in office, intend to do? venue has not yet commenced to drop. not too reassuring. is the evil thereof. like to be able to see at least twelve months ahead. My great complaint, which I think is shared generally by the people, who are becoming aware that financial danger is ahead of us, is that we have nothing to indicate how the Government intend to meet a slump in our affairs and balance the ledger for the future. [92]2 should be prepared to give us something in the shape of a forecast. When a balance sheet is drawn up for an ordinary company I there are generally some remarks indicating its probable future. The Treasurer should have given us some information of that sort, but outside of a statement of accounts, in the shape of a sort of balance sheet, he simply said, after referring to the fact that Federation had increased the trading capacity of AustraliaSurely we have a right to exWe are sometimes inclined to be pessimistic, and in bad times we hear a great deal of the misfortunes of the country, but 1 think that all the evidence now before us indicates a continuance of progress and prosperity equal to that which we have hitherto experienced in Australia. Ih speaking thus, I have in mind not the prosperity of this year or last year, but the average. He assumes there that he is always going to have abounding revenue. Apparently the expenditure is being increased so widely because he thinks we are going to have a continuance of the exceedingly good seasons that we have enjoyed in the past. I say the prospects are quite the other way, and we have only to look at Everything in Australia was the commercial affairs of the country to see it. Australia is a debtor nation. It has to pay a large amount of interest to the Old Country for money borrowed there, and consequently has to export a good deal more than it imports in value if it is to keep the balance of trade. But in Australia to-day our imports are increasing and our exports decreasing. For the first time for a good many years our imports have actually exceeded our exports. When that happens, or when we do not export sufficient to meet the imports and cover the interest on our debts, we have to export gold, and there has not been for a long while so much gold exported from Australia as recently. These facts ought to appeal to a business man, as the Treasurer of the The Customs reCommonwealth certainly ought to be. The position is getting very serious, and the people of Australia require a great deal The prospects are more to satisfy them than a bald statement that we have had good times, that the Government have been lucky so far as revenue and general prosperity are conB u t the taxpayers cerned, and that, so far as the Treasurer can see, the Government are going to con-' tinue to be lucky. It seems to me that we are not going to have a continuance of our bounding prosperity, and, therefore, we cannot look for the heavy revenues we have had in the past.

Are they to tax the people to make up any deficiency, when the people are already taxed sufficiently heavily for a young country, or must they retrench, as has been done before in Australia? To what unfortunate straits are the successors of this Government to be reduced? If such a state of affairs as that came to pass, and the present Ministerial party were sitting in Opposition, they would be the first to howl against any resort to retrenchment. They would be the first to make trouble if it was suggested that old-age pensions should be reduced, because the money was not available to pay them. occurs to you for reduction? show later that old-age pensions stand a very good chance of being reduced if the Labour party are allowed to remain in office, because they are making no attempt to buttress up the system. They are relying solely on the general revenue to pay the pensions, and have made no effort whatever to establish a contributory system of old-age pensions or a compulsory insurance scheme. Without these, the old age pensions fund stands a very good chance of being reduced in lean years. The Government had a revenue in the year just closed of over Â£20,000,000. They had a surplus on hand from previous years of over Â£2,000,000, but they estimate to spend in the financial year 1912-13 the whole of that Â£22,000,000. fair to admit at once that the Government were bound to increase expenditure greatly. That has been forced upon them. I admit also that in the Postal Department they have spent a great deal of money that ought to have been spent years ago. My charge, however, is not so much that they intend to spend so much, but that they do not show us how they are going to finance the country after this year, because we must be prepared for a falling revenue, and we shall have heavy commitments. Our expenditure on defence has jumped almost at a bound to over Â£5,000,000, or 24s. for every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. capita expenditure almost equalling that of the older countries of Europe. I admit that it is perfectly legitimate and necessary, and I am simply calling attention to the fact that it will have to be incurred year after year. We have a liability of Â£2,250,000 for old-age and invalid pensions, and there is a proposition to absorb Â£400,000 during the current financial year for a maternity bonus. These are expenditures which are also likely to continue. There is also the Northern Territory, which in the distant future may be a mine of untold wealth to Australia, but which, I am afraid, for many years to come, is going to be a handicap on all the southern States, which have to provide the sinews of war. We have heavy expenditure to face in other directions which are not reproductive. We have come to a crisis in the financial history of the Commonwealth. We are committed to an immense expenditure, whether the party opposite or this party occupy the Treasury bench. I want to know where the revenue is coming from to meet these heavy outgoings, and if the revenue is not there, what the proposition is to make up the deficiency ? Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Would you suggest dropping the subsidy to Tasmania in order to help to lighten the burden ? to forego it. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Then is there any other item to which vou object? to any item of expenditure at the present time. I am pointing out the heavy liabilities we have to meet, and contending that it is the duty of the Treasurer to tell us how he proposes to meet them. Our imports of merchandise for 1911-12 amounted It is only to Â£71,278,986, while our exports of merchandise for the same period totalled only Â£66,602,964. are living beyond our income. Our exports for that year were less than those of 1910II by Â£1,182,179. If o u r exports go on diminishing in that way, it shows that our Customs revenue is probably going to fall. That is our chief source of revenue; and if we go on in that way, with our present heavy expenditure, we must be faced with a deficit.

A few months ago we were threatened with a drought, ?nd things looked serious, but rain came, and the crisis was averted. The outlook for this season, however, is not as good as that for last season and the season before. This year our production of wheat will probably, and of wool will certainly, show a falling off, and our exportation of butter will not increase, so that there will be a diminution of revenue. The Treasurer evidently is of that opinion, because, although last year he received from Customs duties nearly Â£1,000,000 more than he estimated that he would receive, this year he estimates the revenue at a lower sum than was received last year. If the land tax has the effect that is desired, there will be a considerable falling off in the revenue from it. Indeed, the Treasurer estimates a substantial falling off. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Â£111,00 0 only. able decrease, and as the tax brings about the breaking-up of estates, the revenue from it will continue to diminish. I have already referred to the large export of gold consequent upon the value of our imports of. merchandise exceeding the value of our exports. last, the net export of gold and specie was .Â£* 3.'371597. o r over Â£2,000,000 more than the value of the gold produced in 1911, the last year for which figures are available. There has been a gradual decrease in the production of gold in Australia from 1903 to 1911. As our exports increase, our bank deposits grow, and as our imports increase, the advances become larger and the deposits decrease. In 1909-10 the bank deposits increased by Â£16,063,691, and the advances by .Â£1,728.045, but in 1910-11 the bank deposits increased by Â£T5,293,567, .Â£14,496,637, while last year the bank deposits increased by only Â£4.953.718, and the advances by Â£12,976,189. These facts should be made plain to those whose money we are spending. The attempt is being made to get the community to believe that all is well, and that fhe present prosperity will continue. business man is satisfied that this is so, and business men must be very concerned about the. future prospects of the country. I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that there are financial rocks not very far ahead. The Commonwealth expenditure increased gradually from the beginning of Federation until the Braddon section ceased to operate, and then there was a sudden jump. This year the expenditure on Federal purposes alone is to be Â£14,100,749. The population of Australia from the beginning of Federation until April, 1911, increased by only 700,000, a very small increase in comparison with the increase in expenditure. During the last year or two, the population has increased more rapidly, because of the meritorious efforts of the State Governments to encourage immigration. Although the Budget-papers show a vast expenditure on non-reproductive works, very little is set down for the encouragement of immigration by the Commonwealth. Immigrants of the right type are the serious want of Australia at the piesent time. We have a population of less than 5,000,000, and should have more than 20,000,000. A larger population of the right stamp would increase the development of our resources, and make our land defences stronger. Ministerial supporters tell us that they are not opposed to immigration, but no suggestion for its encouragement has come from them. Many of them, however, emigrated from Great Britain. They found this a good country, and did For the year ending 30th June well for themselves in it, and surely , there are still in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales similar men who, if they followed their example, would, in a few years, be as prosperous as they are. The charge can be levelled against the Government that they have made no attempt to induce people to come here. I do not care how much is spent on immigration so long as suitable immigrants are selected. native-born are leaving Tasmania? with introducing people from abroad? In and the advances by any case, it is for the Government, and not for me, to keep Australians in this country. the native-born, how can we get immigrants ? the Australian-born are leaving Australia No in any great numbers. to faulty selection, in which respect I think Australia has somewhat failed, as, indeed,",64,Johnson Hav E They Not My Ability But I F My Honourable Friends Op

476,Mr Atkinson,"Perhaps that is dueCanada has, if one may judge by what one reads. There are many immigrants into -Canada whom we should be sorry to see come to Australia. At present it seems to be fashionable, on the other side of the world, to turn attention to Australia as a land of promise, and Australia is certainly one of the great outposts of the Em;pire, and should be the chief hope of the British people. I should now like to say a word or two in regard to old-age pensions. Honourable members opposite seem to think that these pensions can be increased to any amount; but they may find their mistake when the revenue has a sudden drop, as, unfortunately, may be the case. I have heard nothing from the Government of a contributory system or of compulsory insurance. At present the money is taken Out of the general revenue, and numbers of people are led to think that their future is practically assured, whereas, if every adult person in Australia were made to contribute to a fund, the idea of thrift would be inculcated. ber is pretty thrifty I know. It is not the intention of this, or any odier, Government, by means of the old-age pensions system, to lull people into a sense of false security. are many directions in which expenditure is It is not the desire that the people should rely on old-age pensions, but that every one should endeavour to place himself in such a position as not to need this kind, of assistance. Government remain in power the lower will be the percentage of the people who require pensions. present there is no indication of the sort; indeed; as I look at thefigures,I am satisfied that the tendency is the other way. If we load the country with taxation, and take more than is reasonable out of the pockets of the people, we are going in the right direction to produce paupers, and to drive people of determination, energy, and brains away. If such should be the result, 1 do not know how the people who remain will be provided for, rendered helpless, as they must be, by reliance on some -spoon-fed scheme. time when the tackling of a question of this -character was more urgent. member object to the present scheme? old-age pensions. I am only too glad tc* see any decent citizen, after his life's work,, or at a certain age, have the evening of his life made comfortable, though I am afraid a pension of ios. a week will not have that result. If some system such as I have indicated is not brought into operation, I fear that in times of stress the old-age pensions may be reduced in order to balance the national ledger. member objects to the present system? vocated old-age pensions, but I think the present system is founded on a wrong idea, and stands a good chance of breaking down of its own weight. I think 1 have said enough to show that the financial outlook of Australia is not as rosy as it might be. blinks the truth, and is afraid to say what he thinks, is not a friend or guide of the people. In some of the Departments the expenditure has increased in what may be fairly called an extravagant manner. Much money has been spent on Socialistic schemes and experiments, although there more urgently needed and can be more usefully incurred. The estimated expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department this year is Â£5,826,990, which, as the honourable member for Parramatta pointed! out this afternoon, is Â£1,500,000 in excess of the estimated revenue. I admit that large sums have been properly spent on new works that ought to have been provided some years before, but that does not account fpr all the difference. We have heard that the Government have increased postal salaries by Â£[270,000 during the last year, but so many have been added to the staff that the average salary works out at a figure somewhere about that before the new expenditure was undertaken. It seems to me that there is room here for an explanation as to where the rest of the money has gone, and we ought to be told whether we are to anticipate each year a deficiency of Â£1,500,000. In other Departments, we see large expenditure, and we are Never was there a not given any satisfactory information as to what we may expect for the future. At any rate, the Government seem to have undertaken a number of Socialistic experihonorable ments which will cost much in the near future, while the Departments are not being",65,Johnson Hav E They Not My Ability But I F My Honourable Friends Op
