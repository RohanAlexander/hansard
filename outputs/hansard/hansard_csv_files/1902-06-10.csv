The colonies are to supply a certain unmber of horses annually. Canada has agreed to furnish uOO Canadian horses per annum, which will be full-grown and trained by the Canadian local troops, at a cost of £20,000 annually. Nothing is said in this official COM| muniqm about Australia as a source of supply. It would seem from that extract that energetic action upon the part of the Commonwealth Government might have been followed by something to the advantage of Australia. Has the Minister representing the Prime Minister anything to communicate to the House on the subject ? statement of the intention of the W a r Office is correct, because I feel that if they have any such intention, Australia cannot be overlooked, but the fact that, neither indirectly or directly, have we received by cable or by letter any intimation upon the subject, goes to show that it is a forecast rather than an account of an absolute determination.

Sir GEORGETURNER ( B a l a c l a v aTreasurer) I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, although a very short one, is of considerable importance, because in considering it the House must determine whether some of our public works are to be paid for with loan moneys, or whether we shall adopt the practice of paying for them all, large or small, out of revenue. TheB ill provides for the borrowing of £1,000,000. That sum would be the basis of our inscribed stock, for which provision is made in the Government Inscribed StockB ill which I intend to introduce almost immediately. U p to the present time the Commonwealth has had no loan funds at its disposal. When certain departments were transferred, works were being proceeded with in most of the States, and were being paid for out of loan funds. As it would be a considerable time before the Commonwealth could make provision for the raising of money by way of loan, I arranged with the State Governments to continue and complete these works,' and promised that the amount expended would be taken into consideration when the value of the properties taken over by the Commonwealth was being fixed. That proceeded as far as the State of New South Wales was concerned until December last, when the Government of that State declined to carry out the arrangement any further. They had incurred some considerable liabilities, and, upon my pointing out how unfair it would be not to meet these, they have made the necessary payments. In Queensland considerable liabilities had also been incurred, and as the loan moneys in that State are voted year by year, and / the votes lapsed in September last, there are accounts amounting to a considerable sum still unpaid, for which we shall have to provide. Since then I have been proceeding very slowly indeed with loan expenditure, because I have had to find the money out of the Treasurer's advance vote. So far we have provided £40,000 or £50,000, mostly for the payment of wages and small accounts which we could not very well avoid meeting. The object of the present B ill is to enable us to raise money out of which we can provide for important works, and honourable members who look through the list of works proposed for the present will, I think, be forced to the conclusion that a very large number of them are absolutely necessary. As a matter of fact, I have had a number of complaints from the States with regard to my action in not providing money for the construction of works which, in my opinion, can only be constructed out of loan money, because they are too large to be charged to the ordinary revenue. Most of the works that are provided for in the schedule are in connection with the telephone and telegraph systems. I have circulated extracts from a report which has been furnished by the officers of the Post and Telegraph department in the various States. The report itself is very voluminous, and copies have been placed in the various rooms for the use of honourable members who desire to go into ""the details, but I have extracted and circulated such portions of the report as I thought would afford honourable members sufficient information regarding its purport. It is evident from the statements made that the present provision with regard to telephones is altogether inadequate for the requirements of the Commonwealth, and that we cannot patch them up, but must have a complete re-organization of the whole of the systems if we are to give satisfaction. The report shows that this cannot be attributed to faulty action on the part of any of the States Governments in the past. They have worked according to the knowledge and information at their command, and it is stated that the large American telephone company-The Bell CompanyI think it is called have had to spend -immense sums of money in doing exactly what is now proposed in connection with our telephone systems. None of our systems are working well, and this to some extent is due to the fact that we now have electric light and power installations with which we had not to contend some j'ears ago and which now interfere to a considerable extent with the proper working of the telephones. Our'switch-boards are also out of date, and the poles which cany our overhead wires are so full that it is said to be almost impossible to add arty more wires. In fact, the report must convince honourable members that our telephone systems are not up to date, and that they should be entirely re-organized. switch-board in Svdiiev? Sir GEORGETURNER in use for eighteen months or two years and has been condemned as one which ought not to have been constructed and which will have to be replaced by what is called the common battery switch-board. This is recommended not only for Sydney, but for every place where a large number of subscribers have to be attended to. penditure proposed may seem to be large, it will ultimately result in a saving to the Commonwealth, because if we attempt to carry on with the old switch-boards, or to duplicate them-som e of them are practically full, and would have to be duplicated a large expenditure would have to be incurred in attending to the two boards, and possibly in connecting them. It is therefore absolutely necessary to adopt a new system. This will involve a very large expenditure during the next three years, aggregating between £500,000 and £600,000. That would be in addition to the ordinary expenditure in the constructionand extension of our telephone and telegraph systems. Of course, in Victoria the extensions are not so large as in the States, such as New South Wales and Queensland, where they have a very large territory to cover. To my mind it would be unreasonable to say that the revenue of the present year, or of the few following years should bear the whole of this heavy extraordinary expenditure, because future years will undoubtedly receive the advantage of the increased revenue which the States will derive from the works proposed. Whilst there is no doubt at the present time a strong feeling against borrowing, we must not be led into saying that we are not justified in borrowing for any purpose whatever. I think we should all iike, if we could, to avoid borrowing and to provide for the whole of these works out of revenue. Ministers would like to do so, if possible, but when we consider the amount of money that has to be expended and the position of the various States we are forced to the conclusion that it will be impossible to carry out the whole of the works, and to provide for them wholly out of the revenue for the next few years. A t the same time. I am quite in accord with those who say that there should be no excessiveborrowing, and that we should not borrow money in order to carry out what inay be looked upon as non-productive works. W it h regard to these works, W h a t about the however, Parliament will have the fullest control, because the details of the proposed T h a t has been expenditure will have to be brought forward annually, and I think we may rest assured that Parliament will take very good care that there is no extravagant expenditure of loan moneys. We have already shown a desire to go as far as we could in the construction of works out of ordinary revenue, because last week we voted nearly £120,000 Although the exfor buildings and various other works which, in most of the States, would in the ordinary course have been constructed out of loan funds. I have carefully revised the list of works to be provided for out of loan money, as submitted in another B ill . I have gone through it with responsible officers with a view to ascertain if there were any works which could not be legitimately charged against loan votes. Still it will be within the province of the House, if they consider that any of the works suggested ought not to be constructed out of loan moneys, and ought to be provided for out of revenue, to say that such works shall be eliminated from the schedule. The list is made up principally of works in the department to which I have referred, and in connection with the completion of one or two large buildings which it would be rather unfair to provide for out of revenue in any particular year. If we regarded this matter purely from the Commonwealth point of view we might have little difficulty in disposing of it. We might say simply that, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the amounts that we are entitled to charge against the States would enable us to pay for the whole of the works out of revenue as it comes in. We are entitled under the Constitution to spend one-fourth of the net amount collected through the customs and excise, and at the present time we have not availed ourselves of that money to the full extent. In considering this matter, however, I must ask honourable members not to deal",15,Drawbacks Supplies Mr G B Edwards Asked The Minis Bonython Has Ter For Trade And Customs Upon Notice
10,Mr Henrywillis,"with totals only. Unfortunately, we are in the habit of looking at the aggregate expenditure, and of insisting, because the amount collected throughout the Commonwealth is more than enough for our purposes, that we are entitled to expend it. have always felt, however, that we must also consider the fact that a large portion of this amount really goes back to two out of the six States, and that whilst there might be no hardship to these States in our expending the money, the other States would undoubtedly feel the pressure. In addition to that, we must regard this, as it is, as new expenditure, which is to be charged on a population basis against all the States, no matter in which State the money may be expended. If this were transferred expenditure there would be no difficulty with regard to the two States which will get back more than the amount required for their own purposes. We could go on expending the money required in those States, and allow the works in the other States to remain in abeyance, although that would be hardly fair to the States which are worse off for revenue. This expenditure is to be charged against all the States, on a population basis, and therefore we could not allow the works to remain in abeyance in the poorer States whilst proceeding with those required in the States which are in a better position. We have the constitutional right to take one-fourth of the total revenue derived from customs and excise, but I feel very strongly that we are trustees for tbe States with regard to the whole of the revenue that is collected, and that we are bound to act in such a manner as to protect the States. During the federal electoral campaign I always said that it would be the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to protect the financial interests of the States, and not to take any step that would be prejudicial to them, because any tiling that would injure one of the States would undoubtedly re-act upon the whole of the Commonwealth. Eventually we shall probably have a different system, and, instead of following out the bookkeeping plan, adopt the course of distributing the revenue which will confer advantages on some of the States. In the meantime, however, for the first few years we have to bear in mind that the money has to be returned as it is collected, and I wish to impress upon honourable members that we must not deal with the totals only, but take into consideration the positions of the various States. As far as New South Wales is concerned there will be no difficulty, because she will have ample means to meet all her reasonable requireI ments. Western Australia also undoubtedly has a very large revenue at present, but it must be remembered that, as the sliding scale comes into operation, the revenue will be largely reduced. As soon as the duties now levied upon imports from the other States are reduced, there will be a large increase in the importations from the States, and a corresponding decrease in the imports from outside Australia. In two or three j'ears,. therefore, the revenue will shrink veiy considerably, and the State having a very large territory will undoubtedly require to spend a considerable amount of money in the development of its resources. Now we come to the State of Victoria, with whose finances I am more particularly acquainted. This State will probably this year show excess of expenditure over revenue to the extent of £400,000. That is a very large amount, which will have to be provided for, and if we look forward to the next year or two we can see that it will be very hard for the Victorian Government to make both ends meet. There will be a considerable falling off in the railway receipts, in consequence of the want of wool to carry and the scarcity of back loading, and owing to other causes. Victoria has also received this year a considerable amount of revenue from sugar which has been imported from abroad instead of being obtained from Queensland. Next year our revenue from that source will probably fall off very considerablj'. Owing to the action of this Parliament in remitting the duties upon tea and kerosene, we shall also suffer a heavy loss. In South Australia, too, there will probabh' be a largely diminished income. The same reniark is .applicable to Queensland; and we know the bad time through which that State is passing. I mention these facts to impress upon honourable members the necessity for being careful to take no steps which will prejudice the position of those States. During the next j ear or two thej' will probably exr perience bad times, and therefore we should avoid taking any action which will impose additional burdens upon them. Moreover, in any action that we take we must guard against forcing the States Governments to impose taxation upon fhe people on account of expenditure incurred by the Connnionwealth. If-as will probably happen in a .few years-the revenue were distributed upon a population basis, things would not be so bad in some of the States, but if we adopt the practice which has been suggested of providing these large sums from revenue, I am perfectly certain that we shall leave the Statesi n a difficult positiona position which will compel them to levy extra taxation. In view of their present condition, it would be exceedingly unwise for us to take any such step. Then, if we are to take other obligations upon ourselves-as has been suggested-the expenditure will no doubt increase year by year. Por example, if we carry out the proposal of the State Premiers, and pay for t i e buildings which have been transferred to the Commonwealth by establishing a sinking fund and paying interest upon their cost, or by taking over a portion of the State loans, we shall go very near to doing away altogether with the difference between the amount which we are entitled to expend and that which we actually spend. pose to agree to the proposal of the State Premiers without consulting the House? Sir GEORGETURNER The matter will have to be dealt with by the introduction of a B ill . ""We thought that our proposal was a reasonable one, but as we have taken over certain buildings, the Premiers think it is only fair that we should take over a portion of their loans. That is a course to which we have not yet. agreed, though we may have to agree to it eventually. Treasurer propose to spend this year ? Sir GEORGETURNER to spend about £600,000. ture to be spread over a period of three years 1 Sir GEORGETURNER out that we proposed an expenditure of between £500,000 and £600,000, which would be spread over three years. But the ordinary expenditure would make up the difference. The total amount which it is proposed to spend is about £660,000. MrA . McLEAN Treasurer expects to spend that money next year 1 Sir GEORGETURNER We cannot spend it this year. The amounts which we provide will practically have to be devoted to next year. I am not going to say that we should be entirely guided by the practice of the States in regard to this expenditure, but we know that for several years past it has been the practice of the States to construct large works out of loan moneys, for the reason that, in the majority of them, the revenue could not possiblyhave carried the burden. While, perh as, our action ought not to be determined by the practice which has hitherto been followed, we cannot altogether disregard that factor in considering whether we are justified in borrowing money for the particular purposes proposed. Of course, the interest will be charged against the individual States in which the work is done. If a certain amount is spent in one State, and, as a consequence, that State derives an increased revenue from its post-office, it would be manifestly unfair to ask the other States to bear a portion of the interest upon the capital cost. While the sinking fund to repay the capital would be D o the Government proa charge upon the basis of population, the interest upon the money expended would be a fair debit to the particular States benefitted, either by way of rental upon their C e r t a in l y not. buildings or of a charge for the use of the telegraph or telephone lines, which are constructed out of the borrowed money. During the first few years we can undoubtedly afford to provide a sinking fund to the extent of 2 per cent, upon the amount borrowed. The utilization of that amount in a way that I shall explain in connection with another B ill would greatly reduce the interest which we have to pay. But I much does the specially wish honourable members to look at the expenditure which we are forcing We expect upon the States. I propose first to deal with next year's expenditure. I think that is not that expendiwe may fairly reckon the ordinary new expenditure, independently of buildings, at £260,000. This year it was between No . Ipointed £230,000 and £240,000 Then we have determined to construct buildings which will necessitate an expenditure of about £120,000.

B y doing that we have placed a considerable burden on the States, and if we go further and say that works, which we know ought to be carried out in re-organizing the telephone system and extending telephones and telegraphs, must be done out of revenue, the burden will become unjustifiable. If the House determines that there shall be no borrowing for these purposes, the only course I can see is to allow the works to remain undone for a year or two, when we shall have gained experience and know exactly how the Tariff will operate after the various alterations which have been made. There is one other course we might pursue, but I am not prepared at present to recommend this to the House. In Canada the banks were compelled to hold a certain amount of their reserve funds in Dominion notes. When we come to deal with the banking laws generally we shall have to give grave and careful consideration to this matter. While such a plan may work well in Canada, it does not follow that it would work equally well in Australia, separated as we are by such a long distance from the place where gold can, if necessary, be obtained. This is not a simple question. If we adopted the Canadian plan the monies obtained from that source might well, I think, be utilized for the large expenditure which will be necessary when we have to construct our federal capital. Air. McCAY means loan monev in another form. Sir GEORGE "" TURNER money; a kind of forced loan without interest. So far as the principle is conerned, there is very little difference between constructing works out of money obtained under the Canadian system and constructing them out of loan; the only point is that interest is saved. These are the facts which I ask honourable members to bear in mind when we are dealing with the question whether or not we are to borrow. As I have said, the Government would be very glad, if they could possibly see their way, to have all works constructed out of revenue ; but looking at the fact that many of the States will get back no more, or very little more, than they were collecting at the time federation took place, and also having regard to the fact that we are imposing a considerable burden on Lhe States' revenue, we are not justified in taking that further step. Under the circumstances, I trust that honourable members will give favourable consideration to the proposals which the Government have submitted. The one question is-Borrowing orno borrowing? If honourable members carefully consider the whole question, I think it will be forced on them, as it has been forced on me that, in fairness and justice to the States, we are bound to expend a reasonable amount each year out of loan funds. We must be careful, however, to spend the money on works which will be fairly reproductive, and not on mere maintenance and repairs. I submit the B ill to honourable members for their favorable consideration. adjourned. LOAN APPROPRIATION BILL. Sir GEORGETURNER ( B a l a c l a v a Treasurer) I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill shows the appropriation of the money which it is proposed to raise if the House should affirm the principle that we are to borrow.

The figures on this subject which have been supplied to honourable members, and the extracts from reports, show that a telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney will, in all probability, be a paying one, or, at all events, will not show a heavy loss. Even if there be a small loss it will, I think, be justified by the benefits derived by the trading and commercial community. to be made ? Sir GEORGETURNER I think, will be 6s. 6d. for three minutes' conversation. It is proposed to supply a new system of switchboards in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, and also to provide additional switchboards in the other States. A very large expenditure will have to be incurred in Victoria, where it is necessary to almost entirely remodel the telephone system. Honourable members who have looked at the Melbourne streets, particularly the narrow streets, and have seen the enormous number of wires and cables overhead, must have come to the conclusion that in a very short time the wires, .is in other places, must be put underground. I shall not take honourable members through the list of items, because to do so would simply weary them. I trust, however, that honourable members will take an opportunity of considering the explanations and extracts from reports which have been circulated. When in committee it will be quite competent for honourable members to say that some of these works are not of sufficient urgency to be carried out at the present moment, and that they ought to be postponed for a year or two. able members to decide that some of the works should be constructed out of revenue. This,is entirely a committee Bill, and, considering that the full facts are set forth in the papers which have been circulated, I shall no longer detain honourable members. journed. BILL. Sir GEORGETURNER ( B a l a c l a v a stock was made payable at a certain date, Treasurer) I move That the Bill be now read a second time. 38 G This is a machinery Bill, for the purpose of managing inscribed stock, should the House in its wisdom determine that a loan is to be raised. The Bill provides for the creation of capital stock for the purpose of raising, by way of loan, any money, the authority to borrow which is granted under any Act. ThisB ill does not in itself provide for the raising of any money, but. leaves it to Parliament from time to timeto determine how much shall be borrowedThe rate of interest is fixed at what appears to be the ruling rate, namely, 3 per The charge, cent. It is wiser, it seems to me, to have a fixed rate, than a rate which may hechanged from time to time as stock is issued. -that it is better to have one uniform stock, than several stocks with varyingrates of interest loans under this B ill ? Sir GEORGETURNER All loans floated within the Commonwealth are underthis Bill, which does not apply to loans raised outside. There is no attempt at present to provide for floating loans outsidethe Commonwealth. The loan is necessarily made a charge on the consolidated revenue, and stock is to be issued as may bedirected by the Order in Council authorizing the raising of the stock. It is provided that there may be two classes of stock, one of which is interminable. I do not think, however, that there is much likelihood of that class of stock being adopted. Some years ago, when in the State Government, I made inquiries in Great Britain on this point,, and was advised very strongly that interminable stock would be looked on with grave displeasure in the London market. It will be also open to honorEngland, with option to pay off. Sir GEORGETURNER T h a t is not. interminable stock. The other stock provided for in the B ill is payable at a fixed date. It probably would be made payable in 50years, and a right taken after 30 years to pay it off on giving certain notice. Interminable stock can be paid off at the reason it is not looked on with favour by those who have to advance the money in to redeem the stock after a fixed date.

New South Wales. Sir GEORGETURNER other States. The money set apart for the sinking fund has been hoarded up to meet a liability when it became due, and has formed a portion of the State trust funds, but impecunious Treasurers have used these trust funds, and the sinking funds have vanished. We should do all we can to prevent that happening in connection with the Commonwealth administration. TheB ill provides that not less than 1 per cent, per annum shall be paid into these sinking funds. In the early days of our borrowing we can well afford to contribute 2 per cent., but the B ill makes the minimum 1 percent., payable half-yearly on the quarter days upon which no interest falls due. fund of 1 per. cent, per annum, the principal cannot be paid off in 30 years.

Personally, I should not be averse to making it 2 per cent. honourable gentleman agree to make it 3, per -cent. ? Sir CEORGETURNER matter for the consideration of the committee. The amount we shall have to provide each half-year will not be very large at first, because, until the federal capital is established, no Treasurer will be able to undertake any very large schemes. We may hereafter have to borrow considerable sums in connection with such works as the transcontinental railway or river navigability, but in fixing the sinking fund all the circumstances of the case must be taken into consideration. I have left it to the Government of the day to say at what rate contributions to the'sinking fund for any loan 3S o 2 shall be made. They need not be uniform Parliament may say that there shall be contributions of 2 per cent, towards the sinking fund for a loan for one class of a work, and of 1 per cent, for a loan for another class, according to the nature of the undertaking.

We also said that we thought that up to that particular date, the 1st May, we ought to discharge some of the liabilities which had been incurred, but that afterwards the salary of £10,000 would have to be looked upon as covering practically everything, except the cost of a very few services such as those of caretakers and cleaners, some orderlies, which would be provided for in the future from the Defence department, and telephones and telegrams, which would be comparatively small items. AVe stated that we would also make provision in regard to railway travelling. value of the services just mentioned by the Treasurer, over and above the £10,000 allowed to H is Excellency as salary-wil l it run into thousands? Sir GEORGETURNER amount will be comparatively small. The caretakers and one or two cleaners, and the telephone and telegraphic services will have to be provided for, but railway travelling will not be charged for by the States, so that the amount to be provided for would be comparatively small. Later on the Attorney General will submit to the House a statement as to what is proposed in connection with the allowances to any future Governor General. AVe told H is Excellency that we felt perfectly certain that the House would be prepared to pay certain allowances up to the 1st May. Whilst matters were pending for many months, a number of accounts came in and were provided for out of the Treasurer's advance account, until it was decided whether they were to be paid personally by His Excellency or to be deducted from the allowance which it was then hoped Parliament would make. The items which will be covered by this £5,000 are few in number. I have provided for £5,000, but so far as I know £4,000 will meet all requirements. It is difficult to say exactly what the amount will be, because some of the accounts are not rendered promptly. For gas we have paid £948, and there are accounts now in hand amounting to £ 8 1 . These are mostly Melbourne accounts. For electric light we have paid £174, and we owe £335. For fuel we have paid £ 2 1 0 , and outstanding accounts amount to £156. For orderlies, including forage, horse-shoeing, and uniforms, £ 1 0 2 has been paid, and £604 is owing. These orderlies are taken from the New South Wales constabulary, and the amount owing will have to be handed to the New South Wales Government, to recoup them for the pay which has been given to the men during the fifteen or sixteen months in which they have been acting as H is Excellency's orderlies. Then another item which would have been payable out of the allowance to H is Excellency is for crockery, marquees, and breakages, for which £ 5 3 has been paid, and £79 is owing. For flags, £ 7 3 has been paid, and £ 1 6 is represented by outstanding accounts. The accounts of the Government Printer represent various items in connection >vith entertainments at Government House and other requirements of H is Excellency, and, with other accounts for stationery and newspapers, and a few miscellaneous articles, represent a total of £775, which has not yet been paid. The total of the accounts which No ; the I have mentioned is £3,613, of which £1,563 has been paid subject to adjustment, and £2,050 is outstanding. Therefore, although we are asking for a vote of £5,000 in order that we may be on the safe side, we do not think we shall be called upon to pay more than £4,000. Under all the circumstances, and in view of the misunderstanding which arose, and the fact that these are accounts which the Prime Minister and I myself practically told His Excellency we believed honourable members would agree to pay, I trust that no difficulty will be raised, and that honourable members will agree to the proposal without much discussion. In the future we can arrange mutters so that the new Governor General shall know how much he is to receive, and there will be no misunderstanding, and no unpleasantness, as in the past. wish that the Treasurer had been able to inform us as to the intentions of the Government regarding future allowances to the Governor General, as well as to claim our consideration for past payments. The right honourable gentleman's statement has shown the absolute need of a definite understanding as to the allowances which are to be attached to the position of the Governor General in future.

If the Commonwealth have been committed to certain payments to H is Excellency by any statements made by his Ministers, we are bound to carry out that undertaking. I understood the Treasurer to say that he and the Prime Minister had indicated to His Excellency that Parliament would no doubt grant these allowances up to the 1st May. in connection with the Governor General's Establishment Bill that the allowances would not be continued. According to the Treasurer's statement the Governor; General was led to believe that the outlay which he was incurring would be repaid by the Commonwealth.

Fortunately these amounts will notrecurwithout theauthority of Parliament. Before any future arrangement is made, Ministers have promised that a schedule of the allowances proposed shall be submitted to and approved by Parliament. I am sorry that it is not in our possession now, as it ought to be. Under these circumstances I regard the whole affair as unfortunate, and believe that we have been committed to an expenditure beyond that which it was intended we should incur. But, whilst the position is an unfortunate one, it would be H is Excellency knew from our action a still greater misfortune if we allowed anything to stand against our good name in connection with our transactions with the Governor General. U p to the present nothing can be urged against our good name, and in order that nothing shall be, I intend to support the proposed vote, but on the distinct understanding that a schedule of future allowances shall be submitted to Parliament at an early date.

It was with an idea of being reasonably generous in the matter that I voted for the additional £10,000. But I am assured since that the amount expended on the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York was not £10,000, but that there was a margin, which the Governor General now has. I do not grudge the Governor General that margin, whatever it may be, because in my mind it wipes out the whole moral obligation which might have existed as between the Governor General and the Parliament, because of the advice given by the Prime Minister. ber mean to say that the Governor General made a profit on the £10,000 ? stand that the expenditure, especially that in connection with the Royal visit, did not amount to £10,000, but to £9,000. the last debate. for the £10,000 with the object of being reasonably generous under thecircumstances, and we had no idea there would be any attempt to bring up this question again.

It struck me that the Prime Minister, when in charge of the Governor General's Allowance B ill , was a little ingenious rather than ingenuous in regard to a comparison with the sum paid to the Governor General of Canada. I obtained from the official Gazette of Canada the amount that is voted to the Governor General there for his establishment. I forget what the figure was, but it was disputed by the Prime Minister, and,-1 think, by the Treasurer. Governor General of Canada, was given by them, and yet even on their own figures the total was (he same, or very little more than the allowances. Sir GEORGE TuisNiiu -We are not paying £18,000.

It was because the Governor General drew attention to the difference that he offered to return something under £2,000, if the view were taken that only official expenditure in connection with the Royal visit was to be debited to him. MrA . M ! c LEAN to mention the matter, but it is very unfortunate that the Government did not take Parliament into their confidence at an earlier perioda course which might have saved a great deal of misunderstanding and unpleasantness oh both sides. However, the Governor General having been given to understand by his Ministers that his annual allowance would be increased bj' £8,000, and he having been led into additional expenditure in consequence of that promise, it would haidly be fair or dignified for the Commonwealth to take advantage of the fact. Therefore, we have scarcely any alternative under the circumstances than to sanction the payment of this amount in regard to the past. I sincerely hope, however, that this vote will not be regarded as justifying the Government in making any promises in the future without first taking Parliament into their confidence. This is a matter upon which Parliament should be consulted beforehand. Of course, there are some items of expenditure in connection with the up-keep of Government-house and grounds, and these, which have always been paid by the States, were not under consideration when we decided the question of the additional £8,000 per annum. U n fortunately on that occasion we were not given to understand that the amount we are now considering lay behind. Sir Minister mentioned the cost of lighting, that the vote of £10,000 got rid of the Goverand of the Governor General's staff-h e nor-General's allowances altogether-that we mentioned all the items. MrA .

MrA . M c LEAN But the Governorin the States is to allow the cost of lighting and other services. MrA . M c LEAN I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that under the unfortunate circumstances we have no alternative but to vote the amount proposed. I'do not attach so much importance It may be too late to the last promise made by the Government on the 1st May, because the money had been spent. A part of the bills had been sent into the Treasurer for liquidation in anticipation of Parliament passing the extra allowance of £8,000 per annum, and it appears to me that, although the £2,000 had been paid, it was intended to continue sending the bills in until the whole £8,000 had been liquidated. had been paid; there were accounts for £2,000, and a few more had to come in. MrA . M c LEAN I would not consider myself bound by the promise made on the 1st May. Certain expenditure had been incurred prior to that date, and it does not affect the matter in one-way or the other, except that the Government expressed their belief that Parliament would pay it, but that such allowances would not be continued. The first promise goes back much further, and it appears tome that the Commonwealth, in deference to its own good name and reputation, is bound to vote the amount asked for. While I. shall vote for the item, I hope thab the Government will not, in regard to any future Governor General, make any promise or commit the Parliament, directly or indirectly, without first consulting honourable members.

79,Sir George Turner,"A sum of £1,500salary of £10,000. We nil know the peculiar circumstances under which that B ill was passed; and I do not think any parallel can be found in Australian politics. The Prime Minister had practically agreed, or come to some understanding with the Governor General, to bring in that B ill , and the Government intended to pass it at all hazards. If they had no such intention, why did they mislead the Governor General in the way they did? But the Government abandoned the B ill at the last moment and handed it over to a private member. The position was simply disgraceful, and I hope we shall never see it repeated in the life of the Commonwealth. The Governor General has been here some eighteen months, and the £8,000 asked for would have been, roughly speaking, £12,000. Parliament voted the Governor General £10,000 for the Royal visit, and now we are asked for another £5,000, or £3,000 more than waspropo.sed in the Establishment B ill . Is that a right way in which to treat the committee? Y e t some honourable gentlemen say that because the Government have practically pledged Parliament in this matter they propose to stultify their previous action, and-vote for the item. Politics are coming to a pretty pass when members will act in that way. I shall not allow the Government to pledge my vote upon any occasion. They had neither authority nor power to make these promises to the Governor General, and if they had had any courage they would not have held office for a day after the Governor General's Establishment B ill was so radically altered in committee. I cannot find a parallel case in the history of Australian politics. I am disappointed, too, at the action of the Governor General in making these petty bargains. It would seem as though he were trying to extort as much money as he could fromtheCommonwealth. It is all very well to say thatweshould talk with bated breath about the Governor General; but, as we have heard so much from his advisers 'as to the bargain made with him, and what they said, and what he said, we have a right to express our opinion upon the matter. I think that the whole thing is a scandal, both upon the Governor General and the Ministry. not here to defend himself. MrM c DONALD are here to defend him. They have tried £16,000 for two years; but now we have to deceive the House repeatedly upon this voted £10,000, and we are asked to matter, and their action shows that they do not care much for the opinion of honourable members. £10,000 have been already voted to the Governor General apart from his salary, and £2,000 which the Government say is not for the Governor General at all, though it stands in the Estimates as a vote to defray the expenses of his household. Now we are asked-to vote another £5,000. I shall not, like some honourable members, vote for the item because the Government have made a promise; I shall divide the committee against it. bers and the people generally must admit that this is a sorry bit of business altogether. The honourable member for North Sydney appealed to the committee not to tarnish our good name. It is the members of the Ministry, not us, who are doing that, and they have now clone so on bwo occasions. opposite are making a party question of the matter. was said when the Governor General's Establishment B ill was before us, but, although any honourable member might have made that a party measure, by moving that it be read "" this day six months,"" nothing of the kind was done. I do not intend to refer to the Governor General personally ; my remarks will have relation simply to his office. The honourable member for Gippsland has spoken of the peculiar and regrettable circumstances of the case, and tells us that we have no alternative. I am tired of those words. We have the alternative in regard to this item that we have in regard to other items, and if we do not believe that the people of the Commonwealth are committed bo bhe payment of the money, we can vote against it. In the first place, the Government asked us to vote an annual allowance of £8,000, to cover certain expenditure by the Governor General, but, in committee, the B ill was dealt with in such a way that, if it had been a State measure, the State Government, introducing it would have resigned, and in the rarer atmosphere of federal politics the same action should have been taken by the against that proposal, I shall vote against But the Ministry his. £8,000 a year is equivalent .to",30,George Turne R The Prime Before Us We Were Distinctly Led To Believe

JSotwithstanding the general expression of opinion in regard to the Governor General's Establishment B ill that no action of this kind should be taken before Parliament had been consulted, we find the Ministry again pledging Parliament to the voting of £5,000. When allowances to the public servants are proposed, they are dealt with relentlessly, and why should we act differently when allowances for the highest public servant in the land are proposed? us that this sum was to cover expenditure upon lighting, fuel, entertainments, and so on, and the items which he read out might well make one think thab he was listening to the accounts of the household of Aladdin, instead of to the expenditure of the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, where the press are everywhere clamouring for economy, and the needs of the States actually demand it. As representatives of the people, we should not be more mealy-mouthed in speaking upon a subject like this than we should be if the allowances of a head messenger were at stake. generally was under discussion, the Ministry promised to withdraw them, and by that promise probably extricated themselves from a defeat upon a motion for adjournment. If there had been in our public life a dignified leader like the late Sir to increase the Governor General's salary or Henry Parkes, the present Ministry would not be in power to-day. The Commonwealbh Parliamenb should seb an example be bhe Sbate Parliamenbs, bub we have nob done so in regard bo this mabter. The leader of the labour party and others have shown that the Governor General has received the astounding amount of £35,000 or £40,000 for eighbeen months' service. He was vobed £10,000 for bhe entertainment of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. We can pass thab by, because the expenditure was national expendibure. They were invibed by bhe people, and bherefore the expendibure was of a national characber, bub ab the time that our Royal visitors were here, the public were under bhe impression that they were being entertained by the Governor General. I do not see why the Parliament should be called upon, after having al ready voted H is Excellency £10,000, bo give him anobher £5,000 bo meeb purely domestic expenses. Honourable members might as well put in a claim for an allowance in consideration of bheir having been debained in Melbourne for a longer time than they had anticipabed. Yeb a proposal in bhab direction has been consistently scouted by the press. The Treasurer tells us that the greater part of the expenditure for which we have been asked to provide has been already met out of the Treasurer's advance account, and the Government should be compelled to bake the responsibility of the payments. The present proposal is an abbempb bo overcome the The Treasurer told difficulty created by the refusal of the House to pass the Governor General's Esbablishmenb B ill in bhe form in which it was originally inbroduced, and I hope that honourable members will not supporb it. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I agree wibh bhose honourable members who have spoken againsb bhe proposed vobe, bub ab bhe same bime I do not think bhab bhe Governmenb were called upon bo resign because bhey failed bo secure the passing of the Governor General's Establishment B ill in ibs original form. The fate of a Ministry should not, in any case, depend upon the insignificant question whether When the subject of allowances we ought to vote a large amount of money for the entertainment of the aristocracy of Australia. The Ministry were culpably negligent in not wiring to the Secrebary of Sbabe for bhe Colonies ab the oubseb telling him bhat they did not intend allowances, and bhab bhey were nob going bo allow bhe Commonwealbh bo become a breeding place for any sorb of cads or snobs.' The figures which have been mentioned by bhe honourable member for Bland have astonished me. The amount which has been paid bo His Excellency bhe Governor General is equal bo nearly 200,000 dollars, and there is nobhing iu ancient or modern history bo compare wibh bhis for extravagance. The newspapers have viewed with disapproval the proposal which has been made in some quarters for an allowance to recoup honourable members the expense bo which they have been pub owing to the length of the session. It has been urged bhat H is Excellency was broughb here under a misapprehension, and honourable members may fairly say bhat they, boo, soughb bheir presenb positions under a misapprehension. I understood thab bhe firsb session of bhis Parliament would probably not last for more than four months. I have received only £ 4 0 0 for a year's work, whereas I have never earned less than £1,500 per annum since I have been in Australia. Ministry to make some addition to my salary, the newspapers tell me that I must not exploit the Treasury. There is no difference between the position of honourable members and that of the Governor General, except that we are starving and the Governor General is not. We have been here now for thirteen months, and there is no hope of our getting away till Christmas. If it were not for duty to the country when the Governorthe representatives of the States which are farthest removed from Melbourne there would be no quorum in this Chamber on Fridays, when the Ministry desire to keep a House in order to pass their Supply Bills, and yet we hear that the honourable members from South Australia and ""Victoria are opposed to the proposal that representatives should receive an increase of salary. I do not oppose this proposal because of any ill feeling towards the Governor General. I have the profoundest respect for him, because he is an able and intellectual man. But I am attacking the system which has grown up and which has been followed by the Ministry. W o must have democratic simplicib\ in our public institutions, and if r there is no noble gentleman in England who is able to run Government House and keep the people loyal by providing them with champagne and big fat turkeys, let us appoint as Governor General some Australian millionaire who is willing to spend his money in that way. Miltiades, who Avon the Battle of Marathon, and drove the Persians into Asia, was content to live in simplicity in a dwelling as humble as any in Athens, and j'et it is considered necessary to keep up an immense barracks here in order to impress the people. The Australians, next to the Americans, are the most intelligent people on earth, and no circuses or tin-pot shows a,re needed to impress them, or make them loyal. The loj'alty of the Australians springs from their intelligence, and is better than any feeling that springs merelv from the stomach. The proposed vote should be passed by the committee, because an assurance has been given by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to H is Excellency the Governor General that certain expenditure incurred by him would be provided for. The action of the House in refusing to ratify the Government proposal to make an annual allowance of £8,000 to H is Excellency the Governor General was a cenBecauseI ask the sure upon their administration, and as they did not resign, H is Excellency the Governor General had no recourse but to retire from his position. I hold that the committee should vote the £5,000 proposed, because the Government have pledged themselves to the Governor General to recoup him ' for his out of pocket expenses. H a d the Ministry done their General's Establishment B ill was practically rejected, they would have resigned. Having failed to take theproper constitutional course, there was only one alternative left to the Governor General, which was to retire from his high office. I shall support the vote in fulfilment of the pledge made to the Governor General by his constitutional advisers. I gave when a somewhat similar matter was under discussion a little time ago is -I think a guarantee that I am prepared to allow anything in reason in relation to the Governor General's expenses. The sum which this House voted upon that occasion was one which Lord Hopetoun could fairly claim to have expended on behalf of the people of Australia. But this is altogether another matter, involving a very important principle, which prevents me from supporting the Government. Honourable 'members have been told that there is some understanding wibh the Governor General of a more or less definite character in connection with the expenditure covered by this particular item. I am unable to see how honourable members can be asked to endorse any such agreement. I have no doubt that the present Government will take reasonable care bhab no excessive expendibure is permitted under bhe heading of allowances. Bub ib is quibe possible bo imagine bhab ab some future period we may have a Governmenb who are nob imbued with the same ideas of economy that are entertained by at least some members of the present administration, and if we vote the sum proposed, it may fairly be regarded as a precedent. Therefore I cannot pledge myself to the Government proposal.

The Government must take the responsibility of their mistakes in this connection. I shall certainly not vote for the proposal before the committee. Sir LANGDONBONYTHON (South Australia) I have already expressed my opinion upon this subject, and I shall not repeat what I said upon a previous occasion ; but as I agree substantially with a good deal that has been said, and as I hold that the Government are responsible for the muddle and misunderstanding which have occurred in connection with this matter, I feel I must ask the Treasurer to give the committee an assurance that when another Governor General is appointed, there will be no misunderstanding as to the salary attaching to the position, or as to what the allowances are to be. good care of that. phase of this matter to which I should like to call attention. I am opposed to voting the sum of £5,000 provided upon these Estimates, and I cannot help remarking that a good deal more explanation seems to be required than has been given by the Government. If there has been any understanding between the Government and the Governor General, I. presume it must have been in connection with this particular class of expenditure. Very big items of expenditure have been presented to us for printing, gas, electric light, &c. I do not know whether these items . refer solely to Government House, or whether the Government have had anything to do with them. If the expenditure set forth has been incurred entirely by the Governor General, why should Parliament be asked to pay for it 1 On the contrary, if the expenditure has been under the control of the Government, the latter should discharge its just obligations. There appears to be a lot of mystery which I should like to see removed in connection with this matter. But the particular phase of the question to which I desire to call attention is that the Government have spent large sums of money without legislative authority whilst Parliament was in session.. . In New South Wales an administration was deposed for having expended £ 1 5 0 without authority whilst Parliament was in recess, and I believe that one of the members of the present Commonwealth Ministry made considerable political capital out of that fact. I intend to vote against the proposed expenditure, because I do not think it is necessary. AVe should declare, once for all, that the Governor General is not expected to spend money in mere entertainment, and that we consider his salary of £10,000 should be sufficient to cover all expenses. I protest against the j>ernicious principle which has been adopted by the Government of spending money without the consent of Parliament. no honourable member in my desire to see due economy exercised in our governmental expenditure, and I deeply regret that at the commencement of our federal existence it seems impossible to curb extravagance. Especially do I desire to see an example of simplicity and domestic economy I shall take very set by those in authority. A t one time. I really thought that under federation we should have an opportunity of making a fair start in this direction. 'But I find myself disappointed, and, very much against my inclination and better judgment I am compelled to support the expenditure proposed. However, I am very glad to believe it will be the last of the kind that this committee will be asked to sanction. I wish to ask honourable members who desire to see the work of governing the country earned on as economically as possible consistently with efficient administration, to look nearer home, and ascertain whether we cannot reduce some of the unnecessary expenditure that is undoubtedly being incurred.

It might just as well be said that the members of this Parliament receive the cost of the lights in front of Parliament House, or the interest of £25,000 a year on the cost of the building. The item now under consideration has no more to do with the salary of the Governor General than it has to do with the salaries of honourable members. There are certain observances which attach to official positions, and if honourable members desire to abolish all ceremony they should commence with that connected with Parliament. I do not think, however, that such a course would mean any saving. There are a couple of mounted police on duty at Sydney Government House, and we are told that the cost of these men is an addition to the Governor General's salary. -which may be dealt with on another occasion.

If the arrangement under discussion had been made with any one but the Governor General, it is possible that he could sue the Commonwealth for, and recover from them, any expenditure made under it ; and I take it that Parliament would not refuse to vote the money which the court said should be paid. This is one of those arrangements which, when entered into by the Government, must be accepted by Parliament; but the moment the money has been voted we are free to say to the Government"" You did wrong in making the arrangement, and we have no further confidence in your administrative ability."" That is not my view alone ; it is the opinion of men who have had experience in executive positions. W h y have they police t Under any circumstances, I should feel compelled to support the Government on this occasion, but, inasmuch as the money is to provide for expenditure which is no more the expenditure of the Governor General than it is my expenditure, I feel still more obliged to vote for it.

I blame the Government because they did not pursue the course which I believe is always taken in Great Britain when any matter affecting the Crown is under consideration. English Ministry would bring forward a proposal for granting an allowance to a member of the Royal family without first taking into their confidence the leaders of the Opposition. front benches have come to an arrangement upon delicate matters of that kind, that a Bill is introduced, and it appears to me that our Government might have followed a similar policy. I think that if they had done so they would have avoided a great deal of the friction and which has come to Australia in connection with this matter. Treasurer shows that the actual salary of the Governor General would be insignificant, and unworthy of the Commonwealth, if it were supposed to cover all his expenses. State Governors have been given allowances, and the occupant of the loftier position of Governor General should not be required to meet such expenses as the salaries of his private secretaries and aidesde-camp. provide the Governor General with an adequate salary-something year-and expect him to pay everything, or give him £10,000 a year, and undertake to pay certain definite expenses. opinion, the salaries of the attached to his household should .be paid by Parliament, and I have no doubt the Ministry will have a clear understanding upon this subject with Lord Hopetoun's successor. Something has been said about economy. nomic stock, but I do not believe in meanness, and I think that the extra expense incurred by the occasionally occupying the House at Sydney, which the New South Wales Government have liberally placed at his disposal, should be met by the Commonwealth. not have a salary which would tie him down to the occupation of one official, residence; he should be able to visit Sydney and the various State capitals, so that he could be seen by the people generally, and, if necessary, entertain them to some extent, though TheI am told that entertainments are regarded as completely out of date by this Spartan Parliament. While economy is a good thing, I think that to give the Governor General only £10,000 a year and expect him to pay all expenses is unworthy of the Commonwealth. No Mr G. B . EDWARDS (South Sydney).

Mr G. B .

Mr G. B . EDAVARDS -What I complain of is that these items should have been kept back until the last moment. The Government must have known from the outset that somesuch items must be provided for, and they should have been placed in the Estimates-in-chief in the first instance. This House is not likely to become an institution for registering the deciees of the Executive ; and although we cannot do anything practical if the money has been spent, we can impress upon the Executive the necessity of acting constitutionally by voting against then' proposals, and allowing the responsibility to rest entirely upon them. MrM c CAY (Corinella) I recognise that the present position of the committee is clue to the action of the Government, and J. feel the greatest reluctance in voting for this proposal. I should vote against it if I did not think that we should be punishing the Governor General, who would have to meet expenditure which he was under the impression would be provided for by the Government out of the public funds. I blame the Government for having, without testing the feeling of honourable members, assumed that they would be willing to vote 38 i i these allowances, but the refusal to vote the money now will not mend matters. The Government have not fairly treated the House or H is Excellency the .Governor General, and the proof that they have not We had a full explanation acted wisely is afforded by the fact that it has been necessary to disclose what took place at interview after interview between F r o m the tenor the Governor General and his advisers. There should never be any necessity to disclose the results of interviews between the Governor General and his advisers. Thequestion of the Governor General's allowances should have been settled from the outset, and honourable members should have* been afforded a clear idea as to the total expenditure in connection with the Governor General's establishment. The items should; be properly grouped together instead of' being scattered through the Estimates. Weshould know distinctly to the last penny what it is costing the community to maintain the position of the Governor General. distinct statement is to be made of all allowances and expenditure in connection with the Governor General's establishments. MrM c CAY It is on the faith of that promise that I. shall support, not the Government, but the proposal to recoup for the expenditure which H is Excellency the Governor General was given to understand would be met out of public funds. It is apparent from the fact that the Treasurer and Prime Minister told H is Excellency after the Governor General's Establishment B ill had been amended, that the money which he had already expended would be recouped to him-that the previous understanding .was of an entirely different 'character. . We were not able to obtain from the Prime Minister a definite statement as to. what took place at former interviews, and I am sorry that he is not here to explain the discrepancy between his statements and those we have recently heard. He never explained to us what has since been made clear by the Treasurer, and we can only infer that H is Excellency was given to. understand from the first that his allowances would be paid in accordance with the practice previously followed in the States. In however false a position we may feel that we have been placed by the dilatoriness of the Government, we are bound to reimburse His Excellency.",37,George Turne R The Prime Before Us We Were Distinctly Led To Believe

I should like the public to be made aware of this fact so that they may be in a position to determine whether the Governor General is poorly or dearly paid. . I hold that he is dearly paid. But altogether apart from the £10,000 which the Commonwealth voted in connection with tiie reception of the Duke and Duchess of York, an additional £5,000 has now been sanctioned. The public should be given to understand that the cost of the Governor General during eighteen months has been £40,000. The honourable member for New England cannot defend the position that Lord Hopetoun has been scurvily treated by the people of Australia. I believe that if the leader of the Opposition had been present to-day he would have compelled the Ministry to abandon their guns. If the Government are not punished for their action, they may be induced to repeat the offence. MrM c CAY (Corinella) It is quite, possible thab the fervid appeal of the honourable member for Dalley might prevail with me were it not for two facts concerning which I am in doubt. The firsb is as bo who the new Prime Minister would be. I always understood that the mover of a successful adverse motion was enbibled to be sent for by the Governor General to form a new Administration. Bub in bhis case the mover's chief follower is bhe honourable member for Dalley, who follows the honourable and learned member for Werriwa only far enough to repudiate him entirely. Therefore the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is to be Prime Minister and Pooh Bah, and to run the whole Adminisbrabion himself. IfI am compelled bo make a choice between the present Ministry and a Government Jed by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, followed ab a long distance by the honourable member for Dalley, I shall be obliged to retain my present quarters, because, bad as they may be, they cannob be so bad as I conceive the others might be. motion deserves more consideration than ib has obbained, and I am inclined to deny that there has been any repudiation of it. I notice that the only honourable member who has risen on the other side has sought by a few amusing phrases to wriggle 3S ii 2 out of the position. The Victorian delegation, as has been pointed out, have almost to a man thrown aside all caution, and voted to support a line of conduct at which, on the hustings, they would never even have dared bo hint They have commibbed themselves to a. line of policy absolutely opposed to every tradition of representative government. 1 see five or six members of the Victorian delegation present: a little while ago I think there were eight. They are supposed, by a long-suffering counbiy, bo attend bo bhe business of Parliamenb, and yeb bhey do it so badly thab not. one-third are presenb on such a crisis as bhis. When they are here they support a Government whose action not one of them would venture to defend ; and every one of them has been more or less an apologist for the sins of the Govern^ nient. ""Retrenchment"" and such shibboleths can never be employed consistently by these gentlemen again. We have, arrived at the astounding conclusion that the Governor General has his salary of £10,000, and in addition £8,000 or £9,000 as allowances, bogebher wibh bhe £5,000 sanctioned bhis evening; and yeb bhere is not a solitary-word of protest from honourable members opposibe. I am sorry there is not public spirit enough in the representatives of Victoria to do justice to the country, even if they do violence bo the Ministry. MrO ' MALLEY The honourable members for Corio and Northern Melbourne voted with us. but I suppose that in every barrel load of apples these must be one or two sound. But out of the 23 or 24 representatives, only eight, excluding Ministers, bhink it their duty to attend, while members of far-distant States are here in much larger proportion. I venture to say that if attention were called to the state of the House there would not appear more representatives than we. see out of bhe 25 members of Vicboria, oubside bhe Ministry; and thab is an eternal disgrace to bhe members for bhe State in which Parliament is meeting. We are entibled, before bhe motion is withdrawn, bo a clear and concise statement on bhe parb of bhe Government as bo whab is proposed for bhe future; and in making that statement bhere should be no hesitation on the parb of the Governmenb.

Prom neither the Minister for Home Affairs, nor the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, do we hear any indication as to the future policy; and the Government will find it exceedingly hard work to convince the country that ""they have done right in this matter. Whenever the Government speak in the future of retrenchment I shall not hesitate to remind them that they neither started it for themselves nor sought to enforce it on others, excepting port an undertaking made with a third in the case of persons whose social position did not stand in the way of their being retrenched out of existence. The Government have now the appalling effrontery to ask the Blouse to vote another £5,000 ; and the request is granted, because the delegations from other States, who have been kept here for thirteen months, have found it necessary to go and look after their own neglected businesses. I cannot see that the Government have been wisely advised, or that, everything, in connection with this matter has transpired; what has transpired calls for the severest and most wholesale condemnation. I shall be very much inclined to support the motion of the honourable member for Werriwa, unless the Government give us an outline of what they propose to do with the next Governor General. We do not want every detail, but we do want' a clear, general statement, so that the next Governor General may have in black and white the exact terms on which he is engaged, and what allowances are to be made.. correct one or two trifling inaccuracies of the honourable member for West Sydney. The first is, that the whole of the members for Victoria voted with the Government. As a matter of fact, two Victorian representatives voted the other way. Instead of only eight members for this State being present, there were ten members for Victoria present and two Ministers, making a total of twelve, while, at the same time, there were present only fourteen representatives of New South Wales. The honourable member for West Sydney was also wrong in his opinion that if the bells were rung no more representatives of Victoria than are now in the Chamber would be found in their places. Mi-. THOMSON (North Sydney) I admit with those who have opposed the Government, and with some of those who have supported them, that the situation which has been created is. a difficult one. Some of those who voted with the Government did not mean thereby to indicate that in their opinion the Government have not done wrong. They stated with their voices that they considered the action of the Government in this matter a series of mistakes from beginning to end ; but they felt that they should not add another wrong to that done by the Government by refusing to supparty, however undesirable that undertaking may be. It has been said that if the proposed allowance had been for some one in a lower position than that of the Governor General it would not have received so much support, but I should like to remind honourable gentlemen that the same consideration has been extended by them from time to time towards, allowances to other public servants. The House objected, on principle, to the allowances, and the Government were constrained to discontinue them; but it was felt that in regard to certain allowances which the Government had promised, the undertaking entered into should be carried out. I have acted in regard to the Governor General's allowances as I should have acted if my votes had been given in regard to the humblest servant of the Commonwealth. It is quite natural, however, that honourable gentlemen should seek to mark in some definite way their disapproval of the actions of the Government. But, while the motion of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is intended to do that, I think it would be a mistake to push it to a division, because, if that were done we should get, not a clear-cut vote upon the question really at issue, but a vote upon the question of the desirability of allowing a private member to take the business out of the hands of the Government. I trust, therefore, that the honourable and learned member will withdraw his motion. able member for North Sydney has very correctly expressed the intention of my motion.

If the vote proposed amounted to £ 1 only I should oppose it, because it will be impossible to equitably distribute the money over the whole of the religious denominations represented amongst us, whilst every taxpayer in the Commonweal fch, irrespective of his religious belief, will, have to contribute. MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) I understand that this money is to be spent in connection with the service to be given in the Exhibition Building? MrM c DONALD nominations are not asking for any assistance? If the Protestant bodies wish to make a show, let them use their own buildings, or hire the Exhibition-building at their own expense. As the money is to be given to a certain section of the community, I move That the item ""Expenses of Coronation services, .£300,"" be omitted. posed to the proposal on principle. Ihavean objection to State aid to religion in any form, and I thought that that principle was so. firmly established in all the States that there was no probability of it ever arising again. The fact that the K in g is to be crowned on the 26 th June affords no reason for any departure from the principle which has been embodied in our Constitution and in the statute-books of all the States. There are a number of religious denominations in the Commonwealth which would not participate in this grant, and it would also be unfair to restrict the State aid to the denominations in any one capital city. In any case, however, I should object to the grant. to ask the Treasurer if he thinks it wise to persist in the retention of this item ? It would be very invidious to make the proposed contribution. In the first place similar church services will be held throughout -Australia. I do not object to the Government proposal on the ground that one particular city in the Commonwealth is selected for this expenditure, but I ask by what authority does the religious body, or collection of bodies, which is to hold the pioposed service in the Exhibition-building represent the churches of Australia. If it does not represent those churches why should it be particularly selected? Then again there are people who entertain certain religious beliefs, who will not engage in the service in the Exhibitionbuilding. Are we going to contribute to a particular service and to entirely ignore many other religious bodies ? That is a dangerous precedent to establish, and as I believe that the churches are quite able and willing to provide their own services I must oppose this item. same position now that I adopted upon a previous occasion when this item was before the committee. I then held that the The n the other deState as a corporate body represents no religion, knows no religion, and has no religion. The honourable member for North Sydney said that as the various bodies which intend to conduct the proposed service in the Exhibition building do not represent the whole of the churches in Australia he could not support the item. But even if they did represent all the churches, I hold that that fact has nothing whatever to do with the matter. As long as there is one citizen outside of the churches which will engage in this service who could notconscientiously take part in it, he is entitled to have hisreligious scruples respected. Once upon a time England was a Christian and a Protestant State. Then Roman Catholics were given the franchise, and England was no longer a Protestant State, although it still remained a Christian State. In the Commonwealth we admit to citizenship those who are non-Christians. Every citizen has a right to have his religious views, respected. He has absolutely the same rights that are enjoyed by every other person within the State. That is the principle which was fought for when we secured the abolition of State aid to religion. I have taken the trouble to work out a few figures in this connection, and I find that 85 per cent, of the population formerly received State aid to their religions. But although that was abolished for the sake of the minority in the present case, at least one-third of the community, totalling 1,242,860 persons, cannot, for conscientious reasons, be present at the proposed service at the Exhibition building. These constitute a very important minority. I have been privileged to see a copy of the programme to be followed upon the occasion in question. Speaking from memory, that programme contains a statement that some .clergyman will declare "" We proclaim to you this day Edward VII .",43,Honorable members H E A R Hear

I support the striking out of 'this item. To my mind it is very clear that the various churches throughout the Commonwealth will fittingly celebrate the occasion of the Coronation without.any assistance from the State. Thevotingof thismoneywillonlycreate an invidious distinction between the churches located in the capital of A ictoria which re7 ceive aid for this service and those churches thioughout the Commonwealth which will conduct services upon their own initiative and without any assistance whatever. It is an unfortunate thing that the Government should offer this green and yellow sop to theology. They have practically divided the community into two sections, Protestants and Catholic, forgetful of the fact that there are many other denominations amongst us-notabl y the Jews-wh o are probably the most loyal people to be found in our midst. One can scarcely enter a church in which he will not hear prayers offered on behalf of the reigning monarch. We can well leave the churches to celebrate the Coronation in their own way without incurring the dangers inherent in any proposal to subsidize religious services. . -Section 116 of the Constitution Act providesThe Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion ; and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust tinder the Commonwealth. In the light of this provision, I have very grave doubts whether this item ought to appear upon the Estimates. I believe that a big constitutional question is involved ; and I ask the ruling of the Chairman upon the point which I have raised. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -Strictly speaking, I do not think this vote can be said to be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, although it may be in opposition to the spirit of that Act. This is merely a vote of money for a special purpose. It does not propose to permanently appropriate that money, or to impose any system of religion upon the Commonwealth, but merely to defray the expenses in connection with a certain religious ceremony. .But whilst I do not agree that the item is unconstitutionally upon the Estimates, I .intend to vote against .it.. I shall do so because, by granting this money, we should be establishing a very bad precedent. I fear, also, that we should create a religious sore in this community, inasmuch as the vote amounts.to a discriminating one. It is a vote which is to be applied to a religious ceremony for a group of i-eligious bodies, to the exclusion of other religious bodies. If it were a vote in which the whole of the religious bodies in the Commonwealth-Je w and Gentile, Catholic and Protestantshared alike, one could not object to it as discriminating; but, as it stands, it is openly intended for the Protestant denominations, and as a Protestant I object to any such discriminating vote. ' I trust that there will be no division upon the item, and that the Ministry will see the wisdom of withdrawing it and thereby avoiding unnecessary discussion and unpleasantness. in which the arguments of those opposed to this item have been presented must be a strong inducement to the Government to withdraw it. The Ministerial proposal undoubtedly introduces the thin end of the wedge of State aid to religion. Every one recognises that the various religious bodies I rise to a point of order. will fittingly carry out their functions upon Coronation Day at their own expense. The proposed service is not a ceremonial provided by the Commonwealth, and therefore I trust that the Government will adopt the suggestion which has been thrown out and remove it from the Estimates. Sir LANGDONBONYTHON (South Australia) -I , too, must join in the request to the Government to withdraw this item. I object to it for two reasons. In the first place I altogether disapprove of the principle involved, and in the second I see no reason why special provision should be made in the case of Melbourne. Similar services will be held in Adelaide, and no doubt in other cities, and the churches in Adelaide are certainly making no application to have the expense of those services defrayed by the Commonwealth. point of order raised by the honourable",44,Honorable members H E A R Hear

W h e n a point of Debate resumed from 27th May (vide page That the Bill be now read a second time. honourable member for Wentworth was to have nssumed the debate, and it was my intention to leave him to state the objections to the measure. However, in his absence, and at very short notice, The honourable member is I shall say as briefly as I can why I intend to oppose the second reading. To some extent, of course, this measure was H o w is it, then, discussed when dealing with Division VIA . of the Tariff. I shall not weary the House by re-entering on the arguments which were then so freely used against the duties which are to follow this bonus proposal. Many free-traders have been claimed as supporters of the bonus system, and some, no doubt, rightly, in that they admit that if encouragement is to be given to manufacturers it can, from their stand-point, be more effectively and more freely given by means of a bonus than by means of protective duties. They admit that it is an advantage that the whole community that pay the bonus should share in the cost of that political engine, rather than that the whole cost should fall on that portion of the community who have to pay higher prices under protective duties. They also admit that whilst protection, even according to its own advocates, does for a time, and occasionally for a very considerable time, raise the prices of commodities, there is no such necessity under the bonus system. In fact, the competition obtained under the latter system is against the raising of prices which takes place under protective duties. But even those who to that extent favour bonuses-and I am not one-mus t admit that in the present instance the bonus is only the beginning of a protective system. It is proposed that, when these bonuses have done their work, if thej do it, they 7 I understand that shall be followed by a protective duty.

Under the circumstances, even those who believe in bonuses not necessarily followed by protective duties, may find reasonably strong objection to the proposal of the Government; and now is the time to decide whether we shalj have this bonus system, with its corollary of protection. The Minister has delayed this B ill to the present date, and I .am rather surprised he has not delayed it a little longer, until he saw whether there was likely to beany necessity for it. It is quite possible that DivisionS I..\ of the Tariff may 7 not eventually receive the force of law, and as we shall know within a reasonable period whether that division will be passed, it would have been better to leave this Bill, which is valueless in the eyes of the Minister, without its addendum, until that addendum ""had been finally dealt with. The question arises whether this bonus proposal and following duty are really likely to thoroughly establish in our midst the iron industry. I venture to think that under the B ill no portion of that industry will be established which, in the larger markets of Australia, would not have come into existence without the proposed encouragement. We have to remember that at best we cannot anticipate for many decades an export trade in iron. The United States, for instance, with a magnificent population, was never able to enter on the export trade until it had reached a"" development we cannot possibly reach for a great number of years. Canada, it is true, adopted the bonus system, and the Minister has chosen to argue that the very moderate success of the iron industry there is entirely due to that system and protective duties. quote the figures for 1901, but the success in that year was marvellous. the Minister that in dealing with Canada lie did not take into account the production beyond the Dominion. land. land is part of Canada certainly, but it is beyond the Dominion. I shall now show the difference between the Minister's proposal and the system in Canada. The Bill before us excludes importations from beyond the Commonwealth, and discourages that blending of ores which, all the world over, has been found so necessary to successful manufacture. Canada, on the other hand, encourages blending by the admission of Newfoundland oies. In this the 'Minister has not followed the example of Canada, and where he has departed from that example he has done so in a way likely to be injurious to the manufacture. The United States admit from Cuba the ores necessary to the production of the finest steel. England imports from Spain, not that England has not sufficient ore of her own, but because by means of the Spanish ore, there can be acquired the qualities necessary to a successful industry. ore in England. royalty, the ore from Spain is landed at a higher cost than that at which England can produce her own ore. But as the honorm able member no doubt knows, perhaps better than I do, these foreign ores are needed for blending with the native ores in order to produce the finest quality of iron and steel. The Minister says that Tasmania is our Cuba. I hope that may prove to be true, because there is no success in that direction we do not all wish Tasmania. and quantities of the ores, and their accessibility. that Tasmanian ores will do for Australia what the Cuban and Spanish ores do for America and England; but that has to be proved. From experience in iron smelting in New South Wales, I know that whilst we may imagine all that did not previously the Minister forecasts, the truth can never be proved except by practical work. Iron-smelters from Great Britain, who have M a y I point out to had the largest experience, have come to New South Wales, and have not been successful in dealing with ores there, which on examination beforehand, they and other exI did as to Newfoundperts thought would readily and cheaply produce magnificent iron.

If we agree to the Bill, we shall commit ourselves to the bonus system, and to all the dangers connected with that system, notwithstanding the exposures which we have had in Australia in the past. Furthermore, while the Customs duties which are to be imposed may at the beginning be low, from a protectionist stand-point, they will be raised from time to time if it is found, or if it is thoughtbhe difficulties which stand in bhe way. which is not the same thing-that they are insufficient for the maintenance of the industry. In taking that course we shall be shutting off the markets of supply from a number of other industries, of which the iron industry is the basis, and we shall incur great risk of injuring a number of producing interests which are as worthy of encouragement as is the iron industry. We do not know all the difficulties in the way, and, therefore, we may, after all, fail to accomplish that which we desire-namely, the establishment of the industry on such a footing that it can hold its own upon competitive lines with the rest of the world. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -A t the present stage, I can venture to give this B ill only a qualified support. I desire to take the very earliest opportunity of conveying my appreciation of the very able manner in which the Minister for Trade and Customs presented his case to the House. ings, and the materials at his disposal, he presented the matter very forcibly, and one could hardly help being influenced very largely by the sympathy which he displayed. I speak from a sympathetic point of view with regard to the bonus and bounty system. I believe that the State can, under proper and favorable circumstances, largely assist in developing its natural resources by means of bonuses and bounties, and there is no industry within the whole range of the possible development of this continent more entitled to favorable consideration at our hands than is the iron industry. Isolated as we are, and so far removed from the great iron resources from which the world is at present supplied, we cannot look forward to the future growth and development of the iron trade of the world without very great anxiety. I believe it may be very fairly said that the nabions that can control the iron trade will shape the industrial destinies of the world. Therefore, whatever difficulties .may at present surround us, we shall have, sooner or later, to deal with this problem in a thoroughly systematic and effectual way. I am not prepared to say that we can do so at the presenb momenb, in view of certain difficulties which I shall proceed to point oub. I bhank bhe Minister for the careful consideration which he has given to this matter, and for the determination he has evinced to follow ib up to bhe besb of his abiliby, and, ""if possible, overcome all The firsb question bhat we are called upon to consider is the nature of bhe inducemenbs which can legally and constitutionally be held out to any companies to engage in the development of the iron industry.

The first is a 15 per cenb. duby upon all the materials which are within the scope of this bounty; the second is a guarantee of a bonus or bounby on the same lines, and to the same extent as thab given in Canada, and the third and most difficulb of all is a guaranbee bhab bhe company shall have a monopoly of bhe supply of iron and rails required by the States Governments in connection with the railways.

Sir JOHN QUICK . ^ -1 admit that the matter is open to argument, but the point will have to be faced sooner or later. Sir JOHN QUICK ought to be settled before the details of. this great scheme are determined. No company would dare to venture upon an enterprise of enormous magnitude, involving, perhaps, millions of money, unless they were clear as to their rights so far as importations are concerned. We may be able to pass a B ill upon the Canadian lines, providing for a 15 per cent, duty, but if the companies engaged in the iron industry cannot obtain protection against importations by the States Governments, all the bonuses in the world will be of no use to them. The States Governments will not give up their rights to the free importation of railway material. Judging from conversations which I have had with responsible politicians in Victoria, I do not believe that that State would give up its right to import railway materials free of duty. They would object to give the proposed company, not merely a huge bonus, but also the benefit of a tax upon the imported railway materials of the States. These are difficulties which will have to be considered in connection with this B ill . objection will be raised by the people of Victoria. The Government have given preferences in regard to locomotives. because they can be made in Victoria. raise an objection in this case because the rails might be made in another State? Sir JOHN QUICK that the people of Victoria would agree to any company of the character proposed being granted more favorable concessions than those conceded to Victorian companies of a similar character. This leads me to consider whether we could guarantee to any company the same terms as are offered in Canada, or whether we could guarantee It provides that any company bonuses or bounties on the Canadian terms. It is a serious question whether any company, or any number of companies, should have a gift made to them of £250,000 or £500,000, as is here suggested, unless the money is placed. at their The honourable and learned disposal subject to a trust.

An Act was passed in 1S96, entitled An Act to Encourage the Establishment of the Beet Sugar Industry in Victoria. This Act is well drawn, and is surrounded by safe: guards and conditions of the most salutary and valuable character which may well be taken into consideration by us. MrA . McLEAN No bonus was given to the Maffra Company. Sir JOHN QUICK No ; it was practically an advance made by the Government of Victoria on the security of the assets of the company, and subject to the conditions laid down in section 17 of the Act, which providedThe amount advanced to any company shall be repaid by such company to the Treasurer by I do not think any means of half-yearly repayments, commencing at the end of two years after the date of the payment of the firsb instalment of the advance.

Why should any subsidized company declare dividends out of public money? We can make advances to give them a helping hand in the same way as advances weie made to the Maffra Beeb Sugar Company. The Government of Victoria were practically a partner iu that company. Why should not the Federal Government in the same sense become a partner in the iron industry ? If we are to make advances of this kind they should not be made in such a way that they can be distributed at any time amongst the shareholders iu the shape of dividends. Even in Victoria the Beet Sugar Company is not an isolated case of a qualified advance being made by way of loan, because the same principle is observed in the Mining Development Act. ThatA c t ' provides that the Minister, subject to certain regulations and conditions, shall be allowed to make advances by way of loan, for the purpose of pioneer mining, procuring machinery, working plant, Arc. It contains a somewhat similar provision to that embodied in the Beet Sugar Act.

One of those dangers was recognised in New South Wales in connection with this very industry.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE ber is quite wrong : I had to deal with this question in . New South AA ales, and the 7 company agreed to the terms presented. when the Reid administration was in power. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo is not satisfied with this B ill because it is not safeguarded with certain conditions. The people of Australia are to be taxed for the purpose of providing this bonus, and it is the duty of the Government to surround the measure with proper safeguards. Sir AVfLLiAM LYNE The Blyth River Company agreed to the labour conditions. years, under the bonus system, the production of iron increased from 29,000 tons to only 34,000 tons ; while, during the same period, there were imported 65,000 tons. Canadian ore increased as the honourable member has stated ;. but the iron made from imported ore increased by 67,000 tons. The whole increase was from about 30,000 tons to about 100,000 tons. is not such as to warrant Australia entering upon a system of coddling this industry. From the schedule I see that the amount required over a certain number of j'ears is £324,000 ; and to provide that sum the I call the attention people of Australia, under the financial arrangements of the Commonwealth, have to be taxed to the extentof a b o u t £ l , 250,000.

If the Government desire to assist the industry, let them, by all means, nationalize it. If the claim for bonuses be granted in this connection, an equally legitimate claim could be made on behalf of ship-building or deep sea fisheries; with the object not only of supplying the home market, but of exporting. begin the system no one can say where it will end. As a free-trader, it has often been my lot to oppose the protective system, for thereason that while the few receive pay. is merely the modern idea of protection-it is the ""gilded pill."" character is undoubtedly an innovation in most of the States of Australia, and it was not foreshadowed in any way in the Governor General's speech, nor on the public platform by any member of the Government. In the first session, such a measure ought not to have been introduced, though I can understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs is attached to it, and is desirous of establishing the industry. traders would welcome the industry, but do not desire to see it established by means of oppressive bonuses. All the artisans of the Commonwealth ought to receive equal consideration, and there has been no hint of extending this system to other industries. We cannot forget the discussion which took place on this subject when the Tariff was before us, and I am pleased that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, who is an ardent protectionist, sees that the bonus system is not so free from blemishes as the Minister would have us believe. The results of the system as applied to the butter industry in Victoria have not been all that could be desired. The intention was that the money should go to the dairy farmers, but, as a matter of fact, it got into the hands of the speculators. the sum of £1,500 went directly into the hands of a middleman in Great Britain. The people of Victoria discovered that the bonus system was not free from blemishes, and their experience of it will be repeated by the people of the Commonwealth. in New South Wales the Lyne Government, following the Reid Ministry, considered the Mr Wilte. expediency of giving a bonus for the establishment of iron works, the See Ministry, knowing the feeling of the public on the subject, have not repeated the advances that they made to investors. They have, however, seriously considered the advisability of establishing a State industry. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No , they have not. and negotiations were biking place with a When onee we view to procuring a site on the Parramatta River. A free-trader might as well vote for protective duties asfor the bonus system, though, of course, under the bonus system it is possible to ascertain what the benefit, the many have to the public are called upon to pay. The GoThe bonus system now proposed vernment ask us to provide for the granting of £324,000 in bonuses, but whether A Bill of this the granting of this amount does or does not achieve the object in view, we shall hereafter be askedto increase the amount. If the iron industry is not successfully established, we shall be asked to vote more to prevent the loss of the money already expended, and the money voted wil l go to enrich manufacturers, while the expenditure will not benefit the Commonwealth. Freeable member will recognise that the advisability of attempting to establish the .iron industry in Australia upon a permanent basis is a very important question. We are assured by experts who have examined the deposits that there is iron ore in abundance in the Commonwealth. We know, too, that coal occurs in various places, and that the iron consumption of Australia is sufficiently large to justify an investigation in regard to the possibility of establishing iron works here. Our experience hitherto goes to show that we cannob establish iron works here unless the manufacturers are given some encouragement. AAe know bhab 7 iron is manufactured in America under very favorable conditions, and under conditions which, perhaps, prevent competition by Australia. Those of us who have inquired In one case into the conditions bhere, believe bhat, had it not been for the action of bhe American Governmenb, the iron indusbry of bhe United States would not have attained its present enormous proportions.

188,Mr Avatson (Bland),"Every honorhis millions. have to the competitive system is that it enriches a few at the expense of the many. Although the many reap some slight advantage from the expenditure of money in the process of production, they are not benefited in the same ratio as are those who are at the head of the operations. the people employed get more than in the iron industry. part of the total expenditure in the iron industry goes towards paying labour than is the case in other manufacturing industries. But while I am prepared to do something towards the encouragement of the establishment of the iron industry here, I do not think that the means proposed by the Government are the best that can be adopted. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has, I think, very properly and carefully put the arguments against the probable success of the system proposed by the Government. The Blyth River Company are supposed to hold the richest deposits of iron ore within the Commonwealth. Sir WILLIAM LYNE posits in regard to bulk, too. these rich deposits in Tasmania, and have at their command about £1,000,000 of capital, they insist upon conditions which can hardly be granted by the Commonwealth. In the first place, they ask for a minimum duty of 15 per cent, upon pig and raw iron, and they want a guarantee that duty shall be collected upon all State importations. done what it can towards making State importations pay duty, by removing such importations from the free list; but, speaking as a layman, it seems to be doubtful whether we can, under the Constitution, levy duties upon State importations. The company, however, very properly point out that the State Governments are the largest consumers of iron, in the Commonwealth. They use an immense quantity in the construction of railways, bridges, and other public works, and if they can import it free of duty-and under the bookkeeping system, even if they had to pay duty, they would during the first five years obtain an adjustment in regard to it 38 i It has also given Carnegie -it seems improbable that any of their constructing departments will order its materials from a local manufacturer or contractor. Not only are the State Governments the largest consumers of iron work, but the steel rails which form the bulk of their consumption do not require a great variety of patterns for moulding, and can be made in large quantities without a proportionate extra cost. But in no industry do The company further point out that in the United States of America and in Canada, the railways are private concerns, and the I believe that a larger material which they use has, therefore, if imported, to pay duty, or, if the local iron is used, an increased price nearly equivalent to the duty. Now, I believe, however, the inside and outside prices in both countries are about the same. Under these circumstances I am very doubtful if any set of men who thoroughly understand the conditions will invest their money in the establishment of iion works, and I believe that the only safe and efficient way of establishing such works will be for the Commonwealth or one of the StateG o vernments to undertake the. enterprise,, after due investigation, and the discovery of a practical scheme. Most proposals for the extension of Government functions meet And the best dewith the opposition of vested interests, and in many cases the difficulties are almost insuperable, but in the case of iron works, there arc practically no vested interests, because in Australia we have no establishments worthy of the name devoted to the production of iron : at any rate we have none which produce pig-iron. If one of the State Governments established iron works it would have an incentive to use the iron in its own undertakings, whereas if the This Parliament has Commonwealth were to undertake the enterprise, it would be likely to receive orders from the State Governments, because the people of the States are also citizens of the Commonwealth, and would thus be partners in the concern. The proposal which I have to make does not bind either myself or any other member of the House to anything until there has"" been a f u l l inquiry into a l l the facts, which will enable us to form a correct opinion upon the subject. ber considered the possible constitutional difficulty 1 there is anything in the Constitution to debar us from embarking on any such enterprise,",53,Second Reading

195,Mr Watson,"I do not think thatbut supposing we were debarred it would be practicable for one of the States to undertake the work, and it would be permissible for us to encourage them by some system of bonuses anything in the B ill that would prevent a State Government from exercising its undoubted power to receive a bonus. to go a little further than that. The Treasurer tells us that the revenue funds are practically exhausted, and that he is therefore under the necessity of borrowing money, and yet the Minister for Trade and -Customs proposes to hand over £300,000 to the various syndicates who may be prepared to enter upon the development of the iron industry. If, on investigation, it is found that the production of iron can be undertaken at only a small increase on the landed cost of imported iron, it would be wise for the Commonwealth to embark upon the enterprise. I have no sympathy with those people who believe in the establishment of Government works of this sort, with the idea that politicians should "" run the show,"" because I can only consent to the establishment of such enterprise, on condition that they are freed absolutely from political control by being handed over to Commissioners. Therefore I do not wish it to be said that I am seeking to increase the number of works over which politicians should exercise control, and in which they should have opportunities of finding billets for their friends, even when legitimate vacancies do not exist. In view of the large sum involved, I regard this question as too big to be hurriedly dealt with. The interests at stake are too enormous to be disposed of, in a mere haphazard manner, on partial experience of what has occurred in the United States. I therefore desire primarily that the matter should be investigated by a body of men selected from this House, with a view to obtaining evidence as to the practicability of establishing iron works. I would also have' them consider the advisability of the Commonwealth undertaking the work, and the question whether the Commonwealth has the power to undertake the work if it should be found advisable. Further, I would ascertain the views of the States, and the extent .to' which they would be prepared to support us in the event of our taking action : also what they would be prepared to do themselves in the event of the Commonwealth not embarking upon the enterprise. W it h regard to the general principle, I may point out that in South Australia, during the premiership of the MinisterI do not think there is for Trade and Customs, Government works were established for the manufacture of iron pipes. The Minister, finding that the prices charged for iron pipes by some of the local manufacturers were too high, and failing to come to a satisfactory understanding with them, established Government works, and so far as I have learned they have proved very successful. The prices at which the pipes were supplied were satisfactory to the Government, and the pipes were of as good quality as those formerly made by private contractors. That has been the experience of every corporation in the world. They have all found it economical to have their work carried out by their own managers. It does not always pay big railway companies to enter upon the manufacture of steel rails, because the quantity they use is small in comparison with the amount turned out at the large ironworks which are devoted solely to the manufacture of that particular class of goods. But, speaking generally, large corporations find it of advantage to do nearly every kind of work that is of sufficient importance to justify the establishment of large departments. Considering the enormous consumption of iron by the States, it would be well worth their while to pay an expert to superintend the manufacture of any iron that they require. Whatever profits might be derived from carrying on such operations would flow into the national exchequer, and any loss that might be incurred would not exceed the amount now proposed to be granted to a private company. The Blyth River Company say that they will require a capital of about £1,000,000 to establish works with an output of 150,000 tons iDer annum. The consumption of steel, rails in the Commonwealth, according to the circular issued by the Blyth River Company, is just about 100,000 tons per annum, and in addition to this the various Governments would require thousands of tons of girders for bridge-work and ship' building plates, and so on, which would probably represent another 50,000 tons. Therefore the consumption from the outset would represent the total capacity of the proposed Blyth River Company's works.",54,Second Reading

Everything points to the fact that if capita] were invested in this enterprise the industry would be successfully established.

If that mountain can be made to produce material which will enable our railways to be extended by hundreds of miles, it will be of enormous advantage to the community -as a whole. We are all interested in giving reasonable encouragement to our natural industries, and there is no product which can give such an impetus to wealth as can iron. regarded as having made England the great commercial centre she is to-day, and with the magnificent deposits of coal in New South Wales, and the enormous deposits of high class iron ore in Tasmania, we shall have the wealthiest State and the smallest State joining hands as great wealth producing agencies in the Commonwealth. I hope that the measure will not be postponed. It is suggested that the industry should be taken up by the States : but we live in a practical age, and we know perfectly well that none of the States would venture on such an undertaking. All such industries must be developed by private capital and enterprise, and we have to face that self-evident fact. According to some honourable members, the B ill ought to be referred to a select committee, but such a course would elicit precisely the same kind of information as that which is available at present, and would simply shelve the question. The first and only question is whether or not the industry is worthy of encouragement by the Commonwealth ; and if we have any reasonable belief that the deposits of coal and the enormous mountain of high-class ore in Tasmania can be profitably worked mountains of ore in Queensland. does not matter whether the mountains of ore are in Queensland or Tasmania, so long as this highly desirable industry is established within the Commonwealth. AlthoughI am only a recently elected member in this Chamber, none will give more generous or fuller support to undertakings of this description. I hope we shall grapple with the question as it is presented to us, and support the measure if we believe it will prove a source of wealth in the future. There are provisions in the B ill .which in We may bring into committee I may not be able to fully support. I should have liked to see the Minister for Trade and Customs propose some encouragement to the production of oil from the shale deposits in Tasmania. The honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, has suggested that in this direction assistance might be rendered to the amount of £ 3 , 0 0 0 ; and that is just about the sum which the company interested would have to pay as duty on the necessary machinery. If the Minister The iron and coal industries are could see his way to afford some small encouragement of the kind he would receive the thanks of the smaller States of the Commonwealth. I have much pleasure in supporting this Bill, and I hope the amendment of the honourable member for Bland will not be regarded as worthy of support. Debate (on motion by Mr G.

215,Mr Mauger,"If we are to.what can be done to save the married men rather than single men, the latter being better able to find employment elsewhere. Sir WILLIAMLTNE (Hume4-Minister for Home Affairs.)-The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has certainly submitted a very important matter for my consideration. It is a matter with which there is very great difficulty in dealing. In carrying out retrenchment it is almost impossible to please evory one; and I recognise that a rather difficult task has been left to. me to perform. The House has decided that £131,000 shall be taken off the military Estimates, in which, of course, are included the naval branch of the service in the various States. Certainly the recommendations that up to the present time have been modeto me savour very much of terminating the .connection with the service of those men whose time is jus&about expiring. They have been token on, I understand, for a certain period, and in nearly all cases where the time, of men is about expiring it is recommended that they .shall not be re-engaged. that the time is'expiring at this particular juncture. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am not prepared to say whether it is an accident, but certainly no claim can be mode in connection with those men whose time is expiring. If they are engaged for a certain time it cannot be said that they have a claim when that time expires. Otherwise, they might as well be engaged continuously. But T do agree that, if it is possible to retain'the services of married men, they should be retained, other things being equal, in preference to single men. I presume, however, that the single men are more active and better fitted to carry out work they are called upon to do. of the most capable men and officers are being discharged. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am doing the best I can to make f u l l inquiries, but I must confess that to inquire into every branch of a service with which I have hitherto had nothing to do is rather a gigantic task for a Minister to undertake. I must depend, to some extent, on the representations made to me by my officers and the heads of the different branches. I may lay down rules and principles, but in the carrying out of them. I must depend, to a large extent, upon the officers. But what I wish is, that the retrenchment should not all fall upon the lower ranks. The.officers will have to beat their fair share of retrenchment. As far as the recommendations have gone up to the present time, I think the officers do bear their fair share. I have taken the trouble to find out the percentage of reductions affecting officers and men respectively. I certainly do not want to find that a small' percentage of officers have been retrenched as compared with a large percentage of men. I mention that in order to give a little confidence to the men that they' will not be ruthlessly discharged, or retrenched, without some good reason being shown. The measure is receiving my very careful consideration, and the consideration of the members of the Government. I had hoped to get it settled before now ; but I do not think it possible to get the matter absolutely settled by the 30th of this month. Next year's Estimates will be framed in accordance with the reductions the House has desired to have made; but I confess that 'it will take two or three months tocomplete the arrangements to meet the demands of the service for next year. I menj tion this to honourable members now, because I wish it to be understood that I do not think it possible to have all retrenchments effected before the 30th June next. Some little time mast be given for changes to be made. The honourable member can quite understand that my sympathy is with the remarks he has made. I shall make further inquiry ; . but I cannot undertake to make a thorough inquiry into every branch of the service, arid in respect to every name which is submitted to me to deal with.
