202,Mr Mcclelland To Present A Bill For An Act In Place To Act As An Incentive To Those,"The following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws (Question No. 97) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports of barristers avoiding large tax debts by declaring themselves bankrupt. (2) Is the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) able to garnishee notices under S.128 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to payments made to barristers by their clients in order to repay tax debts; if so, has the ATO been issuing these notices; if not, why not. (1) and (2) Yes. The ATO uses garnishee notices at all stages of the legal recovery process and manages this on a case by case basis. The ATO has also prosecuted barristers for failure to provide information about third parties such as solicitors holding money on their behalf. Immigration: Refugees (Question No. 652) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) In each of the last three years, how many detainees who were found to be genuine refugees spent further time in detention awaiting a security clearance. (2) What is the (a) average, (b) longest and (c) shortest length of time a detainee has spent awaiting for such a clearance. (3) What steps are taken in relation to such security clearances and by whom are they taken. (4) Is the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) involved in the security clearance process; if so, is he able to say whether ASIO has received specific resources to enable it to undertake this task; if not, why not. (5) What, if any changes have been made to the security clearance process since 11 September 2001 which impact upon delays to detainee releases and to the resources devoted to the task. (1) None. In order for a person to be found to be a refugee a decision maker must be satisfied that they meet the inclusion elements of the definition of a refugee at Article 1A of the Refugees Convention and be satisfied also that the person is not excluded from refugee protection by other provisions of the Convention. The results of the security clearance process are required for this decision. An asylum seeker is released from detention as soon as all criteria have been met. (2) The figures below reflect time elapsed between the initiation of an ASIO assessment to the receipt of the ASIO clearance by the Department. They cover all detainees in the years indicated irrespective of whether or when they may have lodged a protection visa application. ASIO clearances are not required when an applicant is deemed not to be a refugee. As such, time elapsed in periods below excludes periods when clearance is not required.

203,Mr Costello,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,144,Questions On Notice
204,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Primary year Average days for ASIO Longest days for ASIO Shortest days for ASIO lodged clearance clearance clearance 2001-02 57.99 242 0 (3) (1) 57 persons cleared on the same day the check was initiated (2) 26 persons cleared on the same day the check was initiated. (3) 4 persons cleared on the same day the check was initiated. (3) Since 1999, my department has been constantly reviewing, streamlining and strengthening the protection visa process to ensure speedy and rigorous processing of protection visa applications made by unauthorised boat arrivals. In May 2000, the security checking work by ASIO was integrated into initial interviews on arrival of the individual in detention. This enabled an ASIO assessment to be initiated immediately, irrespective of whether or when an unauthorised boat arrival may apply for a protection visa. The Protection Program Management Section, Refugee and Humanitarian Division in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) constantly liaise with ASIO and monitor the outstanding ASIO assessment caseload. (4) Yes, ASIO assess and provide security assessments. ASIO were provided with additional funding to enable them to support the subsection dealing with unauthorised arrivals. DIMIA organise and pay for all ASIO travel for onshore and offshore taskforces. This also includes the arranging and payment of interpreters and overtime. (5) Since September 11 ASIO has been reassessing cases remitted to DIMIA by the RRT. Although these may have been previously cleared by ASIO they now require a reassessment on remittal. Community Landcare Associations (Question No. 915) Ms George asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 16 September 2002: (1) Does he support the competitive recruitment process proposed for Community Landcare Associations. (2) Have Coastcare, Bushcare and Waterwatch been granted funds to allow for staff job security until 30 June 2003 but not community Landcare associations; if so, (a) why and (b) will he rectify this inequity and extend grants to Landcare until 30 June 2003; if not, why not. (3) Is the three months time span for recruitment unreasonably short. (4) Is maintaining employment continuity of current staff vital to the completion of many current projects. (5) Is he aware that many projects under the current Natural Heritage Trust will continue to employ staff until 31 March 2003 in order to complete activities and reports even though funding only extends to their projects until 31 December 2002. (6) Can the competitive recruitment process lead to a loss of expertise and established working relationships. (1) The Commonwealth is funding landcare facilitator and coordinator positions across Australia until 30 June 2003. The selection and appointment of landcare facilitators and coordinators is up to those employing and managing the positions. Employment arrangements vary from region to region. The Commonwealth simply requires, as always, that the process be open and transparent, and comply with the law. (2) Refer to (1).",144,Questions On Notice
205,Mr Truss,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Not relevant. Refer to (1). (4) It is understood that in some regions the landcare facilitators and coordinators will be helping to complete late finishing projects. (5) Interim arrangements have been put in place to fund facilitator and coordinator positions to June 2003. One of the responsibilities of people in these positions is to assist Natural Heritage Trust projects. (6) Where organisations have a need to recruit new people to positions, they should aim to select the best available people for the job. Immigration: Visas (Question No. 1142) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: Further to his reply, dated 21 October 2002, to a letter from me concerning Mr Qadir Fedayee, will he detail any or all of the information received from his Department relating to the reasons for not granting a visa to Mr Fedayee, if not, why not. Privacy rules permit the disclosure of information held on individuals only in very limited circumstances. While the Privacy Act 1988 prevents me from disclosing details relating to this person, I can assure you that his case is being handled in accordance with the Migration Act and Regulations. As I indicated in the 21 October 2002 letter, the power to substitute a review tribunal decision with a more favourable decision is non-compellable and is exercised by me personally. I am under no obligation to exercise that power. A case may fall in the category of being within the public interest if it involves unique or exceptional circumstances. I will generally not reconsider a case unless additional information is provided that brings the case within the guidelines. Taxation: Tax Concessions for Farmers (Question No. 1323) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Are the main tax concessions for farmers to promote sustainable land use (a) accelerated depreciation for water management costs, with full depreciation over three years, (b) the Landcare deduction for conservation related capital works, with full deduction in the year that the expense was incurred and (c) the Landcare offset conservation related capital works rebate if not eligible for the Landcare deduction. (2) Is the cost of these concessions around $20m per annum; if not what is the cost of these concessions. (3) Has any assessment or monitoring of the environmental benefit of these concessions being carried out; if so, what has been its conclusion. (4) Has he considered any alternative funding arrangements or tax concessions to promote sustainable land use; if so, what alternative ideas has he considered. (5) Can he provide an estimate of the cost to revenue of taxing farmer’s income based on the proportion of their land which is cleared, for example, farmers whose land is 90% cleared pay tax on 90% of their income, and farmers whose land is 10% cleared pay tax on 10% of their income.",145,Questions On Notice
206,Mr Ruddock,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,146,Questions On Notice
207,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The main tax concessions for farmers to promote sustainable land use are: (a) a three-year write-off for the cost of facilities to conserve and convey water, such as dams (b) an immediate deduction for capital expenditure on landcare operations, such as preventing land degradation, and (c) the landcare and water facility tax offset. However, the offset was only available for eligible expenditure incurred between 1 July 1997 and 30 June 2001. The water facility offset was allowable in equal parts over three years and claims will still be made in the 2002 and 2003 financial years for eligible expenditure incurred prior to 30th June 2001. This offset was an alternative to the deductions which otherwise would have been allowable and provided low-income taxpayers with a greater tax benefit than the equivalent tax deduction. (2) Yes. (3) Not by the Australian Taxation Office. (4) The Government is making a significant contribution to promoting sustainable land use in addition to these tax concessions. Both the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality promote sustainable land use. Total Commonwealth investment in the Natural Heritage Trust is more than $2.5 billion. The Commonwealth has also provided $700 million towards the $1.4 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The 2002-03 Budget announced funding of up to $25 million to support eligible primary producers in adopting Environmental Management Systems. (5) An estimate of the cost of providing such a concession to farmers cannot be made by the ATO and work done by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) doesn’t collect the detailed information needed to answer this question. Nuclear Waste: Transportation (Question No. 1456) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 12 February 2003: (1) From which locations are the more than 30,000 packages of radioactive material routinely transported across Australia each year, and to where are they shipped. (2) What are the distances between starting locations and destinations over which they are transported. (3) How many packages are transported by (a) air, (b) rail, (c) sea and (d) road. (4) What is the number, and what the details, of any incidents and accidents involving vehicles carrying nuclear waste by (a) air, (b) rail, (c) sea and (d) road. (1) ANSTO Radiopharmaceuticals and Industrials (ARI) sends an average of 3,000 packages a month (approx 36,000 per year), although these figures do vary from month to month. More than 99% of ARI shipments are dispatched from Lucas Heights, NSW, with the balance being shipped from the National Medical Cyclotron next to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown, NSW. Shipments are sent to over 200 nuclear medicine centres in all states and territories (capitals and country areas) and to a number of industrial customers. ARI also ships to overseas customers, including customers in the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Burma, the United States and some European destinations. It should be noted that ARI is not the only entity in Australia that is involved in the routine transportation of radioactive materials. Other entities routinely transport a wide range of radioactive materials across Australia (for example, smoke detectors, industrial gauges and mineral ores). However, details of such shipments are not available, as they are a matter for the relevant State and Territory authorities.",146,Questions On Notice
208,Mr Mcgauran,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Delivery distances range from a few kilometres (for example Lucas Heights to Liverpool) to thousands of kilometres. Within Australia, packages are often sent to their destination by air, including to destinations as close to Sydney as Brisbane or Canberra. This is due to the short-lived nature of the particular radioisotope product being transported. For example, the product with the shortest half-life supplied by ARI is FDG (Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose), with a half-life of only 110 minutes. For these shortlived products, air transport is chosen due to the speed of delivery. For longer-lived products, transport by road becomes viable for Australian destinations. (3) All packages are transported (initially) by road, while approximately 70% would travel further by air by either freighter or passenger aircraft, including to some country NSW destinations, and then by road to the point of use. Given the short half-life of most ARI isotopes no sea or rail transport is used. (4) Within Australia, there has only been one incident involving a vehicle carrying radioactive waste since 1980. In December 1994, a small amount of liquid was found to have seeped from a drum containing very low level waste soil that was being transported by road from Lucas Heights to Woomera. Some 98% of the soil being transported had levels of radiation so low as to not require compliance with the Australian Code of Practice for Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances (1990). Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, it was being transported in accordance with the code. The spill was discovered near Port Augusta, South Australia during a routine load inspection. No radioactivity above background levels was found in the spilled material, and the spilled waste was contained on the tray of the truck. The incident posed no threat to the health and safety of workers or the public. Education, Science and Training: Program Funding (Question No. 1495) Ms Grierson asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: (1) Does the Minister’s Department administer any Commonwealth funded programs for which community organisations, businesses or individuals in the electoral division of Newcastle can apply for funding; if so, what are the programs.

Health: Electromagnetic Radiation (Question No. 1543) Mr Tanner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the UK’s Stewart Group Report on mobile phones. (2) Did the Stewart Group recommend that the widespread use of mobile phones by children for non-essential calls should be discouraged and that the mobile phone industry should refrain from promoting the use of mobile phones by children, and was the recommendation accepted by the UK Government; if so, (a) what is the Australian Government’s current position on mobile phone use by children and (b) will the Government take any action to minimise mobile phone use by children; if not, why not. (3) Did the Stewart Group recommend the establishment of clearly defined physical exclusion zones around mobile base stations to which the UK Government agreed; if so, do such zones exist under Australian regulations; if not, why not and will the Government introduce exclusion zones around current base stations. (4) Did the Stewart Group recommend a national database be set up by the Government giving details of all base stations and their emissions; if so, does such a publicly available database exist in Australia; if not, will the Government consider introducing one; if not, why not. (5) Did the Stewart Group recommend an independent random on-going audit of all base stations be carried out to ensure they are operating within exposure guidelines; if so, does such a process exist in Australia; if not, will the Government consider introducing such a process; if not, why not. (6) Did the Stewart Group pose certain recommendations in relation to mobile base stations in or near school grounds to which the UK Government agreed; if so, are there any specific regulations covering the installation of mobile base stations in or near school grounds in Australia; if not, why not. (7) Are there any specific regulations in Australia stating that mobile base stations should not be within a certain distance of household residences; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) The issues raised in this part of the question relate to the public health effects of mobile phone use and should be addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing, as the Minister responsible for the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). ARPANSA is the Federal Government agency charged with responsibility for protecting the health and safety of people and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation. I am advised by the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) that its role is to ensure that any emissions from radiocommunication equipment identified by qualified health authorities as being potentially harmful are properly controlled. (3) The Stewart Report recommended the establishment of exclusion zones to identify areas where recommended exposure limits are exceeded. The UK Government accepted the recommendation that that exclusion zones be established where necessary – in fact it stated that such zones should already exist. The ACA has advised that it does not require exclusion zones around base stations as a matter of course. However, in addition to incorporating the ARPANSA exposure limits into the new ACA EME regulations, including the Radiocommunications (Electromagnetic Radiation – Human Exposure) Standard 2003 applicable to radiocommunication devices, the ACA also applied the condition currently applies to GSM 900 base stations. The ACA intends to extend the application of the new licence condition to all other types of base stations, that is CDMA, GSM 1800 and 3G, by the end of 2003. The effect of applying the new condition is that licensees for each transmitter, associated with a base station, will be required by the ACA to ensure a member of the public is not exposed to a level of radiation above the limits recommended by ARPANSA. (4) The Stewart Report recommended that a national database be set up giving the following details of base stations: ‘name of the carrier, the grid reference, the height of the antenna above ground level, the date transmission started, the frequency range and signal characteristics of transmission, the transmitter power and the maximum power output under the Wireless Telegraphy Act. Moreover, this information should be readily accessible to the public, and held in such a form that it would be",148,Questions On Notice
210,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Artseasy to identify, for example, all base stations within a defined geographical area and all belonging to a specified operator.’ I am advised by the ACA that in Australia, the ACA maintains a Register of Radiocommunications Licences. The Register provides detailed information, primarily for interference management purposes, on every licence holder including individual licences held and certain technical data on transmitters. The licenses authorising the operation of base stations do not specify a power output limit, therefore the maximum power output of base stations is not recorded in the Register. However, to the extent that carriers comply with their obligation to supply the relevant data, all base stations and their antenna are listed in the Register. The Register is publicly accessible through the ACA website (at www.aca.gov.au), at ACA offices, and on CD-ROM available for purchase from the ACA. (5) The Stewart Report recommended that ‘an independent, random, ongoing audit of all base stations be carried out to ensure that exposure guidelines are not exceeded outside the marked exclusion zone and that the base stations comply with their agreed specifications.’ 1997-1999. In all cases radiation emission levels were thousands of times less than recommended exposure limits. electromagnetic energy (EME) emissions around sixty mobile phone base stations at numerous locations throughout Australia. The 2003 ARPANSA survey is not a requirement of either the The objectives of the 2003 survey are to: measure base station RF levels at specified distances from the antenna and compare levels with the ARPANSA RF exposure limits; compare actual RF levels with predicted levels; and measure environmental levels of RF within 500 metres of the nominated base station’s location. The sites will be selected to ensure that representative numbers of various types of base stations are surveyed. These types of sites will include: conventional free standing towers with and without co-located carriers; at least 10 of the sites used in the previous ARPANSA 1997–1999 survey; ‘low impact’ sites (antenna mounted on existing structures/buildings); and communications towers supporting a range of services. staff, nomination of sites will come from members of the Local Government Association of Australia and the Mobile Carriers Forum (McF). A measurement protocol based on the measurement of the control channel/pilot signal will be developed and will be similar to that used in the ARPANSA 1997–1999 survey. Further, the ACA has advised that, while it does not measure base station emissions as a matter of course, it may do so at base stations suspected of non-compliance with the EME regulations. Under the new ACA EME regulations, which came into effect on 1 March 2003, the ACA has advised that from 1 June 2003 it will require licensees of some radiocommunication transmitters to document their compliance with the new regulations. The ACA will be conducting an on-going random audit program of the relevant documentation to ensure licensees are complying with their obligations under the regulations. Under the Industry Code on Deployment of Radiocommunications Infrastructure, the public can request, at any time, that a carrier provide information on radiation levels around base stations. (6) The Stewart Report recommended that ‘in relation to macrocell base stations sited within school grounds, that the beam of greatest RF intensity should not fall on any part of the school grounds or buildings without agreement from the school and parents. Similar considerations should apply to macrocell base stations sited near to school grounds.’ The UK Government did not agree to this recommendation, instead stating that the exposure levels at schools should be ‘within [International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection] guidelines’. In Australia, licensees for each transmitter associated with a base station, irrespective of its location, will be required by the ACA to ensure that members of the public are not exposed to a level of radiation above the limits recommended by ARPANSA. This requirement applied to GSM 900 base station transmitters under the now superseded ACA EME regulations and it will apply to all base station transmitters from the end of 2003 under the new ACA EME regulations. The ACA has advised that it has not received any recommendations from ARPANSA in relation to the installation of base stations in or near school grounds. Accordingly, the ACA has not issued any guidelines on the matter. See also the answer to part 2 of the Question, above. The Industry Code on Deployment of Radiocomunications Infrastructure requires carriers to have regard to ‘community sensitive locations’ such as schools when locating base stations. See also the answer to part 3 of the Question, above. (7) The ACA has advised that it has not received any recommendations from ARPANSA in relation to the installation of base stations at a minimum distance from household residences. Accordingly, the ACA has not issued any guidelines on the matter. Some local councils have planning policies to this effect (for example Sutherland Shire), however these apply only to those facilities for which the Council has planning authority, not those installed with authorisation under Commonwealth law. The Industry Code on Deployment of Radiocommunications Infrastructure requires carriers to have regard to ‘community sensitive locations’ such as residential areas when locating base stations. See also the answer to part 3 of the Question, above. Irrespective of base station location, licensees for each transmitter associated with a base station will be required by the ACA to ensure a member of the public is not exposed to a level of radiation above the limits recommended by ARPANSA. Transport: Passenger Movement Charge (Question No. 1554) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) With respect to the additional $8 per passenger increase in the Passenger Movement Charge that came into effect on 1 July 2001 to fund increased passenger processing costs as part of Australia’s response to the threat of the introduction of foot and mouth disease, what is the total additional revenue raised by the charge in (a) 2001-2002 and (b) 2002-2003 to date.

(7) Does he agree with the determination of the Department of Transport and Regional Services and therefore the consequence that applications of the type lodged by the Shellharbour City Council are not eligible for funding under the Regional Solutions Program; if so, why; if not, why not. (8) Is he aware that a similar project to that proposed by the Shellharbour City Council was proposed by the Temora Shire Council, that that project was approved by the Department of Transport and Regional Services and that the Temora Shire Council received $550,000 for a significant upgrade of its airport. (9) Why has the Shellharbour City Council application for funding under the Regional Solutions Program been rejected and the Temora Shire Council application been accepted. (10) Is he aware that the Shellharbour City Council asked for a review of its application for Regional Solutions Program funding in a letter dated 20 November 2002 on the basis that the Department’s reason for its decision is inconsistent with its decision to approve the Temora Shire Council’s project. (11) Why has the Department not replied to the Shellharbour City Councils letter dated 20 November 2002 and what will he do to rectify the oversight. (12) Will he intervene on behalf of the Shellharbour City Council to demand a review of the decision to reject its application; if not, why not.

213,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) Electorate Approved Rejected Throsby0 6 Hume5 10 Macarthur 0 0 Cunningham 0 1 Gilmore9 8 (5) Yes, I am aware of the application from the Shellharbour City Council. (6) Yes. Responsibility for the maintenance and upgrade of aerodromes was handed back to many local government agencies from 1990 onwards, including Shellharbour City Council. At that time each local government was provided with funding to maintain these facilities. (7) The independent Regional Solutions Programme Advisory Committee (RSPAC), following its consideration of the Shellharbour City Council’s application, recommended to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government not to fund the project. The Minister accepted the recommendation of the Advisory Committee. (8) I am aware of the Temora Shire Council project. The RSPAC considered the application and recommended to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government that the project be funded. The Ministers accepted the recommendation of the Advisory Committee. (9) Applications under the Regional Solutions Programme (RSP) are considered on a case by case basis against programme guidelines and selection criteria. While on the surface projects may appear similar the specific outcomes sought at the local level can be markedly different. Both proposals were considered on their merits by the independent RSP Advisory Committee against the programme guidelines and selection criteria and a recommendation provided to Ministers. Ministers approved the recommendations of the Advisory Committee. (10) I am advised that the Department is unaware of the letter from the Shellharbour City Council requesting a review of the decision. (11) As above. (12) The Shellharbour City Council can request a review of the project by making a submission to the Department. They will be required to provide additional information addressing the concerns raised in the Department’s letter of 4 November 2002. Medicare: Bulk-billing (Question No. 1642) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 18 March 2003: (1) Did the Minister read an article written by Dr John Deeble, the chief planner for Medicare in the 1980s, titled “Not ailing, but in need of a check up” in The Sydney Morning Herald on 10 March 2003. (2) Which views expressed by Dr Deeble does the Minister accept and why. (3) Which views expressed by Dr Deeble does the Minister not accept and why. (4) What is the Government doing to ensure that all Australians have access to bulk-billing, irrespective of their place of abode. (5) Will the Government grant doctors a minimum increase of $5 in the bulk-billing fee; if so, when; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The Government supports the universal coverage of Medicare for all Australians through: access to free public hospital care; the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; and the Medicare Benefits Schedule rebate. (4) The Government has recently announced a $917m package, A Fairer Medicare, to strengthen Australia’s universal health care system, including by making general practice (GP) services more available and more affordable. A key element of this package is the provision of incentives for GPs to bulk bill pensioners and Commonwealth concession card holders. The level of incentives has been designed to make vast majority of GPs financially better off. Bulk billing rates have historically been lower in rural areas and therefore higher incentive payments will be provided in these areas to ensure that all Australians have the same access to affordable medical services. (5) A Fairer Medicare introduces a range of reforms that will benefit all Australians by providing more affordable access to GP services. Simply increasing the level of rebates to GPs would not achieve this. Over the last few years, the bulk billing rate of GP services (non referred attendances) has declined despite significant increases to the Medicare rebate and other funding to general practice. Employment and Workplace Relations: Program Funding (Question No. 1689) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, upon notice, on 19 March 2003: (1) Does the Minister’s Department administer any Commonwealth funded programs for which community organisations, businesses or individuals in the electoral division of Charlton can apply for funding; if so, what are the programs. (2) Does the Minister’s Department advertise these funding opportunities; if so, (a) what print or other media outlets have been used for the advertising of each of these programs, (b) were these paid advertisements, and if so, (c) what was the cost of each advertisement. (3) With respect to each of the Commonwealth funded programs referred to in part (1), (a) what is its purpose and (b) who is responsible for allocating funds. (4) With respect to each of the Commonwealth funded programs referred to in part (1), how many (a) community organisations, (b) businesses or (c) individuals in the electoral division of Charlton received funding in (i) 1999, (ii) 2000, (iii) 2001, and (iv) 2002. (5) What is the name and address of each recipient. (1) Yes, the department has provided funded programmes for which community organisations, businesses or individuals in the electoral division of Charlton can apply for funding. These programmes are: Indigenous Employment Programme-under the Indigenous Employment Policy Indigenous Small Business Fund-under the Indigenous Employment Policy General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett Group employees (SEESA)",168,Questions On Notice
214,Mr Andrews,The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to,170,Questions On Notice
215,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Work for the Dole Community organisations and businesses can tender to provide Job Network services. Contracts for Job Network have been let for two to three year periods, with the most recent tender being advertised in late 2002 for the next contract period which begins on 1 July 2003 and completes on 30 June 2006. (2) Indigenous Employment Policy (a) and (b) The Indigenous Employment Policy and specific elements under the Policy including Wage Assistance, the National Indigenous Cadetship Project and Indigenous Community Volunteers have primarily been advertised by my department in the print media. Paid advertising has been undertaken in major metropolitan and regional newspapers, industry bulletins such as Australian Transport News, Australian Cane Growers Monthly and Australian Mining and Indigenous newspapers and magazines including the National Indigenous Times, Koori Mail, Deadly Vibe, Black Business and Indivine. The Indigenous Employment Policy and programmes are also featured on the www.workplace.gov.au Internet site and brochures and other promotional material is also produced. (c) Advertising has been undertaken at various times since 1999 when the Indigenous Employment Policy was launched. Standard government rates are charged and the cost of individual advertisements vary depending on a range of factors including the size of the advertisement, how often it appears, the type of media product (eg newspaper, magazine, employer journal) and audience reach. Specific information on the cost of each advertisement is not readily available as it would require significant collation of material across programmes. (a) GEERS and SEESA funding has been advertised in the Australian Insolvency Journal and has been directly marketed to the Insolvency Practitioner Association of Australia (IPAA) members; (b) Yes and; (c) $440 and $3,678 respectively. Work for the Dole (a) (b) and (c) The department has contracted Community Work Coordinators (CWCs) to develop and manage Work for the Dole activities. CWCs employ a range of methods to encourage community and government organisations to sponsor Work for the Dole places. For the purpose of advertising specialised drought force activities under Work for the Dole, in response to the drought, the department placed advertisements in the regional press. The cost of advertising in the Newcastle Herald, which is distributed in parts of Charlton, during December 2002, January 2003 and February 2003 was $3,200. (3) Indigenous Employment Policy (a)The purpose of the Indigenous Employment Policy is to improve the employment circumstances and future prospects of Australian Indigenous peoples by generating sustainable employment opportunities. (b) The department’s national and state offices allocate funds under the Indigenous Employment Policy following assessment of applications and project proposals. (a) To provide assistance to employees who have lost their employment and accrued entitlements due to their employer becoming insolvent or bankrupt they may be eligible to receive payments equivalent to the following: all unpaid wages; accrued annual leave; accrued long service leave; accrued pay in lieu of notice; and up to eight weeks redundancy entitlements (as per community standard). (b) GEERS is funded through a Special Account established under the FMA Act within the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Funding is provided for SEESA through the Air Passenger Ticket Levy (Collection) Act 2001 which establishes a special appropriation within the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Work for the Dole (a) The objectives of the Work for the Dole programme are to develop the work habits of eligible job seekers, to involve local communities in activities that provide for the unemployed and help the unemployed at the end of the activities, and to provide communities with activities that are of value to those communities (b) CWCs recommend activities to the department for approval. (4) (a), (b) and (c) Refer to Tables A, B, C, D and E (attached) for details of community organisations, businesses or individuals that received funding in the electoral division of Charlton in 1999 to 2002. These tables must be read in conjunction with Attachment 1 as it includes important information relating to the derivation of the data. All figures for funding are provided for financial years and not for calendar years. In respect of Work for the Dole (See Table E) in 1999 there were five sponsors, in 2000 there were four CWCs and 12 sponsors, in 2001 there were five CWCs and 16 sponsors and in 2002 there were six CWCs and 18 sponsors who received funding to deliver the programme. (5) Indigenous Employment Policy Assistance provided to individuals and some businesses under the Indigenous Employment Policy cannot be supplied for confidentiality and privacy reasons. I announce project based funding approved for organisations on a periodic basis and this information is available by following the Indigenous links at the www.workplace.gov.au Internet site. Work for the Dole The names and addresses of CWCs in 2000, 2001 and 2002 are at TableE (the CWC model commenced in 2000). The names and addresses of community organisations that sponsored Work for the Dole activities in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 are also at Table E. Not-forprofit CWCs may also operate as sponsors of Work for the Dole activities. Note that this reply excludes organisations in the electoral division of Charlton which have been contracted to provide employment services by the Commonwealth (ie Job Network services, New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, Transition to Work services and, until 30 June 2002, Community Support Programme services). The following statements should be read in conjunction with the figures in this document. 1. Funding and expenditure are normally linked to administrative areas which are used for a number of purposes related to the operation of a program, for example, Labour Market Regional (LMR) or Employment Service Area (ESA) location. The borders associated with these administrative areas do not necessarily coincide with electorate boundaries. 2. Where additional information is held such as the location of a program, this has provided a basis to link expenditure to an electorate. The information provided in the attached spreadsheet is therefore an approximation based on information available. 3. Figures in the attached spreadsheet generally indicate monies allocated, not monies spent. However, it should be noted that all IEP programme figures reflect actual expenditure. 4. An asterisk (*) assigned to a programme indicates that allocated funding is GST inclusive. 5. Only those DEWR programmes administered in the examined electorate are detailed in this document. In addition, the following disclaimer statements should be read in conjunction with Tables A, B, C, D and E. Indigenous Employment Programme (IEP) Offered under the umbrella of the Indigenous Employment Policy, the Indigenous Employment Programmes were implemented progressively from 1 July 1999 and include: Structured Training and Employment Projects (which replaced the former Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programme), Wage Assistance, the Community Development Employment Project Placement Incentive, the Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment Project, the National Indigenous Cadetship Programme and Indigenous Community Volunteers (previously the ‘Voluntary Service to Indigenous Communities Foundation’). Services are also offered to Indigenous job seekers through the Indigenous Small Business Fund, Job Network services and Indigenous Employment Centres. Structured Training and Employment Project (STEP); Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment Project (CLIEP); and Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programme (TAP). The expenditure figures for these programmes relate to claims for payment by contracted organisations. The organisation in question may be the employer and/or trainer of the job seeker or may be an intermediary such as a Group Training Company, a Job Network Member or an alternative industry or community based organisation. Expenditure has been allocated to electorates on the basis of the postal address of the contracted organisation that received funding. In many cases this will be the address of a head office of the contracted organisation and does not necessarily reflect the location of actual employment or training. Figures provided reflect actual expenditure excluding GST. These figures are subject to change due to lags in data entry and ongoing systems reconciliations. Wage Assistance (WA); National Indigenous Cadetship Project (NICP); and Direct Assistance. The expenditure figures for these programmes relate to claims for payment by contracted employers. Data is presented on the grounds that the address of the contracted employer that received funding was in the specified electorate. In many cases this will be the postal address of the contracted employer and does not necessarily reflect the location of actual employment. Figures provided reflect actual expenditure exclusive of GST. These figures are subject to change due to lags in data entry and ongoing systems reconciliations. Community Development Employment Project Placement Incentive (CDEP PI); and Community Development Employment Project Work Preparation and Employment Trial (CDEP Trial). The expenditure figures for these programmes relate to claims for payment by contracted Community Development Employment Project (CDEP) organisations. Expenditure has been allocated to electorates on the basis of the postal address of the CDEP organisation providing the services. However, this address does not necessarily reflect the location of actual employment. Figures reflect actual GST exclusive expenditure. These figures are subject to change due to lags in data entry and ongoing systems reconciliations. Indigenous Employment Centres (IECs) The expenditure figures for the electorate do not include expenditure on Indigenous Employment Centre services provided by Community Development Employment Project (CDEP) organisations located in the electorate. Inclusion of expenditure on IECs would disclose commercial in confidence information. IECs are located where labour market employment opportunities exist for Indigenous job seekers. The address of the head office of the CDEP providing IEC services has been used to determine the relevant electorate. However, participants receiving IEC services may live in a different electorate because to be eligible for services from the IEC they have to be on the schedule of the CDEP providing IEC services rather than live in a particular region or area. Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (EESS), General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) Recipient electorates are determined by claimants’ postcode where available. Some postcodes cover more than one electorate and the information contained shows all relevant data for each electorate. Due to postcodes covering multiple electorates, some payments to recipients will be assigned alphabetically to an electorate. This may result in a minor statistical anomaly. Funding figures are based on actual expenditure. Special Employee Entitlement Scheme for Ansett (SEESA) Recipient electorates are determined by claimants’ postcode where available. Some postcodes cover more than one electorate and the information contained shows all relevant data for each electorate. Due to postcodes covering multiple electorates, some payments to recipients will be assigned alphabetically to an electorate. This may result in a minor statistical anomaly. Funding figures are based on actual expenditure. Notes. There were 28 recipients of SEESA funds ($579,127.18) whose address details did not contain a postcode and as such could not be attributed to an electorate. There were 105 recipients of SEESA funds ($2,831,862.05) whose postcodes were not listed in the Electorate Database and as such could not be attributed to an electorate. This amounts to 133 recipients in total with a gross total SEESA entitlement of $3,410,989.23 who could not be attributed to an electorate row 4 in the attached spreadsheet contains this information Work for the Dole Programme (WfD)* All figures derived in this spreadsheet are based on funding approved. Funding to deliver activities has been linked to electorate by the geographic location or locations where the activity occurs (as advised by the activity sponsor). Where, as a result of this process, the locations associated with an activity fall into more than one electorate, the funds and approved places associated with the activity have been divided equally among the electorates involved. Funding figures are GST inclusive. The number of approved places for which funding is available has been provided because the number of recipients by electorate is not available. Funding and expenditure are normally linked to administrative areas which are used for a number of purposes related to the operation of a program, for example, Labour Market Regional (LMR), Employment Service Area (ESA) or Area Consultative Committee (ACC) location. The borders associated with these administrative areas do not necessarily coincide with electorate boundaries. Figures are based on approved funding, not actual expenditure. Information is current as at 31 January. Wfd activities are approved on a rolling monthly basis and January is the latest month’s data available when these reports were coordinated. Community Support Programme (CSP) * Year and participant numbers: 1998 (3,352); 1999 (5,772); 2000 (13,810); 2001 (17,579); 2002 (5,286). In the 2001-02 Budget the Commonwealth Government announced the Personal Support Programme (PSP) as part of Australians Working Together. The PSP, managed by the Department of Family and Community Services (DFaCS), replaced the CSP and improves on the CSP by expanding the eligibility criteria and tailoring the programme to better meet the needs of its participants. The above figures are allocated to electorate based on the postal address of the recipients. Funding figures are based on actual expenditure. Working Women’s Centres Working Women’s Centres service the entire State and not just the electorate which they are located in. There are no Working Women’s Centres operating in Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory or Victoria. Funding is allocated annually at the beginning of each financial year.

Samaritans Founda14 Torrens Ave, tion CARDIFF NSW 2285 Shipping: Piracy (Question No. 1715) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 2003: (1) Is he aware that hundreds of private yachts traverse the waters currently under the control of coalition forces off the coast of Yemen and that the majority of these yachts are from Australia, the United States, and Europe including Britain. (2) Is he aware that several yachts have been attacked by pirates recently; including the British registered yacht Bambola on 2 March 2003 and a group of 5 yachts, 4 from Australia and 1 from the USA, on 9 March 2003. (3) What role do coalition forces in the region, including Australian warships, have in providing assistance and protection from piracy to private yachts. (4) Will he consider reviewing the role played by coalition forces, including Australian forces, to provide better protection from piracy to private yachts. (5) Have any discussions taken place with our coalition partners on these matters; if not, will he consider raising the issue of better protection for private yachts in this region with Australia’s coalition partners. (1) I am aware that a significant number of international yachts, some of which are registered in Australia, traverse the waters off the Gulf of Yemen. (2) I am aware of a report about an attempted act of piracy against five yachts, including some Australian registered vessels, off the Yemen coast on 11 March 2003, in which the yachts were reported to have outrun the pirate boats and safely continued their voyage. Our concerns with incidents of acts of piracy against Australian yachts near Yemen are reflected in the Government’s travel advice for Yemen and its advice on Piracy at Sea. The International Maritime Organization also has issued general guidance to shipowners and ship crews on preventing and suppressing acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships. (3) This question should be referred to the Minister for Defence. (4) This question should be referred to the Minister for Defence. (5) This question should be referred to the Minister for Defence. Fire Fighting Brigade: Mount Stromlo (Question No. 1738) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 24 March 2003: What was the role of the Government in funding and supporting the fire fighting brigade service at the Mt Stromlo observatory that ceased operating in 1996. The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government has advised that the fire fighting brigade at Mt Stromlo observatory was a volunteer unit operated by the Australian National University (ANU) until it was disbanded in 1996. The ANU owned the fire fighting appliances and provided staff and residents as volunteer fire fighters for those appliances stationed at Mt Stromlo. The Territories portfolio (then the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories) provided funds to the ACT for fire services until 1992, at which time responsibility for this payment was transferred to the Department of Finance. This payment for fire services was in consideration of the significant Federal Government presence in the Territory and the burden this placed on ACT fire services. I am advised that, as a volunteer brigade, the Mt Stromlo observatory fire fighting brigade did not receive any of the funds from these Commonwealth payments.
