They pretty simple story. New technology has just want to say to the company involved: come along allowing a big trawler with huge 'No, you're not going to be able to use this refrigeration capacity to stay out there in the technology, regardless of what the science same waters for a great length of time with says.'

Why? Because they see industry, which is allowing us to mine much some political opportunities in it. When you more coal much more quickly than we ever reflect on it, why would they oppose a could before. That requires a government pause? Why wouldn't they join with the response. And government is constantly government in saying, 'There is community responding to those changes in mining by concern about this new technology. Let's adjusting its policy setting.

So, technology changes and government policy needs to There is this growing concern, if not just a change as a response; and no-one should be perception, in some of my communities, that surprised by that. governments are stopping them from doing Coal-seam methane is another issue for these things-stopping them from hunting, people like me, representing the community stopping them from fishing. I understand in the Hunter Valley. The government has some of those sentiments, quite frankly. really taken the same approach: there is Today, as we debate this bill, a lot of those concern about the science, there is still some people will be out there asking themselves doubt about the impact on water tables et the question, having seen some of the cetera, so we have established an expert photographs, illustrations and indeed scientific committee to ensure that those cartoons in the newspapers, whether they are questions are properly tested.

198,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"ChiefThursday, 13 September 2012 Centrelink my constituents' experience when attempting to phone Centrelink. The issue affects a huge proportion of my electorate, particularly elderly residents receiving the age pension, who often utilise Centrelink's phone services. Customers receiving Centrelink payments such as the age pension and disability support pension are frequently required to contact Centrelink to report changes to their income or to inform them of overseas travel. Reporting this information is a legislative requirement for payment receipts; otherwise, their payments will be cancelled. However, my office has been inundated with constituents informing me that they have not been able to get through to Centrelink on the phone and reporting being kept on hold from anywhere between 30 minutes and up to four hours. In desperation, these people often contact my office in the hope that I may be able to pass on their message to Centrelink. Mrs Dale Ward, a pensioner from Armadale, first contacted me late last year reporting her difficulties getting through to Centrelink and sought assistance in trying to contact them before she left on a holiday. She has since reported the same problems a number of times throughout this year. Mr Peter Pavlinovich and Mr Joseph Sutherland are in the same boat. Most of my constituents who are trying to contact Centrelink are relying on these payments as their main source of income. In many cases, these people are elderly and vulnerable and are frightened of the ramifications of not reporting to Centrelink. They are simply trying to do the right thing and feel that they are being treated as second-class citizens. One local resident told me that, although he is retired, he has better things to do than spend the whole day on the phone. In the light of the vast number of complaints that I have received, on 1 June 2012 I wrote to Senator the Hon. Kim Carr, the Minister for Human Services, in order to raise this issue, and I received a response-which I have here-on 28 August 2012. This was a poor response which was a standard in every sense of the word and even managed to repeat paragraphs. Furthermore, the minister fails to effectively acknowledge the problem and simply offers other alternatives to getting in touch with Centrelink. WhilstI have informed my constituents of the online services, the option of visiting an office or mailing Centrelink, these are not suitable alternatives for most people. Many people that receive the pension or other payments are elderly or disadvantaged and do not have the ability to access online services. A large majority are also unable to drive and cannot get to a Centrelink office to report their information. In addition, most that are able to get in to an office are also met with huge queues and significant delays. I do not seek to criticise the excellent work of Centrelink staff, and I can confirm that staff in the Centrelink offices in my electorate are extremely helpful. However, they are significantly understaffed and underresourced and simply cannot deal with the huge increase in demand for their services. My constituents are trying to assist Centrelink by reporting their",129,Business

Grayndler Electorate: Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards Transport) (09:33): Just over a week ago, I had the honour of meeting Justin Kwon, a year 5 student at St Vincents Primary School in Ashfield. Justin's passion for prose saw him take out a top spot in the Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards, a nationwide competition that attracted over 10,000 entries this year. What was extra special about Justin's award was that it was in the learning assistance and special education category. Justin's passion for poetry began when he heard Dorothea Mackellar's legendary poem My Country. It is fitting that this budding poet has won an award named after his idol. While I happily presented Justin with a book pack and a cheque for his prize, he gave me a much greater gift: a book that he made himself with poems he had written since he was seven years old and illustrations for each poem. It is obvious that poetry is an important part of the way that Justin expresses himself. I was honoured to receive such a wonderful present. He is a credit to his parents, Oh Soo and Marissa; his teacher Robin Catchpole; and his school, St Vincent's at Ashfield. I would like to share with the House some of his poem which won the prize: I wish I had wheels, wings and marvellous things! I wish I had wheels, SoI can be as fast as a car, I can go near and I can go far. I wish I had wheels, wings and marvellous things! I wish I had wings so I can fly: I can take a trip to the blue sky! I wish I had wheels, wings and marvellous things! I wish I had a shell, SoI can hide, when I am scared… or when I’m sleepy inside… I wish I had wheels, wings and marvellous things!

He expresses himself in such a magnificent way through this book of poetry.

He is a wonderful boy and he is a great credit to his school, to his family and to the local community. Centrelink presentation. But today I want to raise a very important issue relating to injury compensation payments and subsequent Centrelink payments. My Hinkler electorate office has received numerous questions and representations on this issue. What appears to be the crux of the issue is the lack of financial advice given to claimants by insurance companies relating to the period of time compensation funds must support the recipient and the fact that most people are unable to receive Centrelink assistance once they have received a payout. Let me explain. When a person receives a compensation payment for whatever reason, they are made aware that they will have to cover their legal fees from the proceeds of the payment. That is fair enough. However, what they are not being told is that, once they receive the compensation payment, they will not be able to receive Centrelink payments for a certain period of time, which is known as the preclusion period. Any Centrelink payments which are being received or have been received during the preclusion period must be repaid. This is what I see in my office frequently. It is very important for all recipients of compensation settlements to understand that the money they received is to support them for the duration of the preclusion period and to cover all of their costs. It has come to my attention that many people are not made aware of the necessity to repay Centrelink or of the preclusion period until they receive a letter from Centrelink after the settlement date. Depending on the amount of the settlement, some people have been placed in a situation where they have to pay back several thousand dollars to Centrelink and wait for many months or even years before they are again eligible for benefits. From my experience, the shock of being made aware of this information can be quite a blow to people, who in many cases are recovering from physical and emotional situations.",131,Constituency Statements

For example, those who become permanently incapacitated are not excluded from these criteria. If those who are unable to ever work again after suffering serious injury use the compensation to pay out a housing loan or convert a home to suit their needs then I believe some sort of exemption should be made available to them, as opposed to those who have become rehabilitated and then can rejoin the workforce. This is a very important matter and I hope the government will take note of it. Fowler Electorate: Young Adults Disabled Association Young Adults Disabled Association, better known as YADA. YADA is a charitable organisation that provides a range of recreational and social support services for people living with disabilities in my local community. Their work is of vital importance, given the fact that my electorate is, unfortunately, overrepresented with families and people who live with disabilities. YADA was started 25 years ago by Jennifer McAlees, John Eastwood and a number of local residents who teamed up to enhance the quality of life for young people with disabilities in a social and friendly environment. Jennifer, who has hydrocephalus and DandyWalker syndrome, has taken herself and others living with disabilities on a journey to enhance the quality of their lives, living without isolation. John was a community transport driver at the time and he made it his mission in life to transport members to and from YADA social support activities. This small group, with humble beginnings, has now grown into a large, extended family type organisation. YADA is now a registered charity and driven by the generosity of its many volunteers, who have worked tirelessly to support and assist the disabled in our community. YADA runs a day centre group two days a week for the local community at the local community hall, where people can come to participate in the various activities, including arts, crafts, singing and dancing. It enhances their confidence, living skills and social interaction. It also alleviates and provides some respite to carers of people with disabilities and their families. YADA also provides assistance to many newly arrived migrants in my area. This is very fortunate considering the fact that more than 55 per cent of my electorate was born overseas. Remarkably, the charity is one of the most self-sufficient. Its operational costs are met by offsetting a comprehensive re-use and recycling program. Second-hand goods ranging from clothes and toys to scrap metal and soft drink bottles are carefully sorted, deconstructed and sold at a reasonable price on the second-hand goods market. Although YADA has received federal funding through the New South Wales Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care in the past, it largely stands on its own two feet. As someone who has long held passionate views about disabilities, I feel very fortunate that, as an organisation, YADA is based in Liverpool and Fairfield local government areas. On behalf of the community, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Jennifer and John for the initiation of this wonderful organisation.

204,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (09:40,"I rise this morning to talk about the wonderful work of theladies are not just sports enthusiasts; there is a very important purpose behind this simple activity. Dragons Abreast Bribie Island is a support group, both in the emotional and physical sense, to ladies in my local community who are recovering from breast cancer. Together the ladies paddle canoes, and the physical act of paddling specifically helps with muscle regeneration. But, more than that, the relationships that the ladies develop help them with the difficult transition from treatment to recovery and beyond. A few weeks ago I braved an early morning to meet with the ladies of Dragons Abreast Bribie Island for the regular paddle up the Pumicestone Passage. I have done a lot of kayaking up the passage-I grew up kayaking up the passage-but canoeing with the Ladies of Dragons Abreast Bribie Island is something else altogether. The camaraderie and support between the ladies that I witnessed are quite incredible. It is not difficult to see how important these times are for these special ladies. Dragons Abreast Bribie Island was founded four years ago and has already come a long way. The idea itself came from a lady by the name of Dawn Worley, who, after herself experiencing breast cancer and seeing first hand the challenges associated with recovery, saw the need to provide a support group for others in a similar position. Dawn recognised that individuals recovering from breast cancer need some help for both the body and for the soul, which is exactly what she saw that Dragons Abreast would provide. Dawn worked tirelessly to raise the funds so that Dragons Abreast could purchase the boats that they now use. Without Dawn's hard work, the generous contribution of donors in my local community and the commitment of other ladies who were determined to see this project come to fruition, this great local initiative would not have been possible. While it is difficult to quantify how much Dragons Abreast Bribie Island means to the local ladies, it is clear from the smiles and from the laughter that I witnessed out on the passage on that cold morning that Dragons Abreast is a very vital part of recovery for many women who have had breast cancer. To all of the ladies who regularly dedicate their time to being a mentor to the other ladies, thank you. Thank you for making our community a richer place. I look forward to getting back out on the passage-on the beautiful Pumicestone Passageagain with these inspirational ladies to offer my support to the incredible work that they do. Thank you, ladies. Corio Electorate: Reading Recovery Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (09:45): As a parent who knows the utter joy of hearing one's child read their first tentative words from the page of a book, I also very much understand the importance of catching early those children who take a bit longer to get the hang of reading. That is why the Reading Recovery program has been such a success in so many of our primary schools in Victoria. It gives grade one children who need extra help with reading highly skilled one-on-one tuition for up to 16 weeks. Because it is so intensive, it helps these children catch up to their classmates before their reading difficulties erode their confidence in other areas of their schoolwork. But in my electorate and those electorates that make young people the Barwon south-west region, the reading recovery program is under threat.

205,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs andreading recovery tutor. This will impact nearly 80 primary schools across the region. Without a tutor working with reading recovery teachers in each school, there will be no training for new reading recovery teachers. Without a tutor, and with reading recovery teachers in each school, the intensive skills set required among the current batch of teachers will not be maintained. Over time there will be fewer qualified to teach reading recovery, and schools will be in the unenviable position of competing with each other for a dwindling pool of teachers. It will be a slow, but inevitable erosion of a highly effective program. There will be a real risk that reading recovery will be no more. I know from talking to teachers and principals in my electorate how much the program is valued. Currently, nearly three quarters of the schools in the Barwon south-west region use the reading recovery program. It boasts a success rate of around 80 per cent. A lot of students starting grade 1 are struggling readers, but finishing the year as confident readers. Without the program, there will be many students in the future not getting the help they need. Many students are being let down by Victorian Liberal government. Since coming to office, the Baillieu government has cut a swathe through the school support programs. The school start bonus, the student support officers, education maintenance allowance, the Victorian Schools Plan and VCAL, are all programs that have been cut back or scrapped altogether. That is not to mention the devastating cutbacks to the TAFE sector, which has been experienced by the Gordon in Geelong. To add reading recovery to this list in this, the National Year of Reading, is indeed alarming. In recent days, we have seen how Liberal governments are taking the axe to education services in New South Wales and Queensland. It is a frightening glimpse into what we would face under an Abbot-led federal government. RU OK? Day parliamentarians to speak up and ask the important questions. Often we do not stop to think of the people around us and check that they are actually okay. I urge everyone to visit www.ruok.com and find out ways to join the movement by hosting events in the workplace, home or classroom, by spreading the message on social media or sharing your story. The RU OK? Day website states that connection, and open and honest conversations, are good for our well-being, whether or not we are struggling with a problem. It helps us to feel valued and supported by the people around us. There is also an emerging body of research which links supportive social relationships and a sense of social connection with protective factors in suicide prevention. I completely agree with this. In Hasluck, we have a large fly-in fly-out population. This has a major impact on the mental health needs of those who travel to mines and on the families left at home. I had one lady visit me in the office with an issue. After she discussed the issue, all it took for me to help was to ask, 'Are you okay?' We were then able to have a discussion around the issue she was facing at home and how she was feeling. Tips on the RU OK?

There is no shame in saying, 'I'm not okay,' and we urgently need to breakdown the stigma surrounding mental health and suicide. Last Friday, I was fortunate enough to listen to former ABC commentator Glenn Mitchell share his journey with depression and mental health issues. Glenn's story is an inspirational one and embodies the spirit of RU OK? Day. If his wife, Karen, had not persisted and asked the question, Glenn's life would have been very different today. Everyone came away from the event quite affected and inspired to make a difference in our own communities. I want to congratulate and thank co-founders Janina Nearn and the late Gavin Larkin OAM for commencing this initiative, and Janina for the hard work that she is doing as the CEO. All Australians should get on board with RU OK? Day, and I urge all parliamentarians to support this life-changing initiative. I think that sometimes in this parliament of ours there are members who experience incredible challenges, as well as staff, and sometimes it would not hurt for us to take the time out to ask a colleague if they are okay, regardless of which political side they are on or which spectrum they are involved with. I think it is important that as human beings we take the time out to care for each other, to listen and to be receptive. Radioactive Waste (09:53): I rise to express my outrage at the very poor treatment that the residents of Western Sydney are receiving from the New South Wales Liberals. We have seen in the last couple of days these devastating cuts to education: $1.7 billion worth of cuts. We all know that this will have a very big impact, especially in places like Western Sydney. The point and the issue I want to discuss today is the breach of promise-the broken promise-by the O'Farrell government, the New South Wales Liberals, and their decision to send radioactive waste to Kemps Creek in Western Sydney. This is waste that comes from the site of a former uranium smelter in Hunters Hill on Sydney's North Shore. To ship it out and to dump it in Western Sydney, in my community, is an outrage. People are angry and they have every reason to be angry. They are especially angry because Mr O'Farrell gave clear commitments before the election that he would not be sending this waste out to Western Sydney. In fact, I have a letter here dated 25 October 2010, where he referred to the waste and the plan to move the waste out to Kemps Creek as 'utterly unacceptable and dangerous'. He said, 'I think the idea of reclassifying the waste so that it could be accepted at Kemps Creek is appalling.' Now, he is in office and that is exactly what he intends to do. Before the election, what did he have to say? He said that it was a threat to people's safety. That is what he said on Channel Nine News on 17 October 2010. On the same day, on the ABC News, he said, 'It needs to be put in an appropriate facility.' To rub people's noses in it, the state Liberal member for Mulgoa, who up until Saturday also happened to be a councillor on the Penrith City Council, got up in the council after having run a campaign against this before the state election, where she said such things as: The people of Western Sydney are not the dumping ground for Sydney, especially this radioactive waste. It is unsafe waste material and should not be dumped in our community.",135,Wyatt Roy Longman 09 43 I Rise Today To Share Information About The Great Work
207,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation)She got up at a recent council meeting and defended this plan to send it out west. What did she say? She told the people of Western Sydney that the amount of radioactivity in this waste was the same level of radioactivity as you would experience in eating a banana. The member for Mulgoa has gone bananas, but people in our community are rightly livid about this. A recent report issued by Mr O'Farrell's own experts say that this waste, if dumped in Kemps Creek, will need to be monitored for up to 300 years. That does not sound very safe to me. It is being moved because there were cancer clusters that emerged in the area where it currently rests. If it is not unsafe, why do they want to move it? I have established a petition at www.nodumping.org, and I would like to table it. (Time expired) Leave granted. Macquarie Electorate: Blue Mountains Cancer Help organisation in my electorate. Blue Mountains Cancer Help is an organisation that is dedicated to supporting people diagnosed with cancer in the local community. Since 2005 more than 400 people from areas as far as Blacktown to Katoomba have received support from Blue Mountains Cancer Help. In the last 12 months alone, this not-for-profit organisation has provided 2,387 subsidised therapies including massage, lymphoedema, oncology massage, acupuncture and reflexology as well as support groups and counselling for clients and their families and carers. These therapies promote relaxation during a very challenging and often life-changing experience. All therapies are subsidised by Blue Mountains Cancer Help and if necessary can be carried out in the client's home. Blue Mountains Cancer Help goes above and beyond to support their clients and the local community. They have implemented a buddy system to support the primary carer or family member and also assist with the transportation costs, which can be considerable when regularly travelling throughout the Blue Mountains. What makes this organisation so unique is the way that they engage with their clients and the local community. In their own words, they 'provide a sense of purpose, friendship and support' to clients and their families. Community engagement has extended beyond just providing therapies and support. Blue Mountains Cancer Help have opened up op shops in the Blue Mountains townships of Blaxland and Katoomba. These shops provide a regular source of income, as well as a source of fundraising events and donations. There are two particular fundraising events that I would like to draw attention to, as I think they are amazing and truly demonstrate just how unique this organisation is. In May this year I attended the 2012 Blue Mountains Cancer Help Arty Bra Auction. The works of art bras are indeed something to behold. This auction raised more than $10,000 in much-needed funds. The solid chocolate corset was auctioned off for close to $3,000. One of the volunteers I met with at the event, Lynne, told me about the next fundraising endeavour: she would be undertaking the Camino walk across Europe. I am delighted to tell you that Lynne commenced the almost 800 kilometre walk just last week and is keeping a highly entertaining blog on the Blue Mountains Cancer Help website to keep us up to date. I would like to read from her blog:",136,Wyatt Roy Longman 09 43 I Rise Today To Share Information About The Great Work

The astonished, angry face of Mr Jac Nasser on TV last night at the decision of the Queensland Premier to impose a mining tax that will be larger than the federal government's in its effect especially on the coking coal industry, and the almost comic performance of the Liberal Party's major fundraiser, Mr Palmer, on Lateline last night, all come to the serious point of what is happening in Queensland. Closing breast cancer screening and closing a TB clinic at Brisbane Hospital-do you imagine that, across, Australia people are not concerned that this is the kind of Australia that a conservative government would stand for? In New South Wales, Mr O'Farrell's cuts to education include cuts to Catholic and independent schools-$66 million a year from their recurrent funding. These are schools that have teachers and programs already in place for next year and the cuts were done without consultation. The Catholic bishops, I believe, got two days notice. Schools will have to close. No wonder the New South Wales Liberal caucus is in revolt. Moving to what one might call the intellectual front, if one looks at the Australian Spectator, the palaeoconservative flagship, one sees that it more and more resembles the world view of the isolationist Pat Buchanan. The Australian Spectator has not only sectarian attacks on other conservatives such as Gerard Henderson in its current edition but it has the idea that there should be an investigation into war crimes of the Iraq War. I would remind all of the people who support the Australian Spectator that Mr John Howard, a former conservative Prime Minister of Australia, would be subject to such an investigation by the very people being advocated by the Australian Spectator. Finally, on my friends at the Institute of Public Affairs: I cannot imagine the great Liberal conservatives, fundraisers such as Charles Goode and Hugh Morgan, support the free-market fanatics of the IPA who appeared before the inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, denigrating the security services, denigrating what they call the national security state, saying it was unnecessary for the security services to intercept telephones and ensure that terrorist events do not happen in Australia. Look at the events in Melbourne this morning. My only conclusion is that their hubris, as we know, leads to nemesis. I think the conservatives across Australia are counting on a victory at the federal election. They have already put it in the bag and they are behaving in the most outrageous fashion by making some truly extreme statements and acting in a way that shows what they really believe. time for members' constituency statements has concluded.",137,Wyatt Roy Longman 09 43 I Rise Today To Share Information About The Great Work

211,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott,"In accordance with standing order 193, theMcDonald, Lance Corporal Mervyn John Galagher, Private Nathanael John Aubrey Debate resumed on the motion: That the House record its deep regret at the deaths on 30 August 2012, of Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of their service to their country and tender its profound sympathy to their families and friends in their bereavement. The loss of one soldier is always one too many. On Monday we remembered the loss of three Australian soldiers who were murdered by a member of the Afghan military and now we also mourn the loss of two Special Operation Task Group members who were killed when their helicopter crashed in Afghanistan. Not since the battle of Nui Le in Vietnam on 21 September 1971 has Australia lost five men in a 24-hour period. Australian Special Forces soldiers Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Private Nathanael Galagher, from 2nd Commando Regiment, were killed when an ISAF helicopter crashed in Helmand province. The Australian Special Forces and their partnered Afghan National Security Force unit were participating in a targeted mission at the time of the incident. Thirty-year-old Lance Corporal McDonald was on his sixth tour of Afghanistan. Lance Corporal McDonald was quick-witted and brought a positive energy to both his unit comrades and all those who served with him. A dedicated and enthusiastic professional soldier, he was always willing to come forward with ideas and solutions. He was a highly professional soldier, but his quiet nature and humility meant he always deflected credit back onto fellow members of his company. I wish to express my sincere condolences to his fiancee Rachael; his mother Myrna and stepfather Bernie; and brothers Percy, Roger and Gary. I am told that his 23-year-old colleague Private Galagher idolised Lance Corporal McDonald. Private Galagher always put 110 per cent into everything he did. He had a 'can-do' attitude, always wanting to get the job done and taking everything in his stride. He was an enthusiastic, young soldier who was very well respected by his mates in the regiment. I wish to express my sincere condolences to his partner Jessie; parents Wayne and Sally; and sister Elanor. During the parliamentary recess I spent 10 days in Afghanistan with our troops and during this time. I met with members of the 2nd Commando Regiment. They were frank and open about their mission, about the challenge it presented and indeed the pressure of achieving their objectives before Australia is scheduled to leave Afghanistan. We have lost two very special soldiers-two men trained to an exceptionally high level, both physically and mentally; two quick-thinking and innovative men who could keep a cool head in difficult and complex situations all over the world. Their commitment to their chosen career as soldiers and to our mission in Afghanistan was unwavering, as was their loyalty to their mates and their love for their own families and their Army family. On behalf of the Ryan",138,Wyatt Roy Longman 09 43 I Rise Today To Share Information About The Great Work
212,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (10:01,"29 August 2012 was a dark day for our whole nation.electorate, I offer my sincere condolences to Lance Corporal McDonald's and Private Galagher's families, friends, colleagues and loved ones. Lest we forget. Pilliga, a village a long way from anywhere in the north-west plains of New South Wales. You get a sense of the isolation-some would say desolation-of this community by the fact that the 1981 award-winning regional history about the area, a work by Eric Rolls, was entitled A Million Wild Acres. Although far away, Pilliga is very much at the heart of the nation at the moment, as the people of this tiny speck on the map farewell one of their favourite sons. Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher called Pilliga home. He was just 23 years of age when he was killed during operations in Afghanistan. Also killed in the same helicopter crash was Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald, 30, from Carnarvon in Western Australia. We have now lost 38 gallant soldiers in Afghanistan-a terrible loss of young life, but by no means a waste. They have helped to secure a better future for a troubled country, a nation which, by and large, seeks the same ideals of peace that we hold so dear and which we almost take for granted here in Australia. They helped drive the Taliban into hiding, if not total submission. The price of peace is a heavy one. It is measured in the blood of brave soldier from far-flung places-freedom fighters sent to do a job in the deadliest of situations. Private Galagher and Lance Corporal McDonald exemplified all that is good and great about the ANZAC spirit. Nate Galagher's partner, Jessie Feeney, is expecting a son-a boy who will grow up without the benefit of having his father around, but who will understand the wonderful man his dad was. That is Jessie's pledge. As she said, 'There is no trait of Nate's that I wouldn't want his son to inherit.' Nate idolised Lance Corporal McDonald, who was also killed alongside him on that fateful 30 August flight. Jessie recounted: Merv was generous with his experience and shared it with the other boys in the team, especially Nate. I last saw Nate at the airport when he departed Australia in July. As they were about to walk off to the gate together, Merv turned to me and said, 'Don't worry Jess, I'll bring him home.' While it's under the most tragic of circumstances, Merv is honouring his promise. Nathanael is also survived by his parents, Wayne and Sally, and sister, Elanor. Born in Wee Waa, Private Galagher joined the Army in 2007, was posted to the 2nd Commando Regiment in November 2011 and was on his second tour to Afghanistan. The Australian Defence Force said: He had a 'can-do' attitude, always wanting to get the job done and taking everything in his stride. Lance Corporal McDonald is survived by his fiancee, Rachael Sprigg-McKinnie, his mother, Myrna, stepfather, Bernie, and brothers, Percy, Roger and Gary. He enlisted in 1999 and at the time of his death was on his sixth tour of duty to Afghanistan. The ADF paid tribute to Lance Corporal McDonald's quick wit and positive energy. According to the ADF: A dedicated and enthusiastic professional soldier, he was always willing to come forward with ideas and solutions. He was a highly professional soldier, but his quiet nature and humility meant he always deflected credit back on to fellow members of his Company. Highly decorated during his career Lance Corporal McDonald was, according to his fiancee: … the warmest guy you'd ever meet. You could see it in his eyes, they had a special sparkle. He was a real Aussie bloke with a passion for his country, especially its natural splendour.",139,Condolences
213,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (10:05,"A sombre ceremony is being held today atNate and Merv were real Aussie blokes, but they were much more as well. They were courageous in the midst of an enemy sometimes impossible to see. They were inseparable mates then, now and forever. They were ANZACs. They were heroes. They may be gone but they will not be forgotten. Let us mourn them today and remember their selfless bravery, their supreme sacrifice, as long as the last post is played each ANZAC Day. Their grieving families will remember their love each and every day. May they rest in peace. Lest we forget. thoughtful and touching contributions by those who have spoken before me on both sides of this House. We are in this chamber today to pay our respects to Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Private Nathaniel Galagher and to offer our condolences to their colleagues in the 2nd Commando Regiment and their respective families and friends. The motto of the 2nd Commando Regiment is foras admonitio, or without warning, and the brave soldiers of the regiment live and serve by this motto. Australian commandos are respected around the world for their skill, professionalism, dedication, discipline and strong determination. The 2nd Commando Regiment has been awarded the unit citation for gallantry and the meritorious unit citation for their role in Afghanistan. It is in this noble and brave vein that these two young Australians served. Lance Corporal McDonald was an experienced soldier and on his sixth deployment to Afghanistan, while having completed four deployments in East Timor between 2001 and 2007. He was generous with his experience and someone that his younger colleagues looked up to. Among them was Private Galagher. Private Gallagher was a young solider who gained entry into the elite commando unit within four years of joining the Army. He has been described as someone with a 'can-do' attitude who always put 110 per cent into everything he did, and there is no doubt that this is why he was so well thought of by his colleagues. The loss of any soldier serving overseas is a tragedy and one felt right across our community, and it is heightened when they are our much respected neighbours stationed at Holsworthy. Today, I am particularly struck by the stories of these two young men, and I have a deep sympathy for their families and their partners. These brave young men have made the ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives in defence of the principles in which they believed-the principles of freedom, democracy and mateship. These men, like all those who join our defence forces, did so out of a love for their country, a love for freedom and a love for the Australian way of life. Both these men travelled to the other side of the world to defend those who could not defend themselves, to give hope to a population that, for so long, has had none. These men are true heroes and will be remembered forever for their sacrifice and their service. Given some recent comments in the media, it is worth recounting the absolute evil that our troops are fighting against in Afghanistan and the evil for which Lance Corporal Mervin McDonald and Private Nathaniel Galagher gave their lives fighting against: the evil of the Taliban. This is a group so evil that it commits systematic massacres against its own civilians. This is a group so evil that it has denied UN food supplies to tens of thousands of starving civilians, with the UN confirming that the Taliban had starved civilians for their own military agenda and were using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war. This is a group so evil that it conducts a scorched earth policy, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens",140,Condolences
214,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (10:09,"Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the mostof thousands of family homes. This is a group so evil that a report by the Physicians for Human Rights said: To PHR's knowledge, no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual house arrest, prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment … This is a group so evil that it has issued edicts forbidding women the most basic human right of being educated, forcing girls to leave schools and colleges. Again, I quote the same report by the Physicians for Human Rights. It said: The extent to which the Taliban regime has violated the human rights of Afghan women is unparalleled in recent history. …… … It is difficult to find another government or would be government in the world that has deliberately created such poverty by arbitrarily depriving half the population under its control of jobs, schooling, mobility and health care. Such restrictions are literally life threatening to women and to their children. This is a group so evil that it has planted improvised explosive devices in girls' schools. This is a group that dynamited the famous sixth century archaeological masterpieces of Buddha statues at Bamiyan. This is a group so evil that it outlawed sports, denying children the right and the joy of kicking a ball, and turned sports stadiums into public execution grounds, shooting people, hanging them from goalposts and chopping off their limbs. This is a group so evil that it seeks to deny people the joys of music and, only recently, took knives and beheaded 17 people for simply playing music at a party. We should never forget the words of Edmund Burke, who once famously said, 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.' Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Private Nathanael Galagher were good men. They were prepared to stand up and to fight evil to ensure that it will not triumph. Australia, and the world, is a better place for their sacrifice and their service, and their efforts should never be forgotten. Lest we forget. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (10:16): It is with great sadness that I rise today to support the condolence motion to honour Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher. Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher were both members of the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan. Tragically they both lost their lives when their helicopter crashed on 30 August 2012. This has been a very tough time for the family and friends of Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher and their mates still serving in Afghanistan. However, I would like them to know that our thoughts and prayers are with them. Lance Corporal McDonald was on his sixth tour to Afghanistan. He served in Operation Slipper in Afghanistan, as well as Operation Astute in Timor-Leste and Operation Citadel in East Timor. By all accounts Lance Corporal McDonald was noted for his quick wit and positive energy. He has been described as a dedicated, wholehearted and highly professional soldier and a credit to his company. The moving words of Lance Corporal McDonald's fiancee, Rachael Sprigg-McKinnie, paint a picture of a loving family man with an infectious personality who was passionate about the Army and serving his country. Rachael's touching tribute to her fiance brings to the fore the tragic loss of this young soldier. I also want to offer my condolences to the family and friends of 23-year-old Private Galagher, who was serving on his second tour to Afghanistan. Private Galagher, known as Nate to his family and mates, was deployed as part of the operation. I have spoken before about meeting soldiers of the calibre of Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher when I travelled to Afghanistan. In my short time in Tarin Kot, Kandahar and Kabul, I saw first hand the determination and focus of the Australian troops and the passion that they have in their mission to eliminate terrorism from the region and create a peaceful and safe country for the people of Afghanistan. I also got to see the loyalty and the camaraderie of these soldiers, and I can only imagine what they are feeling and what they are experiencing at the moment at the loss of two of their own, because they are a very tight-knit and loyal group, and they are very close. It is like a brotherhood. They operate in an environment that is unimaginable to most people. Our troops face unique hardships and risks. They share the satisfaction of serving in an operation that is designed to bring freedom from oppression, and they share the loss of their fellow soldiers very deeply. In my visit I met with those soldiers and commandos and got a sense of the conditions and challenges they endure, because the environment in Afghanistan is difficult and it is difficult to describe. When I was there I was told of life in winter, when the temperature can drop to minus 20, and of life in the summer months, when the temperature can rise to 50 degrees. Within a year the people of Afghanistan experience freezing conditions and boiling hot and dusty days that test the most highly trained and experienced soldiers. SoI have tremendous admiration for the people of Afghanistan, who endure these extreme conditions while under the constant threat of war and terrorism, and I hold in great admiration our service men and women who are there to help the Afghani people as they work towards building their own resilience and stability. Our service men and women are there to assist the people in Afghanistan. They want and need our help, and there are overwhelming sacrifices being made on all sides. What impressed me about the soldiers there was the incredible dignity and respect that they have. Of course, the soldiers being Australian, I also saw a lot of humour and larrikinism, which is very much a trait of Australian soldiers. I have previously described our service men and women in Afghanistan and those serving in other operations as being like a brotherhood, as I mentioned before. As in a brotherhood, if one of their brothers dies or is injured then they are commemorated, often with bracelets bearing their names. There are many ways we can honour and pay tribute to our soldiers. While I did not know these soldiers personally, I can understand the incredible loss their mates are experiencing. Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher were bravely serving their country with distinction and honour. The tributes we have heard today are a recognition on behalf of the parliament that we honour their commitment to our Defence Force and the operations they engage in. I extend my sincere sympathies to the family of Lance Corporal McDonald-his fiancee, Rachael; his mother, Myrna, and stepfather Bernie; and his brothers, Percy, Roger and Gary-and to the family of Private Galagher-his partner, Jessie; his parents, Wayne and Sally; and his sister, Elanor.

215,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (10:21): I move:Rackett, Mr David condolence motion for Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher. I would like to identify with the remarks made in that condolence motion. It's all about looking after your mates. Some are not travelling so well, so we're there for each other. The main thing is they are not alone. These are Dave Rackett's words. Dave is a constituent and a friend and has been awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by the RSL. When Dave Rackett returned from World War II, his father encouraged him to continue his service to others by joining the Returned and Services League. Sixty years later, he has now been awarded another service medal that he will wear with pride. Dave Rackett was presented with the Meritorious Service Medal at the RSL's annual state conference on Wednesday, 4 July. The Meritorious Service Medal is an honour over and above life membership. It is awarded to those already holding life membership who have had 30 years continuous membership and who have given 25 years outstanding service. When Mr Dave Rackett moved to Warragul from Darwin more than 30 years ago, one of his first priorities was to be active in the Warragul RSL branch. Many in the community would know Mr Rackett for his commitment to RSL appeals. He is regularly seen in the leadup to ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day selling badges and poppies. For Mr Rackett, it is all part of the ongoing service he committed to as a 20-year-old in World War II. Mr Rackett served with the Royal Australian Air Force in the south-west Pacific between 1944 and 1946. When he returned home at just 22 years of age, his father immediately took him to the local RSL. His father was also a returned serviceman. Dave says in his own words I thought, what is all this about. But my father (a returned serviceman from both World WarI and World War II) told me it was a way to continue my service to others. In the early days, following the war, Mr Rackett joined other returned servicemen to visit veterans in hospitals and institutions. He said there were many sad cases, many men who had returned from battle still shellshocked and struggling to get back to life. 'Little has changed', says Dave. He becomes emotional now, speaking of other young men he has come into contact with as a welfare officer-a 22-year-old, just like he was, who recently returned from Afghanistan. 'It is tough', he says, shedding a tear, 'It never gets any easier and the wars keep going. It will never end; mankind can be so bitter to others.' Dave Rackett has held many positions within the RSL. For 16 years he has been secretary of the Warragul Branch and is also a past treasurer. But it is service he is happy to continue. There is a lovely photo in the local paper of Dave holding his framed certificate, and up on the honour board behind him, in the corner of the photo, is Dave Racket's name in the secretary's position. I think that is a lovely catch in the photo-it was great that the local paper's photographer got that. Dave says: We have a dedicated team of hospital visitors to people at home who can't get out. That is the beauty of having a local RSL. It has been a rewarding part of my life. It's a real privilege to go into people's homes, talk to them and see what we can do to make their lives easier. But if it wasn't for the support of the community through ANZAC and poppy appeals, we wouldn't have the money to do that. Mr Rackett said he had never provided his service to RSL to be recognised. But he admits, 'when recognition does come along, it is very sweet'.",143,Adjournment
216,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (10:22,"I note before my remarks that I am following theDave is a special personality, and I want to pay tribute-from Maranoa to McMillan, which is from the bottom to the top, there are people like Dave Rackett serving our returned services community. I want to praise every one of them today for the work they do on behalf of our returned servicemen. Here's to you, Dave Rackett, and congratulations on a welldeserved citation. Honourable members: Hear, hear! Housing Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (10:27): The issues of housing availability, affordability and access present critical challenges in Australia, and these are issues on which I have spoken a number of times, particularly with respect to tackling homelessness. In the last 12 months I have been pleased to take part in aged care policy consultations in my electorate with my community, and this has reinforced for me the pressing need to ensure that we create appropriate housing for older Australians and for Australians living with disability. These of course are overlapping categories, because as we age we inevitably become less able in a number of ways. The government's Living Longer, Living Better policy springs from the recognition that Australians are living longer and that the preference of most people is to live active, vibrant lives in their own homes for as long as possible. This government recognises that enabling that to be the case in future will require policy and service reform in a number of areas. One of them is certainly housing. In the last week of AugustI had the opportunity to attend, with the federal Minister for Housing, Brendan O'Connor, the opening of a new development in my electorate at Cockburn Central. The Living Space development is a five-building, 130apartment complex built under the Gillard government's social housing initiative at a cost of $39.35 million. The apartments in this development will deliver a range of affordable housing options, including social housing, affordable rental properties and privately owned homes for lowto moderate-income earners, some of which can be purchased through WA government assisted shared equity programs. It is a credit to the development proponent, the builder and the city of Cockburn that the Living Space project does a lot more than simply create much-needed diverse and affordable housing. The development has a six-star or higher energy rating across all its units, greatly reducing the energy demands of this housing complex and also the cost to the residents. The complex has been designed with accessibility in mind and has special features that provide improved access for those with restricted mobility as well as being easily adaptable for universal access in future. What's more, the Living Space development is a short distance to the Cockburn central train station, the new Cockburn GP superclinic and the Gateway shopping centre, and it is 15 minutes by train from the Perth CBD. It therefore represents the kind of transport-oriented development we need to see a lot more of if our cities are to operate on a more sustainable basis. This development forms only one part of the $101 million that the Labor government has invested in the Fremantle electorate to help build around 320 new homes and to repair and maintain a further 1,580 existing homes. It was late last year that the first major project of this kind in my electorate reached completion, namely the $22.8 million Fort Knox Match development within the heritage warehouse precinct in the heart of Fremantle. That project delivered 58 one-bedroom units, 12 of which are class C adaptable, which means they are easily modified for tenants with a disability. They make up half of the 24 units, which will be available as social housing for the region's most vulnerable people including older Australians and people with a disability. I am proud to be part of a Labor government that has made significant strides in addressing housing affordability and in reducing homelessness in this country. This Labor government has invested a record $20 billion in programs targeted at addressing these issues since coming to office-programs like the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which, through partnership with states and territories, has delivered an increase in the supply of new affordable rental dwellings across Australia. Under the scheme, approved properties are rented out to eligible low-to-moderate income tenants at 20 per cent or more below the market rate. In Western Australia alone the scheme is expected to deliver an additional 5,000 affordable rental homes. The creation of adequate, affordable, accessible, sustainable and well located housing is an absolutely critical challenge in Australia and it is one that must be guided by government at the local, state and federal level. There are special imperatives and constraints that apply when it comes to providing social housing, universally accessible housing and transport oriented development. These imperatives will cause the underprovision of such housing if its provision is left to the market. On either edge of my electorate, east and west, in the City of Cockburn and in the City of Fremantle, both the Living Space and the Match developments have demonstrated how carefully targeted government investment can create much needed housing that would never be provided by the market left to its own devices. Both these projects are transport oriented developments, both these projects involve high-quality energy efficiency and environmental design, both these projects create social and affordable housing and housing that caters for older Australians and Australians with a disability. To me they represent not only brilliant new housing but brilliant examples of the way forward when it comes to Australia's future housing needs. Swan Electorate: National Broadband Network broadband policy tour of my electorate of Swan to meet residents and businesses. We felt a bit like David Attenborough looking for a wild creature out in the wild west of Western Australia that we know is very scarce. It is that scarce, we could not find the NBN nor could we find the fibre in my electorate. If you look at the websiteMr Lyons interjectingNBN in regions of Tasmania. We did not find the NBN but we did find many constituents disillusioned by the broken Labor broadband promises in my electorate from the last election and positively enthused and receptive to Malcolm Turnbull, the member for Wentworth, and the coalition's policy of rapid rollout of fibre-to-the-node NBN that would be delivered faster and to areas that need it most first. I am sure there are many members in this place that remember the great fanfare of the Labor broadband promises made before the last election. In my electorate of Swan, particularly, the Labor candidate trumpeted the fact that we were going to have the commencement of broadband in the second quarter of 2011. There has been no",144,Adjournment

There are plenty of signs on the website saying it has been commenced but it has not commenced. They were out there saying to everyone in Victoria Park, 'We want your vote. We are going to give you broadband in the second quarter of 2011.' It just did not happen. That promise was broken well over 12 months ago. Today not one piece of fibre has been laid in Victoria Park. The residents of the trial site are becoming increasingly frustrated about the lack of delivery from this government and from the NBN. Government members interjectinghang their hats on about all the performances of all the schemes they have implemented since they were elected in 2007. Let us remind them about pink batts, schools, BER and all those sorts of things. We have seen the inability of the government to deliver simple schemes over the last four yearsGovernment members interjectingmassive delays, missed deadlines and broken promises. The losers are the people of my electorate of Swan as well as the people of Australia, who are still waiting for the first house to receive better broadband services. The question has to be asked: if they still have not managed to connect a small trial site in a small part of one of 30 suburbs in my electorate, what hope is there for the broadband black spots in Swan, out in Cloverdale and in Kewdale which have not yet been shortlisted for connection? I know a constituent in Cloverdale who has been told he simply cannot connect to broadband as he is in a black spot. The City of Belmont put in a submission for broadband to the NBN that was rated highly by the office of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy before the last election, but it was not selected and to this day it has not been shortlisted. The black spots in Swan also have not been addressed. The residents and businesses enjoyed meeting the member for Wentworth and were very receptive to the coalition's FTTN policy, given the delays and broken promises that this government has presided over. I commend the member for Wentworth for work he has done in developing a policy that will be rolled out faster and, importantly, will first meet the needs of the areas that need it most. The coalition is in favour of comprehensive high-speed broadband that can be delivered to all Australians, and that is the policy the member for Wentworth has produced. Certainly the residents and businesses we visited in the 6VIC-01 trial site are fast coming to the conclusion that the only way to get change and action is to change the government. I understand it is the government's intention to shortlist another area of Victoria Park next week. My suggestion to the government is to stop the spin and start delivering. There have been so many announcements of new areas, yet still no fibre has been laid for the first area announced in 2010. Stop the spin and start delivering-that is all the residents want, what they expected and what they were promised, but it is not happening. In Bentley the frustration was summarised in an email I received on Tuesday from one of the businesses in my electorate frustrated at the inability to connect to ADSL or to supposed broadband:",146,Adjournment

(Time expired) Bass Electorate: Sporting Achievements outstanding athletes in my electorate of Bass: one who is a world champion and one who will be a world champion. These individuals have both reached the pinnacle of their chosen sport. Launceston-born boxer Daniel Geale's victory on Saturday, 1 September in Germany was an historic one. In defeating WA middleweight titleholder Felix Sturm, Daniel has become the first Australian boxer in history to hold two globally recognised major titles in the same division. The WA middleweight title adds to the IBF middleweight title which Daniel currently holds. He won the IBF title last year in Germany against another German, Sebastian Sylvester. It is believed that Daniel is the first boxer to twice take titles from German boxers on their home soil. This latest achievement adds to an already impressive career for Daniel which includes a Commonwealth Games gold medal, being a former holder of the IBO middleweight title and an impressive 28-to-one professional record. An unassuming, humble man outside the ring, Daniel is a credit to himself and the upbringing he received from his family in Tasmania. We are all very proud of his achievements and in the way he handles himself. Congratulations to Daniel on his well-deserved, historic achievements. You are a great role model not only for upcoming boxers but for athletes generally. The second person I congratulate is Rebecca Quail on her induction into the legend status at the Invermay Bowls& Community Club. I was privileged to be present for Rebecca's induction. Rebecca began her bowling career in 1998 aged 10 years. She is now in her 14th season, having won numerous awards in those 14 years. I would be here a long time if I wanted to list Rebecca's achievements so I will just mention a few.

It was about this time that Sophie Fletcher, Margaret Pearce and Molly Howell took her under their wings and began mentoring Rebecca. Rebecca went on to create ladies bowls history in 2005 when she became the first female lawn bowler to be granted a scholarship with the Tasmanian Institute of Sport. Rebecca is the Australian Champion of Champions singles titleholder. Continuing with her impressive form, in 2011, Rebecca became the first Tasmanian women's bowler to ever attain national No. 1 ranking. She then travelled to South Africa for a test series.

Rebecca's impressive form has continued and in April this year she was selected to travel to Adelaide for the Six Nations International. Again, Australia took away the gold medal. As you can see, Rebecca has an extremely impressive record and is truly deserving of this fantastic and prestigious accolade. What makes it even more impressive is that she is the first female legend for the club. Rebecca has acknowledged her coach, Mr George Atkins, for his contribution to her success. Congratulations to both Daniel and Rebecca. They are both from Launceston, are both humble and outstanding champions, and I wish them all the best for their continued success in their sporting endeavours. debate about foreign investment in this country recently which has got political, and I think many misleading statements about foreign investment have been made. I just want to outline our oldest agricultural company's history in this country. Would you believe that the land that they managed is still done so by them today? The oldest agricultural company in Australia is the Australian Agricultural Company Ltd, AAC. It was established in 1824 and it is the oldest continuously operating company. It has had many different owners over time and the original company had to raise capital in England, which they did. They had to raise one million pounds in order to be granted one million acres in Australia. The member for Hunter, who has walked in, will be interested that that original grant of land had to be out of the settled areas of the colony. It was, in fact, from Newcastle to Gloucester. That was the original AAC-Australian Agricultural Companyland. The land that was granted was for the production and cultivation of agricultural products, obviously, mainly wool. Interestingly, there were 30 members of the House of Commons who were initial investors and who contributed capital to raise that one million pounds. Included in that list of shareholders at the time was the great reformer, William Wilberforce-and we all know the wonderful work he did in the House of Commons for many years to bring about an end to the slave trade, which ended emancipation. He was a great hero for all of us and, I think, should be an inspiration for many of us in this place. The Australian Agricultural Company, since that date, that settlement and that grant of land, and once the bill went through the House of Commons and received royal assent from the King, have been producing agricultural products and for some time had a coal mining operation. They have also been producing food in Australia. In fact, in my own electorate they operate an irrigation and cotton farm near St George, just below Surat. They have a very well established feedlot in the Darling Downs, near Dalby. They hold some 600,000 head of cattle on their books through 19 cattle stations and two feedlots, and they hold today more than 7.2 million hectares of land across Queensland and the Northern Territory, which is equal to about 1.1 per cent of the landmass of Australia. This land was originally wholly owned by foreign investment that started the Australian Agricultural Company in 1824. The Bank of New South Wales, which is now Westpac, claimed to be the oldest company established; it was established in 1823. But AAC is the oldest continuous company and the very oldest agricultural, food producing, company in Australia. It is a proud history, and it underpins and puts to rest this notion that foreign",148,Adjournment
223,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa,"Second Deputy Speaker) (10:41): There has been ainvestment could be bad for the agricultural sector in Australia because they will own this land, they will lock it up, they will not produce food or, if they do produce agricultural products, they will take them offshore and value-add offshore. This is one of the best examples that I can give this parliament, that I accept that foreign investment is important for agricultural development in Australia. It will be needed long into the future. The current proposal for the purchase of Cubbie Station and the group of properties that they hold-not just the one at Dirranbandi but also the anchorage property at St George-is a good one. The proponents certainly do not own it at this stage; they have got to work through the process of the guidelines which have been given to them. But what I say to the Treasurer is this: he should not in future release a statement on a Friday afternoon, that he knows would create a political situation, approving the sale of Cubbie Station under certain terms and conditions, and then hope it will go away. He should be more open about it. He needs to make sure that in the future, while ever he is Treasurer, that it is not done on a Friday afternoon when the media shut down. It should be open and be more transparent. He should ensure that when he releases a statement about why such a foreign investment is in the national interest, whether it is to do with agriculture, mining operations or housing in urban Australia, he does not do it on a Friday afternoon. New South Wales Government: School Funding teaming up with the member for Shortland to express on behalf of the Hunter community collective concerns about the impact of the decision by Barry O'Farrell, Premier of New South Wales, to cut $1.7 billion out of school funding. I know our sentiments will be supported by both the member for Newcastle and the member for Charlton. I challenge, in a bipartisan way, the member for Paterson to come into the House today and also support us and to express concern about the impact of these cuts on Hunter communities generally. We really should pause for a moment and ask ourselves: why do we all need to be in here supporting our schools? Surely, we all support better schools for our children? We should not need to be in here having this debate. But, yet again, this week the Premier of New South Wales announced he would be cutting $1.7 billion from local schools-public, independent and Catholic. This measure will of course affect every school and every student. You do not get better education outcomes by spending less money, although I saw the Premier trying to suggest that was the case in the newspapers this morning. It will mean fewer teachers, fewer textbooks, fewer support staff and fewer computers for our local schools. It will also mean bigger class sizes for our young children. These cuts affect not only schools but, very importantly, our TAFE colleges. It is just so important, particularly in electorates such as mine, which, in the middle of a mining boom, are facing very, very significant skills shortages. We should be investing more in skills, as is the Gillard government, not cutting back our investments in skills training. It will mean that training staff, an apprentice or a trainee will become more expensive or, even worse, that the training they receive will be delivered at a lower standard. That is not good for the broader Hunter community. It will mean cuts to funding for schools in my electorate such as Maitland Public School, St Patrick's Primary School in Cessnock, Merriwa Central School and a school, which I noted this morning was in the parliament, St Paul's of Rutherford. I understand that it will also mean",149,Adjournment
224,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Chief Government Whip) (10:46): This morning I amcuts to the Catholic Schools Office, which was planning for a new school in the Maitland area. I understand and I say this advisedly, because I have not yet spoken to the schools office but I will, that they may now be putting that program on hold. We are already seeing the impact of Barry O'Farrell's cuts. My electorate cannot afford these cuts. It is a disastrous decision to slash $1.7 billion from our schools and our TAFE colleges. It is not about making savings; it is about making choices. Barry O'Farrell has chosen to put school and TAFE students last. That is the bottom line in this debate. We know that these state cuts to schools are just a curtain raiser for what Tony Abbott has in store for the broader Australian community. We can read directly into this and what the election of a Liberal-National Party government at the national level will mean for education standards in this country. Whenever a Liberal premier picks up the axe, schools are the first to face the chop-this I just do not understand-and Tony Abbott undoubtedly will do the same thing. We know he wants to sack one in seven teachers; we know he wants to cut trades training centres. Every child in every local school will feel the pain of the Liberal and National parties' savage budget cuts. Mr Chester: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member should refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his correct title. almost 1,800 jobs slashed in New South Wales and are gouging workers and students with an almost 10 per cent increase in TAFE fees and a whopping $1.7 billion in funding cuts. As I said, they are freezing funding to Catholic and independent schools in New South Wales. This again is a glimpse-a very important glimpse-of what it will mean to have the Libs and the Nats running our education system at the federal level. Mr Husic interjectingnow that the Libs and Nats are trying to blame one another. I have been roaming schools throughout my electorate in the past months doing Building the Education Revolution openings, and everywhere I find great, dedicated teachers trying to do great things for our local schoolkids. We should be supporting them collectively, not making their work even harder than it is. Gippsland Electorate: Gippsland Lakes and Catchments morning on activities within my electorate to protect and enhance the environment of the Gippsland Lakes. I have spoken several times about the importance of the Gippsland Lakes and its catchment areas in terms of the environmental, social, cultural and economic life of my region. I deliberately mention the word 'cultural' because there is a long Indigenous heritage associated with the Gippsland Lakes. They are very productive, with an abundance of bird, animal and fish life which supported Indigenous communities for thousands of years. The European heritage has continued in that vein, so we have very strong cultural links to the lake and river systems. However, I do remain critical of the federal government's attitude to the Gippsland Lakes. I am disappointed that these Ramsar listed wetlands do not receive the level of recognition they deserve by the current government. There is no ongoing funding for practical environmental works and no commitment to working in partnership with the state government, which is",150,Adjournment

227,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (10:51,"I appreciate the opportunity to update the House thisleading the way through the formation of the $10 million Gippsland Lakes Environmental Fund. For the benefit of the House, I want to provide a bit of background on that fund. It came about during the 2010 state election campaign, when I strongly supported the Nationals candidate, Tim Bull. As a fourth-generation East Gippslander with a family history steeped in the marine industry, Tim is as passionate about the Gippsland Lakes as I am. Together, we developed a policy to secure a state government funding commitment and it has led to the development of the environmental fund under the stewardship of the Gippsland Lakes Ministerial Advisory Committee. RecentlyI attended the launch of the committee, where its first eight projects were outlined. The projects include: $30,000 to evaluate the economic and community impact of the algal bloom; funding of $160,000 to support a range of care groups to enhance the biodiversity of the Gippsland Lakes; $137,000 for nutrient reduction in the upper Gippsland Lakes catchment; $120,000 for Latrobe Estuary and wetlands restoration; $150,000 for the meander restoration of the lower Latrobe River; $80,000 for engaging the Gippsland Lakes community; $44,000 for landholders' fencing and revegetating; and $126,000 for monitoring the environmental health of the Gippsland Lakes. That is a great start and I commend the committee on its work under the leadership of its chair, Dr Peter Veenker, and for the way it has undertaken its task. An outstanding committee of people has been assembled. They are passionate about the lakes and have direct local experience in diverse industries such as tourism, fishing, local government and some of the key state government agencies. I look forward to working very closely with this committee in the years ahead and doing everything in my power to help it secure federal funding to leverage off the substantial state government commitment that has been made. We all know it makes sense to combine our resources wherever possible to have all levels of government working closely with groups like Landcare and the Friends of the Gippsland Lakes to achieve practical environmental outcomes to safeguard this magnificent lake and river system for the enjoyment of future generations. As a local member of parliament, I am very keen to build ownership of the lakes within the community and to give local residents a chance to help protect the system. That is why I organised a community action day in 2010 and that is why I am planning another event, on 25 November this year. It is a chance for everyone who loves the magnificent Gippsland Lakes and cares about the future of the system and its rivers to join in and help make a difference. There is, unfortunately, a lot of rubbish which has been blown up by the wind or washed off streets or dropped from boats and collected by tides on the foreshore around the lake system. We will be targeting a few of the highly visited locations around the lakes-towns like Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Metung, Raymond Island and Eagle Point-and we will be hoping to do a clean-up along the banks of the Mitchell and Tambo rivers. As much as most locals and visitors care about the environment and do the right thing when they visit our waterways, there are some people who show a complete disregard for the environment. I have been appalled, quite frankly, by some of the rubbish that has been left behind by a small minority of recreational anglers who lack the intelligence to understand that damaging the environment will actually damage the resource that they have come to enjoy. I know we should not have to clean up after them, but these are irresponsible people and it is a fact of life that there is a mess left behind and it leaves a very poor impression when we are trying to attract visitors to our region and to showcase the beautiful environment of our rivers and lakes system. The community action day on 25 November this year will be a chance for everyone to show their support for the lakes. I will be inviting local people to nominate their own clean-up sites in the weeks leading up to the day, and those sites will be targeted by the volunteers that we assemble on the day. We will be encouraging people to register for the clean-up and we will be allocating some areas for them to work on. Hopefully, at the end of it all, we will have done a good job in cleaning up some of these high profile locations and we will also have a bit of fun at the end of it with a community barbeque. It should be an enjoyable day as well as a very productive day. The community action day will be an opportunity for people who love the lakes to help improve the environment through direct action. I am looking forward to working with my community in the weeks ahead to make sure it is a great success. Education Funding Ms HALL (Shortland-Government Whip) (10:56): I rise to join with my colleague the member for Hunter in expressing disgust at the New South Wales government's decision to withdraw funding for education in New South Wales. I also call on the member for Paterson to join us in our campaign to see that the New South Wales government reverses its decision and actually provides resources for education in New South Wales. The focus of the federal government, since being elected in 2007, has been on making education a priority, as Labor recognises that education is imperative and it is so important that all children can obtain a quality education. We have made an absolute commitment to making our great schools even better. The Prime Minister and the education minister commissioned the Gonski review and have committed to implementing the Gonski reforms. We are planning to build on the reforms and investments that we have made in schools with our national plan for schools. Better schools will give our children the best start in life, and that is why we want to put more teachers into the classroom, give principals more say in the way their schools are run, get better results for education and improve the information that parents get. It is all about education and making sure that we position our students so that they can enjoy a good quality of life. Education is the key to success. This is very different from the approach that the New South Wales government has adopted, and I am extremely disappointed. I hope that the state members in my area will speak out against the $1.7 billion that the Barry O'Farrell Liberal government is slashing from education. New South Wales government cuts to schools will put thousands of students at risk. This comes just after the government has confirmed its commitment to the national school plan. On the ground, this has a devastating impact. It is going to mean a cut of $116 million to TAFE and 1,800 jobs will be slashed. This will also lead to an increase in TAFE fees. TAFE fees will increase by 9.5 per cent and overall there will be a three per cent cut in education funding. This is a four-year funding freeze to all government and non-government schools. It is not going to impact on one sector over the other. I first learned of these changes when the director of schools from the Catholic Schools Office on the Central Coast contacted me and said that the New South Wales government was about to announce a cut of $24.5 million to Catholic schools. What that will mean in that diocese is 20 teachers will lose their jobs, there will be approximately 10 per cent in government cuts and it will lead to a steep rise in fees and the withdrawal of advertising and funding. It will also lead to planning for a Catholic high school on the Central Coast being put on hold, and it is very much needed in the northern part of the Ryan electorate. It is a heavy blow. It was unexpected. I have been told by people involved in Catholic education that the four-year freeze will mean they will be struggling to keep pace with increased costs, but they are going to try not to pass it on to the families. There will be cutbacks in services and planning and, as I just mentioned, the Lake Munmorah High School. It will lead to a lack of support for teachers. One of the most important issues is that this will lead to students with special needs not getting the services they need. These are heartless cuts and they cannot be allowed to continue. It is imperative that the New South Wales government reverse its decision and recognise the fact that education is imperative for every student.

We have been able, under the Howard government, to make many good gains in this area, including the deployment of a CCTV system in Mornington, which is something I was very pleased to partner with the local Mornington police crew in implementing many years ago. This then prompted Frankston City Council to see the value of this technology and embark on its own deployment strategy. I was very pleased that the Howard government and even this government, from funds recovered from the proceeds of crime, have been able to assist. We need to keep that work going. It is a very important tool to support the work of the local police. It is able to capture evidence that can be pursued and used for prosecution even if police are not right there on the spot at the time of an incident. It also adds to the sense and perception of community safety and it is a very wise investment in the Dunkley community. I also acknowledge the excellent work of my state parliamentary colleagues Neale Burgess, Geoff Shaw, Donna Bauer and David Morris who, through their advocacy, have seen a significant increase in not only the number of police officers in our reason but also the protective services crew that is now at Frankston Railway Station and set to be deployed more widely to those state coalition MPs in our region. I tip my hat to them; it is an excellent outcome they have achieved, and we have more officers on the way to the Dunkley community. Recently, at neighbourhood visits in Langwarrin and also at the recent Langwarrin community safety meeting, where I was represented by one of my staff members, some of the themes that we have been working on for some time continue to be uppermost in people's minds. Graffiti continues to be a misspent and misapplied use of creative talents, primarily",151,Adjournment
228,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11:01,"I rise to talk about something that has been a key issueamongst young people, that causes a great deal of concern as people see their neighbourhoods diminished by anything that is not nailed down-actually, most things that are nailed down tend to be a target, but at least some of the moving pieces and assets in the area have not been hit. Frankston City, to its credit, has a very proactive approach to tackling graffiti. There are contractors engaged by the council, a five-day limit on any graffiti that arises, and if there is offensive graffiti they seek a two-day turnaround time as the maximum period within which they seek to remove that graffiti. Residents are encouraged to call 000 if they say any kind of unlawful or antisocial behaviour-something the police keep reminding me of is the need to feed episodes of concern into the police database and their own management systems so that their patrols and the deployment of their officers can reflect what is going on in the community. My message to those in the Langwarrin community is that if you are seeing things that are criminal or antisocial, such as graffiti or vandalism or those kinds of things, please call 000, because that then registers that activity in the police's planning system and can influence where officers are deployed. We still have work to do. The CCTV technology supported by mobile cameras are good devices. Some of the battery life concerns have been overcome and these movement activated devices can be very helpful in law enforcement. For many years I have been working in partnership with Sharron Coburn and others at the local police station trying to establish a Neighbourhood Watch group in Langwarrin. There is lots of interest in it, but, when push comes to shove, we are not always able to get the committed volunteers that are necessary to be at the heart of an initiative like that. It is something I am still very keen on being involved with and it is something that the police are very supportive of, but we need the residents to see that this is of benefit to them, particularly in local community awareness about behaviours and information that can be fed into police planning. It has a very important role in addition to things like Adopt a Park, which is one of the other measures that we are contemplating. We have work still to do in this area. I know Frankston City. I have been working closely with Steve Dickson, the manager at Frankston City Council, for many years. He shares with me his plans of how we would like the network of CCTV technology rolled out. We have some previous commitments up in Seaford that I am revisiting to see whether that is still a relevant response. Mornington is going very well and there are other areas in the Dunkley community where this smart use of technology can support the excellent and dedicated work of our local police force, which has been very welcomely bolstered by the effective advocacy of local state members of parliament. It is a communitywide effort and I will continue to make my contribution as best as I am able. Education: Gonski Report Friday, 7 September, I was invited to Oberon High School in the Belmont suburb in my electorate to meet with the principal, Timothy McMahon, AEU representative Leanne Salisbury, and teaching and support staff. We came together to have morning tea and to recognise the government's response to the Gonski review. I was very pleased that the teachers at that school passed a motion applauding the federal government and urging the Victorian government to also commit to increasing funding for public schools.",154,Adjournment
229,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (11:06,"It was with a great deal of pleasure that lastOur local schools need a number of things to enable them to operate at peak performance. We need to see student centred teaching; we need principals to have the resources to enable them to be flexible; we need access to modern facilities and technologies in schools to enable them to be innovative in the way they go about teaching; and, to be perfectly frank, they need the financial support to enable them to succeed. The level of funding available to schools certainly makes a dramatic difference to the opportunities that those students have. In order to best educate local students, teachers need support and ongoing training, and they need to be able to learn how to use new technologies and new methods in the classroom. The Gonski review was the first real funding review that this country has undertaken since the Whitlam years. The Gonski review found that, in order for schools to excel, they need to have adequate funding to back up new programs targeted at their schools. The review suggested a new funding model whereby each school would have access to a base amount of funding per student and schools with particular needs would be supported with additional funding, particularly in recognition of students who have a disability or students who come from a low socio-economic background or perhaps students who come from homes where English is their second language. In total, the federal government has identified that governments collectively will need to put in an additional $6.5 billion to fully fund the new system. The new national plan for schools will deliver a brand-new funding mechanism for local schools from 2014. The plan will include new ways of funding every school to guarantee all of our schools get access to the money required to enable them to do a better job in the classroom. Additional funding will be available to drive up standards by providing teachers with the necessary time and opportunity to access additional skills to ensure that they are best placed to do their jobs. Under the local reforms local principals and school communities will have a greater say on issues such as hiring staff and controlling their local budgets. The debate around additional funding for local schools has only just begun. We will need to work in partnership with the states and territories to deliver this additional money, and we will need to work in partnership with Catholic and independent schools to ensure that they have at their disposal the resources to teach those communities. I take this opportunity to thank teachers at Oberon Secondary College and I look forward to continuing to work with them so that we have a fantastic education system. (Time expired) Leichhardt Electorate: Dr Edward Koch Foundation Prevention Week to highlight the work of a very worthwhile organisation in Cairns, the Dr Edward Koch Foundation. Since 1996 this non-profit organisation has been involved in many public health activities in Far North Queensland, but a focus I have been particularly supportive of is its role in suicide prevention. In Far North Queensland, since 2007, 40 people on average have taken their own life each year. Anecdotally, I understand this is higher than other regions with a similar population. I have closely followed two particularly sad cases that have occurred in recent times in Cairns. The first case was that of 20-year-old Shelby Fullalove, who committed suicide in February just three weeks after being discharged from the Cairns Base Hospital's mental health ward. On9 March local teenager Declan Crouch disappeared after school. After an extensive and very public three-month search the 13-yearold's body was found near his Machans Beach home.",155,Adjournment
230,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Chief Opposition Whip) (11:11): I rise in this SuicideFrom these tragic cases lessons must be learnt, and this is where the Dr Edward Koch Foundation, and in particular its CEO Dulcie Bird, has risen to the challenge. For some years, the foundation has presented its Life workshops throughout Far North Queensland giving people a set of basic skills to help them realise when someone is at risk of suicide and to know how to respond, along with information on referral services. After Cyclone Yasi, the workshop was held with a post-disaster well-being focus, addressing ongoing mental health needs. Dulcie Bird has told me the more she travels around doing this work the more she sees a pressing need for basic suicide awareness and prevention education in our schools. Speaking to parents of teenagers who have taken their own life and often to the victims' friends, they told her they were not aware of how serious the situation was or what they could have done to help. Sometimes a person who suicides has posted comments on Facebook or may have experienced cyberbullying. The foundation is now developing a version of its Life Workshop for teenagers. Complementing these activities, the foundation runs a free bereavement support service. In June the Dr Edward Koch Foundation hosted its second national Suicide and Selfharm Prevention Conference. I am very proud to have participated in both of those conferences, and they were an outstanding success. The foundation has also set up the Declan Crouch Fund. All money raised will go towards suicide prevention in Far North Queensland. No doubt, 40 deaths a year is 40 too many. Unfortunately it is very difficult to ensure accurate statistics from these cases due to the underreporting of suicide. In researching this speech, I found that figures are often unconfirmed for up to two years while coroners reports are in progress. Suicides are usually expressed as the number of individual cases rather than broken down into rates per region, ethnicity, gender or age, making it difficult to identify areas where suicide prevention activity should be focused. Lastly, the media guidelines mean that suicide-if covered at all-is often reported as nonsuspicious death. This contributes to the issue not being openly discussed. In this regard, I commend the Cairns Post for its extensive coverage of the deaths of both Shelby Fullalove and Declan Crouch, which has certainly helped to raise the awareness of this dreadful epidemic in our community. The really incredible and sad thing is that the foundation does not receive any ongoing Commonwealth funding for its activities but relies on occasional one-off grants, corporate sponsorships, donations and fundraising to raise money to try and continue to provide these services. For an organisation that is recognised around this country-and around the world-as a leader in suicide prevention, they are struggling to continue to offer their desperately needed services. I certainly call on the government to recognise the foundation's value and to provide an appropriate level of funding. In closing, I would like to refer to Dr Edward Koch himself, who, in 1880, stood alone in recognising the link between mosquitoes and malaria. Dr Koch was tireless in his efforts to have the local swampland cleared and drained. He was often seen doing the rounds of work gangs, appealing to them to wear long sleeves to avoid being bitten. The same level of perseverance and determination is required in the field of suicide prevention. It is the most worthwhile of causes and I again commend the work of the Dr Edward Koch Foundation. Active Travel for Sustainable Cities record my thanks to all the participants last night of the Active Travel for Sustainable Cities parliamentary dinner. I particularly want to say thank you to the Cycling Promotion FundPeter Bourke, who is their general manager, and also Stephen Hodge, who is a key player in that organisation in and around Canberra. I also want to make special mention of and thank David Epstein, who is the Vice-President of Corporate and Regulatory Affairs for Optus; Neil Trembath, who is the Chief People and Sustainability Officer for Ausenco; and Atsuhide Seguchi from Sekesui House, who, among many others-including many colleagues in this place-were at the dinner to hear about a very interesting, but a really topical debate around what more we can do in active transport. I think we are all familiar in this place about governments at all levels-local, state and federal-playing a role in active transport, in transport policy and development. There is also a significant role to be played by the corporate sector, and that was the theme last night. It was about talking to two fantastic large companies in Australia with global footprints about what they do in these particular areas. I want to briefly go through their stories. Ausenco is a large company that has somewhere in the order of 3,500 staff. Through some good work they did in wanting to look after their staff they realised that there was actually an economic as well as a social impact that they could have by re-doing some of their policy, particularly in terms of active transport. They decided to invest in their offices around the world, not just in Australia, and build facilities to help people commute to work-mostly by bike but some might also walk to work, run to work, or find other methods to get to work. They also built a gym, change and shower facilities, and looked at how they could better connect people with their organisation and be more a part of their community. You might think it is just a feel good thing that a large organisation like Ausenco might do, but in fact there was an enormous cost saving. Their annual staff turnover went from 10 per cent down to less than five per cent, which had an enormous cost saving base for them. It also meant that people were more productive, there was more encouragement for recommendations to work at the company, and they found that from two years ago when they first started the program and were 10 per cent short on staff, 250 people were not earning a single dollar for that company. They have managed to turn that around. As well as doing something for the broader environment and a broader social good, they also did something really great for their shareholders. They did it through some really simple things: providing shower facilities, encouraging their employees to be active, to be healthier and to do a whole range of things. They did it all without any assistance from any government, which is really commendable. Optus is a well-known telecommunications company, located in Macquarie Park, with 6,500 workers. They have a campus. They had to think about how to get people to and from their site. It is so big, particularly when they have a limit of just 2,000 car-parking spaces, so they embarked on a similar journey, asking: 'How do we encourage active transport? How do we get people to look after themselves and their health and get to work in a better condition?' They found that there was an enormous economic upturn through what that provided for the organisation. They worked with the local council in the area to provide cycling paths, to build infrastructure and to look at ways that they could contribute to the local community, by going down this path. Again, this was all done without any specific government incentive.",156,Adjournment

But the fact is that our tax system is currently skewed towards incentivising people to drive-to commute by using a vehicle-and I certainly believe, as many do, that we need to look at a broader way that active transport can be incentivised as well. These days we know a few more facts and details around evidence based research indicating how good this can be, not just for an organisation or for a country but for individual people. We know that inactivity, for example, is the leading cause of chronic disease right alongside smoking and is recognised as the major cause of disease in OECD countries. There is plenty of evidence in the area of health that points in that direction. But also, if you look at the congestion in cities, productivity and lifestyle, there are so many departmental and portfolio areas that active transport impact on that there is a more global view and a more global approach to the good that can be done. The simplest way, of course, is just to be a bit more conscious personally about being active. Find a better way to get yourself to work on a daily basis. We have great corporate leaders and great government that can do it. (Time expired) Superannuation Funds the union movement in the governance of superannuation funds, as a consequence of the so called 'equal representation model' introduced by the Hawke-Keating government, under which the boards of industry superannuation funds have a certain number of people appointed by unions. That is also the case in respect of public sector funds, such as, for example, the Energy Industries Superannuation Scheme and Local Government Super in New South Wales. These arrangements are very extensive. I recently looked at the arrangements across 64 public sector and industry funds, with a total of more than $300 billion under management. On my calculations there are more than 150 directors appointed by the unions, and there are a significant number of funds where the unions appoint at least half of the directors. It is also interesting to look at the number of unions that appoint the directors of multiple funds. The Super. The AWU appoints directors to AUST(Q), the Allied Unions Superannuation Trust of Queensland, to the AustSafe Superannuation Fund, to Club Super in Queensland, to Health Super Fund and to Local Super. The Australian Services Union appoints directors to CareSuper, to Equipsuper, to the Health Employees Superannuation Trust Australia-that is, the WA Local Government Superannuation Plan. In other words, the arrangements which were introduced by the Hawke-Keating government have led to the union movement having very extensive influence and control over the conduct of the superannuation sector. This is so, even though the percentage of employees across the workforce who are members of unions is now as low as 18 per cent, and in the private sector it is materially lower than that, around 12 per cent, I believe. When you do a basic calculation, if you assume an average fee per director of around $40,000, which is a reasonable number when you look at those funds which do disclose directors remuneration, you are getting the best part of $10 million a year going to directors who are union officials,",158,Adjournment
232,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (11:21,"I have spoken before in this place about the role ofin some cases to be kept by those directors personally and in other cases to be paid into the unions' coffers. There are a number of reasons to be very concerned about these arrangements. The first is that many of these officials are in a position where they face a conflict between their role as industrial advocates and their role as custodians of the retirement savings of the members of the fund. I have previously cited in speeches in this place and elsewhere TWUSUPER, which has some $2.6 billion under management, was very aggressive in its criticism of actions taken by Qantas management last year-actions which Qantas management said were necessary to improve the financial performance of the company. Members of that fund might reasonably ask how directors think about equity investments in Australian companies in the transport sector. I have also previously spoken about the Australian Workers Union and its involvement in effectively scuttling the proposed merger between Vision Super and Equipsuper in Victoria. There is a very long tale of small funds, which is another consequence, because the arrangements we have today effectively reflect the architecture of the union movement. It suits particular union officials to have an affiliated fund. This presumably explains why, for example, we have on the one hand the Australian Meat Industry Superannuation Trust and on the other hand the Meat Industry Employees' Superannuation Fund. We have the Health Industry Plan with net assets of some $612 million, which is different to HESTER. We have what I previously mentioned Aust(Q), the Allied Union Superannuation Trust, with net assets of only $193 million-in other words, a long tale of small funds. You also have the Transport Industry Superannuation Fund with net assets of $84 million and that is different to question arises as to whether the architecture of the arrangement of the funds suit the interests of union officials and the interests of members of the funds come a distant second. There are other issues about the basis on which transactions occur between funds and organisations where there are directors on both the selling organisation of the fund, and I will be pleased to speak about those on another occasion. Early Childhood Learning Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (11:26): As a parent of two young boys, I am a high user of early childhood centres. I remember with great fondness taking my then one-year-old to day care on the back of a bike. These days I tend to drop them off by car, but it is always a pleasure to go there and to see their great enthusiasm at arriving at the Acton Early Childhood Centre. It is a place where they not only have friends but also are learning. One of the great changes over the last couple of decades has been the broad recognition that early childhood is not babysitting; it is education. And high-quality childhood education is fundamental to the future of those individual children and collectively to the productivity and the social well-being of our society. I pay tribute to the hard working staff at the Acton Early Childhood Centre. The fact is that Labor has put record investment into early childhood. We are investing $22 billion dollars over the next four years-more than triple that of the former Liberal-National government. We have raised the childcare rebate to from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket costs and increased the cap from $4,354 per child per year under the coalition to $7½ thousand now. Despite this, the United Voice Big Steps campaign has pointed out, there are challenges with the low wages currently paid to workers in the early childhood sector. The Big Steps campaign estimates that 180 educators leave the sector every week due to low wages and conditions. I have been grateful for the passionate advocacy from United Voice workers Yvette Berry, Rebecca Garden and Verity Mays as well as centre directors, Catherine Konkoly and Timothy Toogood among them, who came to see me to speak about the importance of raising wages and qualifications. The two big challenges for the government in the early childhood space are to improve affordability and access as well as increase quality. The number of Australian children in childcare last financial year reached 1.3 million, an increase of 20 per cent over five years. As I have noted, the government has increased the share of the out-of-pocket costs borne by the federal taxpayer, but at the same time it is vital that we improve the wages and conditions in the sector. The Big Steps campaign calls on the federal government to improve funding for the early childhood sector so that the turnover decreases and we are able to ensure that the sector continues to attract and retain the very best educators. In a recent survey I did of childcare issues in my electorate of Fraser, I asked parents how happy they were with their child's care. Forty per cent said they were very happy and another 39 per cent said they were happy. Only 10 per cent were rather unhappy or very unhappy. There is a great big tick across the Fraser electorate for the great work being done by early childcare educators. I also asked parents how they received the childcare rebate and discovered that 11 per cent received it annually and 35 per cent received it quarterly. That means that only around half of all parents are receiving the childcare rebate in the two new ways that federal Labor has enabled them to receive it-paid either fortnightly or directly to the centre, perhaps the most convenient way of receiving the childcare rebate. Even more concerning are figures from Kate Ellis, the Minister for Early Childhood and Child Care, that 100,000 families across Australia and 1,400 families in the ACT are eligible for the childcare rebate but are not receiving it. I encourage all families to check whether they are eligible for the support and to consider whether they are receiving the childcare rebate in the way that most meets their needs. I also asked parents whether, if they used formal care, they would be willing to pay higher fees in order to increase the salaries of staff and reduce staff turnover. The question was evenly split: 55 per cent in favour, 45 per cent against. The work of early childhood educators is vital to Australia's future and I commend them for it. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Federation Chamber adjourned at 11:32 Post-polio Syndrome Clinics (Question No. 1133) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister for Health, in writing, on 14 August 2012: How is the Government responding to calls for post-polio syndrome clinics to be established within the Australian health network? Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I note the Discussion paper on the late effects of polio/post-polio syndrome prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, and its recommendations. I would like to acknowledge the work of the Committee in highlighting this important health issue. Recommendation 3 of the paper calls on Medicare Locals to engage with Polio Australia and other stakeholders to help raise awareness of the late effects of polio / post-polio syndrome. Medicare Locals are a nation-wide network of 61 primary health care organisations, and operate as health system planners at the regional level. They have primary responsibility for identifying the health care needs of their local populations, based on a comprehensive needs assessment process involving public and stakeholder consultation, and coordinating activities to address identified service gaps. Medicare Locals are also responsible for ensuring that primary health care works for the whole of the local community, including through addressing the needs of people affected by the late effects of polio/ post-polio syndrome. Community members, including post-polio syndrome patients, their families and their carers, are encouraged to engage with their Medicare Local to ensure that their specific health care needs can be better understood, and appropriately addressed, by the Medicare Local. The Medicare Local network is well placed to support clinicians, service providers and peak bodies in improving patient care. An example of how this can be achieved is through Medicare Locals supporting local primary health care providers to participate in continuing professional development activities. The Government urges peak stakeholder groups such as Polio Australia to engage with the Australian Medicare Local Alliance (AML Alliance), as the national body for Medicare Locals, to jointly consider options for how the Medicare Local network can help to address the impacts of the late effects of polio / post-polio syndrome, in collaboration with local primary health care service providers and practitioners.",159,Hesta To Legalsuper And To Vision Super As Well As To Sunsuper Superannuation Fund And
