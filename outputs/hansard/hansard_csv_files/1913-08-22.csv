0,"2&Ousr Of Hrprescntatibes. Friday, 22 August, 1913. A.m., And Read Prayers. Mr W. H . Irvine (Flinders","Attor ney-General) [10.31 a.m.]-An attack of a more or less personal character was made on me yesterday by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I should have left it unanswered had it been directed merely against my personal honour, but I understand that it was not; that the honourable member expressly disclaimed his intention of making an attack of that kind. The attack was made because, in his opinion, the acceptance of the directorship of a bank and the continuance of one of the general retainers which I hold create a conflict between my interest and my duty. I say, at the outset, that that opinion, if held by honourable members generally, would not be permitted by me to be used as a weapon against the Government. Should the House adopt the views at the basis of the honourable member's argument, I should immediately take steps to relieve my colleagues of any embarrassment that might thereby be caused to them. The subject is, therefore, of sufficient importance to warrant me in claiming the indulgence of the House for a few minutes, while I",12,Setup

Of course, I am not opposed to the making of a statement now. ber will have perfect freedom to say what he likes on the motion for the adjournment, why should he not be permitted to say it now? on the adjournment. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The honourable member for Kalgoorlie raised a question which I consider of great importance, and the assenting cheers with which his statements were received by members supporting him cannot be regarded as dictated by purely party motives. This is not a matter affecting merely a section of the .House, and some definite understanding should be arrived at in regard to it. Replying first to the charge that I did not return one of the general retainers that I hold-that from the Marconi CompanyI ask honourable members to consider what a retainer is. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie seems to think that the holding of a general retainer involves The a confidential relationship between the giver of the retainer and the counsel who is retained. Nothing is further from on the gag, of the truth. A general retainer does not entitle the person who gives it to consider the barrister as in any way bound to tender advice or to accept a brief from him. The barrister so retained may at any time, if there should be any reason whatever, public or private, which would embarrass him in accepting a brief from one who has given him a general retainer, decline it . It is a common thing, and it has happened more than once in my experience, I propose to for a barrister to hold general retainers from individuals or companies who are engaged in litigation between themselves. I have no obThat position is often inevitable. The fact that the giver of the first general retainer has the prior right to claim a barrister's services if he is in a position to give them does not require the barrister to hand back the general retainer to the other party in the case by whom he has been retained, because that party may desire to retain his services in other litiI shall proceed gation. A highly confidential relationship is established in another way. As soon as counsel is called into consultation with a client, whether on a retainer or a special retainer or without retainer, there is a relationship established of the highest degree of trust and confidence that can exist among men. The honourable member spoke of the code of honour among lawyers. Let me say that no profession, and no occupation demands from those who would be successful in it a higher standard of personal honour than is demanded of barristers. From the moment that he commences practice, the barrister learns-if he did not learn it he would not get very far-that he must keep absolutely good faith with the Bench, and with his clients, and the important information and secrets which come to his knowledge in the course of his practice he learns to separate entirely from the knowledge of which he may make use. scious lapse occasionally.

MrW . H . IRVINE it , too, in the quotation read by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The barrister who holds a general retainer has not the righ t to give it up unless for a good reason, but when any man takes office as a Minister of the Crown he must at once place himself in a position in which his duty and his interest cannot conflict. That is generally admitted. In accepting the position of AttorneyGeneralI felt it my duty to make a complete and absolute severance of my relations with the Marconi Companyi n its litigation with the Commonwealth. member would do that.

That is a case in which two Ministers of the Crown had become shareholders in a company WhilstI am anxious that the honourable member should have every latitude, I submit that he is going beyond the limits of a personal explanation in dealing with the Marconi Company. that when the Attorney-General first rose I understood that he was about to make a personal explanation, but when he in timated that his remarks would probably go somewhat further than a personal explanation, I took the precaution to ask whether it was the pleasure of the House that he be given leave to make a statement -That leave was granted. explanation. pointed out, leave to make a statement. have objected when leave was sought.

Leave was granted to the Attorney-General to make a statement, and in pursuance of the leave so granted he is making a statement to the House. No dissent was raised when leave was granted. H ad there been one voice raised in dissent at the time, the desired leave could not have been granted. Of course, and However, the Attorney-General has in vited a motion, and he now wants to be out of the trouble he has got into. MrW . H . IRVINE The facts of the I Marconi case in Great Britain are that two Ministers of the Crown, during the Reference was made to the currency, I think, of negotiations between the British Government and the Marconi Company for a large concession or contract, had become shareholders, not in the English company, but in another I rise to a point of order. company, whose fortunes would be necessarily largely affected by the fortunes of the English company. pany had a dominating interest in the English company. I would point out MrW . H . IRVINE I think that is so. The question was as to whether the American company's shares must necessarily have been affected by a successful contract made by the English company with the British Government. I do not wish, however, to enter into that point. Whilst the negotiations were pending, these two British Ministers had taken up shares in a company closely allied, at all events, with the British Company which was obtaining a large contract from No ; as I have just the Imperial Government. The most serious part of the charge, however, The honourable member should was not that fact, but that these Ministers when the contract was brought before Parliament had not",13,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The other ground of the attack made upon me is that I am a director of a banking institution. member leaves the point as to the Marconi Company, will he answer the position I raised as to what would happen in the event of his colleagues presenting to the Cabinet a proposition for a compromise. MrW . H . IRVINE the honourable member has reminded me of that point. He said that there might be a proposal for a compromise. I replied that I did not know whether there was or was not because the whole matter had been handed over by me, as I had pointed out previously, to the Minister of External Affairs. It is quite possible that the M in i ster of External Affairs may bring forward a proposal for a compromise between the Commonwealth, and the Marconi Company, and I should not feel the slightest embarrassment in voting upon such a proposal. What should embarrass me? I am now in no more relation to the Marconi Company than I am to any one of the number of persons who have given me general retainers. They are not clients of mine, and I owe them no duty save that I must give them notice before I accept a brief in an action against them. MrW . H . IRVINE -am free to devote my best judgment to the Commonwealth's interests in respect of any such compromise which may be brought before us, and I give the House the assurance that I shall do so. As to my position as the Director of a Bank, it was said that sometime or other it might be my duty as the Attorney-General to d r a f t banking legislation, and that . in drafting that legislationI do not know what its character might be or how far it would affect any particular bank-m y mining shares. duty and my interest would come into -conflict. How far are honourable members other point. opposite going to carry that proposition? to take the case of the Tariff. I have been for the last ten years or more of the exact position in a director of one of the leading insurance It was on that companies. It will be my duty, probably this session, to bring forward a B ill dealing with all insurance companies. In doing so I shall inform the House, as I do now, what my relation to this particular company is. Do honourable members say that a man who is a director of an insurance company cannot become a member of a Cabinet that may have to bring in an insurance B ill ? Let me carry the point a little further. I ask honourable members in dealing with this question to put aside, if they can for the moment, all party feeling, since it is a matter that affects all sides and all people. It affects honourable members on both sides who may or may not be directors of different institutions. The interest which a director of one of these institutions I am glad that holds is small compared with that of a large shareholder. The services of many persons are sought as directors of these associations or institutions, not because they are large shareholders, but because for various reasons, right or wrong, those who conduct them think they are desirable. In the case of the bank referred to I have nothing but a qualifying in terest. There are hundreds of people who, as shareholders, have large interests in banking companies, insurance societies, and trustee or other companies. Do honourable members say that in these cases a man may not become a Minister of the Crown-that he may not become a member of a Cabinet that will have to deal with these matters-unles s he first divests himself of his shares ? What is a man to do in such cases? Is he to withdraw all his interests from investment in this country and put them into British consols or T h a t is all. the stocks of some other country that canT h a t is a l l. I not possibly be affected by any legislation we may bring in ? Then, again, is a large land-owner not to take office because land-tax legislation may be introduced by the Government? Is he to strip himself of all his land before lie takes office, because he may be directly affected by legislation that may be brought down? Let me take still another case, and I ask honourable members opposite to give me their real attention while I do so. Mr W. H .

I desire to take advantage of the opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, upon your elevation to the high office which you now fill, and upon the action you have taken in restoring the mace to the table of this House. I have been an interested listener to the criticisms of honourable members opposite upon the attitude of the Government. I desire, first of all, to refer to the criticisms of Liberals by the honourable member for West -Sydney. Speaking of the manner in which we conduct our conferences the honourable gentleman maintained that conferences of Liberals are always held with closed doors, and that the press are excluded from them. I have personally attended five Liberal conferences since these conferences were initiated, and I am in a position to give the statement of the ex-Attorney-General a flat contradiction. As a matter of fact, when these conferences are being held the doors are left widely open, and we should be pleased to see every reporter in New South Wales present, because the greater the opportunities afforded them to disseminate our proposals and ideas the better pleased we shall always be. The honourable member for West Sydnay said, speaking of the Labour party, "" We conduct our business in the open."" Every one knows that it is impossible for any person who is not a member of the party to attend the Labour conferences held at Goulburn-street, in Sydney. The press are excluded, and everything is done in secret. The doors are closed and locked, and the blinds on the windows are sometimes pulled down. It is the practice to exclude the press generally, and the only press representative who is allowed access to the chamber in which the conference is held is the editor of the Sydney Worker. The honourable member for West Sydney saidAny man may come in and hear our conferences, but no man from outside the party has ever yet been allowed to attend a Liberal conference, and no report of a Liberal conference is ever published except that which is handed to the reporter. permit a representative of the Worker to attend one of their conferences? pleased, to see a representative of the Worker there. To show how fair newspapers supporting the Liberal side are, I may remind honourable, members that the honourable member for West Sydney has for some time been in the habit of writing a series of articles on ' The case 1 for Labour,"" which have appeared biweekly in the Sydney Daih/ Telegraph.

I suggest that the authorities controlling the Worker might pay our Attorney-General £4 per week to supply a series of articles on "" The case for Liberals,"" for publication in the Worker. I think thab if they did so the result would be beneficial to them, but I feel sure that the reply to my suggestion would show which political party is the more liberal. went on to sayWe, however, conduct our business in the open, because our movement, as it springs from the people, gathers strength from publicity. What has it to lose by giving publicity to its doings? Have we not gained everything that we have by that very publicity which our friends opposite shun? I should prefer to advocate the principles advocated by Dr. Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America. If my honourable friends opposite were well advised, they would take a lesson from these words of President Wilson, published in the World's WorkThe first necessity is to open the doors and let return of two of our candidates. We have in the light on all affairs which the people have the right to know about.

What the honourable member for West Sydney has said on this matter is an absolute misstatement of the facts. It is amusing to hear honourable members on the other side twit those on this side with being members of a "" fusion."" I should like to know which fusion is referred to, because, after all, there are two fusions in this House. We have been called a Fusionist party because Free Traders and Protectionists on this side have agreed to drop their fiscal differences to further the principles of Liberalism. On this ground, our friends opposite are equally Fusionists. I venture to say that they have done exactly the same thing. The ex-Attorney-General is one of the strongest Free Traders New South Wales ever had, whilst the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Andrew Fisher, is a strong Protectionist and the archpriest of Protection in Australia. would not say so if he heard the speeches of the honourable member for Wide Bay on the first Tariff. posite have dropped the fiscal issue, and are a huge Fusionist party. They repreThe ex-Attorney-General sent all kinds of Socialism, and included in their ranks are some of the Industrial Workers of the World. of the World do not believe in political action. opposite do. I think that honourable members on this side have every reason to be proud of their chief. On the 31st May last, the Opposition had a majority in this House of eleven, but we were returned with a majority of one. Our majority would have been three but for a couple of accidents which prevented the reason to be proud of our chief, because we have not only secured a majority in the House of Representatives, but our representatives in the Senate secured a majority of the votes of the electors of Australia. Eight hundred and sixty thousand votes were recorded for the Liberal senators, as against 840,000 for Labour senators. Although we have a minority of members in the Senate, the last election showed a majority of 20,000 votes in favour of the few senators who were returned on our side, and it is gratifying also to know that the referenda proposals of the late Government were turned down by a majority of about 8,000 of the electors. So that we have reason to be proud that we have secured a majority of votes for the House of Representatives, a majority of the votes cast for the Senate, and a majority against the Referendum proposals of the late Government. The occupants of the Treasury bench have every reason to be satisfied with their achievement at the election, and with what they have done since. Honourable members opposite have thrown down the gauntlet in asking us to resign our seats and go to the country. No doubt they would be very pleased if we would accept their challenge. But we are not considering our own individual interests. We are considering the in-",19,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

We require to make Australian conditions as attractive as possible to' immigrants. In leaving the control of this department in the Old Country to the High Commissioner, the Government are adopting a wise policy. I think, too, that it is wise to allow each State to look after its own immigrants upon their arrival here. Last SundayI had great pleasure in going out to the little seaside village of Manly, near Sydney, for the purpose of inspecting the Salvation Army Home there where the waifs and strays of that great city are collected. The Army has established two or three farms near Pittwater where these persons are taught the art of cultivating the soil. If when immigrants arrive here they cannot find immediate occupation, it would be a good plan to introduce them to similar homes, where they might be taught farming under Australian conditions. Then, when they had found their stride, they would be able to hold their own in the wide spaces of this country. I am a firm believer in the repeal of the Immigration Restriction Act so far as it is applicable to British subjects. I do not think that the restrictions imposed under that statute should apply to people of our own nationality.

Certainly there are no honourable members upon this side of the Chamber who are black or tan. During the course of this debate we have heard a good deal about the Electoral Act. I must certainly compliment the late Government upon having introduced and given effect to a system of absentee voting. It is a good system. It is not the system to which I object, but to the way in which it was carried out. We ought to make the facilities for voting as easy as possible; but in order to do away with what is alleged to have taken place at the last election, I would respectfully suggest that the Ministry should introduce a system of electors' rights. We had that system in operation in New South Wales, and it worked very satisfactorily. Underi t double voting is almost impossible. an elector's right for half-a-crown. his vote there is no fear of him parting with his elector's right. I would further suggest that every voter should be asked to endorse his elector's right. but effect cannot be given to it. vote, I was indeed shocked when that portion of the Electoral Act relating to it was repealed at the instance of the late Administration. Years ago I recollect hearing many members of the Labour party vigorously advocating the adoption of postal voting. Whilst speaking at Cobar the other day one of the Senate candidates for New South Wales said in effect, "" Of course we are going to do away with voting by post. It is no good to us. Do you not know that the Liberal party got a majority of from 10,000 to 12,000 by this system?"" I think that the real reason why the Labour party repealed the postal vote was because more advantage from its use accrued to the Liberal party than to themselves.

They informed me that they never had an opportunity to vote, because they could not go to a polling booth, seeing that they would have to ride about 40 miles each way. Why should a man be forced to ride that distance to record a vote when the trouble could be simply remedied by introducing the system of voting by post? introduced for. It was introduced for the convenience of persons who were sick. ballot? Why not have voting by post? bad system, and I am not objecting to it in the slightest degree. pleased to find that honourable members on the other side are in accord with me in this matter, and, therefore, an extract I am about to read from Hansard will be very gratifying to them. the ex-Prime Minister had to say on this important questionI am sorry to hear so many of my friends attacking tlie postal vote provisions of the Electoral Act. I regard those provisions as the necesof the entire population of the State. sary corollary to a universal franchise Because certain persons may have misused the privileges conferred by an Act of Parliament, -we ought not to deprive even one eligible voter of the opportunity to exercise the franchise. I am quite in accord with the sentiments then expressed by the ex-Prime Minister, and I hope that no obstruction will be offered by him when an important amendment of the electoral law is brought before the House. I think that the late Government are to be condemned on more grounds than one for the method in which they conducted the last elections, especially in respect to the issuing of the rolls. A t their instance Parliament enacted a provision under which, if a man did not enrol himself, he was liable to a fine of £2. hundreds of electors in New South Wales were unable to find out whether or not their names were enrolled. the Government. rolh were not printed. The writs were issued on the 24th A p r i l . I obtained a roll from Sydney on the 14th A p r i l , but many country post-offices had not received a roll on the 22nd A p r i l . the Government. Act a man is liable to a fine of £ 2 if he is not enrolled, but the late Government did not supply the electors with the means of finding out whether or not they were enrolled. On the other hand, if men speculated and had their names put on tlie roll, they were liable to be hauled before a court for the offence of roll stuffing, so that whether they had their names put on the roll or left them off, in the eyes of the late Government they would be guilty of committing a criminal act. In my opinion the late Government are not to be complimented upon the attitude they took up in that matter. There is another system which 1 have always advocated. As honourable members know, I represent I am very a rural constituency. I have always maintained that in order that Australia may progress as it ought to do, bigger representation should be given to country districts than is enjoyed by cities and This is what towns. In the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales there are forty-two members representing the city and fortyeight members . representing the country, whereas Sydney holds only 36 per cent, My honourable friends on the other side of the House profess to have great regard for British parliamentary traditions. I recommend to their consideration a method which the Old Country adopted years ago. Great Britain is a country which is f u l l y developed. When we come to consider how the representation of country in terests is dealt with there, we find that in the electorate of Romford, which is practically under the shadow of Parliament House, 49,000 electors return to Parliament one member, whereas across the water in Ireland the electorate of K i l kenny, with only 1,500 electors, returns one member. principle ? crat ?

We find the people of New South Wales, with 200,000 trade unionists, sending six representatives to the Hobart Conference, while the people of Tasmania, with 20,000 trade unionists, also send six representatives. you ? unionists enjoy equal representation at a Labour Conference with 200,000 unionists. in the Senate. the Labour party is concerned, but not as regards the country. Let us have a little more consistency in these matters from honourable members opposite. According to their view, if Kilkenny is entitled to one member, Romford should be entitled to thirty-two members, whereas each electorate is equally represented. Why was that system adopted ? Simply because the British Parliament knew that a city enjoys so many advantages. I want now to call the attention of the House to the electoral position in New South Wales. The electorate of Surry Hills, which comin the Northern Territory, at a salary of prises 170 acres, has one member, while the Cobar electorate, with 29,000,000 acres, has also only oue member. The people living in Surry Hills, Sydney, enjoy all the advantages given by civilization. They have tramways and railways; they can send their children to primary and secondary schools, and to the universities; the postman calls at their doors three or four times a day; and a candidate for Parliament could, from an elevated position, make himself heard by the whole constituency with the aid of a megaphone. Hills with a district like Cobar, in which ing up and clown outside his office on it would take three years to visit every elector, even travelling by motor-car. Those living in the interior are doing the ticket, but could not a more competent work of the country; they are its brawn, muscle, and sinew. large land-owners two, three, or four votes ? land-owners to whom I am referring, but the working people in the country. I would condemn any attempt made by a Government to give preference of any kind. The Prime Minister has pointed out that we all belong to one big union -the union of the States. Every person in the community, whether humble or great, contributes to the funds of that union, and should, have the same opportunities as his fellow members. Preference was given to an alarming degree by the Labour Government to those belonging to their party. During their three years of office they made 137 appointments to the Public Service, carrying an average salary of £550 a year. Those who enter the Public Service as youths, beginning at the lowest rung of the ladder, have the right to be permitted to climb to the highest position, but under the administration of the last Government, men who thought that they were about to reach the top found Labour adherents placed over their heads in lucrative posts. Take, for example, the appointment of the Land Commissioner of the Northern Territory, a gentleman named Ryland. I say nothing against him personally. He had occupied an important position in a trade union in Queensland, and was afterwards elected to the Queensland Parliament, but on his losing his seat the honourable member for Wide Bay found him a comfortable billet £800 a year. out on strike. the Northern Territory for a few months, a strike occurred, and he was called out. We then had the spectacle of the Commissioner of Lands acting as a picket outside the Lands Office. Persons who had gone to Port Darwin to obtain information regarding land in the Northern Territory, instead of learning what they wished Contrast Surry to know, found the Commissioner marchstrike. What were Mr Ryland's qualifications ? Certainly he had a union person have been found in the Public Service of Australia? Applications were called for, and, I believe, several were received, but five days after the date fixed for the receiving of applications Mr Ryland's application was received, and it was given priority over the others. invited ?",23,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

136,Mr Pigott,"We were told that i tthe Fisher Government compelled the banks to find £6,000,000 in gold in notes, thus making a difference of about £10,000,000 in the gold available to them. The banks had practically to find £10,000,000 in sovereigns, and to take notes in lieu of that money. amount, the £4,000,000, £6,000,000 in gold is to-day in the Treasury. Our friends of the Opposition w ill say, "" Of course, they had to find that money, but we were hitting at the banks."" In reality, however, they hit, not at the banks, but at the public who were dealing with those institutions. That is the point. Never before have I seen, money so scarce as it is at present. Today, it is a question, not of getting money at a cheap or a high rate, but of getting it at all . The system which the Labour party have inaugurated is rotten to the core. The note issue has a gold reserve of only 25 per cent. cord with right principles. in his standard work on political economy, says on this important questionI f by the general operations of commerce ten millions of pounds sterling of a known weight and fineness of bullion should be the portion of England, and ten millions of paper pounds were .substituted, no effect would be produced on the exchange; but if by the abuse of the power of issuing paper money, eleven millions of pounds should be employed in the circulation, the exchange would be g per cent against England; if twelve millions were employed, the exchange would be 16 per cent.; and if twenty millions, the exchange would be 50 per cent, against England. Putting our argument on that basis, we find that since we have a gold reserve of 25 per cent, in respect of a note issue of £10,000,000 in circulation, our exchange rate, in the eyes of the world, will have dropped to the extent of 75 per cent. of 41 per cent, to-day. it may be reduced to only 25 per cent. is 41 j>er cent. I can show that 'the exchanges of Australia w ill be at a discount of 59 per cent. We have the history of other countries to guide us in this matter. the Opposition said that we could issue these notes with perfect safety, since we would have behind them, as security, the whole of the resources of Australia. Doubtless the same argument was used by the French during the French Revolution, exchange for Commonwealth when they said, "" We would like to issue £170,000,000 of assignats. We have the right to do so, because these assignats will have behind them, 'as security, the whole of the wealth of the French Of that nation."" But what was the result? public were carrying Carlyle, in his History of the French Rewhile the balance of volution, tells us that these notes or assignats lost their original value to such an extent that for every one of the value of £100 in English money the purchasing value was reduced to something like 6d. or 8d. He tells the story of a gentleman who asked his cabman what his fare was, and received the reply, "" Two thousand livres,"" but it will be seen that the value of the 2,000 livres was reduced to about Is. Another man went into a cafe, and was told that the price of a cup of coffee would be 1,600 livres, or about £ 8 0 , showing a reduction of value to about 6d. The policy of the Labour party is much That does not acthe same as that advocated by the NaRicardo, tional Convention of France, which adopted a system of fixing the prices of wheat, butter, and almost every commodity produced in the country districts and consumed in Paris. The late Government not only introduced a note issue, but also promoted legislation on similar lines to those adopted in France just previous to the Revolution; and if the policy be persisted in here the results will no doubt be much the same. In regard to the Commonwealth Bank, the late Government were very singular in their appointment of a governor. No doubt Mr. Miller is a man of inestimable character, but there were twelve officers senior to him in the Bank of New South Wales. The manager of the latter institution, like the manager of the Bank of England and every other similar institution in the world, has an advisory board in the direc-' tors; but, in the case of the CommonB u t the law is t h a t wealth Bank, if we have not an ' ' autocrat at the breakfast table,"" we have one at The gold reserve to-day the banking table, with complete and absolute control.

In New South Wales there are the Closer Settlement Promotion Act and the Closer Settlement Act , and these Acts are administered with the aid of funds from the State institution. is absurd that one Government should compete against another; and the position presented is very much like that of a draper, for instance, who, having successf u l l y established himself in business on one side of the street, immediately opens a competing establishment on the other. In the country towns throughout the Commonwealth we see the State Savings Bank on one side of the road and the Commonwealth Savings Bank opposite, and the only result is the creation of about 10,000 more Government employees. The State Savings Banks are very ably conducted, as is shown in the fact that for every £100,000 deposited the cost of administration is only about 8s. per cent. the Commonwealth Savings Bank business. rested alike in the various institutions. My opponent at the elections told the people that the Commonwealth Bank was established in order to lend country residents money at a cheap rate, but I have heard since I came into this Chamber, from the honourable member for Eden Monaro, that no less a sum than £300,000 has been lent to the Metropolitan Board of Worksi n Melbourne at 4 per cent. lent to small, struggling farmers? that illustrates that point. A grazier in the Mudgee district applied to the Commonwealth Bank for an advance of £8,000 at 6 per cent, against security valued at £23,000. He was refused, but on going to Sydney he found a capitalist there who was prepared to lend him £10,000 on the same security at 5 per cent. Commonwealth Bank is prepared to lend money to bodies like the Metropolitan Board of Works at 4 per cent., and I suppose the same thing is going on in the other capitals of the Commonwealth. We were told that one reason for the Commonwealth note issue was that if a man happened to be travelling from State to State he had to pay exchange on his notes. There was, however, no such thing as exchange, but the stamp duty under State enactment, which might have been repealed. change charged on notes? It 6d., but the tax really represented stamp duty. They also said that if a person who took home a note for £ 1 0 0 had his house burnt down, and the note was burnt also, the bank would benefit to the extent of the £ 1 0 0 , but that is not the case. The banks were compelled in different States to pay a varying percentage on their note circulation. In some Statesi t was 2 per cent., and in other States3 per cent., and though that note was not in circulation, the State would benefit to the extent of 2 per cent, or 3 per cent. It is just as well to clear up these little difficulties, and show that the facts stated at the last general election did not square with the truth .

I say the legislation is rotten. did Sir George Dibbs have when he made the notes in New South Wales legal tender ? we would have no such remedy as that adopted by Sir George Dibbs. claimed by honourable members opposite that with the institution of the graduated land tax we should have any amount of cheap land in New South Wales, and that estates would be burst up, but I defy any honourable member to point out in my electorate, which is a farming constituency and a grazing constituency, one estate which has been cut up in consequence of the tax. speaking in my electorate during the last campaign, I challenged them to point out one instance. They could not, but they said there were some in the New England district. Then when the Liberal candidate in the New England district threw out the same challenge to them they said there were estates cut up in the Calare district. And so it was right through the piece. The tax has not achieved its purpose. abolishing the tax 1 party said that if we had a graduated land tax there would be any amount of settlement, and so they caught the vote of the unthinking farmer, who thought that by adopting this principle settlement would be advanced, but the tax has not brought about settlement, nor has it helped these people. Wales we had the Closer Settlement Act and the Closer Settlement Promotion Act . If three or four farmers desired to take up land held by a squatter, the Government and the purchaser and the vendor would come together and fix a price on the land to be paid to the vendor, and the Government would find the money, and sell the land to the purchasers at a low rate of interest on forty-years' terms. The graduated land tax has not found money for the purchase of land, and has not found the land, so I do not think it has carried out its purpose. Prime Minister, in his policy speech, at Maryborough, said there were 300,000 acres in Victoria and 150,000 acres in Queensland less cultivated last year, whicli does not look as if cultivation is going ahead as the result of the graduated land tax. I am taking Mr Fisher's last. Like honourable members opposite, I do occasionally read the Worker, bub ib is generally at election time. I think In the case of a panic Mr Fisher's figures a poor argument in favour of the graduated land tax. figures are correct? pared to make a statutory declaration to that effect before the honourable member for Bass-the justice of the peace of honourable gentlemen opposite. in the way you apply them. That is the acreage that should have been cultivated When Labour members were in proportion to what had previously been cultivated. said that the increased area cropped in the whole of the Commonwealth, when he came into power, taking the year 1911, was 1,000,000; but, to the end of 1912, the increase was only 200,000 acres. The total value of our primary products has decreased to the extent of £5,000,000. We seem to be going backward, and this, again, cannot be regarded as an argument you in favour of in favour of the land tax. I should like to direct the attention of the Government The Labour to the unfair manner in which valuations are made for the purpose of the land tax. The Federal check valuators have assessed values at from 50 to 75, and even 100 per cent, beyond local valuations. I am prepared to argue with my honourable friends opposite on this very important matter. I give them credit for being In New South fair men in dealing with many questions. I believe that they are always prepared to advocate the principles of justice, but it is not fair to be just only to men of their own class, and not to persons of other classes. When we find Federal valuators going through the country, and putting up the valuations of local governing bodies by 75 and 100 per cent., it seems clear that some system of valuation other than that at present in vogue should be adopted. I think that an equitable method of arriving at valuations for the purpose of Federal land taxation would be to adopt the values of the local governThe late ing authorities.

165,Mr Fenton,"There should be a unihonorable member, and I say that in this matter the valuations of the local governing authorities should be accepted. vary so much. ment, for the purpose of land tax, should adopt the local authorities' valuations of the land within each shire or local division. The local valuers, knowing the country, must necessarily know more about the valuation of the land within their respective districts than any person coming from Melbourne. Unfortunately, we have in Australia four different valuers of land. up by 86 per cent. I do not think First of all, the owner fixes the value, then we have the local authority or shire valuers, then the State Government valuers, and, finally, the Federal valuers. If I have a sovereign it has only one value, and why should land have four values differing from each other by 10, 75, and even 100 per cent. ? I have two or three concrete instances of varying valuations to put before the House, and I am prepared to mention names. I give the case of a property known as "" Grawlin,"" in the Forbes district, and owned by Mr Thomas Gordon. His valuation of it was 38s., the shire valuathere by the shire council in 1913 was tion 40s., and when the Federal land tax vainer went out to value it he put the value at 65s. This involved an increase in the taxation of over £70 a year, and the effect being retrospective, the owner of the land was called upon to pay the substantial sum of £219 additional taxation. I may inform honourable members that while the Federal valuer fixed the value of this land at £6 8s., the State Government, proposing to resume an adjoining property, "" Wandary,"" fixed its value at £4 2s. 6d., a difference of over £2 5s. 6d. member account for that? wanted to resume the adjoining property at a low price, and, on the other hand, it was to the interest of the Federal Government to put a high value on the land in order to increase the revenue from the land tax. I have before me another case of land owned by a gentleman living not far from where I reside. I refer to Mr be a move in the right direction. There Charles Young, of "" Hilltop,"" Garland. He had to send in a Federal land tax return, and he asked me to go over his property and make a valuation. I did so very carefully, and he added 25 per cent, to my valuation, because he thought the State Government would probably desire to resume the land, and he thought the extra 25 per cent, might be added to the valuation by way of insurance against resumption. The valuation return was £9,094, which represented 25 per cent, more than, in my judgment, the property was worth. The Federal valuer came out later and added £5,737 to that valuation, putting the value up by 63 per cent., which brought the property under a higher scale of the graduated land tax, and so put the rate of increase that that could have been the intention of the Act. I can give honourable members full particulars of this case. The Register number is 335. The notice was issued to Mr C. Young, "" Hilltop,"" Garland. The unimproved tenable value, as per "" original assessment,"" is stated at £9,094; and by addition on account of check valuation-£5,737 . I have given all the facts, and am prepared to show the papers to honourable members opposite if they desire to see them. I have another case which may be quoted from my own district. The valuation of a property £17,005. The owner valued the property at £22,087, and the Commonwealth check-valuer put the value up to £29,386, increasing the amount of taxation by £71 7s. 3d., and the rate of taxation by 76 per cent. Whatever may be our ideas on the subject of this method of taxation, honourable members on both sides can agree that we should be guided by the principles of bed-rock justice, and should give all people a fair deal. That is all that I advocate in this matter. I am thankful for the suggestion of one of my lionorable friends on the opposite side. I agree with him that a uniform system of valuation should be adopted. We require a uniform method of arriving at just valuations. In New Zealand there is a valuation bureau, which fixes the value of all property in the Dominion, whether for shire or State or for buying or selling purposes. The value so determined is always accepted. If we had a system of that sort in Australia, it would is one other point upon which I desire to touch, having reference to the absentee tax. I would urge the Government to repeal that impost. If they did, it would",28,Smith Ho W Much Gold Statement From The Worker Of 3rd A P R I L

170,Mr Pigott,"The State Government have a beneficial effect upon the finances nf this country. I am satisfied that the absentee tax has done great damage to Australian interests. It brings into the revenue of the Commonwealth about £20,000 a year. The British people have taxed themselves to the extent of something like £70,000,000 per annum to protect Australia and the outlying dominions. The great and noble British fleet rides supreme upon the seas. It serves to protect our interest in every quarter of the globe. What gratitude have we shown to the British people for what they have done for us? We turn round and tax them to the extent of £20,000 by this miserable absentee tax. I am satisfied that the effect of it has been tinctly novel character, and I cannot to drive capital out of the country. An eminent authority, Mr Williams, has written some articles on this subject, and he estimates that £57,000,000 of capital has been driven out of Australia during the last three years. Put the £20,000 which we derive from the absentee tax in one scale, and the £57,000,000 in the other. The £20,000 amounts to l^d. per head of the entire population of Australia. Buti t has had the effect of driving out £57,000,000, which amounts to £14 per head of the population. If any honourable member were to go to the dullest schoolboy in tlie city of Melbourne, and hold out to him in the one hand l^d., and in the other fourteen sovereigns, saying to him, "" Which hand will you have?"" he would clutch the £14 without any hesitation. But not so with the ex-Prime Minister of Australia. Put l£d. in one hand and £14 in the other, and he grabs the l j d . , and allows the £14 to go out of the country. They call themselves financiers, do they ? Yet there is the position. Although this absentee tax is a pinprick, it is insulting to our brothers across the seas, and should be repealed. We should hasten to place ourselves in a similar position to South Africa, Canada, and the other outlying dominions of this great Empire. Sitting suspended from 18.56 to %.15 p.m. -As one who has recently been elected to this House, I am naturally somewhat diffident, not to say a trifle nervous, in rising to make a few observations on the amendment which is now engaging our attention. I have always striven to fight my political battles fairly and cleanly, and I can assure my honourable friends upon the other side of the Chamber that they will always receive from me absolute justice and fair-minded consideration. A t the same time, I intend to uphold to the best of my ability the principles for which I stand, and I am satisfied that we might have proceeded with the business of the country much earlier than we can do now. As a new member, I was rather disappointed to find when Parliament met after the elections that a request should have been preferred by the Government for an adjournment for several weeks to enable them to prepare their policy. That policy is now before us, and I am sorry to say that it does not contain anything new. There is nothing in it of a disunderstand why the Ministry sought the adjournment, which .was readily granted to them. During that adjournment, the attitude which Ministers ought to adopt was discussed by the leading newspapers throughout the Commonwealth. Each journal appeared to be full of eagerness to place its own political views before the Government. As a matter of fact, the daily newspapers seemed to occupy the position of honorary advisers to the Ministry. They attempted to influence them to follow the lines which they desired them to follow. Whilst honourable members upon this side of the House have been accused of wasting time, the Ministerial manifesto, which is now before us, impresses me as being exactly what one honourable member has already described it, namely, "" a gauge of battle."" There is in it a definite statement, which clearly shows the dividing line between the two contending political parties, and I feel sure that if we could appeal to the people upon that issue, the result would not be in doubt. The Cook Government would, cease to exist. I must confess, to my surprise, that no mention is made in the Ministerial statement of policy of an intention to repeal the Federal land tax. During the last election campaign, the statement was made by many honourable members opposite that that tax was one which ought not to be imposed, and that it was wrong for the Commonwealth to invade what ought to be the exclusive domain of State taxation. However, this precious document does not contain a word in that direction, although honourable members opposite affirmed that Eliey were in favour of the repeal of the land tax.",29,Smith Ho W Much Gold Statement From The Worker Of 3rd A P R I L

I believe that that would be a step in the right direction. people of this country should be afforded an opportunity of initiating legislation, and that Parliament should, at all times, be, as far as possible, a direct reflex of the will of the electors. In view of the statements made by some of the present Ministers during the recent election campaign, I naturally looked in the Government memorandum for proposals to amend the Constitution in conformity with the opinions which they expressed during the last session of the last Parliament. Before Ministers had become well established in their offices, a very august gathering of representatives of the different Chambers of Commerce throughout Australia took place in Sydney. gentlemen asked for a uniform companies law. tracting from the Age, of 19th June, a copy of the resolution which was submitted by the Chairman of the ConferenceMr Bradden.

Sof a r as Commonwealth expenditure is concerned, Western Australia seems to be in an unfortunate position. Difficulties have arisen in the construction of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, and we have been in formed that a certain company in New South Wales is responsible for the nonsupply of trucks. If , as there should be, there are penalty clauses in the company's contract, they should be enforced at once, but I ask is it not possible to obtain from the Government of New South Wales waggons that would do what is needed ? I was for a number of years connected with tbe railway service, and know that there are usually many waggons available whicli, though not fit for main-line traffic, would serve for the construction of a new railway. the New South Wales authorities have not enough rolling-stock for their own need. Sir but no trucks, at Kalgoorlie. and sleepers stored up there, but no waggons to convey them along the route of the proposed line. I suggest the borrowing, not of new rolling-stock, but of old waggons. It is to the New South Wales Government that application should be made, because the railway gauge of that State is the same as that of the transcontinental line.

The point I wish to emphasize, however, is that the whole question of the alteration of the boundaries of the State electorates was fixed up at a Liberal Caucus meeting. that the whole question was discussed during the State elections, and that the Government responsible for the redistribution did not retain the confidence of the people. Dampier referred to the Electoral Act as being a bad one from beginning to end. It occurred to me that the honourable member might have been referring to the whole Act , or, perhaps, to only the amendments during last session. He was not clear on the point; but if he meant any the whole Act , then those who preceded us in this Parliament must have been T h a t ia exactly sadly lacking in common sense and the knowledge of affairs. The Electoral Act now in force is built on foundations laid as far back as 1902. There has been a great deal of debate on the question of preference to unionists. I believe that when men have given the best part of their lives to trade unionism, It is on these points and have devoted the whole of their time to it , and been consistent in their work, they are entitled to preference in their employment. As I have followed the debate, the whole question appears to hinge I am giving facts, oil two things-preferenc e granted by the President of the Arbitration Court, and The honourable memthe preference in reference to casual employment mentioned by lionorable members on this side of the House.

The honourable member for Dampier raised the question of Wages Boards, but I may explain to the House that the honourable member is no newcomer to political life, and I have taken more notice of his utterances than I would of another honourable member similarly situated to myself. The honourable member for Dampier supports Wages Boards to-day, but in 1902, when tlie Arbitration Act was amended in Western Australia, and the whole arbitration law was before the State Parliament, the honourable member was a member of the Administration that introduced the measure. stand the honourable member's position today with regard to Wages Boards. Much has been said concerning the sugar bounty and Excise. I frankly acknowledge I have had little opportunity to study the subject, but during the recent campaign I met a lady who knew a great deal about sugar, and, under her tuition , I learned much concerning it . To one who has simply heard the arguments for and against during this debate, it seems there has been a very serious blunder made. If only on the matters affecting our Naval policy and its administration, and affecting the sugar bounty and Excise, the gentlemen at present occupying the bench seem to have failed very much in their task. the blunder was in the Act itself 1 that an appeal to the people of Australia cannot be very long delayed. shall welcome an opportunity of going before the electors who sent me here. That is a statement. I have made repeatedly since the elections, and when my friends who are members of the Cabinet to-day decide that they shall go to the country, I am quite prepared to go also, and see whether the electors throughout Australia will not recognise the good work of the Fisher Administration, and see that they have a sufficient majority to place those at present in charge of affairs on the lef t hand of the Speaker, and the Labour party on the right. I think the debate, as far as it has gone, will serve to clear the atmosphere, and when the division is taken we will be able to proceed with business generally. It has been stated that the PrimeM in [17] ister's manifesto contains a lot of matter that means the repeal of the legislation previously passed by the Labour Government. Of course, it does refer to the repeal of certain legislation, but it was the fact that the previous Government piled up legislation of an objectionable character that compelled the present Government to bring down proposals for its repeal. I believe the previous Government put up a record for legislation. In their three years of office, they passed eighty-three measures. They boast of the fact that they put up a record, and as Australia is much inclined to put up records in connection with legislation, probably they are proud of their achievement. I have been looking through the list of achieve^ ments or supposed achievements, and J can find only three matters they tackled that might be regarded as requiring the qualities of statesmanship, and those three were handled in a way that showed their want of statesmanship. The first. I shall refer to is the note issue. I have always believed that the Government of a country should control the issue of its paper money, as they are in a position to know how far it is safe to permit paper money to take the place of gold in order to preTreasury serve the stability of the nation, for which they alone are responsible. My complaint against the late Administration in conyou not think nexion with the note issue is that in this young country, that is continually faced No . I consider with the necessity for the construction of public works, and constantly applying in I the money markets of the world for funds for that purpose, their note issue was based upon a lower gold reserve than is provided for in any other country in the world. We could not afford to make as experiment of that character. In a young country such as this, I believe it was necessary, in the interests of our national credit, to provide a higher gold reserve than would be deemed sufficient in the older countries of the world. I know of no other country in which the gold reserve for the paper currency is as low as 25 per cent. In Germany, they have the lowest reserve required in any country, with the exception of Australia, and, under Statute law, the minimum reserve there is 33 per cent., which means that considerably more than the minimum must be kept in order to prevent a violation of the law in the contingency of a",36,Smith Ho W Much Gold Statement From The Worker Of 3rd A P R I L

225,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [3.12],"sudden demand. Dealing with the banking system introduced by the last A d ministration, I believe that a Commonwealth Bank might have been established to perform great and important services for tbe Commonwealth. It should have been associated with the borrowing of the whole Commonwealth, and the conversion of the debts of the State, which this Parliament has a constitutional mandate to carry out. The late Government, in failing to make the conversion of the State debts an integral part and prominent feature of their banking scheme, displayed a. lack of the statesmanship necessary for the proper management of the finances of the country. and the conversion of the State debts formed the chief justification for bringing a Commonwealth Bank into existence, and these important matters were left out of their consideration of the question by the late Government. member admits that the bank had to be established. established to carry out those great purposes, and my objection to the present Commonwealth Bank is that it has not been established on proper lines. The Government should, first of all, have entered into negotiations with the State Governments. unti l the Commonwealth Bank was estab-. lished. Then the ex-Prime Minister came down with a proposal that the State Governments rightly regarded as an insult to them. The Commonwealth Bank was so established as to interfere with the operation of the splendid banking institutions established by the State Parliaments throughout the States. Finding that the Bank was not as successful as they anticipated, the Commonwealth Government came down with a proposal to the State Governments. I gave the ex-Minister of Home Affairs credit for displaying in the banking scheme which he proposed to the Commonwealth the only evidence of statesmanship that I have been able to discover on the other side in connection with their banking proposals. His proposal was that the States should be brought into association with the Commonwealth in the establishment of a banking institution, the Commonwealth Parliament being supreme in cases of differences of opinion with the Statesi n the management of the concern. If a banking scheme had been introduced on those lines, taking the States into partnership with the Commonwealth, I believe it would have been successful. I should not object to the Commonwealth having a predominating influence in the management of the bank on vital questions. In those circumstances we should have had the whole of the State Parliaments in association with this Parliament in dealing with the financial, problems which conf r o n t us. I venture to say that our financial problems would be much more easily handled under such a scheme than they Commonwealth borrowing are likely to be during the next decade under existing circumstances. member think that the State Righters would have been satisfied with such a scheme ? SMIT H The honourable given the opportunity to say whether they would be satisfied with ib or not, and the overtures should, in the first instance, It should have been have come to them from the Commonwealth Parliament. member know that in Sir George Turner's time the State Parliaments were against the proposal? it could be said that they were.

Sir George Turner's scheme the State Parliaments were to be asked to give over their railway properties as security. they should borrow through the Commonwealth, and they would not agree to that. scheme of ten years ago should not f u r nish a precedent for the action of this Parliament for all time. I remind honourable members again that this Parliament has not yet exercised its constitutional power to bring about a consolidation of the State debts. The Constitution gives this Parliament the power to take over the State debts, with power to compel the States to pay up any deficiency of interest on those debts; and in 1910 that constitutional power was extended to enable us to take over all the State debts up to date. member consolidate the State debts, and permit the State Parliaments to continue to borrow in London as much as they pleased ?",37,Smith Ho W Much Gold Statement From The Worker Of 3rd A P R I L

236,Mr Poynton,"Would the honorablethat represents a very serious objection, because I believe that if a Commonwealth bank were established in a proper and statesmanlike way, Australian consols on the London market would be so much more easily negotiated, and loans could be obtained by the Commonwealth on so much better terms than by the individual States that the various State Parliaments, in .the course of a little time, would find that it was to their interest and advantage to borrow through the Commonwealth. I did not, on rising, intend to refer at such length to ' this matter, bu t I have been drawn into the discussion of it . If the Commonwealth Bank had been established on the lines of a partnersbip between the Commonwealth and the States, it would have secured the confidence of the State Parliaments. They would have had no objection to do their business through what would be their own institution, and would offer less objection to the conversion of their debts through the Commonwealth Bank into Commonwealth stocks. is where the previous Administration lacked perception and statesmanship in dealing with a national question. Here was a magnificent opportunity for the Commonwealth and States to combine to form a great and powerful banking institution, which could deal with the conversion of the State debts, prevent overlapping of borrowing in the different States, secure a reduction of interest on loans, and deal with the whole of the financial business of both States and Commonwealth. Thati n itself would represent a considerable turnover to the bank, without going into every corner of the Commonwealth to compete with existing institutions which have been serving the public well. The Government have tackled another question. They propose to provide to some extent against sickness. that now. but if the honourable member were acquainted with the recent history of England, he would know that provision has been made there for a large number of people to receive the necessary assistance when they are sick. member make a scheme of that kind compulsory here ? [17]a make it far-reaching. This is one of the best planks in the platform of our party, and shows that the Government has some constructive ability. The maternity bonus passed by the last Government is costing the Commonwealth from £600,000 to £700,000 a year. If it had been made part of the scheme to provide for sickness, widowhood, and unemployment, probably the total expenditure from the Treasury would have been only a little over the amount that is now being paid out on account of one branch of incapacity. There was a want of statesmanship and of perspective in the policy of the late Government in this respect such as are necessary for the framing of laws to suit our complex sociological system. It has been claimed that the previous Government were responsible for carrying out the defence scheme. I do not wish to take away the credit that belongs to them in that regard, though the scheme was in itiated by the preceding Government. It was the Liberal Government of 1909 that This originated the defence scheme,' both with respect to naval policy and compulsory training. That scheme has upon it the impress of statesmanship, and I must give credit to both Governments for having carried it out as f a r as we have gone. There are several other questions to which I wish to allude, but perhaps it would be convenient to adjourn the debate at this time, and allow me to continue my speech on Tuesday.

It is a fee paid to a barrister in order that the person who pays it may receive notice from him of any contrary brief that he may get. A general retainer imposes no obligation upon the person who accepts it to do anything on behalf of the person who gives it , my advice and opinion to the Government of -except to notify him, should it be necessary, of the offer of a contrary brief. Tho honourable member for Kalgoorlie has spoken of serving two masters. A t the present time, I serve only one master, the Commonwealth, and am concerned only with the interests of the country. I am not concerned with the interests of the Marconi Company, and am under no obligation to that company, except to give it notice should a brief in an action against them be sent to me. Let me now inform the House of the facts of the case on which the Prime Minister spoke, on the occasion referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. There was no question of a general retainer then. The point was whether Mr Justice Isaacs, who was at the time Attorney-General, could, in accordance with his duty, tender advice, and give an opinion on a certain matter to the Government of South Australia. He was asked to, and did, give an opinion in connection with a matter which the present Prime Minister not unreasonably thought might embarrass him in the Commonwealth respecting the navigation problem which then existed. Mr Isaacs pointed out that, although lie was asked to give an opinion with regard navigation relations with the Commonwealth, he declined to do so; that he gave an opinion to the Government of South Australia with regard to its relations with Victoria, but not in respect to navigat i o n , for the reason that the giving of -such an opinion might embarrass him in forming an opinion, as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, on a matter brought into clear conflict between South Australia and the Commonwealth. I am .going to cite the language used by Mr Isaacs on that occasion, and to adopt it as justifying completely the position that I at present adopt. I refer honourable members to Hansard, ' vol. XXVI . , page .1376. .goorlie, in picking out certain sentences fro m the language used on that occasion by my honourable friend the PrimeM in ister, chose to omit entirely the statement of the case made by the only honourable member then present who knew the whole of the facts, the whole of the law, and the code of honour relating to these matters. Mr Isaacs saidI can have no justification for refusing to give South Australia unless I can offer them some fair recognised reason for that refusal. Buti f my position in regard to that State were to bring me ever so slightly, or by any possibility, into conflict with my duty as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, the State of South Australia would have to stand aside, so far as I was concerned. . . . Honourable members will recognise that it must be a strong feeling of duty that impels me to accept a retainer from South Australia in a case against Victoria, the State to which I belong. The position occupied by counsel at the Bar is a public one. He must not pick and choose his clients. When a client offers him a retainer, unless he has some fair and justifiable reason for refusing it , he is bound to give him his assistance as well as he can. In these circumstances, I was compelled to accept the retainer of the South Australian Government, and unless, as I say, the paramount duty that I owe to the Commonwealth is imperilled, or may be imperilledI shall go as far as that I have no right to reject that retainer, and do not intend to do so With regard to the position of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, I wish to repeat that if at any moment it appears to me possible that a question may bring me into conflict with my duty as Attorney-General, or if at any moment it appears to me possible that my opinions in the future, which I am bound to tender to the Government of the Commonwealth, dealing with the rights of may be adccted by anything I do with regard to the South Australian, or any other case, my duty as Attorney-General must prevail, and everything else will have to go. I repeat and adopt every word of that language, and have only to add that that to South Australia's position was accepted to the f u l l by every honourable member then present who is now sitting on the Opposition side of the House. wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was correct in saying that I objected to his making a statement this morning. I asked whether it was an attack or a personal explanation that he desired to make,, and he declined to give me an answer.

This retainer was offered to the present Attorney-General three or four years ago, and we are asked to say that, on becoming a member of this House, he ought to have declined the retainer, because some case might arise in which he was interested. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who was at that time studying law, ought surely to have learnt the first part of a barrister's duty, which is to look after his fee; but, apparently, he had not even grasped the meaning of a retainer. It would seem, however, that he did understand the position, for on looking at the division list I find that he voted on behalf of the present Attorney-General. member for Kalgoorlie has not given any only be decided on a motion directly reason why he has since changed his dealing with it . views, and, until he does so, he cannot expect us to believe that his action was in a non-party spirit altogether.. dictated by other than political motives; and, under the circumstances, he cannot of the discussion of a no-confidence amendbe regarded as sincere. Leader of the Opposition, when speaking on that occasion, saidHonorable members bait a Minister, and then,, if he will not do exactly what they want, they direct the whole strength of their forces against, him and the Ministry with which he is connected. What Government, and what Minister, would be worth supporting who would conciliate an Opposition which had pursued tactics of that kind ? They first use every parliamentary means. tohumiliate the Minister in the eyes of the House and of the public, and then, because he will not concede the points which they wish to gain, they take the most extreme course open to them. I do not know what view the other members of the Labour party take, but I trust that they hold the opinion in regard to this matter that I hold, and will vote against the amendment. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie so absolutely believed every word of that the deputy portion of the speech that he voted with the honourable member for Wide Bay. is unfortunate that this morning this matter was debated in a most controversial manner, when there was no opportunity to thoroughly discuss it .

The question immediately before us is an abstract one dealing with the rights and privileges, and the honour and integrity, of members of this House and of the Government, and our object is to safeguard the interests of Parliament. The question cannot be decided on a proposed amendment on the Address-in-Reply, but it can be decided as a matter of procedure. Honourable members on both sides may see fit by a certain by this Parliament and Government now and in the future. I think the issue is bigger than party. member for Werriwa has left the chamber. He quoted part of my remarks on this question; but there are other parts of my remarks just preceding which I wish to -quote, from page 1379 of Hansard of the 33rd August, 1905.. I remarked that the honourable member for North Sydney proposed not to vote for the motion. Hansard proceedswrong. North Sydney stated that he would not vote for the amendment. he thought the Attorney-General ought not to accept any more retainers. thought it would be an error of judgment on the part of the Attornev-General if he renewed his retainer. I also held the opinion that it would be a distinct error of judgment on the part of the Attorney-General if he renewed his retainer; and I wish to say now, the attack having been made in that way, that I said exactly then as I Bay now, that it is a matter that cannot be settled on a party issue. It was unfortunate it was raised this morning in the way it was, and I am sure the Attorney-General, when he thinks of it calmly, will regret that, on a question of privilege, he made a statement prejudicing the whole matter, and compelling the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to raise it again on the first opportunity. When an honourable member is attacked by a gentleman occupying the most prominent legal position in the Commonwealth, he must necessarily make some rejoinder. merely replying to an attack made on him yesterday. The Attorney-General addressed himself to this question for twenty-five minutes, and used the scimitar here and there in the nicest language, but in many oases with bitter thrusts at the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The Attorney General may not know it , but honourable members are aware of the ability of the Attorney-General to do this,, and there are ways of doing it without shouting very loudly. I do not think the matter can large majority to say that rest here, now that it has come on; but rules shall be observed it is bigger than party, and bigger than individual issues, and really concerns the House, and may only be finally decided The honourable as .a non-party question. My last wordB are that the Government cannot accuse the Opposition of being unduly partisan in this and other matters. I have been in the House since the first meeting of this Parliament, and I have never known such bitter and biting statements as have been made from the Government side this session. Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [4.25] -Prom what I have heard of my speech on the occasion referred to, I see no reason to withdraw the substance of the .argument used by me. I think it expressed the correct attitude. The distinction that I see between that matter and the present one is very plain. A t that time, the then Attorney-General was in the pay of the Government of South Australia with respect to the dispute over the Murray waters, and he had a brief from the South Australian Government, and received payment. pute between two States.",46,Marconi Company

General says that he is still getting a general retaining fee. nexion has been cut completely, so far as that litigation is concerned, which differentiates the present case from the one in question. On that occasion, honourable members now in Opposition agreed that the Attorney-.General could do anything he liked, because they all voted solidly with him. The ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was one of those who counted the division on that occasion, the honourable member for Barrier voted, and so did the honourable member for Kennedy, and everything was right as right could be then; but now everything is as wrong as wrong can be. that occasion 1 motion. The matter was only taken as one of censure by the then Attorney General; but I made it very clear that we were not anxious to attack the Government for it . We never thought of such a thing as want of confidence in submitting the motion. mark our sense of the conduct of the then Attorney-General in taking fees and in being actively engaged in connection with a matter concerning State Governments which might bring him into conflict with his own Government. That is a position that ought not to exist anywhere or at any time. I take the same view to-day. But the present Attorney-General has completely severed his connection with this litigation, and is, therefore, in an entirely different position from that of the At torney-General at that time.
