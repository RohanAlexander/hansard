As honourable members have had the Bill in their hands for a week, it is not necessary that I should go into the details of every one of its clauses. indicate where the provisions of this Bill differ from the provisions of the States laws dealing with the same branch of the subject. Sir WILLIAM LYNE States laws before me, but they are rather lengthy, and it would take some time to do what the honourable member suggests. can, however, say that I know of no instance in which the proposed law deviates very widely from the provisions existing in the States at the present time. cipal alteration is the federalization of the law.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE States laws differ from each other in some respects, and honourable members will understand that by this B ill it is proposed to apply uniform provisions to all of the States. miscellaneous provisions. Clause 75 deals with a matter of some importance, and under that clause special power is taken to require persons subject to quarantine to submit to vaccination. In clause 87 power is of course takeni to maSke by-laws. stringent by-laws are necessary to deal with some of the matters coming under a quarantine law, and the power taken to make regulations is necessarily wide, in order to render quarantine effective. Under the regulations to be provided the Commonwealth will have power to deal with any thing from oversea which is likely to convey to the Commonwealth diseases, some of which have already been mysteriously conveyed to Australia. For instance, it is supposed that rinderpest was introduced in some way from South Africa to the northern parts of Australia. Guinea now.

I have explained that there are not many alterations proposed by the B ill , but they are very important, and I recognise, as I have just said, that the States Parliaments may not be found in entire agreement with the States Premiers who desired that the subject of quarantine should be taken over by the Commonwealth.

106,Sir William Lyne,"As I informedlike the honourable member's own, that it does not take away any power, nor does it make the exercise of our power concurrent with that of the States, but that the Bill when passed will supersede the power under the States Acts. That, however, is a matter for legal minds, and I shall not attempt to argue it with legal members. The officers I have consulted in regard to the matter are the best I could consult, and doubtless, the debate on the second reading of the Bill will bring the question to a head, and we shall hear whether or not any State is dissatisfied on the point. If that should be found to be the case, the decision of the matter must be left to the High Court. [3.59] -The Minister of Trade and Customs, perhaps, does well to eschew the. legal difficulties with which a Bill of this kind bristles. It occurred to me that when we are considering a Bill of this description, the least we might expect is the presence of the Attorney-General in the Chamber. There are legal questions involved in this legislation, and matters which should perhaps be left to the Attorney-General rather than to the Minister in charge of it. personal experience of quarantine. honourable member had that experience, it is possible that he is not seized with all the legal difficulties which crop up -in this Wales the administration is in the Mines effort to assimilate the quarantine laws of the States, and to assume for this Parliament the function which undoubtedly it has of exercising the powers of quarantine over the whole of Australia. There can be no two opinions as to the wisdom of such legislation as this. The Constitution makes it clear thaf the functions dealt with in this Bill are left to this Parliament, and, in the exercise of this power, we shall take a step forward in connection with the exercise of Federal powers generally, which I hope will ultimately be for the good of the States concerned. quarantine affects Australia very nearly. For instance, we have here already diseases which, perhaps, would not have been introduced had there been an efficient quarantine for the whole of Australia. The utmost vigilance must be maintained in the future to prevent the introduction of new diseases. Every disease under the sun, it seems to me, will thrive in some part or other of Australia. dead. the genus. No doubt, we shall get to that disease by-and-by, and perhaps be bitten very badly with it if it makes its appearance in this Chamber. I have often said that a Tariff debate is another name for pandemonium. In the meantime, we are discussing the question of keeping out diseases of a character which may affect, more profoundly than even a Tariff question, the producing interests of Australia. As to the wisdom of our performing this function remitted to us by the Constitution, there can be no two opinions. I should like to point out also that very little is known about the kinds of disease to be found, at any rate; in some of the islands where there is no system of quarantine. Only the other day we were told by Dr. Ramsay Smith, of Adelaide, who has made a special study of this subject, that the dogs in New Caledonia have a disease which is quite unknown in Australia, or indeed in any other part of the world. It is peculiar to that island. It is a matter of the utmost consequence to Australia, with our large flocks and herds, that we should be careful as to the importation of even any new dog disease. Speaking of dogs reminds me that in New South Wales the administration of quarantine is centred in the Mines Department. I believe in some States it is administered by the Health Department, but in New South Department, and I had the privilege and responsibility attaching to it there for twelve months. During that time, a great difficulty cropped up about the question of importing dogs. I remember on one occasion receiving a deputation from some of the dog fanciers there, who were importing new breeds of dogs. They had a great grievance against the Minister for the time being-m y humble self-becaus e of the stringency of the quarantine in New South Wales. They pointed, for instance, to the State of Victoria, sayingI believe it was This matter of the case then, but I do not know if it is still so-that dogs imported to Victoria might go into private instead of general quarantine-that is to say that they might be quarantined at their homes. common sense or not, it did not suit our pastoralists. toria when the dogs accompany visitors-",23,Quarantine Bill Second Reading

I believe, for instance, that coursing dogs are allowed to go into private quarantine here, being quarantined at their homes. from another State in Australia, and not from oversea. of the quarantine of oversea importations. I remember I was almost on the eve of agreeing to a similar provision in New South Wales, but that our pastoralists and others interested in stock rose almost as one man, Health Department, morally prevented me from acceding to the wishes of those who desired to import dogs in the way suggested. The President of the Health Department informed me that there was a case on record of hydrophobia having developed in a dog seven months after it was imported. That was in a place where hydrophobia was not known before, and he pointed out the danger of lowering our quarantine barrier by ever so slight a degree. All this shows the danger of importing any of these diseases to a place like Australia, which is now happily free from them. Hydrophobia, for instance, has not made its appearance here, but I have no doubt that if ever it did so it would become at once very virulent in a climate like ours. All these considerations make the matter of the quarantining of animals and stock a very serious one for the States. duration of quarantine, it is the custom in some States to impose a period of six months, and in others only three or four months. The Franklin says that the period in Tasmania is four months. If there is one thing more than another that ought to be uniform in its law of the States comprising the Australian group. All this, of course, argues the wisdom of the Commonwealth taking over the matter of quarantine, but when it comes to a question of applying uniform provisions throughout Australia, there arise one or two considerations which seem to create difficulties. It is as to these that I should like to ask one or two questions, not merely from the Attorney-General, who I see is now present at the table, but from some of the other legal members of the House. I have already asked the Minister of Trade and Customs one of those questions, as to the scope of the exercise of I think my this power, and as to whether the power so exercised is to be of an exclusive or concurrent character. TheB ill takes very large powers indeed. It purposes to quarantine goods, animals, plants, and, in fact, diseases wherever found, and a. power of proclamation is taken to quarantine any possible source of infection even where disease has not already developed. This is a very wise provision, because prevention in some of these cases is very much better than cure. If , by the exercise of a strict and urgent quarantine, we can prevent diseases from gaining a foothold and spreading throughout the length and breadth of Australia, it will be one of tbe and backed, of course, by the wisest and best things we could do. But then comes the question whether this B ill is to take the place of the powers of the various States with regard to the quarantining of various sources of infection, particularly animals and plants. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It takes the power, but that , power may not be wholly exercised. sure that it ought not to be exercised. The sooner uniform Federal treatment can be applied to the question of quarantine and the prevention of the spread of disease the better for all concerned, and the better for the smooth working of the units of this great Commonwealth. What is happening to-day? ber desire to apply -a uniform Federal With regard to the quarantine law to diseases which originate in Australia, such as tick? takes power to deal with diseases which honourable member for exist in any part of Australia, and to prohibit the passage of frui t or plants or animals from one part of the Commonwealth to another, or from one part of a application it is the quarantine State to another part of the same State.

After we had done our digging there seemed to be more phylloxera than there was when we began.

I venture to say that to-day, in For consequence of that action, there is less phylloxera in New South Wales than there would have been had we continued to exterminate it by digging out the roots. In deed, the digging seemed only to stir the pest into greater activity. Suppose that each of the States has a common pest, and that it is doing its best to keep it under control. Where is the sense in one State, in a fit of righteousness, saying that it will not permit any f r u it to enter its territory from other States?

161,Mr Joseph Cook,"The more I seethere is to be smoothness of working between the Commonwealth and the States, to take steps to ascertain our powers before proceeding to legislate.' If we do not do so, we shall soon require a High Court consisting of fifty Justices to hear the appeals which will be made. I was amazed to learn to-day that numerically our Judges, Commonwealth and State, are monstrously out of proportion to our population, compared with the state of affairs which obtains in the United Kingdom. I hope that the Attorney-General will tell us whether it is contemplated that the States shall still be able to exercise their powers of quarantine and inspection in regard to live stock and vegetation; whether these powers are to continue to exist, notwithstanding the exercise by the Commonwealth of the general power of quarantine proposed to be taken by the Bill. The Constitution instructs the Parliament to take that power, and I think no one will demur to the wisdom of the step. The Government have done right in introducing the Bill, whose operation, I hope, will diminish the friction which is causing so much trouble. fold. I give my hearty support to the Bill. Its introduction has been .promised for several years past, and as long ago as 1904 I addressed this Chamber in advocacy of such a course. In that year a conference of the health authorities of the States was held in Melbourne. Some of the most distinguished medical men in Australia then assembled men like Dr. Ashburton Thompson, of New South Wales; Dr. Burnett Ham, of Queensland; Dr. Ramsay Smith, of South Australia; Dr. Elkington, of Tasmania; Dr. Gresswell, of Victoria; and Dr. Lovegrove, of Western' Australia. They recommended that the Commonwealth Government should proceed with the least possible delay to take over the administration of the quarantine laws, their grounds being fully set out on page 3 of their report of the 10th May, 1904. The Constitution was framed, and Federation entered into, to secure uniformity of regulations and Jaws on such matters as quarantine, both as regards the outside world and between the States. We shall understand the question a little more clearly if we keep in view the difference between quarantine and general health regulationsA Commonwealth law relating to quarantine will not necessarily interfere with the exercise by the States of their powers of legislation for the preservation of the health of their communities. do so. pair the power of the Parliaments and Governments of the States to make laws and regulations for the protection of the health of their peoples. We must also keep in view the difference between quarantine and the undoubted power of the States to impose, and to apply, inspection laws; to make inspections at their borders in order tc keep out diseased persons or goods. The power of the States to make laws for the preservation of the public health, and to exercise inspection within their own borders, will not be impaired or interfered with by the exercise by the Commonwealth of the power of Federal quarantine. The question arises, what is quarantine? The word is. referred to in clause 4 as having relation to measures for theexclusion, detention, segregation, isolation, protection, and disinfection of vessels, persons, goods, animals, or plants, and having as their object the prevention of the introduction or spread of diseases or pests affecting man, animals, or plants. In general terms, it covers measures for the walling-out of diseases, or the keeping; within specified areas diseased persons, goods, animals or plants which have obtained admission. In my opinion, the definitions of the Bill will not cause us to exceed the power given to us by the Constitution. We have a much greater power than is possessed by the United States Congress, by the reason of our right to make laws relating to quarantine as well as for the control of trade and commerce; but the very great, and indeed extraordinary, control which has been exercised by the Government of the United States in regard to the prevention of the introduction of diseases has never been successfully challenged. We have double-barrelled powers in reference to this matter; we can control trade and commerce with other countries and between the States, and we are expressly given power to legislate in respect to quarantine. Therefore, we have abundance of authority to legislate for the isolation of disease in a manner which will not in any way impair the efficiency of State action to the same end. Probably the fight in regard to the measure will be uipon such provisions as that of paragraph g of clause 13, whereby it",27,Quarantine Bill Second Reading

Of course, quarantine laws must cover all diseases. We could not possibly limit the class of diseases to which they should relate, because any disease may be -dangerous, and it may be advisable that the -quarantine laws shall extend to every possible form and development of disease, whether it be in animals, human beings or plants-in short, to every form of life. It would not be desirable to limit the character of the disease which should come within the scope of this Bill. The only point to be considered is whether the Federal authority, upon discovering any form of disease either in animal or plant life-say , in the county of Cumberland, New South Wales -shoul d be empowered to issue a proclamation walling-in that county for the purpose of preventing the spread of the disease, or whether, upon the other hand, it should be able to proclaim a quarantine area, say, in Victoria, such as the Braybrook district, where outbreaks of* anthrax frequently occur. In my opinion, this power of quarantine will be very ineffective and impotent unless the Federal authority is empowered to localize disease which may be discovered in any part of the Commonwealth. It might be difficult to trace the origin of any outbreak of disease in the Braybrook district or in the county of Cumberland to a foreign source, but, nevertheless, the probability would be that it had been imported, and any disease which, it is suspected, has been imported could, in my opinion, be tracked and "" walled-in "" by the Federal authority. I remember some years ago when small-pox first invaded Victoria. A patient arrived in Melbourne by steamer, and, before the local authorities could quarantine him, escaped to Bendigo, where the disease germinated. Subsequently, a quarantine area was proclaimed within the district of Bendigo. Assuming that that patient had crossed the Murray, why should not the Federal authority be at liberty to pursue him to any part of Australia, to proclaim a quarantine area there, and to prevent him from enjoying his liberty until he was free from disease? That is an illustration of the quarantine authority. I say that it should be universal throughout the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth authority cannot follow the disease wherever it may be found, it is possessed of a very ineffective power. That is how I understand paragraph g of this clause. The provision is a necessary and incidental part of the power of quarantine, and I cannot see how that power can be effective if the provision be rejected. Paragraph h provides thatThe Governor General may, by proclamationdeclare any part of the Commonwealth or a State in which a quarantinable disease or any disease or pest affecting animals or plants exists to be a quarantine area; It is quite possible that in the exercise of the power conferred by this Bill a conflict may arise in course of time between a State and the Federal authority. But, undoubtedly, in such a conflict the State authority and the State law will have to give way to the Federal authority and the Federal law. Commonwealth Government could "" l if t ' ' a quarantine which had been imposed by a State? could. If it could not, the quarantine law would be ineffective. The superior law must prevail over the inferior, and, in such circumstances, the State law would have no more potency than would a municipal by-law which was in conflict with a State Statute. But until a conflict between the Federal and the State law actually arose, the latter would be effective. Wherever there is a conflict in reference to quarantine only, the Commonwealth law must prevail, otherwise it is useless to launch upon this scheme of legislation. does the honourable and learned member give to "" quarantine "" as opposed to inspection ? the right of a State to appoint officers to watch its borders, and to see that no disease from without is introduced within those borders.

If the Federal authority had established a quarantine, it would take care to keep those persons who were quarantined within the proclaimed area. under this Bill have the right to quarantine any one State against another? that the Commonwealth may quarantine any particular area, whether it be within one State or two States. order. learned member think that that is a verylarge power to confer? is, and it is necessary to confer large powers in the interests of the public health, and in order to secure uniformity in the law and its administration. Another point may arise as to the control of FedeTal quarantine over vessels running exclusively between ports of the Commonwealth. But on the same principle, I apprehend, of the right to isolate, segregate, impound, "" wall in , "" and "" wall out "" disease, the Federal authority would extend to Inter-State ships and shipping as well as to ships and shipping from beyond the sea. There is no doubt that in course of time the little conflict which may arise between the States and the Commonwealth will be removed, and the whole of the laws of the Commonwealth and of the States will be smoothly administered. The States will refrain from trespassing upon what is undoubtedly the Commonwealth right of quarantine, while, on the other hand, the Commonwealth authorities will abstain from interfering with the local health laws of the States. I welcome this Bill, because it bears upon its face signs of great care and consideration having been devoted to its preparation. It is satisbeen very seriously neglected by some of factory to know that most of the leading medical authorities in the Commonwealth either have been consulted, or have had an opportunity of expressing an opinion in regard to its main provisions. I see no reason why there should be any duplication of staff or of machinery under the conjoint operation of the State health laws and the Federal quarantine laws. If we keep steadily in view that distinction, there will be no necessity for any such duplication. There will certainly be no duplication of experly administered. penses or of staff. Our main object should be to secure the services of a few of the best medical men in Australia to preside over this Departmenta first-class medical director, assisted, it may be, by a competent medical officer, together with the nucleus of a small Department required to carry out the ideas entertained by the honourable and learned member. that would be necessary under normal circumstances. Probably, in case of an epidemic of disease, we should require almost an army of inspectors to enforce Federal quarantine, but these epidemics within the States do not often occur. land there is a Health Officer at the present time. where would arise the necessity for the appointment of a new army of officers? The services of the present officials could be utilized for the purpose of ascertaining and reporting upon local outbreaks. It would be only when diseased persons or animals were actually quarantined or impounded within a proclaimed area that an increased staff would be necessary. Such cases, however, do not often arise, and it i.s to be hoped that their occurrence will not be frequent. If we have at our ports such a proper inspection as we should be able to secure under a Federal system, we shall be able to prevent the escape of diseased persons among the general mass of the population, and probably to prevent the introduction of diseased animals and goods. By an improved system of supervision at ports the outbreaks and epidemics which in the past have been the cause of so much expense, loss and disaster to Australia will be avoided. I particularly welcome those provisions of the Bill which relate to the quarantining of animals and plants, for I believe that this part of our sphere of health administration in times past has the States. know the difference between the terms "" inspection "" and "" quarantine "" as relating to insects and plants. cause a wholesale spreading of disease if we are not very careful. that is likely to occur if the law be pro-",29,Quarantine Bill Second Reading

Sir JOHN QUICK the honourable member is somewhat concerned about the present conflict of State regulations in reference to the frui t fly. part of the general question. Sir JOHN QUICK the question that has considerably agitated the representatives of South Australia. I think that under this B i ll the Federal authority will have power to proclaim areas within which the frui t fly at present exists, and to prevent the removal of diseased frui t from those areas to clean ones. Would the honourable member object to that being done? It would be unreasonable to object. The great object of our quarantine law will be, as far.as possible, to localise disease. people interested with that object in viewto work with the Government. list the sympathies of those likely to be affected or injured by a disease, we cannot hope to succeed. If a i l to see why the various States Departments of Agriculture should not co-operate in such a scheme as this or in the administration of (States laws and regulations to prevent the spread of the fruit fly. South Australia has a perfect right to pass laws with respect to inspection, and the regulations now being enforced in that State with the object of shutting out the f r u it fly are quite justified. The Victorian Minister of Agriculture is merely following on tlie same lines. Every State has a perfect right to endeavour to protect itself, and to prevent, by the passing of inspection laws, the introduction of disease. Honourable members will now understand what I mean when I speak of inspection laws. The right of inspection means the right of every State to inspect goods, wares, merchandise, and people at its ports or on its frontiers for the purpose of excluding disease. Bill take that power from the States? Sir WILLIAM LYNE Sir JOHN QUICK away from the States the power to pass overlapping of the power of inspection, so legitimate inspection laws.

This Parliament probably has a right under the Constitution to set aside inspection laws which it considers are not the bond fide exercise of the powers of inspection and exclusion. learn why it is necessary for a State to charge three or four times the amount requisite to cover the expenses of inspection. charges were excessive might show that they did not represent the bond fide exercise of the right of inspection. I do not think that inspection charges should exceed what is a fair and reasonable amount. If the charge for inspection is excessive, it is within the power of this Parliament to set aside the inspection law under which it is made. It will thus be seen that we have a check over anything like an abuse of the power of inspection. roughly much expense must be incurred. may be difficult in some cases to say where inspection ends and discrimination and prohibition begin; but I do not think it would be right to interfere with that principle of self-protection and self-preservation which the Constitution has rightly reserved to each of the States.

There should be no attempt to invade the sphere of State legislation and State administration with reference to the general question of public health. I have looked through the B ill , and see in it nothing that could be said to amount to an invasion of States rights. On the contrary, I think it will rather supplement, reinforce, and assist the States in the administration of their public health laws. I hope that no attempt will be made to excite the cry of "" States rights ""a cry to which we are too much addicted-and I do not think that even Mr Carruthers will find in this B ill anything to provide work for the legal gentleman whom he intends to appoint to i nspect Federal measures. hope that it will secure the favorable consideration and attention of the House, and that it will be passed without any unnecessary delay. It seems to me that the B ill is more comprehensive than some honourable members appear to imagine. If a i l to recognise the distinction which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has sought to draw between the right of inspection and the right to quarantine. be served if a State, on exercising its right of inspection, detects a disease, but has no power to prevent its spread? If the Federal law removed all right of quarantine as between two States, what would be the position of a Statei f , as the result of the exercise of its powers of inspection, it found disease in stock or plants proposed to be introduced into its territory? not provide for a particular class of inspection, and the State law does, I think the State law will be all right. MrM c WILLIAMS connection with the disease of pleuro, I have for a long time been an advocate of lightening the quarantine regulations in Tasmania against stock from the mainland, in regard to which the period is four months. Sir ridiculous. MrM c WILLIAMS The Minister may say that the regulation is ridiculous; but I know' of cases which, but for the regulation, would have resulted in pleuro being spread broadcast throughout the herds of Tasmania. Although in favour of reducing the existing period of quarantine in Tasmania, I am of opinion that it is very necessary for the protection of stock that there should be some general system of inspection. Sof a r as I can see, no such provision is made under the B ill . member desire to leave it in the power of the State of Tasmania to continue the quarantine of four months? MrM c WILLIAMS I do not; but if we remove the protection which Tasmania has at the present time, it will be our bounden duty to give some equivalent protection, so far as the introduction of disease is concerned. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No doubt that w ill be done; the B ill simply takes power to do so. Mir. M c WILLIAMS I agree with the I , therefore, Bill in so f a r as it is necessary to federalize the laws dealing with trade from outside. There should be perfectly uniform quarantine regulations, so f a r as disease and all parasites are concerned. It is very desirable that there should be uniformity as between the States. As one honourable member has pointed out, the Government of Western Australia, under the shallow pretence of inspection, has imposed a. duty which is almost prohibitive; at any rate, it is^. stiff protective duty. For inWhat purpose will stance, the cost of the inspection of f r u it from other States is, in Western Australia, morethan double the cost of packing the fruit in the State of origin. the duty. ' but it is more difficult to detect disease in a few apples than to pack a case. If the Federal law does the inspection charges amount to more than would a duty. MrM c WILLIAMS I have no hesitaF o r instance, in tion in saying that the inspection charges in Western Australia, whatever their object may be, have the absolute effect of astiff protective duty against the rest of Australia. MrM c WILLIAMS I believe the codlin moth, has been in Western Australia for some years.

MrM c WILLIAMS however, we think that some system of inspection is necessary. If the power conferred by the Bill takes from the local authorities their complete control of the quarantine existing in different districts, it will have a fatal effect. In the f r u it districts of Tasmania men have staked all they have in the world in the industry, and the restrictions which they have imposed, not against outsiders, but against themselves, are distinctly severe. For instance, if a man takes a case of apples to a packing shed he must, before he takes the case out again, dip it into water which is kept at boiling point .throughout the season; and that is a restriction which the Fruit Board have themselves imposed. again, if a person does not keep his orchard in proper condition-if it is not sprayed and kept clear of parasites-the local authorities have power to send a man in to do the necessary work, and charge the owner with the cost. Such work, in my opinion, is infinitely better done by the local authorities, who know all about the conditions, than it can possibly be done by a central authority, who know nothing about the conditions. gard to Western Australia. MrM c WILLIAMS in Western Australia is carried out with a view to prevent the introduction of disease, not one word can be said against the policy. If there is one duty which a State owes to itself, it is to prevent the introduction of disease which may spread ruin amongst hundreds and thousands of people. If , in South Australia, it is found absolute! v essential, in the interests of the producers, to pass restrictive laws, or even prohibitory laws, with the honest intention to prevent the introduction of terrible diseases, the authorities there have a perfect right to take that step. ' In my opinion, the whole effect of the B ill will be to take from the States and the local authorities that power which at present they exercise so well, and which they have found necessary for the protection of the industry. There is much good in the B ill ; and, of course, I know it will go into Committee, though, I understand, not to-day. After hearing the explanation of the Minister, I wired to some people in Tasmania, who have not recognised the drastic provisions of some clauses in the B ill , so far as concerns the entire superseding of the local authorities. In Tasmania, effect of the Bill in this connection is f u l l y recognised. bers have not realized up' to the present, I think, the enormous extent to which the B i ll proposes to deprive the local authorities of their power of self-protection, and to vest the whole authority in the Commonwealth Government. I hope that every consideration will be given to the clauses of the B ill in Committee. I shall offer no objection to the Bill being taken to that stage; but I should like honourable members todirect their attention particularly to those clauses which seek to deprive the State and the local bodies of what I thinik is a very Then, necessary power of self-protection. In Committee I shall test the House on my desire to preserve to local bodies their existing right of self-protection. I am quite sure that every honourable member will vote for this measure, because it is a step in the right direction-the .direction of Federation. The Federal Conventionthought fit to enumerate under the particular section of the Constitution, in which the word ""quarantine"" occurs, the branches of the law which the people of Australia desire to have assimilated; and, If the inspection providing that, the provisions of the B i ll are legally justifiable, there can be-no objection to the assimilation of the quarantine laws throughout the Commonwealth. I take it that the people desired in regard to this subject to obliterate the divisions which exist between the States, and, in future, to administer those branches of the law, including quarantine laws, from one instead of from six administrative centres, seeing that the latter system multiplies the administrative_ machinery, and adds to the expense which is necessitated by maintaining so many heads of Departments. There was the same desire in regard to Defence and many other branches of administration, which, during the discussions on Federation, it was deemed desirable to concentrate, as if we were unified. That, I take it , was the primary object of Federation, and quarantine is only a small branch of the administration which it is deemed advisable to centralize.",32,Williamlyne T H E Regulation Is The Codlin Moth

213,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes) [4.58],"Now, we have to take very great care that, in attempting to assimilate our laws on any particular subject, we do not go beyond the powers which have been conferred upon this Parliament by the Constitution. The word "" quarantine"" is one which has a popular meaning, but it is a word which, I think, has a technical meaning far different from that which is occasionally given to it by the general public. word ""quarantine"" is tlie point upon which the legality of this measure must turn. I think the public may have come to regard quarantine as indicating a very broad subject, dealing with the right of a State to regulate the movements of human diseases, animal diseases, and plant diseases. have formed from looking up a number of technical definitions is that the word quarantine possibly does not extend in its technical application to animals, and certainly not to plants. perhaps, of no consequence with regard to the power of the Federal Parliament to make such laws; but every honourable member will recognise that by-and-by if the question of the power of the Federal Parliament to make laws upon this subject should ever be discussed and questioned, an appeal to the High Court would turn upon the technical definition of the word ""quarantine."" I can see very vividly counsel on both sides bringing into Court* as is the common practice when a question of this sort arises, definitions from all the well-known dictionaries, and all the well-known scientific works. I have taken the trouble to look up four or five of the. best known dictionary definitions of the word, because the whole question of the power of the Federal Parliament to put this Bill upon the statute-book turns upon the meaning which it is going to apply to that word "" quarantine,"" and upon the meaning which the ultimate Court of Appeal will apply to that word. I may say at once that in not one of the definitions which I find in the accepted dictionaries is there any reference whatever to animals or to plants, the reference being confined to human diseases. I find in Ogilvie the oldest definition which seems to have been applied to the word. It defines it as followsThe period, originally of forty days, now of variable length, during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of being_ infected with a malignant infectious disease is compelled to forbear all intercourse with the shore; also the into this Bill a number of clauses and subplace where infected or prohibited vessels are stationed Mr Bruce Smith. That is from a work which is recognised as being one of the most scholarly of its kind in the English language. be introduced by the instrumentality of animals. and if quarantine is understood as including the possibility of infection to The human beings from animals, the question may still arise as to whether the word really covers all that is required. been, introduced through rats. had plague from rats.

Mr W. H . IRVINE -What I mean is that a wider definition may be given to the word in America member may be quite right in that. It is important that the Minister should pay attention to this point, because, as I said before, the question whether this measure is ultra, vires may turn upon the definition which the highest Court to which such questions can be brought puts upon the , word quarantine. The only word upon this subject used in-the well-known section of the Constitution dealing with the matter, is the word ""quarantine"" itself; and if honourable members will turn to section 109 they will find that it is there provided thatWhen a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. Now, we are placed in this position : .that we in this Parliament can only invalidate States laws so far as they apply to quarantine as it will be interpreted by the High Court.

Paragraphs h and i are very much in the same direction. Now, what I wish to point out to the House is that this B ill , rightly or wronglyI do' not want to press the argument too much one way or the other, but I want the House to understand where we are-assume s that quarantine, and the giving of jurisdiction over quarantine matters, will authorize the Federal Parliament to deal with matters now entirely and exclusively within the control of the States-that the Commonwealth will be able to take over the whole question of the inspection of vines and other vegetable growths, and to regulate them as the States are now doing. Buti f the definitions of quarantine that I have been able to refer to are right, I venture the opinion for what it is worth, that it was never intended-whe n I say it was never intended, I mean that it is not intended as expressed by a technical reading of the Constitution, whatever the members of the Convention may have wished and intended in their own minds-that the Commonwealth Parliament should usurp the functions of the States so far as they deal with matters that the Constitution leaves within their own province.

229,Mr Bruce Smith,"I should likemight have read to us the opinions he had obtained to show how the difficulties to 1 which I have referred are to be got over. Because, as the honourable gentleman must be aware, if this question ever comes up on appeal, the definitions of ""quarantine"" will be put before the Court to show whether or not this Parliament has been invested under that word in the Constitution with the power to interfere with the States laws in matters exclusively within their proprimatur of the Commonwealth Governvince in regard to animals and plants. for a moment to another aspect of the Bill, and that is the probable cost involved. I understood from the Minister that, so far as he can anticipate, the cost of administering quarantine from -a Federal administrative same as it costs the States at the present time. In making an estimate of the probable cost, the honourable gentleman has added, and I think very properly, an amount for interest at 3 per cent, upon the capital value of the assets which the Commonwealth will have to take over from the States. I shall be very much disappointed if , when the Bill comes to be administered, there is not really a saving shown, because one of the advantages of Federation which all its advocates put before the public was that by centralizing administration we should save administrative expenses. If we, by administering six Departments as one, make no saving in administrative expense, I fail to see what benefit will be gained by administration from one centre rather than from, six, in view tion is not respected as essential; and if of the fact that we should probably secure more detailed inspection at each with an administration from six centres than we should by administration from one. I anticipate that the Minister has not sufficiently worked out, as indeed he could not have done, the details, to enable him to say whether the Bill will actually lead to a saving of expense. I desire to say that I think we have a right to anticipate some important advantages from the operation of this measure. Honourable members are aware of the difficulties which have arisen from time to time in Australia in connection with quarantine. They will recollect that ships and large numbers of the public travelling in them have frequently been detained, in Western Australia, as well as elsewhere, for quarantine purposes, and that after the authorities of that particular State had been satisfied they have been again detained. at great inconvenience and expense, when they have reached South Australia, again at Melbourne, and for a fourth time at Sydney. It seems to me that one of the chief advantages of this Bill will be that Australia will be regarded as a whole instead of as six different States, and that when once the quarantine authorities have at Western Australia cleared the ship and discharged her from quarantine, she will bear the imment as a clean ship, and will then be at I stated so.' liberty to continue her voyage to each of the other States without any further detention or inspection. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Unless something suspicious occurs in the meantime. there might be some fresh developments point will be about the which would necessitate further inspection. The advantage to be gained in this way under clause 42 will be appreciated not only by the ship-owner, but by the freightpayer and the travelling public. We know that men of business and in important posts have sometimes been detained at a quarantine station for weeks even though they mav previously have been similarly detained in another State. The question of vaccination has been referred to, and I have not had time to give sufficient study to the details of the Bill to enable me to say how the measure will operate, in view of the fact that whilst in Victoria vaccination is regarded as a matter of such moment that people are prosecuted for not having their children vaccinated before they reach a certain age, in New South Wales compulsory vaccinalaws ever existed to provide for it they have become a dead-letter. more small-pox in New South Wales than there is in Victoria.. Wales are more susceptible to small-pox than are natives of Victoria. member for Laanecoorie is giving us medical opinion for nothing. I do not know whether the honourable member has gone into the matter scientifically; I am speaking not of what ought to be done, but of the existing state of things. As I have said, in Victoria people are fined if their children are not vaccinated before they reach a certain age, whilst in New South Wales the urgency of vaccination is altogether disregarded.

We Shall Be Taking Away From The,"less effectively at the present time, and which they have the very strongest reasons for carrying out effectively, because, with regard to animals and plants at any rate, they are, in competition one with another. The States are exporters, and it is well that every State should be able to show a clean bill of health, so to speak, to the whole world, to which it desires to send its products, and no State can have that unless it keeps its territory clean. partments of Agriculture are doing a great deal of valuable work in this connection. In Queensland especially, where they have the pioneer bacteriological laboratory, in which work has been carried on for very many years past, we have evidence of the desire and intention, of the State to carry out its work effectively, and evidence also of the actual achievement of that intention. If , however, we pass this Bill as it stands it present, we shall be giving notice to the States that all this may be unnecessary, and that one of two things will happeneither they may not continue to do this work, of if they do they may find themselves in conflict with a Commonwealth law. disaster would follow. I sincerely hope that before this aspect of the question is dealt with in Committee, some time for reflection and study will be granted to honourable members, so that we may consider it in all its bearings. I feel sure that every honourable member realizes, from the professional training I have had, that I am fully seized of the importance of protecting the health of our people, but we must not be carried away by our desires. Our desires must be limited by our powers. because we think it is well that a thing should be done, we are not going to give that as a reason why we should trespass upon the province of the States in doing work, admirable in its way, which would be very much better done by the States separately. clause which has been quoted over and over again, that the Commonwealth may prevent the passage of infected animals, persons or plants not only from one State to another, but from any part of one State to another part of the same State. This would mean, therefore, to take a familiar instance, that if the State of Queensland drew across the State from Cloncurry a ""tick line,"" as it has been called, below which no cattle should be allowed to travel from a tick-infested area, the Commonwealth officer might come in and say that the line should be Mr Salmon. drawn from Winton. There would immediately be a conflict of authority, although the Minister of Trade and Customs says that the State could still go on doing its work. I said that if the Commonwealth did not act there was nothing to prevent the State from acting in concurrence with the Commonwealth. agine, then, that the Commonwealth does not act, through want of information, and that the State does act, fixing the line at Cloncurry. The Commonwealth then does get information, and, acting on it, fixes the line so many miles lower down, say at Winton. In those circumstances, there would be a conflict of authority. be. must prevail. States must go under. I do not believe in limiting or belittling the powers of this In either circumstance nothing, but Parliament, but I hope the day is far distant when there will be any intention or desire on the part of honourable members here to trespass on the powers of the States in this particular direction. I realize that this is a matter which cannot-, and ought not to, be decided by us now. We can deal with it when we come to the particular clause in which it is involved. There seems to be a desire on die part of the Minister and of his Department to establish another huge Department of State. work is to be done well. The deputy leader of the Opposition spoke of the policing of the whole of tbe Commonwealth, and the Minister received his remarks with approbation.

WhatI said was that where we took over the business from the State we should employ the States officers, as employed now, so far as we could. stand that perfectly, and I do not think that I have said anything bearing a different construction. contended is that, in order to have effective work done, we shall have to increase the number of the officers who are employed by the States. I can tell the Minister and other honourable members that the health officer system as it exists in Australia is most unsatisfactory; it is the worse system which can possibly be imagined. For instance, a shire or a borough appoints a health officer at a salary of £ 1 0 a year to look after an enormous tract of country. He is elected by the council, the majority of whom are probably patients of his own, and possibly keep pigs within the municipal boundary if they get a chance. That is the sort of thing which we get under our present health officer system. Why should we perpetuate a system like that for the purpose of employing, tine same officers under the Commonwealth? interfere with that at all. able member has not heard the discussion; otherwise he would know that it is intended that the whole work of treating the spread of contagious or infectious disease, no matter where it may arise, shall be.placed in the hands oflhe Commonwealth. able member is wrong. and of course we know that doctors differ, I am quite prepared to have this matter thoroughly threshed out, as no doubt it will be, when we reach the clause in Committee. It will then be my duty to speak at greater length, and advance reasonswhich I believe will be found cogent-wh y we at the present juncture should not carry on the work which is being done by the States through experts to the best possible extent, considering the opportunities which they have at their disposal, and above all, why we should not interfere with the Departments of Agriculture which are acting in strong commercial competition one with the other, and which undoubtedly find it to their interest to preserve a clean bill of health for the States, from which products are sent to all parts of the world, with the honourable member for Laanecoorie, that this is really a Bill for consideration in Committee; and as long as its provisions are adequate to the objects sought to be attained, of course it ought to go through fairly quickly. On WhatI have looking through the measure I can scarcely see that the provisions assuming that the power to legislate exists-ar e not such as ought to be ineluded; but any merit which is in the legislation will depend upon the administration; and about that I am somewhat doubtful. We are in a great hurry to take over several Departments from the States. One. would really think that our legislative powers are so extensive that we can keep on legislating at this pace for the next thirty or forty years. But so far as I can see ahead, I should think that within ten or fifteen years we shall have practically exhausted all the powers vested in us by section 51 of the Constitutionunless of course we should make such a mess of our legislation, that the greater part of the time of each subsequent Parliament will be taken up in amending what previous Parliaments have done. So far as one can reasonably conjecture, there does not seem to be any very great haste, before the Ministers have made adequate provision for effective administration, to take over Departments or frame uniform laws. As to the efficacy of the administration a doubt exists. At the present time there is some timidity in South Australia in relation to the fruit pests of other States. Relations are almost strained at times between South Australia and one or two of the other States. If the Minister is assured that he can go to the expense necessitated by a proper Federal administration of quarantine, everything may be right. It is on that point that I am somewhat doubtf u l . As regards the powers of the Federation, I scarcely think that a doubt exists but the powers are merely concurrent, So far as we do not over-ride any local provisions in regard to the health of the States, there is no doubt that the State provisions-will remain. If , for instance, we .have a quarantine law which negatives some provision of a State law, although it is called an inspection law of the State, there is no doubt that the inspection law of the State will go to the wall.

259,Mr Glynn (Angas) [5.33],"I agreecourse, extend to persons. That is one of the points which the honourable member for Franklin referred to when he asked what really is the distinction between the inspecinspection laws. That does show that, intion law of a State and the quarantine power. As I take it, the quarantine power comprises not only general articles of commerce which may be subject to pests, but extends also to persons and animals. The inspection laws of the States extend to such articles as come within the trade and commerce power, and therefore do not touch human beings. The powers, therefore, are not co-extensive, although, if a Federal quarantine provision over-rides a provision of the State law in regard to inspection, in my opinion the latter is to that extent bad. It does show the necessity of having an effective administration of whatever laws we do pass. If we are going to take over quarantine and frame a uniform law, we ought not to shrink from authorizing whatever expense may be necessary to make it thoroughly efficacious throughout the Commonwealth. That will require a good deal of expense possibly. I have recently read a report by Dr. Ramsay Smith-wh o is a specialist in these matters-whic h was presented to the Federal Government,, and which deals with quarantine in the New Hebrides and some of the other Pacific Islands. He showed that the French Government disseminate in New Caledonia and in part of the New Hebrides a good deal of information as regards health under their jurisdiction of quarantine. seem to be schools established in some counat present are imposed by South Australia, tries for the purpose of studying disease in connection with quarantine administration. If anything of that sort is done here it will involve a very considerable expense, and, unless it is done, I am afraid that our administration will be faulty. quarantine ? the health provisions which are supposed to be within the quarantine power. Assuming that we have the right to pass the make an improvement ? Bill under the quarantine power, then it seems to me that anything which will rening of our quarantine laws uniform will be der that power efficacious, such as the esan improvement. Our policy is to secure tablishment of a college of experts or the uniformity. appointment of a staff of experts,, to studyabout the restrictions placed on the impordiseases, will be constitutional. levy rates to meet their own expenditure. so under the Constitution. contains an express provision enabling a State to impose a tax even on Inter-State goods for the purpose of carrying out its dependently of the quarantine power and the trade and commerce power, the Constitution assumes that, very large inspection powers still remain with the States. I am sure that the provision would not have been inserted in the Constitution unless the inspection laws of the States were fairly extensive. At the same time, it is probable that,, so far as we negative any provisions in the inspection laws by a Federal quarantine law, then the former are neutralized. We, therefore, have to see that the administration of our laws shall be perfect. The honourable and learned member for Bendigohas referred to this matter so extensively that I do not think that, under the circumstances, I should be justified in saying any more. But I do hope that the Minister will be thoroughly prepared, if the Department is to be taken over,, to see that the administration is up-to-date in every respect. That there will be a good deal of trouble I have not the slightest doubt. It may be that the administration may practically quarantine a State. That has been done at present by one State as against another. If there is any relaxation of any of the provisions under which, say, Western Australia quarantines in relation' to certain fruit pests the fruits coming from There other States, or of the regulations which and which, to some extent, affect New South Wales, so much the worse for the State which at present is not affected by those pests. If the limits of quarantine are made coterminous with the boundaries of the States there is sure to be an uproar and talk about CommonThe test of the value of the Bill must be whether the Commonwealth administers the There have been complaints tation of our fruits into Germany and South Africa, and, as a diversity of regulations is parts of the world, it may also prove harmSection 112 One State complains that the regulations of",39,Williamlyne T H E Regulation Is The Codlin Moth

Of course, the Minister will tell us that this inspection is already provided for by Queensland; but I think that more than is now provided for would be necessary if the Bill became law as it stands. I ask the Minister to take these matters into consideration. I shall vote for the measure, with the exception of the three paragraphs to which I have drawn attention, and which I hope the Minister will see his way to eliminate in Committee. Otherwise, I think that the Bill is a good one, and I am sorry that it was not brought into operation some four or five years ago. It will certainly relieve the States of some expenditure and involve the Commonwealth in a considerable outlay. But I do not think that that consideration should stand in the way of its adoption. I think that the measure should be applied only to oversea shipping, and that the States Governments should.be left free to deal with inter-State matters.

In most matters of quarantine, everybody agrees with a policy of centralization, but when we are called upon to consider quarantine provisions which affect the administration of the various State Departments which deal with stock and plant life, there is room for a considerable difference of opinion. enamoured of Federal control so far as it has been exhibited. In many of thejransferred Departments, I venture to say that Federal control has not been an improvement upon State control. Sir South Australia, Federal control of the Customs Department has been a very great improvement upon State control. Most of the Customs frauds which have been disclosed there were committed prior to Federation. drawn off the track by these parochial i nterjections of the Minister. member is making a parochial speech. I wish to draw attention to the fact that nearly all of the Customs frauds recently disclosed in Adelaide were committed during the period that the honourable member for Hume has been a Minister of the Commonwealth. member is quite mistaken. in regard to many thousands of pounds of which the revenue has been defrauded. Sir WILLIAM LYNE But it is not correct in regard to the £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 . to discuss the question of whether or not the Customs administration by the Commonwealth authorities has been an improvement upon that of the State. I hope that it has been, but certainly the Federal administration of many Departments has not been an improvement upon their administration by the States. nearly every instance there has been an improvement. Trade and Customs must know that the administration of the Electoral Department D i d not the Minister exin almost every State was preferable, more effective, and less open to abuses than is I do not think its administration by the Commonwealth.

Hence it will be seen that the vignerons of South Australia view with some alarm Commonwealth interference with these matters, most of which can best be dealt with by the local authorities. I do not mean to suggest that power should not be taken by the Commonwealth to deal with attempts made, under the disguise of measures for the exclusion of pests, to secure substantial protection for an industry by means of interference with Inter-State free-trade. The Commonwealth should certainly have power to intervene in such cases; but I do not think that we ought to go beyond that. I trust that we shall have from the Minister a clear indication of the scope of the Bill, and a statement as to the way in which it will be administered. When the Commerce Bill was under consideration we had many assurances that certain interferences with trade which honourable members on both sides of the House strongly deprecated, would not be permitted under that measure, but we, have found that in some cases more harm than good has been done under it.

If Parliament only keeps a careful eye on the Minister who has the administration of the Bill, the existing expenditure need not, I think, be exceeded. Western Australia has been referred to in connection with this matter. In that State, there is rather a strict system of inspection, particularly of fruit from the Eastern States.

Surely some method can be adopted by which the Federal and States Governments could act in conjunction in a matter of that kind, and decide between them whether the particular case brought under their notice would be best dealt with by""the State or the Federal authority. In my opinion, if a case occurred within a State it would best be dealt with by the State; but if it extended beyond any particular State only the Federal Government could effectively deal with it. I have not yet condesirable that, in order that Federation sidered a method of arriving at such an agreement between a State and the Federal Government, but I think that a way could be discovered out of the difficulty which, I perceive, from the debate, is present to the minds of many honourable members. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [6.21] I think the Bill should commend itself on general principles to every member of the House. There seems to be a general consensus of opinion, with which I concur, that so far as the question of Inter-State or overtempts are made to go beyond the strict sea quarantine is concerned, more especially as applicable to diseases which affect the human being, it is most desirable that such a BiU should be passed. References have been made to previous efforts made in this direction. I remember that as a member of the Federal Council in 1899,1 supported a Bill then introduced by Sir James Dickson, which proposed to establish a system of Federal quarantine for the whole of Australia. Unfortunately, the whole of the States were not represented on the Federal Council, and Tasmania was not inclined to join in ; though an effort was made to induce New Zealand to co-operate. None of the previous efforts was successful, however. Some opposition to the Bill emanating from the Council was raised on the giound that the larger movement of Federation was so imminent, and here we are today some eight years later endeavouring to pass a Federal quarantine measure. In my study of the BillI went into the question as did the honourable member for Parkesof the powers of this Parliament to deal with quarantine in the manner proposed in the three paragraphs of clause 13 to which so much reference has been made, and to my astonishment I arrived at a conclusion very similar to the honourable member's. I say with astonishment, because I had imagined that when a Bill was proposed to Parliament, which, in the most unequivocal manner endeavoured to interfere with districts within a State regarding matters of quarantine and inspection of plants and animals and diseases affecting them, it would have been established in the minds of those who introduced the measure that what was proposed was clearly within the scope of the functions of this Parliament. I have looked with some degree of anticipation to a reply from the Treasury Bench to that portion of the speech of the honourable member for Parkes which dealt with that particular point. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta. that it is most shall' not become more unpopular in the country than it is, extreme care should be taken by the Federal Parliament not to tread upon the corns of any of the States. It is sometimes said that those who hold that opinion take a parochial view. I deny that altogether. Such a view is taken entirely in the interests of Federation itself. The Constitution prescribes certain spheres within which and only within which the Commonwealth can legislate, and if atletter of the Constitution in that regard, the Commonwealth Parliament will certainly be doing that which will tend to undermine the confidence that the people of the various States have in it, and that it is desirable that they should have. In connection with the question whether the Bill is not ultra vires in this respect, it appears to me that, in the drafting of it, there is an almost unconscious admission that quarantine does relate strictly to diseases affecting human beings only, because it will be noticed from the interpretation clause in the expression "" quarantinable disease "" meanssmall-pox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, or leprosy or any disease declared by the Governor General by proclamation to be a quarantinable disease. It is a curious fact that there is no disease mentioned under the heading "" quarantinable disease "" which affects plants, and animals other than man. Diseases in connection with plants are not defined as being "" quarantinable "" diseases. I do not know where this phrase has been taken from. I presume that it has been copied from some authority. If not, it is a curious coincidence that the expression, as defined in clause 5, relates exclusively to diseases affecting the human subject. In the case",45,William Lyne I Think That In Plants Is Largely A Local Matter As Well As

314,Mr Groom,In connection with this quo.,47,William Lyne I Think That In Plants Is Largely A Local Matter As Well As
315,Mr Groom,"Recently, also, in conQueensland, owing to their extreme distance from the Seat of Government, I believe it would be found almost impossible for the Commonwealth Government to administer provisions such as those which are now enforced under States legislation affecting diseases in animals and plants. It will be necessary, I think, for this Parliament to go a great deal further than is proposed in this B i ll if it be intended that the Commonwealth Government should take upon itself a tithe of the functions of administration connected with these matters which have to be attended to in such a State as Queensland. There is no adequate machinery for the purpose provided in the B ill . We have in Queensland six or eight elaborate States Acts under, which administration in connection with these various matters takes place. It seems to me that it is almost preposterous to suppose that under three subsections of a Federal Quarantine Act it will be possible to develop an administration of these various matters which would be in any way commensurate with that which this measure would displace. AlthoughI had some difficulty in following the Minister of Trade and Customs, I understand that that is not what is desired, and that the three paragraphs of clause 13 referred to would be put into operation in such a way as not to completely override the provisions of the various States Acts dealing with these questions. If that be so, would it not be better to eliminate these provisions and substitute for them a provision conferring power upon the Commonwealth Government to compel or coerce the various States Governments to administer States Acts dealing with these matters in an effective way? member think that to take up the position of controlling and directing the States Governments in that way would be likely to create a great deal of friction? Colonel FOXTON that it would lead to any more friction than would be created by an attempt to enforce the provisions of clause 13 to which I have referred; because, if the course I suggest were adopted, a warning would be given in the first instance to were not taking proper steps to proclaim quarantine areas, and so forth. A State would naturally act upon the warning. If it neglected to do so, it would then be quite right for some power like the Commonwealth to be able to step in and say to that State, "" You are not doing your duty in this matter, either to some of your own districts or to the other States, and if you continue to neglect it it will be for us to step in and compel you to do your duty, or take the administration out of your hands."". Possibly that is what is intended. Possibly the intention is to allow the various State Acts to be administered as they have been in the past, and merely to hold these three paragraphs of clause 13 in terrorem over the States in order to compel them to do what the Commonwealth Government may consider to be their duty towards the other parts of Australia. secure uniformity of administration, and a uniform standard in the States. Obviously that will be an advantage. Colonel FOXTON If that is the intention of the Government, and if that is a'l, I am quite with them; but this B ill gives much wider powers, if it is intended to give those powers, the subject should be elaborated to a much greater degree than it is in these three paragraphs, and we should have a guarantee that in intervening the Federal Government would be able to do something really effective. There are machinery clauses for everything else in the B ill . Oversea quarantine and all that sort of thing is elaborately provided for, but in this case there are merely three bald paragraphs which, whenever they were put into operation, would cause a considerable amount of friction. The Minister of Trade and Customs said they were necessarybecause some of the States were too stringent in the administration of their various Acts. Mention has been made of certain action takenby Western Australia in the imposition of examination! fees, which will amount almost to a prohibitive dufy. Possibly that was in the honourable gentleman's mind when he made that reference. I do not believe Queensland has probably suffered most at the hands of other States from various restrictions on the transport of its animals and its vegetable productions, as the result of the pests such as tick and fruit fly that we have there. But I feel that there is very little exception to be the States Governments if they tjaken, speaking broadly, to the action taken at various times by the different States for the protection of their flocks and herds, orchards, and vegetable gardens, although some of those restrictions may have been a little too stringent.

On the whole, I am extremely pleased to see this B ill , berot so stringent with their quarantine laws cause I think it is undoubtedly necessary in relation to oversea quarantine; but, unless it can be shown that there is an absolute -and immediate necessity for interference with State arrangements regarding animal and plant diseases within the States themselves, it would be extremely desirable to end the matter at oversea quarantine and omit the rest of the Bill. very easily done without disfiguring the measure in any way, and what is omitted could be left until such time as it was foundthat there was a real and urgent necessity for its enactment. am in sympathy with this Bill with regard to oversea quarantine, and feel that something should be done to make uniform the different quarantine Acts now in force throughout the Commonwealth, what interests me and my constituents much more than the question of oversea quarantine is the quarantining of animals and plants. I cannot for the life of me understand how the Cabinet have come to the conclusion that the Federal Convention, when they put vision in the Constitution, meant that we should deal with quarantine inside as well as outside the Commonwealth.'

Queensland had to bell the cat, and has belled it ever since the tick was introduced; but I am pleased to say that some of the others have the cat to bell now, and are as they were before. They have had a taste of their own physic, and are now a. little more sympathetic towards Queensland. In regard to the tick area, the sympathies of the law-makers in Queensland are with the people of the State, but so far as I can see, the sympathies of the Commonwealth Administration are not with the State at This could be all. If a law is administered from Brisbane, it is an easy matter to get the ear of a Minister or the Cabinet there, so as to have the quarantine enforced with the least possible hardship to those interested, but in the case of anything that comes under the Commonwealth a hard and fast line is drawn. If , for instance, there was an outbreak of anthrax or tick in a particular district in Queensland, the Commonwealth, without giving any notice at all, would step in and declare the district infected and quarantine it . There would be no sympathy whatever from the Federal Parliament, and the consequence would be absolute ruination to the whole of the people in the quarantined area.

321,Mr Page,"It might be the wholefurther east, then further south, and next put back again as the country became less infected, or not infected at all. As soon as ever it was' proved to the satisfaction of the Agricultural Department that the ticks had disappeared, then the line was moved further back. What would be the position in regard to Federal control and State control ? In his speech the Minister said that the State could regulate the business as well as the Commonwealth, but the honourable member for Laanecoorie put the position very tersely when he pointed out that if the Commonwealth wanted Cloncurry to be made the boundary, and the State wanted Winton to be made the boundary-Winton is really the southern boundary of the tick line, for the ticks first came from Brighton Downs-the two authorities would clash at once. There is something else to be said in connection with this quarantine movement. Queensland has a Bacteriological Institute, which is one of the finest in the Commonwealth, if not in the world. About a fortnight ago I read a statement in which it was pointed out that Mr Pound was going into the question of diseases of stock, particularly those in which Queensland is interested. Are we to hand over the Institute to the Commonwealth ? We know very well what becomes of institutions when that step is taken. I have not much faith in the Commonwealth in that regard. If we .were to lose the control of our Bacteriological Institute, the stock-owners in Queensland are the only persons who would suffer. As the pastoral industry in that State is the backbone of the Commonwealth, surely they deserve some consideration from the Ministry. believe that the control of oversea quarantine should be vested in the Federal Government, but when this Bill goes into Committee, I shall try to make such alterations as will give the States the control of quarantine within their boundaries, because that alone will give satisfaction, not merely to the States themselves, but to the stock-owners and all those who are interested in horticulture and viticulture. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.8] I agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes, that OUT first duty in approaching a Bill of this kind is to endeavour to ascertain as well as we can what are the limitations on our legislative powers. that there is no practice more mischievous than that which we may fall into of taking our powers for granted, because I feel sure that it will not only lead us into very serious difficulties with the States, unless we are very careful in that respect, but will inevitably also lead to protracted and vexatious litigation. A suggestion has been thrown out that a way might be devised by which an authoritative opinion could be obtained from the High Court on a doubtful point such as has been discussed tonight. Of course the great difficulty about that is that once we vested in a judicial tribunal legislative functions, we might introduce another mischief to the State. is done in Canada. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That may be so. I am not going to pronounce myself as opposed to such a method if it can be introduced without the danger to which I have alluded. But as things are, it becomes the duty of all who have devoted any study to the constitutional aspect of the question, to 'give the best advice they can to the House, and I feel it my duty to say a few words from that stand-point. I go further than the honourable and learned member for Parkes in the doubt which he expressed as to the general unconstitutionality of this Bill. As he has said, and as other honourable members have 'said, it all turns upon the meaning of the word ""quarantine"" not in the Bill that of course cannot alter in the slightest degree our legislative power but in the Constitution itself. In common parlance the word ""quarantine"" has been applied to a host of things. In Victoria it has recently been applied to a matter which I do not think that even the I Minister in charge of the Bill would say came within the constitutional meaning of the word "" quarantine,"" and that is the quarantining of gaming houses. If we take that extremely wide meaning of the word "" quarantine, we shall see that it canno* be the meaning which was intended by the framers of the ' Constitution. In Victoria we have a power-and I feel sure that a similar power exists in the other Stateswhereby if a case of diphtheria or other infectious disease is discovered, it becomes the duty of the police,, the parent of the sufferer, and other persons to aid in removing the patient to a fever hospital. That is done partly for the sake of the family, but principally for the sake of I believe removing the patient from a locality in which he might be a source of danger to other persons. Can it be contended for a moment that, under the general power of",49,William Lyne I Think That In Plants Is Largely A Local Matter As Well As
322,Mr Joseph Cook,"I understand that itmaking laws as to quarantine, it was intended that the Federal Parliament was to step in and control such a purely domestic matter as that? Take, again, the case of pests which are mentioned in clause 4 of the Bill, namely, "" pests affecting man, animals, or plants."" There are all sorts of pests, even plants that are pests, which have been regulated hitherto by domestic legislation in the States. Take the case of stinkwort, which has recently become a pest in certain parts of Victoria. Surely it was never intended that under its legislanot had time since the debate comtive power as to quarantine this Parliament was to step in and control that which will bring us into direct conflict with the vast range of subjects which were, as I believe, intended to be left to the States to regulate, and which I believe also the States can more efficiently, and probably more cheaply, regulate than it can. effectively by the States? Mr W. H . IRVINE I admit that in a certain class of cases, where uniform legislation throughout the States is desired, this Parliament can, if it has the constitudate the Laws relating to Quarantine-con tional power, legislate more effectively than could any one or two or more of the States, but that does not carry us beyond the question : Has this Parliament the power to pass such legislation? What is really included in the word ""quarantine""? I think I shall be able to show to demonstration,, by adopting the first rule which we ought to adopt in the interpretation of the term in the Constitution, that "" quarantine "" was intended to cover nothing of the kind, and was really not intended to go beyond what is technically known as quarantine, namely, the prohibition of the introduction of disease in human beings from places outside the Commonwealth The High Court has certainly been engaged in going into some fundamental propositions with regard to the interpretation of the Constitution, and the learned Chief Justice has laid down a principle with which, if I may say so without disrespect, I cordially agree, and with which every lawyer will agree, namely, that when we are dealing with the construction of a constitutional compact between a number of independent States who came together into a partnership, and said, "" These are our articles of partnership,"" and we find a term or expression used in the contract relating to a class of matters which previously to the partnership had been dealt with by the States Legislatures, then we must first of all look to the language used by those Legislatures as our best guide as to what the articles of the partnership mean. Surely it is obvious that if we are dealing with .a matter of Excise or Customs or any of the more or less technical expressions which are enumerated in section 51 of the Constitution, the very first source of light that we should consult is the sense in which the Parliaments of the States had then used them. Common sense teaches us that. I have menced to exhaustively investigate the legislation of the States in regard to quarantine, but I have taken the trouble to ascertain what were the provisions of* the States Acts immediately preceding Federation. My contention is that, it is reasonable to suppose that, when the framers of the Constitution were considering what powers should be given to the Commonwealth Parliament, they used the word "" quarantine "" in the sense in which the Parliaments of the States were using it. Take the case of New South Wales first. The local Act, No. 25 of 1897-a n Act to consolitains not a word about diseases pf anjmals or plants, though such diseases are dealt with in other Acts. This Act contains thirty-seven sections, of which section 4 enacts thatThe Governor may by proclamation published in the Gazette, appoint places in New South Wales to be stations for the performance of quarantine by all vessels, persons, and things liable to perform quarantine. Then section 6 provides that(1) Whenever any vessel arrives in any port or harbour in New South Wales, and (a) there is at the time any infectious or contagious disease on board such vessel ; or (i) there has been during the voyage of such vessel any infectious or contagious disease on board; or (f) such vessel has during the voyage communicated with any other vessel on board which any infectious or contagious disease existed; or (d) such vessel has during the voyage touched at any port or place where any infectious or contagious disease prevailed; or (e) such vessel has arrived from or after having touched at any place beyond the seas, and the Governor has by proclamation notified that such place is infected with any infectious or contagious disease highly dangerous to the public health, and that it is probable that such disease may be brought from such place to New South Wales, then such vessel shall be and be deemed to have been liable to quarantine.",50,William Lyne I Think That In Plants Is Largely A Local Matter As Well As
323,Mr Webster,"Can it be done more-Penalties are provided for evasion of the Act, and persons liable to quarantine may be seized; but everything turns upon the existence of an infectious or contagious disease. PartI V. deals with proceedings on the arrival of vessels, such as the hoistthe movements of men or animals and thusing of signals, and Part V. with the performance of quarantine. Then there are miscellaneous provisions in Part VI . , for rendering the Act effective. But there is not a word or a sentence in the measure indicating that the word "" quarantine "" is intended by the New South Wales Legislature to mean more than I say the framers of the Constitution meant-the prevention of the introduction from abroad of contagious or -infectious diseases in human beings. covering the other matters dealt with in this Bill. Mr W. H .

That is the only power for the prevention of the introduction of disease which the United States Government possesses, but it effectively prevents the introthe State. But it will be found that whenduction of disease. Mr W. H . IRVINE -My concern is whether the power to legislate with respect to quarantine' includes the power to pass such a Bill as this.

My contention is that the power to pass laws in respect to quarantine does not extend beyond the'power-to .prevent the introduction from abroad of diseases dangerous to human beings. As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, we have power to prevent the importation of inferior and dangerous goods, but the exercise of that power is not. quarantine. learned member include contagious diseases in animals communicable to human beings ? Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is highly desirable that we should have the power, and stitutional power as to commerce apply tc* possibly that we should exercise it under some of these matters? the Bill, to control the importations of diseased animals from abroad. WhatI am particularly concerned to show is that: we have not the power claimed in this Bill' to pass all kinds of provisions controlling.' invading the sphere of States legislation. It would be a very dangerous thing if we tried to do that. I shall not refer at length to the quarantine laws of the oilier States. In. the Victorian Health Act of 1890 provisionssimilar to those in force in New South. Wales are included under the heading of "" quarantine."" Under other headingsthere are provisions, some of which are similar to those in the Bill, to which exceptionis taken; but there are no such provisionsunder the heading of quarantine. The conclusion at which I have arrived from a comparison of the States Acts is -thatr the word "" quarantine"" is used by all the Parliaments of the States to mean the prevention of the introduction from: abroad of contagious or infectious diseases. It is only fair to state that in the WesternAustralian Act the expression "" land quarantine "" is used to include something morethan that, namely, some of those domestic regulations to which I have referred, such as the isolation of persons suffering"" from disease in any particular portion of the Federation was established the word ""quarantine"" throughout the legislationof all the States was limited to the technical meaning indicated by the honourable and learned member for Parkes to-day. Of course, it may be a very wise thing for us to endeavour to attain as many of the objects of this Bill as we can. I am quite in sympathy with its general objects, and I think it is highly desirable that we For instance, we should, as far as possible, secure uniforthe treatment of various diseases and peststhroughout Australia. Buti f we attempt to gain that uniformity by overstepping the limits of our constitutional authority, we shall not only create a great deal of friction, but we shall practically defeat the end.which we have in view. Therefore, I am of opinion that the Government would be acting very wisely if they consented toreconsider the whole position before endeavouring to force this measure through even its second reading.",51,William Lyne I Think That In Plants Is Largely A Local Matter As Well As

IRVINE constitutional power as to commerce, it can be shown that we can include some of these matters, I , for one, should like to be afforded an opportunity of considering the subject more carefully. ready exercised the power conferred upon us by that provision in our Constitution in the Customs Act. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes, but the exact limitation of our powers in regard to trade and commerce is a question which is fraught with considerable difficulty. We may or may not have power to include some of these matters. Even our powers under the Customs Act may be limited by conditions which do not permit of our differentiating between the States. But the whole B i ll requires to be recast. Another suggestion which I desire to make is that we have begun at the wrong end-that we have put the cart before the horse. The scheme -of the Constitution with regard to this particular matter seems to me to be this: Quarantine is really an Executive function. It involves the carrying out of the Executive authority which exists in every community for its self-preservation-for saving itself from the influx of disease which may be dangerous to the community. In its nature and in its execution, quarantine essentially comes under the general heading of Executive acts. Of course, it has to be enforced by legislative authority, but it differs entirely from the range of legislative action the object of which is to lay down rules for the conduct of citizens. To lay down rules for the conduct of citizens is one thing, and legislation which prescribes the mode in which an Executive function shall be carried out is another thing. There are certain functions of an Executive character, which, under the Constitution, have been taken from the States and handed over to the Commonwealth. The transferred Departments are post and telegraphs, telephones, naval and military ships, beacons and buoys, and quarantine. These Departments were to be transferable to the Commonwealth in accordance with section 69 of the Constitution. But under section 52 it is provided that the Parliament shall have exclusive powers to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commomyealth, with respect to matters relating to any Department of. the Public Service, the control of which is, by this Constitution, transferred to the If , under our Executive Government of the Commonwealth. Now what I submit ought to be done in regard to quarantine-the proper business-like way of discharging our duty under the Constitution-is to do what that . instrument of government tells us we are to do, if the time be ripe for it . We should, by the necessary Executive act, namely, by proclamation by the Governor General, take over the several quarantine services of the States. carry on those services without a uniform law to guide us? Mr W. H . IRVINE If the Minister studied the Constitution a little more closely he would know that until we substitute a Federal law for them, all the States laws remain operative. That is what the Constitution contemplates. Suppose that we had first passed an elaborate Post Office Act dealing with the whole administration of the Postal Department, and had afterwards taken over that Department. Act still. Mr W. H . IRVINE T h a t may be so. The Constitution required that the Customs Department should be taken over by the Federation immediately upon its inception. It was transferred to the Commonwealth even before this Parliament met. Now, the plan which the Constitution proposes is one which should be carried out. If the time be ripe for it, let the Government take over the various State Departments dealing with quarantine. lating to quarantine vary. Mr W. H . IRVINE -When we have taken over those Departments, we shall exercise exclusive control over them. The Government will then be in a position to bring forward legislation in respect of them and to make it uniform, just as they did in the case of the Customs Department, the Post Office, and the Defence Department. providing the necessary legislation first? . Mr W. H . IRVINE If we provide the necessary legislation simply to enable us to act when we have taken over the States Departments there is no objection to be urged except that we are jumping before we come to the stile. But that is not what we are now asked to do. We are asked to create a new Department, to enable the Governor General in Council to appoint officers and to establish a new system which will duplicate existing machinery.",52,William Lyne I Think That In Plants Is Largely A Local Matter As Well As

I may add that in Quick and Garran, page 567, the point is stated distinctly. this power the Commonwealthmay deal with quarantine without reference to the former powers in relation to health the interests of trade and commerce, but as were still retained. There is no doubt an independent question having regard to the about that. sanitary condition and welfare of the Commonwealth as a whole. It will be able to provide for the isolation, segregation, remedial and preventive treatment of animals and plants and their diseases wherever found within the Commonwealth. It would probably be able, if deemed desirable, to grapple with such problems as the tick plague or a phylloxera pest, in stamping out which the whole of Australia is interested. Mr W. H . IRVINE -What authority is confined to ports. cited for that ? the authors. authors themselves. Amongst the authorities makes the power an efficient instrument of According to the report of Sir John Thompson, Minister of Justice of Canada, dated 28th nothing January, 1889, respecting the Nova Scotia Acts of 188S, authorizing the Governor in 'Council to regulate "" with a view of preventing the spread of infectious disease, the entry or departure In Prentice and Egan on the of boats or vessels at the different ports or places in Nova Scotia,"" and the report of the same Minister, dated 21st March, 1891, on the Manitoba Act respecting diseases of animals, it would seem that, in the opinion of the Federal authorities of Canada, such legislation is an invasion of the Dominion power over quarantine. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Does the Minister mind reading the passage immediately before the expression of opinion which he has quoted ? The Legislature of British Columbia passed an Act enabling the Corporation of Vancouver to make by-laws for regulating, with a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease, the entry and departure of ships at the port of Vancouver, and the landing of passengers and cargoes from ships or from railroad cars. In the case of the Canadian Pacific Navigation Co. v. the City of Vancouver, 2 Brit. Columb., 193, it was held that this was not an infringement of the Dominion power to regulate trade and commerce. In the Act creating the Dominion of Canada power is given specifically to deal with quarantine just in the same way as that power is given to us. it was held that the Dominion Government had not power to go over the head of a State. that where there was anything in the nature of a disaster threatening the whole of Canada, the Dominion authority had power It is stated that under to act. The effect of the decision, I understand, was that in a particular province Government had a general power of quarantine. of quarantine which, apparently, according to the Canadian authorities, extends to animals as well as to human beings. to quarantine expressed in the same wide",57,William Lyne I T Would Be Laws Of Each State

403,Sir John Quick,And that power is not,58,William Lyne I T Would Be Laws Of Each State
404,Mr Groom,"No. In our own Congovernment for the people of Australia as a whole. the old system of State boundaries. and pests are not very provincial in their nature. They over-run the boundaries of States very quickly. The desire is to prevent the spread of diseases. It seems to me to be admitted that, undoubtedly, we have the power to deal with oversea quar-, antine. That power is not questioned in the slightest degree. Well now, in this Bill that power is exercised to the f u l l . It is realized that it is the greatest hardship possible for vessels to be made subject to six distinct Acts in the Commonwealth of Australia, and our desire was, as far as shipping was concerned, that when a ship once arrived at any port in Australia, for the rest of the time while she was in Australian waters she should be under one law and one authority. That was our intention, and the Bill carries it out f u l l y and completely. I come now to the second point with which the B ill deals. I do not know whether the honourable member for Flinders will dispute the claim that as regards oversea importations into Australia, we have undoubtedly power to deal with stock and plants. Mr W. point. cised under the Customs Act. If honourable members turn to PartV . of the Bill they will see that it is built upon the power which we have, and have exercised, in that respect. merce. tine or commerce. tion. comes into operation all importations of plants and of animals will be subject to the provisions of this measure absolutely. I understand chat honourable members opposite raise no objection on that point. They are satisfied that, as regards oversea matters, both respecting plants and animals, we possess that power. Now, as regards Inter-State trade, I am sure that my honourable friends from Queensland, especially those who represent pastoral and agricultural areas, know of the trouble which their State has suffered through the administration of quarantine regulations in the southern States. When the plague Otherwise it would perpetuate broke out in Queensland, on one occasion New South Wales, by its regulations, I am sorry to say that diseases absolutely prohibited the introduction into Sydney of any agricultural produce from the port of Brisbane. Even although the goods absolutely did not come from anywhere near the city, or even from any affected area, they exercised their power in that respect. think, Dr. Ashburton Thompson had had an interview with Dr. Ham, the Queensland Health Commissioner, and several letters had been written on the subject. It was shown that under the Constitution, where a State possesses a police power like that which was exercised by the New South Wales Government, if it is exercised to the extent of a prohibition of goods, and not merely to the extent of protection, then to the extent to which it exceeds the police power of protection, its exercise is absolutely invalid. say that there was in that case an intentional prohibition? with the difficulty that arose. bition related only to hides. produce of every description, and for some months not a single bushel of wheat or barley could be imported into New South Wales from Brisbane. I am referring to this merely as an illustration, to show that in respect 1 of Inter-State powers what is necessary is that we should have throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth a complete and uniform system, so that the people of all the States may know that, so far as the regulation of the spread of disease is It s combined operaconcerned, all shall be treated on the same footing. gested here that at the time to which the Minister refers the people of New South Wales lapsed into protection. zeal, of the pervert, and not of the convert. rampant in Sydney. was.

420,Mr Groom,"I do not know that it would like to restrict the operation of such a measure as this to oversea quarantine. They will surely admit that the Inter-State difficulty in thijs connection is most important and most pressing, and also that it is highly desirable that there should be, in connection with the administration of these regulations, a feeling that the Inter-State transit of goods is not prohibited as. the result of any particular local feeling, but solely in the interests of Australia as a whole. State commerce in this connection cannot be questioned in the slightest degree. I come now to the narrowest point of view,. and that is with respect to our power to legislate and deal with the matter of quarantine in an area within a State. There is no doubt as to the power we possess, except as to whether we can, as a Commonwealth, deal with a disease which breaks out on land, and is for the time conStates. fined to a particular State. I do not say that it is so, but it may be that as regards is dealing with another point. The memthat particular phase of the question we must rely entirely on the word "" quarantine."" of the disease can be traced to a port? oversea matter, and we might deal with it as I have said. Buti f , for some unaccountable reason, there was an outbreak of disease within a State, it might be that to deal with that' matter we should have to rely on the word "" quarantine."" out in the port of Melbourne. might be dealt with as an oversea matter. I submit that the authorities which I have quoted show that we have the power claimed, and the only question is as to whether we should exercise the power we possess in this particular instance. That is all that is at issue. My own view is that 1 if we are to prevent the spread of disease within the Commonwealth, it is absolutely essential that we should have the power, and should exercise it in case of need. If , for instance, a disease broke out in Brisbane, why should we not have power to ,deal with it if that should be necessary to prevent it spreading to the Richmond district, and sweeping the towns which are springing up in the northern parts of New South Wales. do the work thoroughly, or we should not undertake it at all. follow that because we have this power we shall exercise it in every conceivable case. Mr W. H . IRVINE -No r does it follow that because it would be a good thing to exercise the power, we therefore possess it. dealt with the question as to our having, the power, and I claim that we do possess it. A previous Attorney-General has already advised that we have full power Our powers in regard to Interunder quarantine to deal with animals and plants, and I may add that the question was considered in the Convention. If honourable members will turn to the debates of the Convention they will find that the members of the Convention believed that the word "" quarantine "" included human beings and animals. Mr W. H . IRVINE -But it does not include the regulation of traffic between bers of the Convention, when they adopted! this part of section 51 of the Constitution, believed that the word ""quarantine"" included animals as well as human beings. O'Connor submitted a proposal at the Convention to limit it to imports of animals, and it was rejected. that it was understood to include plants ? but I say the power does. taking power to deal with plants. say that the inclusion of plant life was contemplated at the Convention? well as men were mentioned by the members of the Convention as included under the word ""quarantine."" In proof of that statement, I can refer honourable members to page 1072 of the debates of the second Convention held at Sydney in 1897. I find that Mr O'Connor saidThe sub-clause as it stands now provides for the quarantine of animals. and Mr Isaacs saidI believe it would include the quarantine of animals if . those animals when slaughtered 1 would go into consumption as food, and might thereby affect the public health. that ? sent Mr Justice Isaacs.",59,William Lyne I T Would Be Laws Of Each State

He has told us of the perfunctory manner in which the medical examinations of ships' passengers and crews is often conducted. According to him, all that a well-groomed man has to do is to sit still while the doctor walks past him, while second class passengers and the crew have to file past the doctor, and put out their tongues. The honourable member does not often make alarming statements; but what he said on this subject is distinctly alarming. tine laws loosely, the Commonwealth should take control of quarantine, and provide for the effective inspection and examination of I do not think that new arrivals. The honourable and learned member for Flinders, and the AttorneyI believe that if the General, have both presented long and intricate arguments, one trying to show that the Commonwealth has not the power to pass this B ill , and the other that it has the power.

TheI t will not be, unhonorable and learned member for Flinders doubts the constitutionality of the measure, and suggests that the Minister should hasten slowly with it ; indeed, that he should put It is very plain that it aside because it may be unconstitutional.

That would be a most humiliating position for the Parliament to occupy. MrW . H .

He certainly got the horse in the right position when he said that the States Departments should be taken over first; but he would not allow it to be harnessed, because he objects to the passing of the necessary machinery legislation. I think that the Government have done right in bringing the measure forward. The objections which have been urged against it were urged against the Customs Bill and the Commerce Bill. The Attorney-General, however, has proved that we have already exercised the Constitutional powers under which this measure has been introduced, and, in the end, the honourable and learned member for Flinders admitted that the intention of the Minister is not a bad one. The advice of the legal fraternity is altogether too subtle for the lay mind. The honourable and learned member at first seemed to find everything as wrong as could be, but finally he seemed to think that everything is as right as possible. You, Mr Speaker, are a recognised authority on constitutional questions. Although you have not upon you the guinea stamp of the lawyer, you possess common sense and much experience of public life, and you have sided with those who think that the Commonwealth can exercise these powers. hear more about the constitutionality of the measure, but will proceed to pass it. The honourable member for Hunter has shown us that the present system is so lax that the most pernicious diseases might be introduced into the Commonwealth notwithstanding the medical inspection which takes place. If the States are lax in the exercise of their quarantine powers, the sooner the Commonwealth takes over the administration of quarantine matters the better. Concerning Inter-State matters, of which the honourable member for Maranoa spoke this afternoon, I would point out that prior to Federation some of the States endeavoured, by means of Stock Acts, to give effect to the object which we are endeavouring to attain by this Bill. When the first outbreak of bubonic plague occurred in New South Wales the present Minister of Trade and Customs took steps to quarantine almost the whole of one portion of the waterside of Sydney. But he did not take that action until nearly every member of the New South Wales Parliament had signed.a "" round robin "" in favour of that course being adopted. I mention this matter, not for the purpose of injuring the prestige of the Minister in charge of this Bill, but with a view to showing that a process of quarantine was adopted by the State on that occasion. I quite agree with the Attorney-General that the Commonwealth would not be likely to interfere in any Inter-State matter relating to quarantine unless it became of a serious character owing to it being apparent that a disease was likely to spread to the injury of other portions of the Commonwealth. In such a contingency, it would be our bounden duty to take whatever steps might be deemed necessary. I am pleased indeed that at the seventh year of its existence the Commonwealth is about to exercise some of the more important powers with which the Constitution has clothed it. In the past we have exercised powers of a more ""showy"" or glittering character, but personally I cannot imagine anything more important than a Commonweal th quarantine law. The sooner we exercise the legitimate powers conferred upon us by the Constitution, the sooner will this Parliament be recognised as the supreme Parliament of Australia^ I have listened to some very interesting contributions to this debate, notably to two which dealt almost exclusively with the I hope that we shall not legal aspect of our position in regard to quarantine. As a layman, I do not profess to be able to follow the views advanced by the honourable and learned member for Flinders and the honourable and learned member for Parkes. I could, however, follow the reasoning of the honourable member for Dalley, who, after indulging in a splendid eulogy of the Bill, slyly gave it "" a dig under the ribs."" The Minister of Trade and Customs, when introducing the measure, indicated that there was some doubt about the exact meaning of the word ' ' quarantine "" and of the power of this Parliament to deal with the matter. I have a vivid recollection that in the Melbourne session of the Federal Convention certain matters were discussed in sections. For example, the provisions of the Constitution relating to financial matters were grouped together, others relating to quarantine were similarly grouped. Paragraph 7 of section 51 deals with light-houses, light-ships,",65,William Lyne Probabl Y The Tion Has Been Referred To The High Court

510,Mr Tille Y Brown (Indi) [9.48],"beacons and buoys, paragraph 8 with astronomical and meteorological observations, and paragraph 9 with quarantine. I am quite certain that the framers of our Constitution never contemplated that this Parliament should talke over all minor matters connected with the States quarantine service. The word ""quarantine"" has a very wide application. Had it ever been intended that this Parliament should take oyer everything connected with quarantine in the various States, it would have been clearly specified in the Constitution. I do not know very much about the quarantine laws operative in Western Australia, and I dare say that the representatives of that State are equally unfamiliar with Victorian legislation in regard to this matter. It has occurred to me that, when a Bill of this character was to be introduced, it would be wise to distribute, for the information of honourable members, a synopsis of the legislation in force in the various States. It cannot be denied that this Bill is a contentious one. The debate which has already taken place demonstrates that honourable members are in doubt as to our powers in respect of quarantine, and it is certainly undesirable to create any friction with the States. Personally, I do not think that taking over the States services of quarantine in their entirety, and centralizing their administration in Melbourne, would be a wise step. To my mind, mischievous legislation of that sort will not advance the interests of the Commonwealth. Only the other night I heard the Minister of Trade and Customs priding himself upon the provisions of the Navigation Bill which is shortly ""to be introduced, and which gives effect to the decisions arrived at by the Conference recently held in London. But I venture to say that if we are not very careful, instead of attracting shipping to our shores, we shall drive it away. good deal of friction already exists in shipping circles. The three miles' limit is not quite acceptable to a large number. The Bill immediately under consideration bristles with penalties. Clause 36, which is a very important one, providesWhen a vessel is ordered into quarantine, the issues. In the first place, it relates to overmaster thereof shall forthwith cause the vessel sea quarantine,, applying to the quarantinand all persons and goods on board the vessel to be conveyed into such quarantine station as ing of human beings, animals, and plants. the quarantine officer directs, there to perforin There is also a proposal to deal with the quarantine. Penalty : Five hundred pounds. That clause would place in the hands of a antining of animals passing between one "" Jack-in-office ""-whos e action, in all proState and another, or between different bability, would be uncontrolled by reason parts of one State. I am entirely in accord of the distance of the port from the Seat of Government-the power to put ships coming to this country to incalculable trouble. Altogether, the measure deals with very important principles, which have been clearly laid down by the honourable and learned member for Flinders and the Attorney General. There is an old axiom, with which we are all familiar, that "" delay is the fundamental principle of the British Constitution."" I venture to say that if we have a little delay in connection with this Bill, it will be better for all concerned. I entirely agree that this Parliament should exercise the power of quarantine in respect of oversea ships, and also have supervision over the introduction from abroad of animal and plant life that is likely to be detrimental. But the States authorities have a more immediate local knowledge of what ts necessary to eradicate the phylloxera and other pests than a Commonwealth Department could hope to possess. Practically every pest in Australia has been introduced. The rabbits, the foxes, the sparrows, and nearly every other pest, were brought in, and I should be sorry to think it might be said at some future time that, by unduly hurrying the passing of legislation of this kind, we had caused the Federal Parliament to be regarded as still another pest. I wish to deal briefly with one or two questions to which this very important Bill gives rise; but do not propose to make any reference to the constitutional point which has already been ably dealt with by several honourable members, and in respect of which we find, as usual, a difference of legal opinion. I may say at once that I see ahead of us a very expensive lawsuit if the Bill be passed in its present form. The High Court will probably be appealed to, A and we shall be subjected to innumerable charges. I wish, however, to deal with the Bill from the stand-point of its expediency or otherwise. Is it expedient at the present time to pass such a measure? From what has been said during the debate it is obvious that it involves three main health laws of the various States, and further that the Bill shall apply to the quar-",66,William Lyne Probabl Y The Tion Has Been Referred To The High Court
511,Mr Fairbairn (Fawkner) [9.57],"with the proposal that the Commonwealth shall deal with oversea quarantine, whether it relates to the quarantining of human beings, animals, or plants. It is in the common interest of every State that we should endeavour to prevent the introduction of diseases or pests. All the States have a common desire to exclude every class of diseaseand pest, and thereests of the two States are, to some extent, fore I think that the carrying out of such a conflicting. If the Federal Government work is distinctly a Commonwealth function. I do not agree,, however, with the proposition that we should interfere with the displease another, and bring about a good work of the States in respect to health inspection. That is too diverse a matter for Commonwealth administration. I also object most strongly to the measures necessary for stamping out the noxious diseases which infect animals in the different States being intrusted to the Commonwealth, and I speak as one who has had some experience. The honourable member for Maranoa has made special reference to the tick pest, and the point I wish to make in this regard is that Federal action should be in the comtions."" mon interests of all the States. It is certhese matters are arranged. tainly in the interests of the States that such a pest should be stamped out, but 1 should like to remind honourable members that Queensland does not stand in exactly the position occupied by New South Wales, so far as the presence of tick in cattle is concerned. well over the whole of Queensland. of the Darling Downs is free from the pest. It is only on the coast that it is to be found. honourable member. I know that the Dest is prevalent at Clermont and CunnamuII'a. all over Queensland. South Wales is naturally most anxious to exclude the tick pest from its territory, and South Wales. The tick pest would thus be representatives of South Australia and Westspread. ern Australia have already pointed out that their States are deeply concerned in the work of excluding from their midst the various fruit pests prevalent in other States. The measures necessary for this work can be better carried out by the States themselves. can administer the law in this regard far better than we could hope to administer it from one centre, perhaps thousands of miles away from the point at which the trouble existed. Another consideration is that the States have varying interests. Pastoralists and others in Queensland naturally desire to send their cattle to Sydney, Melbourne, and other markets, and are therefore interested in the passing of their stock over the borders. The people of New South Wales, on the other hand, are vitally interested in the exclusion of tick-infested stock from their territory, so that the intertook in hand the work of dealing with the whole question, they might please one State, deal of friction. ation. The Federal Government misrht propose to take drastic steps to confine tickinfested cattle to one area, and in the event of their attempting anything of the kind the representatives of the State concerned would probably say to them, "" We shall have to oppose you in regard to this or that measure if you do not relax your regulaYou know, Mr Speaker, how tomed to that sort of thing. leave the Minister of Trade and Customs to look after such matters. The tick pest extends fairly after a good many things. human nature to proceed as I have indicated, and I suppose the Minister is not immune from such considerations. The representatives of Queensland, in the event of action such as I have indicated being taken, would bring a good deal of pressure to bear upon the Government, with the result that they might become rather conciliatory in their dealings with the people of that State, and be tempted to allow cattle from Queensland to travel all over NewI see much difficulty and danger in the way of the Commonwealth assuming these responsibilities.

If the Government desire to pass this measure, they must confine it solely to what the people understand by the term, "" oversea shipping."" There is no difference of opinion amongst the States as to the desirability of Federal control of oversea quarantine; and honourable members will be prepared, on that basis, to pass the second reading, and carry the Bill through Committee as rapidly as the Minister may wish, in order to make way for the Tariff Bill. Sir WILLIAM LYNE bers will do that, the B ill will not occupy much time. Minister is burning with desire to introduce the TariffB ill , which I hope will soon be dealt with. As I say, all the States desire a proper oversea quarantine for human beings, animals, and plants, so that fresh pests-and goodness knows we have enough already !-shal l not be introduced into Australia. If the measure be limited to that end, it will have a very rapid passage, and the result will be an It is to a small exenactment in the interests of the whole of the community. \ At this late hour it is not my intention to do more than offer a short expression of opinion on the B ill . This subject was The Victor' dealt with by me during my election tour; and I feel that I must say a few words. The constitutional aspect of the matter has been fairly dealt with this evening; and I am inclined to believe, from the various arguments adduced-althoug h I speak with a certain amount of diffidence in this connection-that the measure is constitutional. It seems to me that, even on the part of the Government, there is some uncertainty or doubt as to how far the Bill is to go. HonI f the Government orable members have, so far, not had any very clear exposition as to how far the functions of the Commonwealth and the different States are to be modified or extended. It might be possible to adjust the powers satisfactorily, in much the same way as the powers of the States ParliaT h e rabbit pest ments, the Boards of Health, and the municipal councils, which administer the health laws and stock diseases quarantine at the present time, are adjusted. If the measure is to be effective, the Federal Parliament will have to take the responsibility of relieving the States of their functions in regard to quarantine laws and the spread of disease in plants and stock, as well as amongst human beings. That, I believe, would be a proper thing to do, because it is highly desirable that we should have uniformity of administration; and I refer more particularly to the prevention of stock diseases. It is generally agreed that the quarantine in respect to human beings, especially oversea quarantine, should be administered by the Commonwealth; but the question of the inspection of stock, and the prevention of stock diseases, is one in which this House is particularly interested. Australia is the greatest stock-producing country in the If honourable memworld, and, owing to the munificence of our climate and our great grazing possibilities, we keep rapidly adding to our stock, I know that the and it becomes necessary that we should have uniformity of laws, regardless of State boundaries. If a i l to appreciate the difficulties that have been ihinted at respecting the proper administration of a Quarantine Act by the Federal Parliament: In my opinion, there will be no more difficulty in efficiently administering a Quarantine Act than there is at the present time in controlling the Department of Trade and",68,William Lyne Probabl Y The Tion Has Been Referred To The High Court

531,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [10.5],"Customs or the Post and Telegraph Department; and it is just as necessary that there should be uniformity in stock inspecttion, as in connection with either of the two great Departments I have mentioned. Most of us can only speak from our actual experience in our own State; and I can say that in many instances the administration of the laws relating to stock has been most unsatisfactory in Victoria. Private individuals have embarked their wealth in providing Victoria some of the finest cattle and sheep in the world; and yet, at the present time, there are now stock inspectors who know little or nothing of stock diseases. quired to put the supervision on a proper basis is thoroughly qualified men, and my opinion is that .throughout the Commonwealth there ought to be veterinary surgeons as Government stock inspectors. known stock inspectors, who came into a district to report on an epidemic, to have no and dissatisfaction with the administration technical knowledge of, and no power of diagnosing certain' diseases. The opinions of these inspectors have proved to be fallacious respecting epidemics, and, altogether, I think that the taking over of the administration of the quarantine laws by the Commonwealth will result in uniformity, greater efficiency, and the prevention of the spread of disease. then be possible to appoint a class of men thoroughly qualified to investigate outbreaks this complicated subject, so as to be in a of disease, and to suggest means for their remedy and prevention. I hope that, when the Bill gets into Committee, we mav make certain modifications in it ; but with the general principle of the measure I cordially agree. the desire is to pass the second reading of the Bill to-night, but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to the fact that a feeling has been expressed by one or two honourable members that the Bill will result in increasing unnecessarily the governmental machinery, and the imposing of an additional burden on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. DidI understand the Minister, at an earlier stage of the. debate, to assure honourable members that the object of the Government was not to unnecessarily increase the public expenditure, or the machinery of administration ? arise which are not dealt with by the States, this measure until we have had time for I should say the cost of administration will be reduced. sure, create a new Department; and if that Department is to be on the same scale as some of the other transferred Departments I am afraid it will mean a largely increased expenditure. Therefore, while anxious to see what I regard as one of the most important functions of the Commonwealth taken over, I am only doing my duty in protesting against any unnecessary increase in the expenditure. I agree with the honwith orable and learned member for Flinders, who, in his excellent speech this evening, expressed the opinion that all the objects which the Government have in view might What is rehave been secured by simply giving official notice by proclamation, and introducing a machinery measure which would have kept us in good favour with the various States. BecauseI do say that at the present I have moment we ought to act with caution, so as not to increase that feeling of discontent of Commonwealth affairs which is growing up in the individual States. On these two grounds I ask Ministers to have regard to the representations which have been made, and to give the House an opportunity to consider the details of the measure carefully before we approach it in Committee. We should, I consider, have an interval of It would at least a fortnight. Personally I wish to consult expert authorities in connection with position, if necessary,, to submit amendments. I know that other members are in the same position. In refraining from prolonging the debate, we are justified in asking the Minister in charge of the Bill to give us an undertaking that he will not proceed further with this important and complicated measure, affecting as it does so many great interests, until we have had a full opportunity of considering what readjustments we have to suggest in connection with it. think that nearly all honourable members are agreed that this is a measure which is not only one that the Commonwealth has ful l power to tackle, but one which should be grappled with at the earliest possible moment. But beyond the real reason for this proposal-that is to say, beyond quarantine in its original and usually accepted sense -honorabl e members seem to differ as to whether or not we ought to proceed with reflection. For instance, the honourable member who has just resumed his seat has",69,William Lyne Probabl Y The Tion Has Been Referred To The High Court

The honourable member who preceded him took up the same position; and honourable members all round the Chamber seem to be in a certain difficulty as to whether we have or have not the constitutional authority to take over these new powers. stances, I feel sure that the Minister will see that it is inadvisable l o force the B ill through. anxious to assist in passing a measure of this kind, which has no party complexion; but in view of the fair expressions of opinion which have emanated from all sides, and the general desire to assist the Government in the action they are taking, it is only right that the Minister should consent at any rate to a reasonable adjournment after the second reading has been taken. My honourable friend the member for Kooyong suggested that the Government should allow a fortnight to elapse. I do not know whether any particular period is a fair one to ask for, but I hope the Minister will tell us that he is prepared to postpone the consideration of the B ill in Committee for a reasonable time. Sir WILLIAM LYNE proceed with the Bill to-imorrow. the point, but I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us in his reply that he proposes to give the House that opportunity which it has asked for in a reasonable way. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) [10.20] -In reference to the question of postponing the ""consideration of the Bill in Committee, I consider that a fortnight, as asked for by the honourable member for Kooyong, would be too long. 'House has ness. themselves to this Bill it will take a very short time to compass the whole of the intended powers. I do not propose to proceed with the B ill tq-morrow, although it will be put on the notice paper. The probabilities are that we shall not proceed with it for perhaps a week. I certainly would not agree to adjourn the Committee stage for more than a week, and I cannot make any promise of a definite time. Probably it will be Tuesday next before the Bill comes on again, I recognise that it contains important provisions, and while I do not wish to delay its passage, I have no desire to hurry it unduly. Statements have been made as to our rights in connection with quarantine. I feel that the question of in terpreting the meaning of the word is one which finally will have to be decided by_ the High Court. One lawyer may say that what is proposed in this B ill does not properly come within the category of Commonwealth legislation. Another may say Under these circumthat it does. We are entitled to take the powers which appear to this Parliament to be within the Commonwealth All honourable members are Constitution if we so desire. The argument used by the honourable member for Flinders, would not, in my opinion, have been used if he had been in this Parliament from the beginning. The same question has been raised many times. In almost every case where we have taken over Departments from the States before we passed a law dealing with the matters in question, we have found their administration to be most difficult. It has, therefore, been determined by the Government that except perhaps in extreme cases, we should not assume any of our powers under the Constitution without first passing an Act. There is another Federal power similar to the one which we are now proposing to exercise, namely, that relating to beacons, buoys, and I do not propose to lighthouses. I wanted the Government eighteen months ago to take over those I do not wish to labour works by proclamation, but after a very f u l l discussion, and in the light of what had taken place previously, the Government decided that it was far better to pass a law and have the whole matter done in order, so that we could adminster the works under the law of the Commonwealth, and avoid the difficulty of administering them in accordance with the six different laws of six disintegrated States. Mr W. H. IRVINE I think we all I presume that the agree with that. The question is : Are the assembled to do busiGovernment going to bring this Bill into If honourable members apply operation before they take over the department of quarantine ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I cannot give a distinct promise to that effect. But I can say what is likely to be the result if the Bill passes as it stands, or if its main principles are accepted. Negotiations will at once be opened with the States Governments as to what shall be done, and what they are prepared to do in connection with its administration, before we take any action under the B ill . That is the course I adopted in connection with the Commerce Act. When the same question cropped up in that case, I communicated with the States Governments with most satisfactory results, ultimately,",70,William Lyne Probabl Y The Tion Has Been Referred To The High Court
536,Mr Kelly,"because at the present moment it is the States authorities who are practically administering that Act. Though, of course, we hold the power in case they do not do what is right to step in and interfere, I have been exceedingly cautious never to interfere with the States authorities if I can help it, and so long as they are properly administering the Commonwealth law. little pressure upon them in connection with the Commerce Act. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The honourable member will excuse me I put a little pressure upon a few gentlemen who desired to defeat the Act, but not upon the States authorities. As the honourable member is aware, I even made a certain arrangement with the Government of New South Wales, in which State there was perhaps more antagonism shown to the Act than in any of the other States. The States authorities of New South' Wales are practically administering the Commerce Act now in that State, but we are paying the expense of administration, which, in the case of New South Wales, has been increased, because that State did not previously employ as many inspectors as were employed in Victoria and some of the other States. the Minister is that he will do anything he has to do. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I shall try to. I wish to explain to the honourable member for Flinders that the Government have no intention whatever to issue a proclamation taking over the matter of quarantine until they have negotiated with the States, and, if possible, come to an arrangement with them which, in the great majority of cases, will lead to the law being administered by the States authorities rather than by the Commonwealth. There is a good reason for this, inasmuch as we cannot, and do not, propose to interfere with the States Boards pf Health. To create new Boards of Health for the Commonwealth would involve great expense, and might not be as successful in achieving the object we have in view. I anticipate that the quarantine law will practically be administered by the existing States Boards of Health, and all that the Commonwealth Government desire to do is to exercise a controlling power. So long as they can make arrangements with the States Governments, which will not add to the expense, but will, if possible, reduce it, in each State where they may be kept and the States authorities administer the law in its entirety, the Commonwealth Government will interfere very little. That is what is intended in connection with the practical administration of this measure. As I have said, the interpretation of the word "" quarantine"" must ultimately be a matter for the High Court, and it is therefore hardly worthwhile discussing it at length at the present stage. I point out further that when we get into Committee on the Bill, honourable members will be able to submit amendments to strike out certain clauses, or to alter the measure in any other way they think necessary. If the further consideration of the Bill is postponed for a week at most, time will be given for communication with the States Governments. They will in the meantime have an opportunity of perusing the-Bill, and when we get into Committee we can deal with any objections which may be raised by the States authorities or by outside persons. In regard to the remarks made by the honourable member for Hunter, I may say that at present the States do not deal with consumption and other diseases in the way he suggests they should be dealt with under this Bill. the Commonwealth should not deal with them. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I admit that, but I wish to make it clear that if we have to deal with many other subjects, and incur the expense of detailed examinations when ships arrive at our ports to prevent the landing of persons suffering from the diseases referred to by the honourable member, the cost involved in the administration of the Bill will be more than is estimated at the present time, and in such circumstances I am not to be held to the statement that it will not amount to more than does the administration! of quarantine under existing conditions. cost. pared to discuss the scientific points raised by the honourable member, but I would say that so many (persons suffer from consumption that to adopt his suggestion would be to exclude a very great number of people from landing on our shores. I think that a better way in which to deal with that disease is not to exclude persons suffering from it, but to set apart places under strict quarantine.

In mv opinion, the present stage is a purelv formal one, to which no honourable member has any right to offer factious opposition, because the principles of the measure concerned can be discussed on the motion for its second reading; but the Ministry having reported progress on another measure at this stage, it is unreasonable for them to proceed with the Bounties Bill. The leader of the House should tell us why this step has been taken at this late hour. of Trade and Customs) [10.57] I a m prised at the captious remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I was desirous of proceeding further with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway SurveyB ill ; but, as it was probable that the motion concerning it would provoke a long debate, lasting until the early hours of the morning, and I did not wish to keep the House late, I allowed an adjournment on the understanding that there would be no opposition to the introduction and the first reading, of the Bounties Bill. If I had persisted in going on with the other Bill, we might have been here all night without getting anything done. HadI thought that anything would be gained in persisting with the other Bill,. I should have gone on, as the honourable member knows. The step I took was in the interests of the Railway Survey Bill. If there is a second reading debate on the motion for .consideration in Committee of the Governor General's message, it may shorten the discussion on the second reading. At any rate, it is not because I wish to keep back the Bill that I have taken the course with which the honourable member finds fault. surer) [11.1] -It is well known that I take a great deal of interest in the project of a railway to connect the eastern and western/ States of Australia.; but I do not think that fault can justly be found with the Minister's action in regard to postponing the discussion on it until to-morrow. While it is somewhat unusual to discuss in Committee the motion for the consideration of the Governor General's message recommending an appropriation for a Bill, honourable members have a perfect right to discuss it if they choose to do so, and I do not object to the exercise of that right in regard to this Bill. able members be consistent and discuss both Bills in Committee? present Western Australia are no doubt a little sensitive on this subject, and feel that this railway proposal should not receive more adverse attention than other measures of the Government. I am sorry that the acting leader of the Opposition has not allowed the present stage to be taken as formal, deferring the discussion of the measure until the second reading; but while I was at first somewhat irritated at the adsurjournment of the debate, I feel now that honourable members are strictly within their rights in the action they have taken, and I am most anxious not to appear as beintr desirous of interfering with those rights. When the leader of the Government intimated a few minutes ago that the discussion on the Railway Survey Bill would be adjourned, the Treasurer was unmistakably disgusted; but some one has since whispered something into his ear, and now he is an apologist for the action which offended him only a fewminutes since. This sudden change of attitude is only in keeping with his political conduct during the past few months. But whatever attitude the Treasurer may take, the Government had no right to allow the Opposition to control the business. From the Opposition point of view, what happened is right enough, and if I were a member of the Opposition I should be extremely pleased. The Opposition has only threatened to make a little trouble, and Ministers have thrown up their hands and said, "" Don't shoot! "" If the desire of the Minister was simply to let honourable members away early, what justification had he in proceeding to deal with another measure? The Minister of Trade and Customs may arrogate to himself the right to'specially lecture me as often as he chooses, but that will not deter me from expressing my opinion upon the actions of the Government. I utterly fail to see that there is any more urgency for the passing of this Bill than there was for passing the measure which' preceded it upon the business paper. If the Government have realized that it is time the "" tired "" contingent from Sydney were allowed to leave for their homes, there is nothing upon that paper the consideration of which cannot be deferred until to-morrow.
