It is right there on the public record; it cause that was the source of Nick Bolkus is right up front; it is the centrepiece of the himself getting hold of the material-to make story. the critical point that this material was out. Then this article went to the location of the It was extraordinary that it was out in the assets. We are told that there was a lot of public domain.

At the time of his death, Maurie was the Newcastle and northern regions branch secretary of the A WU and state president of the AWU. Maurie knew he had cancer for over three years, yet he led his union in very difficult negotiations with the federal government and BHP over the closure of the steelworks in Newcastle. As a former official of FIME I knew Maurie well. I found him to be a good, decent Australian who at all times put the interests of his members before his own welfare. Maurie had two great loves outside his immediate family. They were his union in its various formsthe Federated Iron workers, which he joined in 1970, with the amalgamation of the FIA and the ASE into FIME and, finally, the AWU-and the Australian Labor Party, in which he worked quietly to improve the living standards of people in Newcastle. As a committee member of the Newcastle Beyond 2000 group, he worked hard to attract new investment into Newcastle to create more employment, particularly for young people, for whom he had a special interest. Maurie Rudd completed his education at Bellingen High School. He worked in various callings. He started work at BHP Newcastle as a steelworker in 1970 and subsequently became BHP's sub-branch secretary of the Federated Iron workers Association, in 1976. He became a full-time national organiser of the FIA in 1984 and then assistant secretary, in 1987. He was elected as the Newcastle branch secretary of the FIA in 1989 and he was· the FIA state secretary from 1990 until the AWU amalgamation. , Maurie Rudd was a board member of Radio 2HD and past board member of the Australian Centre for Best Practice (Hunter) Labor Cooperative. His interest was in football, golf, greyhounds, horseracing, reading and politics. In June 1997, he was co-chairman of the Prime Minister's task force investigating the social and economic impact that the closure of BHP would have on Newcastle and the wider community. Australia will be the poorer for the passing of Maurie Rudd. Economy strengthened the economy in the past two years: we have the lowest inflation rate amongst major economies; in two years time we will have halved the debt to GDP ratio inherited from Labor; we will have taken a Labor $10.5 billion deficit into a budgeted surplus by next year; we have presided over interest rate reductions of four percentage points on home loans; capital expenditure figures in the past two months demonstrate the .strong confidence of the business community in the future prospects of the Australian economy; and building approvals in Australia are now 20 per cent higher than they were a year ago.",117,Notices Papers

The federal government hasThursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 633 In the Bendigo Advertiser of Wednesday, 25 February, an article by Linda Barrow appeared with the heading 'Bendigo builds a future. Private sector jobs on the rise.' This is part of 'Strategy 2000', a feature series in the Bendigo Advertiser. The article states: Bendigo is having a quiet employment revolution. While Bendigo people bemoan the loss of 1600 public sector jobs in the last few years, most do not realise an extra 3198 jobs have been created in that time ... Australi3J.l Bureau of Statistics figures show Bendigo's total employment growth outstripped the rest of Victorialin the five-year time frame from 1991 to 1996. ' Our jobs grew by a strong 5.2 per cent, while the rest of Victoria recorded just 4.1 per cent job growth. Bendigo's shining light on the employment front was the work of its private sector. I spoke in this chamber yesterday about the increase in private sector jobs in the telecommunications industry. Obviously that is reflected in these figures. Mr Sawford. I look forward to serving it for a good time yet, probably about another 12 months. I look forward to that. A total of 3,198 new jobs were created in the private sector. This is all good news for Bendigo. The article goes on to say that the Chief Executive Officer of the City of Greater Bendigo, Hadley Sides, said: ... the figures showed Bendigo had quietly moved from a ""public sector town"" which was highly dependent on government jobs, to a region which could generate its own employment and sustain its own industries. Banking Regional Australia put to the House of Representatives inquiry into financial institutions and public administration which covers alternative means of providing banking and like services in regional Australia. I found the submissions quite interesting. Why did I find them quite interesting and why did I receive a copy? I carried out my own survey of small business and individuals in country areas in my electorate and put a submission together to put their views to the inquiry. The point I want to make is that there was only one other politician, the member for Barker, Mr Ian McLachlan, who had bothered to put something in, which shows that there must be concerns in his area as well. Yet we keep being told in this place how well the government is representing the people in regional areas. I know that those areas have just as many problems as my constituents, yet their parliamentary representatives have not seen fit to make submissions to this very important inquiry. They stand up in the parliament and argue constantly that they represent regional Australia, but they could not put their services and their minds together to put a submission to this very important inquiry. Bank closures was one of the first issues I had to address in 1993 when the Commonwealth Bank closed its doors in Queenstown-ironic, really, as that was the parliamentary seat of King O'Malley, who represented Darwin on the west coast of Tasmania, and he was instrumental in establishing the Commonwealth Bank or the 'people's bank' as he always called it.",118,Representatives Main Commitiee

My submission talks of those problems: how isolated communities have difficulties getting bank finance, the increased cost of having to use facilities outside their towns, the inadequacies of electronic banking in country areas, and the loss of privacy and the personal touch in banking-to mention a few of the views. Regional members should be more aware of what is going on in their communities and see the difficulties that many country people are having. Banking has been an area of grave disquiet. So many services are deserting the country, especially in Tasmania. We have not only lost banks, but a whole host of other services have gone. Most of all, we have lost jobs. That is a disaster, especially for our young people. SoI will be seeking to ensure that regional Tasmania, at least, is represented at this inquiry. Even if other members representing regional Australia who claim, in this government, to represent regional Australia do not, I will be in there fighting for regional Australia.(Time expired) Youth congratulations to some very hard working young people in my electorate of Forde. Young people get a bad rap sometimes these days, and the media tends to focus on the bad news stories. But this government has tremendous confidence, faith and belief in the ability and dedication of our younger generation. This is reflected in the many positive programs we have put together to benefit young people and to help them playa constructive and important role in our local communities. There is the tremendously successful work for the dole program. I am pleased to say there are two pilot programs operating in Forde, both of which have gained an enormous amount of community support. One is run by the Beaudesert based organisation Boystown and one by our local community organisation Phantast, overseen by the energetic and dedicated Calvin and June Pybus. I visited the teams of local people who are working on these programs and I am very impressed with the enthusiasm they display and the contribution they are making. I congratulate them and encourage them, and I really hope that the skills they are learning will boost their self-esteem and help them find the full-time jobs that they are seeking. But it is another hard working group of young people today that I particularly want to thank and that is the Tamborine Mountain Green Corp team, headed by supervisor Dale Treadwell and with fantastic support from Will Buck of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This team have had remarkable results with their rehabilitation, planting and revegetation programs which are helping preserve the unique Tamborine Mountain environment. They have also done a tremendous job with special projects such as the recently completed rainforest boardwalk at Mount Tamborine Primary School, designed to provide environmental education and enjoyment for local children. That is what is really special about Green Corp. It is community based and tackles practical tasks while also providing special training and employment for our young people.

(Time expired) Aircraft Noise of Australia of my intention during the next few weeks to put forward two specific private member's bills. The first bill, still to be named, will be provisionally known as the Sydney Airport Commission Bill. I will be calling for the establishment of an independent and permanent Sydney Airport Commission incorporating a panel of three commissioners with a judicial or a magisterial background to be appointed with adequate support staff and to be required to report to the federal parliament on a quarterly basis or as required by the parliament. The role of the commission is to consider flight paths and any proposed changes so as to ensure that this extremely contentious and divisive issue is removed from the political process once and for all, to allow for a clearly transparent process to be established so that flight paths are determined fairly, equitably and without fear or favour. Also that an appeal mechanism be incorporated to ensure that any objections received are given a fair hearing. One million Sydneysiders have had enough of political interference by successive governments and the intrusion in their lives by changing flight paths to suit hidden agendas. Additionally, an overarching planning body is urgently required to oversee all air and surface transport planning in the Sydney region. The three tiers of government need to be working closely together to avoid such messes as we are now fighting. I will be incorporating that provj-ion as a recommendation. The other bill which will be in bill form, or in a similar format, will seek to establish a magisterial inquiry into the unsatisfactory process that has led to the formulation of the long term operating plans for Sydney airport. The long-term operating plan has had a very detrimental effect on large numbers of Sydney residents because of aircraft noise and air pollution and substantially increases the genuine fear held by those under the flight paths of the risk of a plane crash. Conversely, some other areas have received overly generous reductions resulting in understandable accusations of political bias. There is an undeniably widely-held view that the LTOP is unsustainable because of the alleged political manipulation of the process. The one million aircraft noise and air pollution affected residents of Sydney are entitled to know the facts, such as: is there is any truth to the allegations that the LTOP was put together by Airservices Australia under the direct direction of the former minister for transport, John Sharp? Is it true that the published draft document was seen by the task force only a matter of hours before publication? The work of the environment subcommittee ceased at that time. No mention was made of the defined impact criteria. Why did the community consultation process not provide essential measures of the environmental impact of the proposals and their alternatives together with proposed selection criteria?

(Time expired) Families do in this place is develop policies and legislation which strengthen the family unit. Certainly, one of my major concerns has been families in my electorate of MacquarieWhip. The traditional families in my electorate and the battling single parent families have all had to cope over a long period of time with changes in society-changing economic circumstances; changes to family law, changing value systems and the changing influence of the media-and an increase in pressures that have made it more and more difficult for families to cope. I thought after two years in government that it was an appropriate time to look back and see what sort of progress this government has made in helping our families. I am quite encouraged by the significant progress that has occurred, firstly in tackling some of the symptoms of family breakdown and secondly in tackling some of the causes of family breakdown. Regarding the symptoms of family breakdown, the government has helped families with its tough on drugs strategy where $90 million will be spent over three years. I am especially pleased to see an emphasis on education and treatment for those people who have suffered. There have also been changes to child support arrangements to help accommodate noncustodial parents. Also, $19 million has been provided for youth counselling projects and prevention of youth suicide projects to help those young people who are often the victims of family breakdown. There has been a great deal of progress, and there will be more to come, on tackling the causes of family breakdown. There is the need to reform our economic system to provide hope and security for our battling families. The government has made progress in reducing unemployment from 8.6 per cent to 8.1 per cent. There is the growth in apprenticeships and traineeships particularly to provide hope for our young people. There is the $1 billion family tax package designed to help those families on low and middle incomes, and particularly those families where there is only one income. The family tax package provides greater choice for families where one parent wants to stay at home to look after the children. There is the great benefit stemming from low interest rates that is saving families with mortgages hundreds of dollars a month and thereby reducing their debt. There is the domestic violence strategy where $25 million has been provided to protect women. There have been greater censorship controls on violence. The government has introduced firearms control, and there has been a return to an emphasis on responsibilities and obligations rather than a preoccupation with rights. There is plenty more to do. Obviously, this government intends to pursue that and there are many more challenges ahead for society as a whole. We need to change our priorities and our",121,Representatives Main Committee

Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November 1997, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. opposition will be supporting the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Amendment Bill 1997. By way of background, where Commonwealth employees, including parliamentarians, are convicted of an offence and the Attorney-General is of the opinion that the offence is a corruption offence, then the Attorney-General may instruct the Director of Public Prosecutions to make an application to the court for the Commonwealth component of thy employee's superannuation to be forfeited. That is the nub of what we are discussing now. A loophole has recently come to light whereby, before being convicted, a Commonwealth employee may avoid this process by rolling over their superannuation benefit into a superannuation fund beyond the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. This bill proposes to close this loophole and provide additional powers to freeze assets after a person has been chargt:d with a corruption offence by amending the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 and the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to allow the following: tracing and recovery of Commonwealth funded superannuation benefits that have been paid to rollover institutions; the official trustee of a superannuation fund to take custody and control of restrained property and sell it in accordance with a superannuation order; temporary suspension of an employee's employer financed superannuation benefits; facilitation of the provision of information to the Commonwealth by superannuation entities, and simplification of the way information is provided to a court that certifies the amount of a person's superannuation benefits. As I said earlier, this legislation may have application to the recovery of Commonwealth funded superannuation benefits of current and former parliamentarians who have been, or are about to be, charged with a corruption offence, provided the superannuation benefit has not yet been rolled over or a conviction made. We, on the opposition side, think that this is an important measure and that is why it is being supported by the opposition. It is appropriate that it apply also to parliamentarians because we do not want double standards in this regard. There needs to be equality right across the sector. We are part of the public sector. We are elected, but we are part of the sector that services the community. There is not much more to say. We welcome this initiative. It may well have application in relation to other matters that are current at this point in time. I do not prejudge that. I do not prejudge anything in relation to this, but this is a weapon that the Attorney-General should have. It is appropriate that the Attorney-General is armed with this weapon because it is about closing loopholes. We should not be stopping just at closing this loophole. There are other loopholes.

268,Mr Melham (Banks) (9.58 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I indicate at the outset that the638 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,S March 1998 where the case can be made out. In this instance, it has. In other instances, we believe that the case has not been made out. We are not into suspicion. We are not into innuendo. We are n'ot into the presumption of guilt before the case has been made out according to proper standards. You must have proper standards because we inherited the British system of justice, the golden thread that says there is a presumption of innocence and the Crown bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt. If there is a reasonable doubt, an acquittal then follows. This is not the French system where we seek the truth. This is an adversarial system. This provision is necessary because it does not presume one thing or another. But if a conviction subsequently flows, then the circumstances of the matter can be taken into account by the Attorney-General. It might not necessarily be used in some instances. The Attorney-General should have that discretion because different instances have different facts. That is why you have a discretion. We do not believe in things just automatically flowing in this area. There is that cautionary note. It is not expected by the opposition that the DPP or the Attorney-General, in terms of their discretions, will also exercise discretion one way all the time. That is why you have a discretion for whatever office. Whether the DPP decide to prosecute or not, that is their discretion alone and it can be judged on the circumstances, the same as for the Attorney General in terms of his ability to form a view. We take the view-and I put -on record here-it is not upon opinion polls and the community standard which Attorney-General or the DPP should act if he invokes this section. It is not a standard that should be a higher standard for a parliamentarian or a public official . as against another public servant. It has got to be the same standard, because I rem-mber a Director of Public· Prosecutions in an earlier time evoking a higher standard for public officials. I remember my outrage at the time when I saw a double standard. The argument back then was, 'Well, we will prosecute to clear the air.' That is not the discretion; that should not be a factor in the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney-General exercising any discretion. And, particularly, it should not be the factor if this section is invoked that, because it is a public official, this section will necessarily be invoked or because it is a popular public official that this section will not necessarily be invoked. It has got to be a proper discretion that is exercised-a proper use of this power. That is why it should not be mandatory or automatically flowing. I do not believe in mandatory sentences. I do not believe in one strike and you are in automatically or three strikes and you are in automatically. If we do, then give the judiciary a miss and let us put in computers. Then all you need to do is pump in the charge, do not worry about the circumstances of the case and feed it all out. I do not want it to be thought that because we support this particular provision-and we do unreservedly-that we say it should be exercised in every instance; each case must be taken on its merits. What worries me, and not only in relation to this, is that there is a double standard out there at the moment. There is a double standard that flows from the fourth arm, the fourth estate, the gallery. I believe strongly in the presumption of innocence. I believe strongly in those who accuse bearing the burden and putting the evidence up or shutting up. That is why I am happy and the opposition is happy to support this particular proposal. It is necessary because of the Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 639 loophole but it is something that the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions should, and I trust will, exercise on the merits of each case. I raised the earlier incident only because I disagreed very strongly with what the then Director of Public Prosecutions had to say over a decade ago when basically the policy was that, if you were a prominent public official, you would be prosecuted to clear the air. That is not a proper standard and it has been subsequently abandoned, as I understand it, as it should have been. Melham) has stolen a bit of my thunder in relation to what he just observed and I find myself in agreement with him. In particular, I am reminded of a statement made recently about people on crusades. Those sorts of people are usually so fired up with their own moral superiority that they do not think about what they are doing; they .also tend to be careless with the truth. That was said by Ron Brunton, the anthropologist. I do think it has some application to what the honourable member has just said. Having gone through the aftermath of the Fitzgerald inquiry as counsel for a number of people who were charged after that particular inquiry, I saw there was an evangelical zeal that was exercised on the part of the Office of Special Prosecutor, the office set up to prosecute those who were charged with official corruption and other offences in the aftermath of that particular inquiry. That inquiry did have some greatly beneficial effects in Queensland, in so far as it exposed official corruption at a very high level. Indeed, the police commissioner at the time, Sir Terence Lewis, ultimately was charged with a number of counts of official corruption and, after a lengthy trial, was convicted. I might say that there has been some recent press in relation to his being in prison, and suggestions have been made by Professor Paul Wilson that it is about time Lewis was released, because he is a political prisoner. I reject that notion, in the case of that particular prisoner. He received a fair trial. In fact, the trial judge in that case was His Honour Judge Tony Healy, who, in my opinion, is one of the fairest judges on the criminal court district court bench. Indeed, many thought with some horror during the course of that trial-when he ruled out some evidence in relation to Sir Terence Lewis's diaries as corroboration for the offences-that a conviction might well not be made because of that ruling, so fair was His Honour during the course of that trial. However, Sir Terence was convicted. He was represented by extremely experienced counsel in John Jerrard QC, and I do not think anyone could have got a fairer trial in those circumstances. There are many judges who would not have ruled that evidence out. As a result of all of that, he was convicted. The process was very much cleansed by that conviction. But there were other people involved in those particular matters surrounding the police commissioner. More removed from him were those who were caught up in what I might call a spiritual oil spill: the evangelistic zeal of the Office of Special Prosector spread out like a spiritual oil spill and captured in its tentacles a number of people that, in my opinion, ought not to have been so captured. That is why I do endorse some of the remarks of the honourable member for Banks about that, because it is true that the prosecutorial authorities, be they the Director of Public Prosecutions or counsel briefed privately to prosecute, must be extremely careful of the political pressure that can be brought to bear when notorious inquiries end up with individuals being charged with offences. The temptation to run the prosecution as some sort of quest to get up a score sheet is a very dangerous thing, and something that I think has no place in our law.",123,Representatives Main Committee
269,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (10.08 A.m.),"In many respects the member for Banks( Mr640 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 I do believe, with all due respect to the Office of Special Prosecutor in Queensland, that some at least of the trials in the aftermath of the Fitzgerald inquiry were proceeded with with a zeal which was unbecoming of normal criminal prosecutions. I was involved in a case called the Queen v. David Rodney Smith. It was a trial that went for nine weeks in the District Court. It had a lengthy prehistory, including what I think was a two-week committal hearing, which was stopped to take to the Court of Appeal a point that arose during the course of the committal. So it had a lengthy prehistory when it finally came to trial and the case was presented to the District Court. Really, I got the impression from time to time, from the way the case was prosecuted, that it was something akin to an accused being charged with mass murder. In actual fact, the accused was charged with official corruption. The official corruption arose out of section 121 of the criminal code, which says, inter alia: ... Any person who(i) ... being a person employed in the Public Service in any capacity not judicial for the prosecution ... of offenders, corruptly ... agrees ... to receive ... any property or benefit of any kind for himself or any other person, on account of anything already done or omitted to be done, or to be afterwards done or omitte.d to be done, by him, with a view to ... the protection of any ... intending offender from detection or punishment ... is gUilty of a criine The accused in that case was charged with receiving a benefit, namely sexual services, from prostitutes. IfI may digress for a moment, one of the amusing parts of the particular case that was argued in the legal argument preceding the trial was whether or not sexual services, for the purposes of section 121 of the Criminal Code, could be a benefit. Well do I recall the concluding remarks of Mr Griffin QC in legal argument when he suggested to Judge Margaret McMurdo that Sir Samuel Griffith, when he drafted section 121, did not have sex in mind. That did not produce a favourable response from the bench, I might say. The particular submission was ruled out. However, what I want to say about that case-it is important because it has a relationship to what we are quite rightly doing here; but what we must be careful with when we look at exercising a discretion to both apply these particular provisions that will come into law as well as prosecute-is that we should be absolutely certain that what we are doing is an offence that is capable of being corruption. In that particular case, what Mr Smith was ultimately convicted of, I have no doubt, was sex, because the issue was not corruption. The system in Queensland was that people who engaged in those practices-the brothels and so forth in Queensland-were charged on a rotational basis by arrangement. There was never any real suggestion that what was done by Mr Smith in that particular case, or what was alleged to be done-and ultimately he was convicted of it-had anything to do with corruption, but, rather, it was an arrangement which was to facilitate the system in Queensland. It had nothing to do with payment of money. It had nothing to do with anything other than a system which was extremely difficult to police. Ultimately, Mr Smith appealed his conviction and the conviction was overturned. The decision is reported in 1993: lQR 541. It was overturned by a majority of Justices McPherson and Pincus, with Thomas dissenting. Again, the clear thrust of the judgment of the majority decision was that, really, this was not corruption. The jury were invited to be put into a position of deciding that perhaps what was being charged, namely official corruption, was Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 641 blurred by the activity-the particular salacious activity-that was alleged to have been involved. I can well recall the spiritual zeal with which that case was prosecuted by the Office of Special Prosecutor. I was very glad when the Office of Special Prosecutor ceased operations because in my view, as well as in the view of many police officers associated with it-not necessarily those who had been charged-and in the view of members of the legal profession, that office did get completely out of hand in relation to the cases that they were involved in. That, in my view, was one particular case. Well do I remember some of the records of interview conducted by barristers who were employed by the Office of Special Prosecutor. Some of these records of interview were ruled out and excluded by trial judges because the zeal with which they pursued these cases overtook them. Unfairness and inadmissibility of evidence thereby followed. With that background, I do support the legislation, and I refer to the particular sections involved that deal with this legislation. Corruption, for the purposes of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Amendment Bil11997, is mirrored in section 2 of the principal act. It involves abuse of office, corruption itself committed for the purposes of perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice, or being involved in corruption. The powers that follow from those particular elements of involvement in corruption are the power to freeze the superannuation entitlements of the official charged with serious corruption, tracing the amounts rolled over and recovering the amounts under orders of the court. Queensland, as I mentioned before, was very much involved in this particular area following the Fitzgerald inquiry, and there is legislation in Queensland in the form of the Crimes (Confiscation) Act 1989 and the Public Officers' Superannuation Benefits Recovery Act 1988. It is to be borne in mind, too, that there were some difficulties, going back to the Terry Lewis case, experienced in relation to his particular superannuation. Some lengthy· and expensive court proceedings were had before a successful outcome was obtained in relation to a very large superannuation benefit that he had become entitled to by virtue of his office. When one looks at the power under the bill, the minister may only make a direction that a person's employer funded contributions be suspended if the person has been charged with or convicted of an offence. Where the person. is convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced in respect of that offence, the sentence must be for a term greater than 12 months, and this follows earlier legislation that came into this House last year, from memory. Overall, these measures are good measures because the common law, which has been around for hundreds of years, was inadequate to deal with some of these particular matters and there was a necessity to introduce legislation to cover many of the bases that were not covered by the common law. SoI think that the forerunners of this legislation and this legislation itself have been good responses to some of the difficulties that have been encountered in ensuring that recovery of moneys from corrupt officials has been able to be speedily put in train. All in all, these measures are very appropriate and come at a time when society expects there to be condign measures for officials who are minded to pervert the course of justice or otherwise engage in official corruption. But, at the same time, society also expects that those charged with a discretion both to prosecute and to commence proceedings should do so with care, unabridged or uninfluenced by political or public pressure considerations. The justice system itself will thereby be perverted if those considerations are allowed too much to influence the course. of the discretion, a very important discretion which is not always 642 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 recognised. The discretion of a crown prosecutor to both prosecute or enter an nolle prosequi is one that should be unhindered and unfettered. In conclusion, in recent years, particularly with the advent of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Queensland, I have seen a diminution in the exercise of that discretion by the prosecuting officer, the crown law officer who was in court. So often in the course of cases I saw where a discretion was patently open to be exercised, particularly in relation to the entering of a nolle prosequi where a judge had given an indication that officer would seek an adjournment to go and consult the Director of Public Prosecutions. I do not think that that was a good thing. In some particular cases it may well have been necessary, but in most cases it is not a good thing, for only the crown law officer doing the case understands the need to exercise such a discretion and ought to be able to exercise an unfettered discretion. Overall, Mr Deputy Speaker, with those remarks I welcome this measure and fully support it. I am very pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in this debate on the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Amendment Bill 1997. Like other honourable members, I support the bill and, indeed, the further amendments which will be moved by the government. At the outset, I would like to point out that those further amendments are technical amendments which do not in any way, shape or fomi undermine the impact of the bill. Quite to the contrary, they actually correct a drafting fault and better implement the intention behind the legislation. It is really important that in Australia the public is able to have confidence that corrupt public officials, whether federal public servants, judges, members of parliament, or others on the public payroll, are not able to breach the law and yet still receive publicly funded superannuation benefits. This bill before the chamber proposes to amend the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 and the Australian Federal Police Act to close loopholes which have allowed corrupt public officials to access their publicly funcled superannuation benefits. Following the passage of this legislation, corrupt officials will no longer be able to avoid confiscation of employer funded benefits by rolling their superannuation into a nonCommonwealth fund. The government will be able to freeze the superannuation benefits of any official charged with a serious corruption offence, trace amounts that have been rolled over and recover them under a court order. This is appropriate legislation. The community will see it as being very fair and reasonable, and I am pleased to see that the opposition is supporting the government. It is eminently regrettable that, however, the opposition does not see fit to support the government on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 which would see small businesses employing 15 or fewer people being exempted from the unfair dismissals law. Coming from the Northern Territory, Mr Deputy Speaker Dondas, you would also be eminently regretful that the opposition has failed to support the Wik legislation which would enshrine a very fair proposal, the Prime Minister's lO-point plan, as part of the law of this nation. the pastoralists, the Aborigines and the general community. You say that it is not fair or reasonable. You are completely wrong, and I challenge you to go out there to the community-",125,Representatives Main Committee

Returning to the bill: this bill allows the tracing of amounts that have been paid to superannuation providers, that is, amounts that have been rolled over, and enables them to be recovered under a superannuation order made by a court. It provides a mechanism by which the employer funded superannuation benefits of persons charged with, or convicted of offences involving corruption, may be temporarily suspended. It enables the official trustee to take custody and control of restrained property and to sell it, or otherwise dispose of it, in satisfaction of a superannuation order. It facilitates the provision of information to the Commonwealth by superannuation entities concerning Commonwealth employees, and it simplifies the way in which information is provided to a court that certifies the amount of a person's superannuation benefits in superannuation order proceedings. The policy underlying this change is that employer funded superannuation benefits should not be paid from the public purse to people who are corrupt. That is unexceptional, but it is interesting that until now the law has not provided for this very sensible change. It ought to be noted also that the forfeiture of benefits is not a penalty for the commission of an offence. Instead, corruption of office is a fundamental failure to fulfil a vital condition of public employment, and the commission of a corruption offence is a fundamental breach of trust in the employer-employee relationship and justifies disentitlement to taxpayer funded superannuation benefits. To sum up: this legislation provides the capacity to freeze the superannuation entitlement of any public employee charged or about to be charged with a corruption offence. It means that the government will be able to ensure that taxpayers' money is protected from those who have betrayed the public trust. I commend the opposition for backing this legislation. It is a matter of great regret that it has not supported other legislation currently before the parliament. At this point I had planned to commend the bill to the House but I have just been given a note that says, 'Keep going,' and keep going I shall. Mr Eoin Cameron-I'm sure that will be fascinating. endeavour to cast forth further pearls of wisdom. This is important legislation which has widespread support in the Australian community.

Given some of the reports we have had in the media in relation to public corruption, it is not before time that this legislation is now before the chamber. Fia Cumming, a very able person, writing in the Sun-Herald of 7 December 1997, in effect commended the Howard government for moving quickly to close a legal loophole which could allow corrupt politicians to keep their generous parliamentary superannuation. It should be remembered however that this bill applies not only to politicians but to any public official. It applies to federal judges, public servants or anyone else on the public payroll who may be suspected of having his or her snout in the public trough. I am very pleased to see my colleague the Attorney-General in the chamber and I presumeis well qualified to hold that position. I imagine that, now the Attorney-General is here, the note that I received to keep going is no longer appropriate and it is in order for me to wind up these remarks. The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Amendment Bill is legislation which enjoys support from the community and from all sides of politics. I commend the bill to the chamber. to participate in a timely. way in the closing of the debate on this bill. I thank members for their support of the bill. I thank in particular the member for Banks( Mr Melham), the member for Dickson( Mr Smith) and the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper). The member for Banks emphasised that the amendments are fair, they apply across the board to the public sector and they are necessary to close a loophole by which the objectives of the principal act may be defeated. The government endorses those sentiments. The members for Banks and Dickson expressed concern about the possible improper exercise of discretions under the act, particularly by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Under section 16 of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act, the only relevant discretion resides in the Attorney-General. Once the Attorney-General is satisfied that a person has been convicted of a corruption offence, and the sentence exceeds 12 months imprisonment, he or she may authorise the DPP to seek a superannuation order from the court. The DPP has no discretion; he must then seek the order. The discretion exercised by the Attorney-General is reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The bill improves the operation of orders and makes provision for a more efficient recovery of benefits that have been paid by Commonwealth schemes. . Mr Depu""ty Speaker, while I am on my feet, it has been foreshadowed that the government seeks to move amendments. I will move them in due course, but I would like to briefly speak to them now. Amendment 1 is a minor and technical amendment to the bill and restores a technical evidentiary provision to the act that was inadvertently repealed by the bill. That technical provision, subsection 18(6), is being restored and modified as a consequence of the amendments being made to the evidentiary provisions of the act by the bill. The modified provision has the same function and purpose as the provision the bill repeals. Further explanation of the amendment is contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which I will present in due course. Parallel amendments are made to the Australian Federal Police Act by a fourth amendment. Amendments 2 and 3 are technical amendments that make it clear that subparagraphs 19(9)(a)(i) and 19(9)(a)(ii) are to be read cumulatively and conjunctively.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 December 1997, on motion by Ms Worth: That the bill be now read a second time. I would like to say at the outset that the opposition is supporting this particular piece of legislation, but I would like to, in particular, make a few remarks about the changes to the impact that this legislation will have on paper protection for manufacturers of pharmaceutical products in Australia. In Australia, thanks to the factor F program which was introduced by the former Labor government's industry minister, Senator John Button, we have had a very good record on the performance of the Australian pharmaceutical industry. We have had a substantial increase in investment, a substantial increase in exports of Australian made pharmaceutical products and an increase in commitment to research and development in Australia as a result of the factor F program. Basically, the factor F program was about ensuring that Australia paid higher prices to those pharmaceutical manufacturers who did the right thing by Australian investment, Australian exports of Australian made pharmaceuticals and research and development carried out in Australia. Currently, we pay about 50 to 75 per cent of the OECD price for pharmaceutical products because Australia has the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which gives the government an enormous negotiating power in determining the prices that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme pays for drugs. The factor F program has been recognised by all of those in the industry as one that encouraged a great deal of worthwhile outcomes for the Australian manufacturing industry. The current government commissioned an Industry Commission inquiry into this industry some time ago and a number of recommendations were considered by the government. About 12 months ago, the government made a decision to continue with some assistance to this",131,Representatives Main Committee

291,Mr Lee (Dobell) (L0.41 A.m.),"My voice being what it is, I might be brief this morning.Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 647 industry. The amount of assistance provided to the industry was of the order of $300 million over five years. That was $300 million which was not quite as generous as the factor F program, but it was $300 million that we think in part compensates the industry for the fact that they received less than market prices because of the government's strong negotiating power through the pharmaceutical benefit scheme. One of the terms of the agreement between the industry and the government about that replacement industry plan for the pharmaceutical industry was an improvement in patent protection for pharmaceutical manufacturers. That improvement in the patent protection is, I understand, included in this legislation and it is one that we, on the opposition side of the parliament, support. We think it is important that pharmaceutical manufacturers receive a fair return for the research work they do in developing new pharmaceutical products. Naturally, laws in Australia and in other countries ensure that a lot of work has to be carried out on ensuring that new pharmaceutical products do not. have any unintended consequences. Often those medical research projects not only take a lengthy time but also cost a great deal of money. It is for that reason, and for the reason that we want to encourage an investment in a domestic Australian pharmaceutical industry, that we believe that providing improved patent protection and some form of an industry plan for the pharmaceutical industry is something that is worthwhile and worth encouraging. One of our concerns is that, having reached this agreement with the industry about 12 months ago, in a bolt from the blue in last year's budget the government decided to make $500 million worth of savings in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by introducing its disgraceful therapeutic group premiums policy. pockets of multinationals. I am sure that will be a surprise to some of his constituents who are being asked to pay more for their essential medications because of this very policy. I admit that some of the money has come from the profitability of pharmaceutical companies, but I know that after reflection and study the member for Robertson will be forced to agree with me that a portion of those savings does come from the pockets of his constituents who are forced to pay more for medication for high blood pressure and stomach ulcers. The real concern I have is that, while the government in this legislation reached agreement with the industry to extend patent protection to encourage the industry, the government in that decision in last year's budget has done the reverse of what it set out to do in the industry plan. The Prime Minister( Mr Howard) delivered an industry policy statement late last year and he rightly said that the industries we wanted to attract to Australia were those that were prepared to invest to create jobs, those that were prepared to develop exports, and those that were prepared to invest in research and development. What industry other than pharmaceuticals better fits that description? It provides investment, exports, and research and development, and yet this is the industry that the government has targeted for the biggest cut in last year's budget. At the end of the day it is a matter of working out what is the fair price that the pharmaceutical manufacturers should receive. The industry currently receives about 50 to 70 per cent of the OECD average price. It receives even less as a percentage of the price that is paid in the United States for pharmaceutical products where market forces reign. Those on",132,Representatives Main Committee

In my visits to organisations on the central coast of New South Wales, there is a great deal of concern amongst people who are required to use drugs for high blood pressure and for stomach ulcers about the impact that this decision has had onbut I have to say that what is really scary is the government's policy decision, not the comments that are made by people from the opposition. When organisations such as the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales express their concern about the impact that this is going to have on pensioners and retirees, you have really got to ask whether this has been a fair decision. We, on this side of the House, would certainly argue that it has been extremely unfair, and one that is causing a greatof Norvasc, one that has been raised in the parliament on several occasions with the Prime Minister and with the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). I would now like to challenge the member for Robertson to get up today and explain to us whether he considers Norvasc to be medically equivalent to the cheapest drugs, the drugs that his constituents have been told that they should switch to, unless they are prepared to pay $4.46 extra on top of what they have paid in the past. Norvasc has been accepted by the government's own medical experts as being quite different from the cheapest alternatives in that therapeutic group. Under the cost justification regime the makers of Norvasc had to prove that it would generate sufficient savings, that is, fewer visits to hospitals, to justify the higher price premium that was negotiated between the manufacturers of Norvasc and the government. You have got to ask how people such as the member for Robertson and the minister for health can claim that these drugs are absolutely the same if the government's experts have reached a very different conclusion. Just getting back to patent protection, we certainly argue that the Australian pharmaceutical industry is one that should be encouraged. It has done a very good job in creating jobs. We have had a lot of investment in the Australian pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in the last decade, in no small measure due to the great efforts of former Senator John Button during the time that he was industry minister. It is an area where there is going to be a massive increase in demand, especially in the Asian region despite their current economic troubles. This is an area where, with a commitment to some research and development in Australia and by making sure we have a stable regime that encourages new investment from the industry, we can generate many new jobs in years to come. This legislation gives a better patent protection regime for those companies that are prepared to invest and operate in Australia. It is something that we on this side of the House support. of us in the first instance think of the word's original meaning of robbery at sea.

298,Mrs Elizabeth Grace (Lilley) (10.52 A.m.),"When the word 'piracy' is used, manyThursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 649 However, like many words, new meaning has been added to the word 'piracy' over time. Through changing circumstances, today the word 'piracy' is commonly used to refer to unauthorised appropriation or use of intellectual property such as copyrighted or patented work, ideas, et cetera. In contrast, this kind of piracy, whether we are aware of it or not, is quite common and subtly impacts upon our daily lives. It impacts on the economy. It impacts on society's well-being. According to Harry Hillman Chartrand in his article, 'Intellectual Property in the Global Village', published on the Internet, economies in recent times have become more and more knowledge based. He says: Wealth creation in the global village is shifting from a resource to a knowledge-base. The economy is increasingly dependent on brain power and our ability to create, to sell, to explain and to solve problems. In future, wealth will come more and more out of our heads; less and less will come out of the ground. And the goods and services of our brainpower will be marketed in an increasingly competitive global village. But knowledge is abstract. It is not like a car or a house which can be locked and secured against theft. If someone gains knowledge, it does not reduce that being available to others. Essentially, there are two ways of turning knowledge into one's own private property. One way is through keeping it to one's self and the other is through intellectual property law, including copyright, patent, registered industrial design and trademark legislation and conventions. Although such property rights can be created, there is a difficulty in protecting them, particularly in the global marketplace. The act of piracy of intellectual property is commonly found in the computer software industry. Misappropriation of software, which is referred to by some as superhighway robbery, is relatively easy when offenders can remain anonymous and avoid detection. Piracy of intellectual property-even that which is protected through legal patents, copyrights, et cetera-denies the authors the benefits of the fruits of their creativity. It is a disincentive to development of even more sophisticated software. Arguably, the effect of pirating intellectual property in the pharmaceutical industry is of much greater concern. The pharmaceutical industry is a research intensive industry and this feature makes its products very costly to bring to the marketplace in the first instance. Not only do pharmaceutical firms carry out very expensive, highly specialised research to develop new products but we, as consumers, expect products to' then be subject to rigorous and extensive testing to ensure their suitability for our use or consumption. In an article titled 'A pharmaceutical quest for cures to trade ailments', Harvey Bale of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America points out that the pharmaceutical industry is highly innovative and spends more than 20 per cent of its income from sales on research and development. Pharmaceutical companies therefore seek expansion into the international marketplace to provide additional revenues that can be devoted to additional research and development into the new therapeutic cures for old and new diseases. It is notable that more than a dozen new infectious diseases have been encountered and identified since 1975. The pharmaceutical industry discovers over 90 per cent of the new pharmaceutical and vaccine therapies and critical research into such areas such as AIDS, heart disease and cancer are improving the length and quality of life and saving on overall social costs of health care. 650 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 For these reasons, it is in this global society's interests to ensure that the pharmaceutical industry remains strongly viable. Because pharmaceutical firms conducting business in the international competitive environment have very high costs associated with bringing their product to the marketplace, they have a vital interest in expanding global trade to ensure profitability and worthwhile returns on their vast capital and R&D outlays. But intellectual property protection cannot be global per se. Rather, it is achieved through a network of national laws. In other words, protection in a global context from unauthorised misappropriation will only be achieved if the laws are put in place in all countries where products are marketed. International protection for intellectual property comes from obtaining protection from within each country through its own laws. If there is a weak link in the global network of protective legislation because one country has less strict laws, it is likely that acts of piracy will occur at that point in the network. This has been common in the Middle East, particularly where lack of laws and extremely liberal trade policies have resulted in widespread distribution of counterfeited and pirated material throughout the region. However, in recent years, there have been significant changes in laws and attitudes of the governments in the Middle East to intellectual property. There has been a growing recognition that the lack of intellectual property protection is economically detrimental and hampers technological development. This is because many high-tech countries such as the US and the European countries have simply stayed away from the region, depriving countries with unsatisfactory intellectual property law protection of the latest technological advances in the medical, telecommunications and computer services. According to a review of the Australian pharmaceutical industry in 1996 by the Industry Commission, if Australia proved to be a weak link in the international network of protection it could give rise to the potential for companies to withhold new drugs from Australian markets because commercial confidentiality could not be assured. A duty therefore falls upon us to make effective laws in this country that complement and harmonise with worldwide international property laws. This would provide a desirable level of protection for pharmaceutical intellectual property and ensure that Australians can benefit from the latest pharmaceutical advances. It is in this context that the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, which I strongly commend, is brought before the House. The main purpose of the proposed legislation is to establish a system where confidential information about new chemical entities has five years of data protection similar to that which is provided by several overseas countries. When manufacturers wish to register new products in Australia, they are required to submit test data which is protected against disclosure unless release is in the public interest. This does not prevent any company registering a generic product consisting of the same active components. Under the proposed legislation, such companies will, in future, be required to seek the agreement of the originator company to assess its original data. To demonstrate bioequivalence, they must develop and lodge with the Therapeutic Goods Administration their own full data package instead of an abbreviated package which is required at present. Chartrand says that formal protection of intellectual property rights such as copyrights, patents, registered industrial designs and trademarks, is justified as a protection of, and an incentive to, creativity but, in return, society expects creators to make their work available and that a market will be created in which such work can be bought and sold. While society wishes to enco-rage creativity, it does not want to foster harmful market power. Accordingly, the state Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 651 builds in limitations to the rights granted to the creator. Such limitations embrace both time and space and rights are granted for a fixed period of time. In Australia, patents were for many years granted for a period of 16 years, but this was extended to 20 to align with international standards. The latest Uruguay Round of GATT produced trade related intellectual property agreements, commonly known as TRIPs, which established many sets of codes dealing with different trade aspects, intellectual property rights, minimum standards and strong enforcement measures. The TRIPs propose a 20-year patent term effective from the filing date. As we have observed, however, because of the stringent testing requirements there is a lengthy period before a pharmaceutical product can be marketed. This means that, despite the high costs involved, patented pharmaceutical goods effectively have a shorter period of protection than any other patented goods. The proposed legislation before this House removes that anomaly by granting a five-year data protection period for therapeutic goods. Whilst granting an extended data protection period is the primary aim of the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 before the House, it has other important elements. These include a provision for the Secretary to the Department of Health and Family Services to cancel the registration in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods of any therapeutic goods, as a result of using protected information; a provision enabling the secretary to seek additional information about manufacturing processes used to produce goods that are not listed in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods; provisions that stop people who have been convicted of an offence against the act, or against a state or territory law relating to therapeutic goods, from continuing to manufacture goods through another corporation or entity; a provision for regulations to be made relating to the issue of import and export permits in relation to therapeutic goods; and, finally, a provision for the consequential amendments to the Customs A. It is essential, therefore, that there be enforcement provisions supporting the thrust of the proposed legislation. The power to cancel registration of offenders is therefore appropriate. It is necessary that powers of investigation into manufacturing processes be granted to the Secretary of the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods to seek additional information about manufacturing processes, so that the proper manufacturing standards can be met. It is prudent to close such loopholes as the one that may occur and which would allow convicted offenders against legislation to simply manufacture under the name of another legal entity. Finally, it is good practice to make consequential amendments affecting customs regulations. I believe that enacting the legislation currently before the House is consistent with our charge under the constitution to provide good government fcir the citizens of Australia. Furthermore, enactment would discharge our international obligations under the trade related international property agreement to which Australia is a signatory. It harmonises our legislation with other countries' legislation relating to the protection and marketing of therapeutic goods, thus providing not only the best commercial environment for producers but also the best social outcomes for consumers. In view of all these circumstances, I commend this legislation to the House. 1997 is the second one introduced by the Howard government into the House in recent times that seeks to effect changes to the patent protection of pharmaceutical products. Probably the first of these bills, the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997, is the more important",134,Representatives Main Committee
299,Mr Rocher (Curtin) (11.03 A.m.),"The Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill652 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 of the two. Its principal aim is to improve Australia's place in the highly competitive global pharmaceutical industry by giving greater patent protection to local pharmaceutical manufacturers. Whereas that first bill is concerned with providing an effective patent life for complete pharmaceutical substances, this second bill aims to improve the protection regime for new active components-or NACs, as they are called-that are connected with an application to register therapeutic products with the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Put simply, although the issue of safeguarding of intellectual property is anything but simple, this bill seeks to give patent protection to innovators, where the final product of their research and development is quite different from the original forecast and is, therefore, not subject to protection under the original patent. This is not a common occurrence. However, given that we are competing in an aggressive international marketplace, it is critical that we implement comparable legislation to that which is in effect elsewhere. The coalition has espoused that the five-year data protection regime proposed in this bill is consistent with that of New Zealand and the United States of America. While it is true that New Zealand adheres to this time frame, the United States of America Food and Drug Administration protects test data for up to seven years. The United Kingdom goes further than this in recognising that data relating to new chemical entities remains the exclusive property of the registering individual or organisation for a period of 10 years from the date of first marketing. While the measures in this bill are supportable, it is submitted that the government should look, as a matter of priority, at extending patent protection for test data for a minimum of seven years. In presenting its 1996 report into the domestic pharmaceutical industry, the Industry Commission acknowledged that: Australia is bound to abide by its international obligations in the area of intellectual property protection. This was a reference to the 1994 agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, commonly known as TRIPs, to which Australia is a party. Section7 of that agreement reads, in part: Members, when requiring, as a condition of approving the marketing of pharmaceutical products which utilise new chemical entities. the submission of undisclosed test or other data. the origination of which involves a considerable effort. shall protect against disclosure, except where necessary to protect the public, or unless steps are taken to ensure that the data are protected against unfair commercial use. To this end, the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 proposes to introduce a number of changes to better align Australian patent legislation with the laws of other member nations to the TRIPs agreement. A five-year data protection regime is to be introduced to prevent the Secretary to the Department of Health and Family Services from accessing information about a new active component in order to process other applications for the registration of goods with a like active component. Representatives from the Tri-Med Specialties Group, a medical research organisation which borders on my electorate-I believe it might even be known to the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Eoin Cameron), who is at the table-believe this to be a significant and fair inclusion. As they rightly point out, the cost and time being borne by those who are the first to produce a new active component far outweigh those costs incurred by firms which opt to piggyback off these innovations. Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 653 This position is also advanced by the Australian Phannaceutical Manufacturers Association, APMA, the peak body representing the interests of domestic manufacturers of prescription medicines. In a fax dated 23 January 1998, Dr Janice Hirshorn, Director of Policy and Strategy Development at APMA, noted thatA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.09 a.m. to 11.19 a.m. said: The APMA considers that protection of test data is critical both from a public or health policy standpoint. She went on to note: Equity demands that protection be provided for data, which can cost the original submitter several millions of dollars to produce (because) disclosing these data to the public or allowing its use by another applicant, unfairly denies the compiler of the data the value of its efforts and grants an economic advantage to later applicants for marketing approval, enabling them to avoid the cost of developing test data for their own products. One of the most significant traits of the phannaceutical industry is its dependence on products that are technologically intensive and knowledge driven, hence the bigger than average expenditure in phannaceutical research and development as a proportion of total sales in comparison to other industries. Given that pioneering pharmaceutical companies rely so heavily on R&D to keep ahead of the pack, it is perfectly reasonable for them to anticipate that any submissions made for inclusion in the Australian Therapeutic Goods Register, the ATGR, will be adequately protected under Australian patent law. Some have suggested that the deficiencies in the existing legislation have disadvantaged innovative companies and dissuaded them from pursuing other costly research and development projects in Australia. If this is the case, it is to be hoped that the amendments in this bill will help to reverse that trend. The 1998 DEeD Economic Surveys publication notes that Australia has not fared all that well in recent global comparisons of innovativeness. Page 116 of that report reads: The rate of (Australian) enterprise creation has not stood out as high by international comparison, relatively few companies have grown beyond medium size, and the industrial sector is still dominated by large resourced based-many foreign owned-companies. But it is not just the industrial sector that is commanded by multinationals. The United States of America, Japan, Gennany, the United Kingdom and France are the largest producers of phannaceutical products. Together, they accounted for greater than 80 per cent of the total phannaceutical production in 1991, the most recent figures available to me. The USA alone was responsible for 40 per cent of total global production in that same year. In comparison, Australia is considered to be small fry, both in tenns of the size of our domestic market and in our share of production of phannaceuticals. Given the relative obscurity of the Australian phannaceutical market, it is paramount that indigenous companies make the most of their opportunities to increase their market share, through both a commitment to research and development and a focus on the development of external markets. The government, too, has an obligation to create the right conditions to cement the commitment of foreign drug companies to continue with research and development and production in Australia. It is ridiculous to argue that the major benefactors of this legislation",137,Representatives Main Committee
300,Mr Rocher,"Before the suspension, I was about to quote Dr Hirshorn. In the fax she654 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 will be Australian pharmaceutical companies. The fact is that the big winners will be those countries which are net exporters of pharmaceuticals-that is, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and possibly Japan. In strengthening the patent protection for new active components in the manner prescribed in this bill, we are effectively fortifying the grip that these multinationals have on the pharmaceutical trade. To illustrate the control that foreign companies have over the Australian market, I refer members to table 2.7 of the Industry Commission report into the pharmaceutical industry. The contents of this table reveal that the two largest Australian pharmaceutical companies, in terms of pharmaceutical benefits scheme, PBS, sales, accounted for less than five per cent of total PBS sales in the year 1994-95 worth $111 million. On the other hand, the biggest 10 multinational enterprises, called MNEs, generated sales in excess of $1,255 million in Australia in the same period. Just as telling is the fact that greater than 90 per cent of all new drugs developed post-1960 have originated from Japan, Europe and the USA. To not proceed with the amendments proposed in this legislation could mean that the MNEs look abroad to countries that are prepared to reward innovation through investment in research and development. As the Industry Commission noted: The pharmaceutical industry is knowledge intensive. This means that R&D plays a key role in allowing companies to develop and refine products. At the same time, companies rely on patents to enable them to capture the returns from their investment in R&D. In recent years, the costs associated with pharmaceutical research and development have escalated but the discovery of new chemical entities, the subject of this bill, has become less frequent. Patent protection for MNEs is therefore becoming increasingly significant. Should those MNEs opt to take their Australian operations elsewhere, the impact on the Australian economy of the loss of those multinationals cannot be overstated. The Industry Commission has concluded that the majority of multinatiomils conduct a large proportion, around 40 per cent, of their research and development through linkages with other pharmaceutical companies and other research organisations. In other words, domestic pharmaceutical organisations benefit directly from these formal links with the MNEs, as well as indirectly through the spill-over effects of foreign research and development. The Industry Commission estimates that the pharmaceutical industry makes a substantial contribution to the broader Australian economy, with value adding of approximately $745 million in the year 1993-94 alone. We simply cannot afford to become blase in our attitude towards the protection of intellectual property. Item4 of schedule 1 will see the secretary's powers further enhanced, so that he or she may revoke the registration of a therapeutic good, if it is found that the registration includes the use of protected information. That is both fair and reasonable. As the explanatory memorandum indicates, this bill aims also to extend the secretary's authority to pursue information about a manufacturer of therapeutic goods beyond the current restrictions. Under the proposed legislation, detailed information relating to the site of manufacturer and the modus operandi of a producer of a therapeutic good will be able to be investigated by the secretary. Many expect this provision to discourage a home-brew type of operation and therefore it enjoys the broad support of industry. Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 655 The government has forecast that the measures in this bill-unlike the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1997, with its financial impact-will have no significant effect on revenue. This is principally because it is not common for pharmaceutical R&D to produce a new chemical entity that is so different from the initial forecast that it is not covered by the original patent. Therefore, this bill should be viewed as an extension of the coalition's attempts to upgrade protection for intellectual property rights. Given the commitment of both sides of the House, as I understand it, to fostering a culture that encourages research and development in Australia, I expect that all members will support this legislation. I remind my parliamentary colleagues that pharmaceutical manufacturers rely heavily on patents to maximise their returns on the fruits of their research and development. R&D and the protection of intellectual property are inextricably linked, and it should be the priority of government to foster the input of knowledge back into technology. The pharmaceutical industry operates in a. heavily regulated environment and it is important for government to strike a balance between the interests of manufacturers of new drugs and of those producing generic versions of drugs. In its 1996 report, the Industry Commission quotes the former Department of Industry, Science and Technology as concluding: From the consumer's point of view, a balance that encourages both research and production of new drugs and the availability of lower priced generic drugs is important. This balance is also important in the context of retaining competitive pressures which keep PBS prices low. Any reasonable measure which seeks to protect innovators from copycat manufacturers, and therefore provides an incentive to invest in the development of new pharmaceutical products, should be embraced. In March last year I noted, in my contribution to a grievance debate on research and development of intellectual property, that the key ""to success for technology firms is the speedy getting and marketing of information. I noted then that the protection of intellectual property is equally important. In the absence of adequate patents legislation, companies do not have the time to reap the rewards of their research and development, and we would surely see Australian businesses look elsewhere in those circumstances to fund their research and development. I support the bill. that the speech from the member for Curtin( Mr Rocher) was well researched and worthwhile listening to. Thank you. protection for the selected sponsors for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. In some ways I see. a similarity between that protection bill and the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, and that is the protection of investments. I argued in the debate on the Sydney 2000 games protection bill that the major sponsors deserved to be protected against other products or companies using the various Olympic symbols for some sort of market advantage. The major sponsors will hold a special position, but then they have invested the money with SOCOG for that exclusive right and the bill protected that investment.

301,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.30 A.m.),"BeforeI begin my contribution, I would like to say",141,Representatives Main Committee
302,Mr Rocher,Thank you.,141,Representatives Main Committee
303,Mr Lindsay,"My first address to the Main Committee was in relation to insignia656 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 problems are often the result of years of research and development, requiring many thousands of hours of work, testing and triaIling, not to mention money. I said in relation to the Sydney 2000 games protection bill that it was only fair that we do the best we can to ensure that commercial sponsors are given a fair go for the investment which they have made. Likewise, it is only fair that we live up to our national and international responsibilities and protect the research data and the results of manufacturers who develop new therapeutic chemical entities. I note the comments of the Industry Commission in the 1996 review of the Australian pharmaceutical industry where they said: Protection of commercially sensitive data supplied in confidence is understandably a concern to international businesses.... Of particular concern is the potential for companies to withhold new drugs from the Australian market if commercial confidentiality cannot be assured. This bill introduces a new data protection regime which will provide a five-year period of data and research security for companies which develop new chemical entities or active therapeutic components. Further, as the honourable member for Adelaide and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) stated in introducing this bill: During this time, any other company seeking to register a generic copy of a registered product containing ... the active component will be required to seek the agreement of the originator company before the TGA can directly or indirectly access or reference the originator company's data relating to the same component. Put simply, what we are talking about here is giving a fair go to the people who put the time, the effort, the energy and the money into developing a new product or therapeutic agent. I think we all recognise that the pharmaceutical industry is extremely competitive, and rightly so. That intense competition helps in many instances to keep the cost of generic products down to a level accessible by ordinary members of the public. But the effort that goes into producing new drugs to treat specific problems or conditions needs to be recognised and protected. I note that the new data regime this bill will introduce is very similar to those which have already been introduced in many other countries. Some of the other measures in the bill relate to general consumer protection measures, for example, enabling more detailed information to be obtained about the manufacturing process and premises of an applicant seeking to list the therapeutic goods in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, as the explanatory memorandum of this bill makes clear. The guidelines concerning the introduction of new pharmaceutical product into the open market are naturally very strict. One bit of advice I think Townsville parents give their children when they are growing up is that when it comes to your health you do not take chances. We likewise should not take chances with the products we allow onto the market shelves. The regulatory steps are there to protect-consumers, and the overwhelming number of therapeutic products which do reach the market do so for good reasons. These are sensible measures. Therefore I support them and have no hesitation in supporting this bill. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (11.35 a.m.)I rise today also to speak to the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bil11997. At first glance, the amendments to this legislation would appear to be only very minor, but they are very significant in so far as they indicate this government's commitment to the delivery of quality public health and safety measures throughout the community and they improve legal protection to the Australian pharmaceutical industry. Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 657 The amendments will also assist the work of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Family Services, through its watchdog role for and the support of this particular industry. The bill, as outlined here today, aims at tightening some of the therapeutic goods legislation in three key aspect areas. Firstly, it is important to mention that it will widen the protection for research, developers and manufacturers in the degree of chemical entities patents. Secondly, it examines the registration process of listable products by the TGA and it allows for additional information to be sought on the manufacturer. Finally, the legislation tightens the loophole which allows persons who have been convicted for offences under the act to start a new company. In itself, this is a very important safeguard for public health and safety. The confidence in Australia's regulatory system is strong and the quality of our products which are exported is very highly regarded by many overseas countries. The TGA has a very important role and has the community's confidence to ensure the safety and the quality of these products. The TGA also has a strong consultative basis and recognises the importance of obtaining practical support necessary through regular consultation with industry and consumer groups. Over the years, the therapeutic goods industry has become much better regulated with the measures that it has put in place to ensure that products are developed and dispensed, with the utmost care taken to ensure that this quality and safety continues. Manufacturers must adhere to a rigid set of guidelines in order to ensure that certain provisions and regulations are upheld. These guidelines cover everything-advertising, labelling and production. Over recent years, particularly since the enactment of the Therapeutic Goods Act of 1989, there has been a far more regulated and competitive approach taken towards this particular industry. This government is very conscious, in the present environment, of rapid development in the area of intellectual property and of the necessity to provide up-to-date protection of intellectual property and to ensure that there are no breaches where this research data is provided. In the Industry Commission's 1996 report-and the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Lindsay) also highlighted this-on the pharmaceutical industry, the introduction to the chapter on intellectual property issues states: Adequate protection of intellectual property is of fundamental importance for research based industries. Given the high risks and the cost involved, pharmaceutical companies rely on a period of patent protection for successful products to secure an adequate return on their total investment in research and development. In fact, this federal government has been at the leading edge of providing secure vehicles where manufacturers can protect this very important intellectual property. I note that the launch early in 1997 of the innovation patent system provides rights to small and low cost innovations. This particular function allows for a quicker approval process; industrial property rights for upwards of eight years; and much lower threshold protection. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism( Mr Moore) really needs to be congratulated for his work during this period. The cost of patenting intellectual property has, for a long time, been a very contentious issue. This government has provided leadership on this issue by attempting to alleviate the burden in the area of research and development within small and medium sized industries. The federal government as part of its response to the Industry Commission's report into the pharmaceutical industry provided amendments to the Patents Act 1990 which extended the 658 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 term to up to five years for the 20-year standard pharmaceutical patent which brought Australia in line with international best practice. The pharmaceutical industry is a very important sector in the economy and, in the 1996-97 financial year, it accounted for exports of just under $1 billion. This amount is actually even higher than for exports generated by the wine industry. The government is supporting this sector of the economy and acknowledges the jobs which are generated from research, development and distribution through to dispensing. The extension of time for patents also shows the commitment to the industry and acknowledges the very valuable work that is done in this particular area of research and development. This commitment to the protection of patents and support for research and development continues with this bill under debate here today. As mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) when introducing the bill, the amending legislation ensures that Australia fulfils its obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. One of the key amendments arises in item 4, which gives the Secretary to the Department of Health and Family Services jurisdiction in the event that protected information has been used in the application to register therapeutic goods. The legislation also introduces a new data protection scheme which will in effect allow five years for data protection. It provides greater protection to originators and insists that applicants ensure that they provide a full data package when they are registering. This amendment also strengthens the power of the secretary in relation to these matters. It allows for assurance in the intellectual property which already exists and it acts as a deterrent for the future in legislation rather than in principle. As mentioned previously, this decision also places Australia in line with similar protection which now exists in the United States, Europe and New Zealand. It is important that Australia continues to be at the forefront of intellectual property laws, a particular area of law which has seen far more focus in recent years. As with any sector which relies on research and development, the provision of necessary protection measures is important to encourage further improvement within the industry. Australia must cement its position as a world best practice nation. Whether it he in the therapeutic industry or other industry sectors, we have to ensure that we have the protection in place to encourage further research on our shores. Item5 of the amending legislation provides much further scope, specifically allowing further examination of a manufacturer who plans to produce listable goods. The legislation also tightens the situation where previously there has been available immediate re-application following the registration of a conviction under the Therapeutic. Goods Act 1989. This particular amendment provides further conditions regulating the granting and the cancelling of licences and extends the powers which presently exist for those implementing the act, particularly with respect to the Secretary to the Department of Health and Family Services. Items6 and 7 also strengthen the position of the secretary to clean up the industry, particularly in relation to those manufacturers who are convicted of offences under the act. The health and safety of consumers must always be a primary concern of any government.. Therefore, it is extremely important that we tighten and close the loophole which previously existed and ensure that those people who had a conviction cannot immediately apply to Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 659 establish another company and obtain a similar manufacturing licence. By adding safeguards to those situations where a licence can be refused or cancelled, these amendments can only serve to increase the level of safety to the community. The TGA oversees a pharmaceutical industry which encourages companies to invest, research and continue to develop products and therefore provides jobs for this country. I have no hesitation today in commending this particular bill to this committee. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (11.44 a.m.)-in reply-I would like to thank those members who have taken part in this debate and for the contributions that they have made. They have highlighted the importance of data protection. I was pleased to hear the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) giving such emphasis to the role of the TGA in promoting health and safety to consumers. People often like to say they wished that politicians and governments would get out of their way. However, when it comes to protecting health and safety, when they pick something off the shelf in a chemist shop or a health food shop, they do expect that to be safe and to be in their best interests. SoI am pleased to hear an emphasis on that. There has been some debate about the importance of intellectual property rights. The importance to Australia of the pharmaceutical industry has been mentioned and, of course, it is a very important industry to us. The member for Dobell( Mr Lee), possibly under some provocation, did stray from this legislation to talk about the therapeutic group premiums. I think that it is worth mentioning again how important research and development is in this area. In the last budget the government sought to have the pharmaceutical manufacturers put forward competitive prices so that there would not be too much dipping into the Medicare fund inadvertently. There was $300 million set aside for research and development. I talked to manufacturers in the industry. They see this as a very important thing because not all manufacturers are involved in research and development. It is important that those that are get the financial advantage for that rather than just perhaps the profit line from medicines that are consumed by the general public. Over the next four years, $500 million will be saved from that scheme, as at the same time $300 million is going in for those involved in research and development. About $440 million of that $500 million will come from savings from that competitive pricing. That really is a good thing. From the manufacturers' point of view, they know that with an ageing population it is an ever increasing market. While those savings are going on, they know that it is going to grow at least $200 million a year, with a large proportion of that going to manufacturers. The government seeks to have a good working relationship with manufacturers, but at the same time very much get the best possible deal for the public. The member for Dobell did raise again the issue of one particular drug, Norvasc, and whether that had any particular value over others. I was at great pains in the consultation process to ensure that the drugs were grouped appropriately. All those medical experts in the end came up with the assessment that they had been certainly very appropriately grouped for similar clinical effect. After all, that is what we were after. We had a very successful satellite link-up with 450 doctor sites around Australia. Professor Terry Campbell, a very well qualified gentleman from St Vincent's Hospital got that question. 660 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 I might at some time remind the member for Dobell, and even give him a copy of the video, of-the answer that was given to that. Of course, for manufacturers it is a competitive business. In particular, this multinational manufacturer has been at great pains to try and point out that their product was better, but Professor Campbell on that occasion said he did not agree with that assessment. That is straying slightly from this bill. I am just commenting on the contributions made by my colleagues. Again, I thank them and I commend the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform C-mmittee Report Debate resumed from 4 December 1997, on motion by Mr Anthony: That the House take note of the report. the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, attending as I did their hearings in Bathurst last year, at which they received evidence from many local organisations, including councils from CENTROC, the central west regional organisation. I suspect that they were a little surprised not to hear any parochial pleadings from that group for special help for roads in their own areas, but they concentrated their attention on the quite deficient state of the Great Western Highway, quite outside their own area of responsibility but hugely important for the economic development of the central west. I will allude to that particular link as I move through my contribution. I hope, but very much doubt, whether this inquiry of itself will lead to much improvement in Australia's underfunded and inadequate road transport network. But I guess it has at least put in train strategies to complete an inventory of our road needs. Clearly, we need to spend much more on our roads and we need to ensure that money is spent as wisely as possible. Of particular interest to me is recommendation 12 that projects, funded under roads of national importance, be prioritised on the basis of substantial net economic benefits using costbenefit ratios. Such a study on the Great Western Highway is now under way by Charles Sturt University in Bathurst and I trust the state and federal authorities will avail themselves of this data in determining their road funding priorities. This inquiry has made many worthwhile recommendations but I think perhaps we get a lot of value in the dissenting report from the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Ross Cameron), who boldly suggested the Commonwealth should vacate funding and management of road projects altogether. I listened to his contribution in the last session of parliament with interest.

Our only hope of injecting more badly needed funds will come with a fairer tax collection system and a fairer regional distribution of those scarce government funds with an increasing degree of private investment. We just do not have the tax resources in this country to fund our road needs and so the member for Parramatta's support for private sector involvement in the so-called BOOT-build, own, operate and transfer-projects has a lot of merit. We are simply chasing the bigger and bigger road transport rigs around this country, patching up from behind, rather than being able to invest in the quality and safety of road we require, particularly in regional and rural areas. I am most concerned, as are the highway safety action group in the central west and the Newell Highway promotions committee, at the announcement of a $100,000 study. It is not so much the spending on the study but the possible introduction of 36-metre road trains over the length of that highway, despite documentation that shows a lack of overtaking opportunities and many unsafe areas on a highway with a notorious safety record. The highway safety group has challenged the minister to produce a comprehensive costbenefit analysis to prove the claimed economic benefits of such a move and I hope that will be forthcoming. If the study does properly examine the implications for trafficability, overtaking opportunities, bridge strength and road safety, as the minister's press release suggested, then I suggest the necessary improvements could be in the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars worth, with two-kilometre long overtaking sections obviously being necessary to get around the road trains on these long, fast and congested sections. They would have to be there on a very regular basis, I would suggest. Because this route is the major inland link from Melbourne to the sunshine of Queensland, carrying as it does throughout the year hundreds of thousands of tourists, buses, cars and caravans, travelling north and south, the introduction of 36-metre road trains to this mix has alarmed a lot of road safety authorities. We would have to improve that infrastructure to the tune of many hundreds of millions of dollars before we could begin to think of introducing road trains. We are ignoring in this country's transport infrastructure the existing rail infrastructure and the need to create more. The inland Melbourne-Darwin rail link, I believe, makes far more economic sense than the Adelaide-Darwin link. Infrastructure experts I speak with agree with that. We should look at the irrationality of not getting heavy and hazardous freight on to rail. If private funding was found for urban ring-roads and motorways, surely it should free up those scarce public funds for roads of national importance. That brings me back to the Great Western Highway. Despite having some reservations about the report, I am pleased to say that it has finally recognised the inadequacy of this highway, which is the lifeline connecting the people of inland New South Wales with Sydney. The road still follows much the same winding path that Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson trod in 1813. Despite a lot of work in recent years, it falls far short of the type of major commercial link that western New South Wales should have to Sydney-and the other way around. More use of rail-with incentives, if necessary, for users-should be part of any plan to improve those Sydney to central west links. But major and hard decisions have to be taken about how we can provide a road of national status and standard through that Blue Mountains 662 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 area. Tunnels, bypasses of mountain villages, and certainly a wider, less congested route have all been suggested. Real planning, and not putting off or patching, should be the aim. The Great Western Highway accident and fatality rates are much higher than for the Pacific Highway, into which this government has channelled many millions of dollars. This report published evidence that the Great Western Highway is of an 'inferior standard ... in terms of pavement condition and capacity', 'has contributed to a poor safety record' and 'has constrained the development and efficiency of the agriculture sector and manufacturing industries' in central western New South Wales. It does not get any plainer than that. The government and the opposition can talk about regional development all they like, but regional development will remain an elusive pipedream for the people of inland New South Wales, unless this highway is brought up to an acceptable, world-class standard. To help that, there should be rail transport of heavy and hazardous freight across the mountains. Timber from Oberon will be travelling that road in ever increasing amounts, because the state government and the CSR organisation reneged on their agreement to upgrade the Tarana-Oberon rail line. Timber from Oberon, coal from the western fields and fuel from Sydney must all be part of the equation and must go onto rail. Rail must be part of this upgrade, if we are talking any sort of economic rationality about the link between Sydney and the west. I am saddened to say that I am one of the many people in my electorate who have lost a loved one on this road. I too have had to go to the morgue to identify a body robbed of life at a shamefully young age, for the simple reasons that the bulk freight on one vehicle involved should by rights have been on rail and that the highway was, to quote the report again, of an 'inferior standard ... in terms of pavement condition and capacity.' Well, it certainly was. Public action after a series of fatalities, including that one on this highway, and the formation of the Highway Safety Action Group, led to urgent work on sections of this highway in 199293. But the remainder of the link, from Lithgow to Bathurst, and the Mitchell Highway to Orange, remain inadequate by any judgment-and woefully so in parts. I realise there are other members who would also have, in their electorates, major arterial roads with shocking safety records-all roads which require many millions of dollars to be channelled into them. It saddens me to see no real national, non-political, road blueprint. Unfortunately, as with everything else, politics comes into play with road funding. The Labor Party is now quick to condemn the current government for failing to make the Great Western Highway a road of national importance, but there was no such funding forthcoming from the Keating government. The present government is fond of pretending it is really doing a lot for roads, but it has in fact continued the trend of cutting back in real terms, a trend that started under the previous government, way back in the 1991-92 financial year. In that year, almost $2.2 billion was spent on roads in today's terms; this year, spending is down to $1.5 billion. As the opposition is wont to point out, the present government slashed $600 million from road funding in the coalition's first budget. But it was really only taking a more enthusiastic cut to a budget that had already been whittled back by Labor over the previous few years. Sure, this government has reinstituted the black spot program: a very worthwhile program which has benefited my electorate, and for which I am grateful. But that is worth only $37 million per year, nationwide. I say it is a $37 million sales job because government MPs go about crowing how they have reinstated the black spot program but, sadly, forget to mention how they have continued Thursday,S March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 663 Labor's policy of slashing road funding. They took $600 million out and put $37 million back. I believe the media attractive but fiscally challenged black spot program was reinstated as a deliberate ploy to try to divert attention away from the overall funding cut. It is really quite pathetic to see local government plead, when you go and talk to them, for black spot funding. It is almost their only source of help for the roads running through their areas which have cement trucks, school buses and tourist buses travelling over gravel comers. The llford-Sofala road, for example, is a black spot waiting to happen. I know, and they know, they have very little chance of success in gaining funding for these projects that are crying out for help. I have to explain, time and time again, that there is available only $37 million Australia-wide a year. That is about 100 kilometres of road, at best, around Australia. I say that as a member whose electorate has been better treated than most in funding under this program. But it is a very paltry assistance program, given the enormity of the problem out there. We need to be more visionary about our mix of road and rail and about our introduction of private operators to provide some of those urban roads in particular. I compliment the hard working members of the committee for their report. I know it is a difficult subject area and a hugely political one. But the very worthwhile sentiments and recommendations expressed in this report can only be addressed with real money-private and government-and by a regeneration of the rail transport option. committee secretariat-in particular to Meg Crooks for her very professional work, for the support she gave the committee during what was a very extensive hearing period, and for helping all members of the committee get through what was a very extensive and complex question. In addressing the report on the review of federal road funding, I wish to point out that the terms of reference were both clear and concise. Sometimes I worry; this does not always happen. I believe these terms have been well met by the committee. In reviewing the Commonwealth's role in road funding, with the goal of identifying the most effective means of fulfilling that role, it was clearly obvious that we do not have a long-term national strategic plan for the nation's road system or, for that matter, a land transport network. In fact, it is unfortunate that the committee found no cohesive plan on either a state to state level or a federal level. Neither does there appear to have ever been a proposal to generate one. Confusion resulting from a lack of a clear strategic outlook has resulted in ineffectiveness and inefficiencies. The end result of ad hoc and crisis planning is always a blow-out in funding. I believe this report identifies the many ways we can improve our road system at a better return on funds for the taxpayer. Any Australian who travelled through Germany in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s will remember how they returned home marvelling at the length and breadth of the German autobahns. Here were endless fourand six-lane freeways with no speed limit in the outer lane. At that time, all but the major roads in this country were dusty gravel tracks. Many of our so-called national highways were two lanes at most and with many a winding turn. The German autobahns were originally designed and constructed for one reason and one reason alone, and that was for military purposes. After the end of the Second World War they became part of that country's economic revival. These vast and fast highways were planned without consideration of social or environmental",146,Representatives Main Commitiee
305,Mr Mcdougall (Griffith) (12.01 P.m.),"May I first of all pass on my thanks to the664 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 constraints and their very reason for being was certainly questionable. But, in tenns of road construction, the Gennan autobahns still stand as some of the finest roadways in the world. My months as a member of the standing committee and my work on the inquiry into federal road funding have made me acutely aware of the urgent need for Australia to fonn a strategic plan for transporting its people and goods across this country. We must consider the environmental and social ramifications and, as we do so, retain what is the core of our great nation, that is, a community spirit. Ripping a huge slice of road through a small township or well-established suburban community is simply not the way to go. Our national road system has been patched rather than planned, and this is evident not only in Queensland but in all other states. I do not need to tell the many road users of the many instances where a superhighway of four lanes abruptly ends to convert into a double or single lane roadway. We have seen the example of good planning with Brisbane's Gateway arterial and road access for the Brisbane port. The Gateway arterial links two major freeways, giving users efficient and fast access to the Brisbane domestic and international airports. It also bypasses the city centre and the majority of the city's urban areas. It therefore is a fast and efficient traffic mover for people travelling north or south of the city of Brisbane, and they can do so without clogging up the city or suburban streets. As the Commonwealth government is responsible for the funding of our national highway system, I believe it is vital that we demonstrate our commitment to a top quality and safe highway system which sets the benchmark for the states to follow. To ensure a national road system where standards are high throughout the country, it is important that the Commonwealth introduces greater certainty in road funding. As our reintroduction of black spot funding has shown, the Commonwealth government can make an impact on the safety and quality of roads from the highway system down to the individual suburban intersections. The people of Australia must know that if they believe there is a serious road problem in their neighbourhood, despite the involvement of the three levels of government, they can expect action. I agree with the committee's resolve that the responsibility for each category of road should be clearly defined, not just to avoid the passing of responsibility from one level of government to the other but to encourage clear accountability in road funding. Our first goal, as clearly stated in this road inquiry report, is for the Commonwealth to continue to be fully responsible for our national highway system and to continue to fund roads of national importance, but not at the expense of other road systems. For this reason, I stand behind our decision to hold off any further extension of the national highway. There are too many other major roads of economic importance to be funded before we start extending the national highway. As the development of these other roads brings economic benefit to individual states and territories, an equal share of the construction cost is appropriate. The other members of this committee are well aware of my interest in strategic planning. I certainly was not alone in my concerns for the lack of a national transport plan for this nation. The committee was inundated with evidence critical of this lapse and revealing the dangers in the ad hoc program which currently exists. The states, along with the Australian Road Federation, have thrown their support behind our recommendation for a national strategic transport plan. Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 665 Among the many people who gave generously of their time and effort to contribute to this inquiry were the Cement and Concrete Association of Australia. This organisation pointed out the additional costs that are incurred when there is no ongoing forward plan for major road construction. As it currently stands, many contractors retrenched valuable skilled staff during low levels of federal road construction funding. The cost to let go and rehire these skilled technicians is then reflected in future tender prices. With a long-term planning program in place, the government can minimise construction costs by establishing continuity in shortand long-term funding of major projects. I also support the committee's resolve to incorporate in a long-term planning strategy the integration of all forms of land transport. We have seen the result in the rail system, where a lack of national planning resulted in different gauges for different states. We cannot afford to maintain a dysfunctional national transport system, and improving the quality of a road is meaningless unless it connects to other forms of transport. I refer there to rail, airports and seaports. Currently, our national highway does not meet these needs. In some cases, a state highway, or an urban arterial, is the only connection between the national highway and other forms of transport. The states' and territories' role in our road transport network will be made easier and more economical when everyone is working on an overall plan. Therefore, I support the committee's recommendation that untied road funding paid to the states and territories and local government be paid as tied block grants and maintained in real terms. This will ensure' that all Commonwealth moneys directed to roads will reach the target, and not be transferred elsewhere by the states, territories or local governments. I also support the recommendation that we implement a guaranteed funding approach for a rolling three-year period. This recommendation ensures good planning for all levels of government and assists greatly with the contracting process I discussed earlier. The use of tied funds will ensure that the limited available funding is targeted towards achieving national outcomes. This gets back to the important point raised by the Cement and Concrete Association, who suffer financial loss due to the unpredictability of Commonwealth funded projects. The investment by contractors in skilled operators and high cost road construction equipment must be considered as, ultimately, the cost of all road construction falls back on the taxpayer. CSR Emoleum, a major road surfacing company, pointed out to the committee that uncertainty of future road funding levels had inhibited reinvestment in new equipment which, in tum, led to missed opportunities in introducing new technology. This result eventually limits the ability of such a company to achieve an even higher quality of work. Again, in the long run, it means a higher cost to be borne by the taxpayer. The Queensland Department of Main Roads advised the committee that a current process of annual appropriations raises such a degree of uncertainty for our road programs that project planning, environmental considerations and public consultation are seriously impaired. For that reason alone, I support the committee's recommendation that we implement a guaranteed funding approach for a rolling three-year period. Another aspect considered by the committee is the private sector involvement. I support the principle of private sector involvement in public infrastructure. At this stage, the Commonwealth has had no direct private sector investment, or ownership arrangement, in its road infrastructure responsibilities, but it can be seen as indirectly supporting the opportunity for 666 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 investment and ownership of road infrastructure on its tax incentive programs. This inquiry, has studied the three broad forms of private sector involvement and has found some of them wanting. The committee supports the provision of road infrastructure through the competitive tendering for design and construct contracts where work is carried out by the private sector. But financing and ownership remain with the government. When it comes to what is known as the BOOT scheme, where the private operator builds, owns and operates the road until the end of the contract, there is evidence to indicate that this is unlikely to be the best method of delivering Commonwealth road projects. A case in point is the road into Maroochydore on the Queensland Sunshine Coast which was built by the private sector under a BOOT scheme. The new toll road was not popular with the community and, while efficient, was not far from an alternative route, and the community chose to use the alternative route. The state government of Queensland, had to buy the road and remove the toll. Both the new road and the alternative route carry an equitable and comfortable traffic flow. This project is an example of a lack of planning. The community did not want, or need, the new road at that time. There is no reason to wipe this method of road construction off the books, but I believe that it is up to the government to find a mechanism to make it acceptable and agreeable to everyone. The committee recognised that private sector investors will only look for financial benefits. The government has a role in ensuring that resource allocation is improved with respect to social benefits. The third aspect of the private sector involvement is the maintenance of roads by the private contractors. In this case, the private sector involvement is for works only and not associated with investment or ownership. As with all cases, the committee believes that proposals for private sector involvement in road projects should be considered on a case by case basis. The fact that we need a national plan for our road and transport network is evident. I believe this report clearly outlines all the ramifications, and therefore the recommendations. I am pleased to give my support to that report. to address some of the matters referred to in this very important document by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform entitled Planning not patching: an inquiry into federal road funding. I would certainly compliment the chairman of the committee, the member for Lyne( Mr Vaile), who has now of course been elevated to Minister for Transport and Regional Development, so he is going to have to act on his own report. That will be a matter of considerable interest, I am sure, to all of us. I would also like to compliment the previous speaker, the honourable member for Griffith hard. In fact, I have to declare an interest in that I made a submission to the committee and appeared before the committee at its hearing in Melbourne. The member for Griffith was one of several members of the committee at that hearing who gave me a very rigorous work-out. I think the report is a substantial piece of work. I think the committee has come up with some very sound recommendations. I am not going to attempt to address them all here this morning but I will pick up on a few critical points. I compliment the committee on its work and on the calibre of its findings.",149,Representatives Main Committee

307,"( Mr Mcdougall), Who, I Know, As A Member Of That Committee, Would Have Worked Extremely","Thursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 667 It is important when we talk about this particular report that we understand that the committee's terms of reference were that it was to talk about the approach we take to road funding. They were not in terms 'Are we going to build this bit of road or that bit of road?' Or, 'How much funding in real dollar terms are we going to spend?' I know in my electorate that a number of members of the public and those people who had a vested interest, either pro-pUblic transport or pro-roads or whatever, misunderstood the purpose of the inquiry and thought that the committee was putting in bids for particular pieces of road. That was not the case. The first point I make is that the committee has quite clearly come up with a recommendation that we need to have a national plan, and that is of vital importance. One of the reasons that Australia has often found difficulty in a number of its endeavours, historically, is that so many things tend to be state by state. Occasionally, there is a bit of interstate linkage. But the reality of life-whether you are talking about gun control or environmental control or poisons control or labelling or the road system-is that, increasingly, what we do affects Australia, and not just one small part of Australia. So national planning is an absolute key. I am delighted to note that two of my colleagues, the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Dondas) and the honourable member for Groom( Mr Taylor), have come to hear this learned dissertation-not arriving early for the adjournment debate, I am sure. I note that my colleagues have arrived for that purpose. So national planning is very important. The second important point that comes out in the report as far as I can see is the emphasis on getting transparency in the system. One has suspicions that the basis of some decisions that are made as to where road funding might go are not always understood. I think that causes a lot of emotional difficulty amongst those who are proponents of particular systems. The third point that comes out fairly clearly in the report is that, in decisions about where road funding will go, the question of economic benefit has to be, if not the dominant factor, certainly a much more important factor than perhaps has been the case historically. I think that, historically, with the national highway system we have had a bit of a mentality of wanting to jO-.l places on maps with dots from A to B; we wanted to join up the capital cities or go to other particular towns. Whether there has been real economic benefits in some of those roads has perhaps been questionable. In my submission to the committee, economic benefit was the toain point that I wanted to make. But I would add that the submission that I actually signed off and put in was not just a submission on my own behalf. In fact, the submission which I wrote and coordinated was signed off by eight federal members of parliament, by 16 state members of parliament and by eight local government authorities covering the whole of the eastern part of metropolitan Melbourne. The point that we were trying to make, fundamentally, is that in Melbourne, because of the size of the spread of the metropolitan boundary, the major road development that needs to go on-particularly in the eastern suburbs, which has seen huge development in popUlation and industry terms in the last quarter of a century-has, frankly, not kept pace with the growth that has gone on there. We were not saying to the committee, 'We want you to recommend funding for us.' What we were saying was, firstly, that under the present structure there is no way that the state government can come up with the necessary finance, and, secondly, under the present system 668 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 it appears that there is no way that major roads in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne are going to get funded as roads of national importance. Our concern was that something like 46 per cent of economic activity, particularly manufacturing activity, takes place in that part of Melbourne. A huge part of the popUlation base lives in that part of Melbourne. Because of the over-congestion of economic activity on the present road system we have dreadful road safety and pollution problems, and the economic activity of the companies who operate in that part of Australia are severely handicapped. With the growth of Melbourne going south-east, that problem is going to be exacerbated because so much of the activity in the east and south-east of Melbourne is either going to the ports or going up north, and there is no major road to connect them to the Hume Highway or to the Western Ring Road. We put forward as an example the need to build the Eastern Ring Road, incorporated in the Scoresby transport corridor. We pointed out that, although there is high economic justification in national Australian terms, there nevertheless was no way that that could happen under the present system. We therefore felt that it was necessary that the way in which roads are assessed and decisions are made about funding is looked at much more in a national context based on economic benefit. That is of critical importance. Having talked very briefly about that submission, which is aimed exclusively at . demonstrating that we really are not putting the emphasis in the right direction, I will say that a number of the recommendations that have been made by the committee go a long way towards taking that message on board. Recommendations 5 and 6, recommendation 12 and recommendation 15 in the report are recommendations that are particularly noteworthy and "",:,orth drawing attention to. Finally, I would like to say a very brief word on the subject of overall funding. I would certainly like to urge the government to allocate more overall funding for roads in this country, because it is a vital area. I would certainly like to encourage the minister in that line. Private sector involvement is a fact of life. For example, in Melbourne at the moment we have the City Link project, which is very much going to be privately funded. I think that will be a very interesting exercise in how viable such a thing is. I commend the report; I commend the members of the committee for doing a good job and I encourage the minister-now that he is the minister-who was chairman at the time, to implement his own report.

308,", Mrs Crosio (Prospect) (12.25 P.m.)","At the outset I would like to state that I did notThursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 669 I have to refer the author to page 113, which I have just very quickly looked at, and remind the author that Fairfield is not a shire. Fairfield City Council, which I am so proudly associated with, became a city in 1979, so obviously that is an error in the report that has been tabled before the House. They do quote correctly their population figures, of roughly 187,150, but I am sure that they would like to be declared a city. HowI know that they are a city is that I happened to be the mayor at the time. When we made Fairfield a city, it had been a municipality prior to that. It is now a city, a very large city, and is classified as such in this report when we talk about the population. I am pleased also that another area I represent, Holroyd, which has a population in excess of 82,000, at least has been declared in the correct category, that is, as a city. This report talks mainly about the allocation of funding, particularly under capital grants. One of the problems of local government in New South Wales in particular is the tied rating structure that has been in existence for quite some time. They have also expressed the anomalies that with the granting of money to local government we seem to take into account some aspects but not others. Fairfield, for example, which I know very well, would say that over a period of time when they had been very much a growing city a lot of the infrastructure that they had to build was not taken into account in the allocation of grants. I also believe, and I am sure many of my colleagues would agree with me, particularly as we have just had debate on a report on roads, the patching of roads and the building and financing of roads, that one of the anomalies done in the past-it was under our government; I admit to that-was when, following a Premiers Conference of 1990 or 1991, we decided that the allocation of funding to local government for roads would be untied. I know local government welcomed that and said that we should be the masters of our own destiny; that we were old enough to say where our money should be spent. I query whether that money should have gone as untied. I queried it at the time and, sitting on the committee whose report on road funding is also before the House, I still continue to query whether those grants should be tied or untied. Nevertheless, that is up to the government and it is for future local governments, I believe, to put their propositions forward as to whether or not that funding should remain untied. There is another problem we have with the allocation of financing in this country, again, particularly in New South Wales. We have 178 councils in New South Wales. I think the last amalgamations we experienced in that state were in the early 1970s. If my memory serves me correctly-and I see the honourable member for Page( Mr Causley) agreeing with me-at that time there was all the hoo-ha in the shire area particularly where a number of anomalies came across in our state because of the inadequacies of those shires in rate structure; therefore, for the area they have to look after, they have not got the means and the wherewithal to do it. At that time, in the early 1970s, we had something like 34 shires amalgamated into something like 15 larger areas in rural New South Wales. I still today would question that and whether we should not look at the size of some of the local government areas which have got to distribute the workload, and also whether they have the means with which to do it. I think at times when the Local Government Grants Commission looks at the aspects of funding some of those things are not necessarily taken into account. I am pleased that the report has covered a number of merit points, where councils are now starting to get their acts together. In particular, if you go to chapter 5 of this report where we look at benchmarking, we are looking at what councils are now starting to do in coming 670 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 together on a regional basis.

Strathmore Community Committee which recommended that this adjournment debate opportunity be provided in the Main Committee, I think it is a very good thing and I look forward to the opportunity of participating in that. The suburb of Strathmore within my own electorate of Wills has terrific sense of place and a terrific sense of community. In a sense, it has had to have that, because it has been confronted over the years with a number of major challenges. No matter what the issuewhether it is an expression of local concern about the operations of the Essendon airport or concerns about the impact of Tullamarine Freeway widening through the City Link. project or the planning issues involving the impact on the community of multi storey units-Strathmore people have rallied to protect the value of their suburb and their community and to protect it in the way that is more commonly associated with country towns. It is a place which has a great sense of its own identity and that has certainly been something 'that I have valued as its representative. Against that background, the people of Strathmore rallied very strongly to try and save the Commonwealth Bank when it announced that it would close the Strathmore branch. I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of many people from the Strathmore community, in partiCUlar, Rock Pinder and Geoff Kirschner from the Strathmore Traders Association who organised much of the local campaign against that branch closure. My own office received in excess of 100 phone calls. That would be more than I have received on any other single issue. We have over 2,000 petition signatures, and I have a copy of them here this afternoon. We had many letters. When we held a meeting at the Strathmore Bowling Club, over 200 people attended to express their very strong protest against the bank's intentions. Regrettably, the bank said, 'We are going to do this anyway; we are going to close the Strathmore branch,' and it did close on 20 February. I make the observation that these branch closures and staff sackings are not being accompanied by lower fees and charges. On the contrary, they are being accompanied by higher fees and charges, and banks are endeavouring to get us all, coming and going. I did write to the National Bank, which also has a branch in the Strathmore village shopping centre, seeking assurances from the National Bank that they would retain their branch in Strathmore. I suggested to them that people would transfer their accounts from the Commonwealth to the National, provided they had those assurances. The National Bank's response to me said: Whilst the bank conducts regular reviews of its network to ensure service standards are maintained, no current plans are in train for a review of our Strathmore outlet.",154,Representatives Main Committee

The bank said: The need for a full service/time branch is gradually diminishing. I do not accept those propositions. As to changes in the community, Strathmore community is not changing in that sense. It is not going anywhere. As for increasing acceptance of the new technology, people are simply given no choice. A fact of life is that, for many older people, automatic teller machines are not a satisfactory alternative. Indeed, there have been a couple of robberies of people at automatic teller machines-so far not from the Strathmore area-and this does not give older people an appropriate feeling of assurance and safety. I am most concerned about the impact of this branch closure on older people and on shopping centres. I also want to express concern about the gain sharing issue. From the new technology, we see no benefits for ordinary members of the community who lose things like their branches. The benefits all go to people at the top-the chief executives and so on. I have some figures not from the Commonwealth Bank but from Westpac which show their chief executive received $1.9 million in the last financial year, with a bonus of $750,000. For the average person in Wills, it would take in the order of 30 years to earn the bonus, let alone the total salary. We have a situation where the gains from new technology are not adequately being shared out and the banks need to take account of this and to lift their game. (Time expired) Dean, Mr Roger to pay tribute to the late Roger Dean, a great Australian and a true Territorian. My sincere condolences go to his children Michael and Julia, his brother Colin, and to his grandchildren. Roger Levinge Dean, CBE, was born in Sydney in December 1913 and died in Sydney in January 1998. His early years were spent in Newcastle, between 1913 and 1942, where he was educated at Newcastle Church of England Grammar School and at Newcastle Boys High School. In fact, there are a lot of members of parliament today who have been educated at Newcastle Boys High School. It must have been a very good stamping ground for future MPs. He joined the Newcastle based company Rylands Brothers in 1935 as a clerk, aged 22. He was commissioned into the AIF in 1942 and arrived in Darwin within weeks of Darwin being bombed in February 1942. He rose to the rank of lieutenant in the 103rd Anti-tank Regiment. His unit travelled extensively throughout the Top End investigating rumours of enemy landings along the remote coastline. It was here that he made his first contact with Aboriginal communities, which led to his great interest in Aboriginal advancement in the Northern Territory. Later in the war years he joined a waterborne unit and served as beach master in the Wewak campaign. At war's end he rejoined Rylands Brothers in Newcastle. In 1949 he gained Liberal Party preselection for the seat of Robertson, a seat located north of the Hawkesbury River. The current member for Robertson ( Mr Lloyd) made some comments in the parliament yesterday in regard to Roger Dean's involvement with the political infrastructure. It was during a Liberal Party candidates convention that he met his future wife, Ann Manning, whom he married in 1950. They had two children, Julia and Michael, and Ann died in 1982.",156,Representatives Main Committee
311,Mr Dondas (Northern Territory) (12.35 P.m.),"I rise in this adjournment debate today672 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 He was counted among the so-called 'Menzies 4gers', candidates whose views and character were shaped by the Depression and by the war years. He remained as the member for Robertson for 15 years, between 1949 and 1964, fighting and winning seven elections in that time in a seat which changed industrially and socially and which underwent several redistributions. He served on numerous parliamentary delegations and committees including in 1963 as chairman of a parliamentary select committee investigating the grievances of the Yirrkala people. That was also referred to yesterday by the honourable member for Banks( Mr Melham). His involvement with the Northern Territory really started in 1964 when he resigned as a member of parliament to accept the appointment as Administrator of the Northern Territory. His previous interest in Aboriginal matters was seen as part of his qualifications for the Administrator's job. He was there during a period of great change in Territory affairs. When appointed he was also President of the Legislative Council and Commissioner of Police. In 1964, as the Northern Territory parliament started to evolve, the Legislative Council obtained the right to elect its own president. Roger Dean lost his job as council president and a gentleman called Harry Chan was elected to the post. Despite that, Roger maintained a strong interest in the Legislative Council and after losing his job as president had the PMG provide a direct line from Hansard to his office so he would not miss out on what was going on in parliament. He played a very significant role in a period of new Commonwealth expenditure commitment, particularly the construction of the Territory's beef roads. He supported Aboriginal advancement including Legislative Council amendments allowing rents from Aboriginal reserve leases, timber and mining to be used to provide employment in Aboriginal communities, something that is happening in the Northern Territory today. He travelled extensively throughout the Northern Territory including visiting Wattie Creek in 1968 during the Aboriginal pastoral strike. In 1968 he received a Commander of the British Empire honour for public and community service. A quote from Jim Bowditch in the Northern Territory News in 1970 really explains Roger Dean. He said: A plain man, kindly and endowed with an extraordinarily successful talent for communicating with people. Jim Bowditch also said in the Northern Territory News in 1970: He will always have a special place in the memories of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Aborigines. His frankness and unpretentious manner won friends wherever he went. He retired in 1974. He maintained a strong link with America, becoming the federal Vice President of the Australia-America Association. My final quote is from Sir John Carrick in the Australian of 19 January 1998. He wrote: A happy, friendly man with a deep-throated infectious chuckle reserved for the world's whimsies and frailties. He was hard to dislike even in the fierce cut and thrust of politics where he was a worthy opponent. My sincere condolences go to his family.

On this day some 130 people, local politicians, civic dignitaries, trade union",157,Representatives Main Committee
312,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (12.40 P.m.),"Last Friday, 27 February, I had the pleasure ofThursday, 5 March 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 673 officials and workers gathered at the Dapto Leagues Club to commemorate the famous Dalfram dispute of 1938. The Illawarra Labor movement came together to recognise the crucial role played by the Port Kembla Waterfront Workers Federation and its membership. It was 60 years ago this year that the Waterside Workers Federation led the Illawarra labour movement and stood by what it has always stood for since: principles, fairness, justice, community and human rights. Last Friday we paid a special and long overdue tribute to the three remaining wharfies who were involved in the Dalfram dispute: Norm Gamble, popularly known as 'Sunshine', Alan Hetherington and Ray Elliott. They embody the heroes involved in the Dalfram dispute 60 years ago. Although the dispute did not commence until 14 November 1938, all of us in the Illawarra labour movement thought it entirely appropriate that 'Sunshine', Alan and Ray be honoured for their enormous contribution. I particularly want to take this opportunity to have recorded in Hansard my thanks to the Chinese ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Mr Hua Junduo. His remarks at the luncheon were especially warm, appreciated and very well received by all guests. It is important to note that the luncheon on Friday is perhaps Olle of the last official functions the ambassador will attend. He is about to complete his diplomatic service to Australia and will return to China to take up a senior posting in the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I am pleased that in the ambassador's final round of engagements he had the opportunity to join us to celebrate and commemorate this dispute, which established a strong and still firm bond between the People's Republic of China and the Illawarra. The Dalfram dispute has a special significance in the social, political and industrial-history of Australia. Today, 60 years later, the image of the wharfie and the WWF-the Maritime Union of Australia as it is now-is maligned at every opportunity by all members of the Howard government. Back then in 1938, on the eve of World War n, the wharfies and the Waterside Workers Federation faced up to a conservative Lyons government and a conservative business establishment. Today they face ,the same situation-a conservative Howard government and business establishment. Today, just as in 1938, the wharfies and their union line up against political and commercial forces ready to impose their will, prepared to destroy their jobs and security and to destroy their union. In 1938, 'Sunshine', Alan and Ray, along with their comrades, stood up against the government and business to defeat appeasement and the prospect of the infliction of more death and destruction upon the people of China by an aggressive Japan. The Chinese ambassador made a telling point in his remarks on Friday, saying that the Dalfram dispute was remarkable in that the wharfies did not undertake an industrial action to further their own pay or conditions. Wharfies and their unions stood up for China and its people against aggression, against the appeasement of the Lyons government and for Australian lives. BHP, as ever, put profit before human lives. They were earning huge profits from the export of pig iron to Japan. Then Attorney-General Menzies tried to bring in scab labour. He rightly earned the unflattering name, 'Pig Iron Bob', which stayed with him for the rest of his life. There is no doubt that, on the eve of World War II, the pig iron the Lyons government was determine to see loaded aboard the Dalfram would return to Australia in a shower of exploded metalGovernment members interjecting674 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 the admonition to be quiet will not get the call. Blood was the price to be paid for pig iron-a price not acceptable to 'Sunshine', Ray, Alan and their comrades. Member for Casey Speaker Nehl, I have had to offer my congratulations to Speaker Sinclair and I would ask that you pass on my best wishes. I am sure he wiIlleave his indelible mark on that most prestigious position. The reason I jump is that I wanted to take the opportunity, very briefly, to pay tribute to his predecessor. I do not do that as somebody who has been in the parliament with Bob Halverson as the member for Casey for the last 10 years but as somebody who, I think, has known Bob for arguably longer than anybody in either chamber in this parliament. I think that is probably fairly accurate. I first met Bob Halverson in 1957 when Bob was the senior cadet at the officer cadet school in Portsea in Victoria. I was a navy cadet and unfortunately, during an escape and evasion exercise, I had been captured and I was interrogated by somebody I will always remember-a White Russian by the name of Kovalenko-and in the process he got me to sign a piece of paper. I signed this piece of paper, thinking that I was signing for my baggage to be returned after the escape and evasion exercise. However, it was an application form for OCS Portsea. So, for my sins, I had to spend three days at OCS Portsea, as a navy cadet, being redrilled for three days under the auspices of Bob Halverson and trying to learn to be an army cadet. That was my first experience of Bob Halverson. The second experience was when we both served together in the sixties in the Australian embassy in Washington DC-myself as a young navy lieutenant in the naval attache's office and Bob as a flight lieutenant in the air attache's office. We spent a lot of time professionally and personally and on the squash court and off the squash court over a couple of years in that embassy. In the seventies, Bob, as a three-stripe wing commander and I, as a commander, spent exchange in the United Kingdom together-Bob in RAP training command and myself working for the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force, then General Bramwell and now Lord Bramwell. Bob, of course, for the great work that he obviously did during that period of time was awarded the OBE and I know that he was held in the highest regard by the senior officers in the Royal Air Force. Of course, Bob then, after a while, left the air force as a group captain, by which time. I was a navy captain and I went on to be the Director-General of Supply as a one-star commodore. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I feel sure that had Bob Halverson stayed on in the air force, he and I would have been directors-general of supply together-he of the air force and I of the navy. When I decided to resign, as a one-star, to preselect to come into this parliament at the end of 1987, one of the first persons to contact me was the member for Casey. Bob and I have been great mates over a long period of time. I regard him as a very close friend. He put his stamp on the office of Speaker. He put every effort into that job that he possibly could. What are the characteristics of Bob Halverson? I think he is a true leader; I think he is somebody who communicates with people; he can be tough at times as, indeed, he has had",158,Representatives Main Committee

I think that when he leaves the parliament at the end of this particular parliament, he and I will leave together. It is one of those things; we seemed to have followed each other right through the Defence Force and now through the parliament. Of course, when Bob does finally leave this parliament, I hope that there is another capacity in which he can serve this country. He will do so very well. Of course, it comes down to leadership. He is a very loyal person: he is loyal to his party; he is loyal to the parliament; and he is loyal to his family. I take the opportunity to thank Maggie for her assistance, and also to thank Pauline Osmond, in his office, without whom he would not have been able to do the job that he did. (Time expired) Waterfront I want to say something about the waterfront and to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the far greater potential for improvement in efficiency and productivity is in the journey to and from the waterfront. I would suggest to members of the committee that they take the time to read the Warehouse to whaifreport of 1992 and the Warehouse to whaiffinal In that report, we made the point that there was an 'appalling apathy, ignorance and inertia' on the part of waterfront users. Going back to the Inter-State Commission reports, the examination of the 'outside the gate' opportunity for productivity improvement showed that something in excess of $1 billion could be earned or saved, back then. If those numbers are adjusted for inflation, the figure rises to something in the order of $1 '12 billion today. When we did the second report at the end of 1995, we still found the same situation as in 1992: outdated financial documentary and logistic practices were continuing impediments to improved performance and the even flow of cargo to and from the waterfront. We found that there was still little interest from waterfront users. The most telling contribution was made by a waterfront users group. I quote from the Australian Shipping Users Group response to a question about the ignorance from importers and exporters of how the waterfront worked and the transport chain to and from the waterfront. In the 1992 inquiry, they said: It is not a case of ignorance or disinterest as much as a question of priorities. Individual firms do not see the waterfront as a key issue compared with other more pressing problems (maintaining sales, avoiding industrial disputes) and so do not accord it, or its problems, a high priority. That also explains why, when you go to major firms and even to smaller firms, you will not find a transport decision maker on the board and you will not find in the organisation a senior officer responsible for transport coordination decisions. You will generally find ·that those decisions are made by the purchase clerk, in the case of inbound purchases, or by the dispatch clerk. You will not find a transport person on the board of those organisations. They ought to be there. If you link the operation of the waterfront-which operates every hour of every day of every week of the year, into the origin or destination of cargoes from ships, you funnel that into less than office hours work, Monday to Friday. I wanted to make those points, because they put this whole debate into proper perspective. People can rail on with the old political agenda-'It's the wharfie; it's the wharfie; it's the wharfie!'-the mantra that conservatives have lived behind for decades.

317,"Report, In Which The Member For Corangamite ( Mr Mcarthur) Played A Very Important Role.","676 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 5 March 1998 the report that we did and tum to the report that came forward from the National Transport Planning Taskforce in late 1994. They had this to say: To date there has been little success in developing effective linkages between the modes. This failure is due to the unwillingness of the parties involved to compromise in the interest of providing coordinated intermodal services that suit the needs of users. There is a tendency to work around the problems. That brings me to the comparisons I made when I visited the port of Felixstowe on 11 December last. Felixstowe is the largest container terminal in the United Kingdom. It handles more containers-this year, probably about 2.2 million TEUs-than do all the Australian ports put together, and this along a strip of wharf about 1Y2 kilometres long. Its workers are paid between £28,000 and £35,000. When I asked these questions, they said, 'Mind you, they work very long hours.' I asked, 'What is a rough range?' and they said, 'They work very long hours: there's a lot of overtime.' I asked, 'But what range?' They said, 'Between £28,000 and £35,000.' That is a range of from $A72,OOO to $A 105 ,000. It makes the point, in comparison to other industries, that the industry is global and that there a lot of similarities in how the whole thing functions. The actual operation-and I will go into this in a later speech, when I have the opportunity-shows that the same kind of things that happen there also happen in other ports around the world. It is a physical task-(Time expired) work of some very young people doing a pre-apprenticeship course in painting and decorating at the South East Metropolitan College, which is situated at Thornlie, in my electorate of Canning. The innovation and the talent that was displayed by the 13 students and their lecturers, Chris Coleman and Mike Haines, in creating murals on the walls of the campus cafeteria must, I believe, be recognised by everyone. Imagine a dull, uninteresting, grey wall, and then imagine it over and over and over: all around you, you see absolutely nothing but bricks; they are all one colour; they are very uninspiring; and they are extremely boring. Then you go there the next day-or perhaps you could imagine this-and you see this total transformation. You walk into the campus canteen and you find yourself surrounded by scenes from ancient Egypt. Instead of these dull, grey walls, there are now vibrant, exciting and perfectly crafted images of people, animals, objects, pyramids and waterways. Cooling oases and warm sunlight bounce at you from all directions. I want to congratulate Laurie Bull, the program administrator; the lecturers, whom I have already mentioned; and the 13 students at Thornlie TAPE on their fantastic result in attempting to brighten up the college environment whilst at the very same time teaching and learning very relevant trade skills. . This project demonstrates very clearly that young people are very keen to learn new skills. They are keen to be guided into reaching their objectives and to put in extra time and effort, even if this means outside of school hours. These young people, aged between 15 and 16, have every right to feel very proud of and satisfied with their great work and, indeed, of what they have achieved. Once the idea of transforming the dull canteen walls into this exciting mural was conceived, architectural students from the Leederville TAPE College were asked to design a concept. The brief that was given to them was that they had to take note of the shape of the canteen itself, which was actually in the shape of a pyramid. Thus, the Egyptian concept was conceived. After that, the Thornlie TAPE students used an overhead projector to project computerised",161,Representatives Main Committee

These were enlarged and the images traced in with chalk. All of this was done by the students themselves. The next step was for the students to methodically mix paint so that they could actually match the colours exactly to the original painting that they took their idea from. Then, of course, they had to go about filling in the mural and painting the walls. In doing this, they had to use distinctive brushes, strokes, techniques and methods that were all part of their syllabus. What they combined here was having some fun and learning skills according to the course. Almost 95 per cent of this unique project was completed by the students themselves. It gave them an excellent opportunity to work on a team project which was bound to be successful. I add too that this project had such an impact that it has been nominated for the best practice award for teaching methodology by the Building and Construction Industry Training Council. The Thornlie campus canteen will stand as an example of what can be achieved with innovation, dedication and determination on the part of not only the teachers but also the students. All too often I hear that young people are lacking interest; that they do not have the go or the motivation to do something. I would suggest that here is positive proof that most young people are keen to succeed. (Time expired) Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 p.m.",162,Representatives Main Commitiee
