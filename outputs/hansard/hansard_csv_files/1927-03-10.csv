Government has received no request from the British Government to co-operate in any way in the action which it has had to take in China for the protection of British lives and property. No such request would be sent, because, it has been made perfectly clear and definite as the basis of Empire co-operation today that it is for the self-governing dominions to determine what their participation shall be in any matter of this kind. pears in the press to-day to the effect that new proposals for the limitation of naval armament have been submitted by President Coolidge to Great Britain and Japan, the only two powers agreeable to conferring with the United States of America on the subject. gested that a conference shall take place in Geneva to consider the matter.

In view of the fact that the Federal Capital Commission has urged, in a report, that finality should be reached in this matter, and in view, also, of the unrest in Canberra, owing to the Government's delay, I ask the Prime Minister whether it is his intention to introduce the legislation which I presume will be required to permit of a local option poll taking place.

After hearing the speeches of the right honourable member for Balaclava ancl the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), whom I may regard as leaders of thought on either side of the chamber, I am quite satisfied that the moral obligation to continue the per capita payment does not come into question. It must have been a tremendous shock last night to the right honourable member for North Sydney when the At-' torney-Genernl( Mr Latham) confronted him with the words he had used at a cbriference of State Premiers regarding the per capita payment. He must have been smitten "" hip and thigh,"" to use a delightful phrase he himself is so fond of using. The bill will have a very far-reaching effect on Tasmania, particularly .when we compare the per capita payment in 1921 with the estimated receipts of Tasmania for the current year. In 1921, Tasmania received, as per capita Government. payments, £272,514; whereas in 1927-28 it is anticipated that it will receive only £267,367, a decrease of £5,147. At the same time the other States will have benefited by an increase of £1,135,000. other States are more progressive. may be more progressive, but at the expense of the smaller States.

That it may be in the future, I am very hopeful. Tasmania has a diminishing population, but it is not alone in that misfortune. The Island of Newfoundland, close to Canada, is also losing population, and is confronted with exactly the same problems as face Tasmania. The StateI represent not only has less population to tax, but is unable to further decrease its expenditure. That has been clearly stated by the Labour Premier( Mr Lyons), who in the last financial year contented himself with expending from loan funds only the very small amount of £250,000.

The honourable member forgot to mention the landslide in the Herbert electorate as a result of which the honourable member for Dalley found himself back in Brisbane without an occupation. It is noteworthy, too, that when he decided to again attempt to reach the Federal Parliament, he chose another State in whicli to "" take off."" The Legislative Councils of the States have been held up as bogies to frighten supporters of the bill. We are told that where the lower chambers impose the taxation which the Federal Parliament has promised to remit, but that the Legislative Councils, as the strongholds of the rich, will reject such measures. I am of the opinion that reasonable restraint in finance is necessary in both Federal and State legislatures. Council are faced with a proposal to levy additional taxation in fields evacuated by the Commonwealth, without in any way inconveniencing the State taxpayers, is it reasonable to expect that they will place their Government in a financial hole? I refuse entirely to beAt no time lieve that. I think that this Government is taking a certain amount of risk with regard to placing almost total reliance on Customs reveuue. We have heard many honourable members comment upon the inordinate rise in the Customs revenue, but there are quite a number of reasons for that. Some honourable members say that the tariff is not high enough to protect Australian industries sufficiently. I should like to point out three or four factors in the enormous growth of the Customs revenue. One is growth of population, and another is higher values. Then there are the protection policy itself, ancl, perhaps to a lesser degree, the excessive borrowing overseas. Taking the first two items-the growth of population and higher values-ha d the present-day figures been computed ou the same basis as were the 1910-11 figures, £13,000,000, we would have had to-day a Customs revenue of £24,000,000, instead of £44,000,000. On that basis, the difference between the figures for 1910-11 and 1926-27 docs not appear to be nearly so great as some of the free trade members of this House would have us to believe. We have also to take into consideration certain tariff items which have been imposed solely to meet war expenditure. I am uot one of those who think that the present tariff policy is not protective. The way in which our industries are extending to-day is sufficient evidence to me that our tariff policy is highly protective.

The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) must be pleased to find himself with such political bed-fellows as the honourable members for Swan( Mr Gregory) Forrest( Mr Prowse), and Perth( Mr as the next one promises to be, and no Mann). Seeing that the Western Australian members in this House are almost, if not entirely, unanimous in their attitude towards the measure, it seems to mo that they are opposing it solely because of their opposition to the Government's tariff policy. is entirely wrong. that assurance; I feared it was not so. for ring to the entertainments tax, said that the children of Australia would say, "" God bless Dr. Page."" I would remind him that the present Treasurer did not relieve the children of the amusement tax. I am astonished that the right honourable gentleman should wear such a cloak of modesty, especially in view of his amazing political career. He completely forgot that it was the last Treasurer of his own Government, the present Prime Minister, who discontinued the amusement tax, in October, 1922. That act left £1,000 a week in the pockets and purses of the children of this community. In any case, it is far better that the children should grow up with the idea that the Prime Minister, and perhaps the Treasurer as well, had acted as a sort of Father Christmas, than that they should bo imbued with bitterness against the right honourable member for North Sydney for introducing the entertainments tax in 1917. member did not object to the entertainments tax? been an advocate of that tax; but the right honourable member for North Sydney tried to ridicule the Treasurer by saying that he was responsible for something which the right honourable member himself had actually done. We were also asked by the right honourable member what we were going to say at the next election. He tried to crack the whip over some honourable members with a view to frightening them into opposition to the measure. It is a poor sort of individual who always keeps his eyes on the next election, especially when it is so far away one in this chamber is better able than the right honourable member himself to do this. I regret that the Tasmanian grant has been embodied in the bill, but the fact remains that it is there. Under the present arrangement, that State is to be paid a special grant of £378,000 for two years. I regret that the grants to Western Australia and Tasmania are looked upon by certain honourable members as acts of charity on the part of the Commonwealth The right honourable member Government, because I maintain that North Sydney, when referthose States are justly entitled to them. The Treasurer has stated that, under the readjustment, Tasmania will benefit to the extent of another £50,000 a year. . As a Tasmanian representative I have first to think how the proposal will affect my State, and then how it will affect the Commonwealth as a whole. I am convinced that it is in the best interests of Tasmania. The Premier and Treasurer of Tasmania( Mr Lyons) has issued circular after circular, endeavouring to prove that the amount that he will he able to collect when the Federal Government has evacuated the fields of taxation, as is now proposed, will not nearly approximate the amount that the Treasurer says he will receive. that the result will be as stated by the Premier of Tasmania. Even if such were the case, there is still £50,000 to be paid to Tasmania under the proposal outlined by the Treasurer. The per capita payment to Tasmania amounts to about £267,000, and Ave are to receive an equivalent sum, plus £50,000.

51,Mr Jackson,"The taxpayers of the Tasmanian Grant Act, passed in 1924, Tasmania was to receive in the first year £85,000, which was to be reduced by the fifth year to £17,000. The Treasurer on that occasion saidTlie Commonwealth promise was that the fhuue should remain at £68.0(10 for l!)26-27 und 1927-28, thi n showing a gain of fiil.OOO for these two years. The bill now before the House amends the Act of 1924, and the last payment of £17,000 will disappear. I do not know what the Treasurer intends to do about that; but in view of the promise of the Prime Minister that after the two-year period he would have an investigation made into the affairs of Tasmania, I hope an intimation, will be given that financial justice will be_done to that State. The grant and the added advantage for the next two years-£50,00 0 each year, plus the Prime Minister's promise-ar e an assurance to me that the bill will be of advantage to Tasmania, and of no disadvantage to the other States. believe that it is the fervent wish of the general public that the Gommonwealth fiha.ll cease to levy direct income taxation, and I hope that my vote will help them along that ""desirable road. I am contributing to this debate because certain speeches by honourable members have drawn attention to the confusion that has arisen on this question. It has been stated that the Government has a mandate to do this thing, but every honourable member knows that although the Government may have made a statement to that effect, it has no such mandate as is claimed. It stated that it was given a mandate to deport certain residents It staged the play, and to-day the wives of those residents are likely to be awarded compensation by the law courts of this country. The Government also had a mandate to revise the tariff, and to do many other things, and a promise was also given to hold a constitutional session as soon as Parliament had removed to its new home at Canberra. The constitutional session ought to be held, and if it is the intention of the Government to hold it, what folly it is at this stage to antagonize the Slates, whose assistance and co-operation wall be required before any alteration of the Constitution can be made. Notwithstanding the announcement that a constitutional session will be held, the Government a little while ago submitted 'to the people proposals which were emphatically rejected. The people, who did not believe' that the Government was in earnest, desire a complete revision of the Constitution. They believe that the Constitution needs altering materially, but do not approve of the pin-pricking that is now taking place. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) has explained the effect of the bill on Tasmania. I am not aware that, when the grants were being made to Tasmania and Western Australia, any honourable member regarded them as charitable doles. member remember what the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) said about our holding out our hands for I a tip? that; but he has said many foolish things. It is obvious that if the per capita payments cease, Tasmania, with only 40 per cent, of the field of direct taxation, must suffer. This Parliament will continually be required to vote grants. It is obvious that that State will not be able to collect sufficient money for developmental purposes. The hope of the States was contained in the concluding remarks of the honourable member, who disclosed the principal reason for the support accorded to the bill. It is hoped that ultimately the Commonwealth Parliament will cease to collect direct taxation, and that means that practically the only source of revenue for the Commonwealth of this country. will be the Customs and excise. It is wrong to collect revenue through the Customs. As one who believes in perfecting the industries of this country, I fear that the bill will bring about a reduction of the protective incidence of the tariff, and that the indebtedness of this country will be met by the man with the biggest family, who is generally the poorest man. Some time ago the Treasurer handed to the State authorities the work of collecting Federal income taxation, and he said that the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Taxation",17,States Grants Bill Second Reading

Dr. £250,000 has been saved this year in tlie cost of collecting taxatiou. ment of that kind the Treasurer omits to take into consideration many items of additional expenditure. What has happened is confusion worse confounded. While business people ancl others in particular States may have been relieved of taxation, those engaged in industries or commercial enterprises of an interstate nature have derived no benefit. It was stated at the time of the amalgamation that the idea was that the Commonwealth should eventually relinquish the field of income taxation. With the present bill has come another promise to that effect; but instead of being a proposal of a truly federal character, as honourable members who support the measure declare it to be, it is really anti-federal in its essence and application. The action of the Government will not stimulate the Pederal spirit, but stifle it . One finds, on the Government side of the House, a situation that has never previously existed since the inception of the Commonwealth. Honourable members constituting a large section of the Government's followers, including members of both ministerial parties, have pointed out the iniquity of the proposal. They have said that the bill should be withdrawn or postponed until a conference has been held. Never before have I seen a Government with so many opponents among its own followers as the present Government has with respect to this bill. The honourable member for Bass( Mr were passed. The general federal taxaJackson) suggested that we should not talk of such a conference until the bill had been passed. But that would be a conference with a corpse! conference be held? ment's proposal with regard to the claims of the States. 'Ever since the expiration of the Braddon provision, any alteration of the financial relations, or other legislation by this Parliament affecting the States, has been preceded by a conference between Commonwealth and State Ministers. The present Government has adopted a new attitude by saying"" We shall legislate first, and discuss the shall content myself by assuring the Government that if its proposal is persisted in it will have gone back on its mandate and on its promise to hold a constitutional session at Canberra for the purpose of dealing with necessary alterations of the Constitution regarding financial relations and other matters. By its present action, and by what it did in connection with the last referendum, the Government has made it impossible to secure the consent of the people to the granting of increased powers to the Commonwealth. desire to give a silent vote on the bill, and I shall be brief in my remarks, since arguments for and against the measure have been advanced at length. The Government's decision to grant the States £7,700,000 from July next, conditional upon an agreement being arrived at, and to withdraw £7,600,000, or thereabouts, which has been paid by way of the per capita grant, has my whole-hearted support, because it is the only way in which to prepare for a thoroughly comprehensive inquiry, such as all sections desire, to determine the basis on which surplus Commonwealth revenue should be distributed. The assertion of the State Treasurers that they would have to increase taxation considerably in the event of the withdrawal of the per capita payment is nonsensical. It has been said that, in Victoria, additional taxation to the amount of £2,144.000 would be necessary if the hill tion returns £7,780,000, and we return to the States that amount less about £100,000 -the cost of collection-which , under the Government scheme, we are told, would be saved. So far as Victoria is concerned the land and income tax, the estate duties, and the entertainments tax yields £2,270,619, and we hand back to that State £2,144,796, showing a loss to Victoria of £125,853. These figures are disputed by certain State officials; but, when the Treasurer expressed a desire that they should be investigated by a commission, the States would not face the inquiry. They have made up their minds that they want the",18,States Grants Bill Second Reading

The Government has promised that, in the event of any discrepancy being discovered, it w ill make good any loss sustained by the States. To show the mis-statements in circulation concerning taxation I shall read a short letter that recently appeared in the Melbourne Argus over the name of a well-to-do land-owner. It readsSir, Tlie Federal Treasurer (Dr. Pago) says that the States will receive more than they give up under the new arrangement. This may or may not ibe so, but has he considered the effect on individual taxpayers? the present Federal land tax an exemption of £5,000 of unimproved value is allowed. If the tax be transferred to the State this exemption will disappear and every primary producer, indeed every land taxpayer whose unimproved value is £5,000 or more, will be penalized. Perhaps Dr. Page will explain why they should submit to this additional burden. Farmers are already struggling under huge Customs taxation which has been greatly increased by the present Ministry. This is a matter which affects wheat-growers. To grow wheat to advantage an area of at least 1.000 acres is desirable. Roughly, the value of such a farm in Victoria to-day is about £12 an acre. On the Wimmera, it is very much higher. A farm of 1,000 acres at £12 an acre represents £12,000 capital value. Deducting, say, £3 an acre for improvements, £3,000 leaves £0,000 unimproved value. The present exemption is £5,000, leaving a present taxable value of £4,000. When the exemption disappears this taxable value will be £9,000, making an increase in the former's land tax of 125 per cent. Is this just or equitable? Yours, &c, A. W. H. WHITE. Echuca, 3rd March. The fallacies contained in that letter are only equalled by those expressed by some honourable members in this chamber. There is this difference, however, that, gation of incomes? whereas Mr White is probably unaware of the facts, honourable members are not with f u l l y last night by the Attorneyunacquainted with thern. States desire to increase their taxation, in the matter I am prepared to accept in even by 125 per cent., that is a matter preference to that of the honourable memfor them alone. If , however, they require ber for Maribyrnong. I have here an only the amount that they now collect, interesting statement showing that, for why should they ask for more?

Why should it be assumed that if the State collects the tax, instead of the Commonwealth, the amount of the present Federal exemption must disappear? The Commonwealth proposes to retire from taxation fields tliat, in the aggregate, yield more than the States are now receiving from the capitation payments, and it is quite open to the States to re-enact the Commonwealth legislation, or to pass legislation in such form that at least the present incidence of taxation shall not be altered. So far as land tax is concerned, therefore, the States need only collect from that source what the Commonwealth is now receiving-n o more and probably less. According to the illustration given by Mr White the farmer Under who owns a farm of unimproved value of £9,000 now pays £20 4s. 5d. tax on a taxable value of £4,000, but "" when the tax is transferred to the State,'' he will lose the benefit of the exemption of £5,000, and will pay tax on the whole amount of £9,000; which, under the present Commonwealth law. would amount to £55 10s. The removal of the exemption of £5,000, and the continuance of the present rate of Commonwealth tax, however, would mean that the State would raise from land taxation a much larger revenue than the Commonwealth now derives from that source. If this be done, it is in no wise a necessary consequence of the Commonwealth proposals, but a question of policy for which the State legislators must assume responsibility. In the case of Victoria, a gain of £125,000 per annum would result from the adoption of the Government's scheme. Sof a r as I am concerned, it does not matter whether the land and income taxes which I pay are credited to the State or to the Commonwealth. I do not favour the discontinuance of the per capita payments in the expectation that I shall be exempted from taxation; but any increase that the State may put on me will not be due to the provisions of this bill.

The per capita payments operate unfairly in respect of States like Western Australia. I am connected with two trading concerns which have an annual turnover of considerably over £500,000, and I know how difficult it is for small firms to set up in opposition to huge enterprises. If business men in a State like Western Australia attempted to establish industries to compete with those that are well established in a State like Yictoria, goods manufactured here could be dumped there, and all endeavours to set up local industries would be defeated. It is a foolish scheme that compels States like Western Australia and Queensland to participate in per capita payments on the same basis as States like Victoria and New South",20,Earle Page A N Amount Of Matter With The States Afterwards I

I submit that the per capita plan tends to make the wealthy States wealthier and the poorer States poorer, and, therefore, the sooner it is superseded the better for all concerned.

Government, on its part, flatly refused to consent to the withdrawal of the proposal to abolish the per capita payments. submit alternative proposals, and they declined to do so. Honourable members have said that there was no referenco to this subject in the Prime Minister's policy speech; but, in my opinion, the following paragraph is definite on that point:The whole basis of these arrangements, however, was destroyed by the great war. The financing of Australia's great effort in that struggle was undertaken by the Commonwealth, and to-day the Commonwealth is carrying an annual burden of nearly £30,000,000 to meet the obligations incurred at that period. In addition, the Commonwealth has undertaken the obligation to provide for old age pensions, and invalidity, as well as the maternity bonus. amount to over £8,000,000. The result of these fundamental changes is that the Commonwealth to-day is raising revenues in order to provide the per capita payments to the States. This is contrary to the 'basic principle of national finance that every Government shall have the responsibility of raising the revenue whicli it is expending. The development of Australia as a nation, and the necessity of dealing with many great questions on a national basis, sucli as that of road transport, to whioh I have already referred, also' renders necessary a re-examination of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. It passes my comprehension how, in the face of that statement, honourable members can argue that this proposal was not Victoria is, probably, the referred to in the policy speech. It haa been stated that the Commonwealth is morally bound to continue the per capita payments, but those who argue in that way, apparently forget that there has been a war, in respeet of which the Commonwealth has to meet an annual charge of £29,000,000. The interest on our war debt and the provision for sinking f u n d , w ill , as a matter of fact, continue for the next 50 years, and £8,000,000 of the expenditure will continue indefinitely. I often reI n the gret that I am not able to extract a little more from the Pensions Department to meet the urgent .needs of ex-soldiers and their dependants who make appeals to me. Our expenditure on in valid and old-age pensions amounts to £10,000,000; maternity allowance, £700,000; and defence from £5,000,000 to £5,500,000 a year. Our Customs and excise revenue last year was about Commonwealth £40,000,000, but, as the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) remarked, it may this year amount to £44,000,000.' Out of this revenue we It asked the States to have, however, to meet those items of expenditure which I have just enumerated and others which amount to approximately £45,500,000 a year.

I congratulate the honourable member for Indi( Mr Cook) upon the electioneering speeh that he has made in the interests of the Country party. What is the real issue that faces honourable members? At the last election the party opposite went to the country with the cry "" We must have constitutional government."" Members of the Labour party were charged with being in league with disloyalists and communists, and the result was that the electors were stampeded into voting for the present occupants of the treasury bench. The withdrawal of the per capita payment was not made an issue at that election. for granted that the payment was to be withdrawn. granted that it was the settled policy of the Government to continue the practice that had been in existence since the establishment of federation. The Government has not been asked to take this action; on the coiitrary, it is meeting with opposition from all political organizations. The platform which I have signed specifically instructs me to support the retention of the per capita payment. I understand that a promise on similar lines has been made by the National party. I am not aware of what has been done by the Country party. Had federation not been established, the States would now be receiving the whole of the Customs revenue. Federation the understanding that the States were to have returned to them a portion of that revenue. been said that the obligation of the Commonwealth in respect of invalid and old age pensions and interest on the war debt amounts to over £29,000,000. If we were to vacate the field of direct taxation the revenue required for those purposes, as well as for the defence of Australia and the development of our territories, would have to be provided by Customs and excise duties, and it would be necessary to impose a purely revenue tariff. We should not then have an effective protection policy. A protective tariff is designed to factures. When that object has been achieved to the extent that we are able to manufacture the whole of our requirements we shall not derive a great deal of revenue through the Customs. The idea of the Government is to retire from all avenues of direct taxation and depend for its revenue solely upon the Customs Department. The people will not stand for that. The real object of federation was to secure uniformity in legislation. Under the Government's proposal, instead of having that uniformity, we shall have six collectors of land and income taxation, a state of affah's entirely contrary to the spirit of federation. The intention of the Ministry to convene a conference after the passing of the bill is analogous to a proposal for a conference between employers and employees to consider whether the employees' wives should be allowed to do domestic work to supplement the family income and make good the losses sustained by wage reductions forced on the employees by the employers. templates depriving New South Wales of between £2,600,000 and £3,000,000 of revenue each year. propose to take it after fifteen months, and, in the meantime, to discuss the position with the various States. will be convened after tlie per capita payments have been withdrawn. The attitude of the Ministry reminds me of a former public executioner in New South Wales, who enjoyed the reputation of was agreed to on being a very gentle man. It was said of him that when he was about to tie the rope round the neck of the unfortunate It has condemned man, he would say, "" I will make it as easy as I can for you."" To do that he would give the man a long drop. This Government proposes to make the position easier for the States by immediately withdrawing the whole of the income which, under existing arrangements, they receive from Customs and excise duties. From a political point of view, this will suit the Labour party. The-people of New South Wales are bearing a heavy burden of taxation at present.

Consequently, the Federal Government will have to answer to the people at the next general election. But1 put the interests of the Commonwealth before the interests of my party, and urge the Government not to take this retrograde step. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Perkins) said yesterday thut not one prominent member of the Nationalist or Country parties of New South Wales or Queensland was opposed to the Government's proposals. The honourable member spoke out of his turn, because an hour or two later, the right honourable W. M . Hughes, one of the most prominent Nationalist representatives from New South Wales, strongly condemned the bill. The right honourable gentleman, I remind honourable members, has had a very long experience in the public life of this country. He has been a member of the Federal Parliament since the inception of federation, is a former Prime Minister, and can be relied on always to have his finger on the pulse of the people. When I remember the record of those honourable members who are opposed to the bill, and compare it with that of the occupants of the front Government bench, I feeling impressed with the gravity of the situation. Not one member of the Ministry has had any State parliamentary experience, and, consequently, Ministers know nothing about difficulties of the State administrations. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer both entered this Parliament as raw recruits. Mr B-RENNAN -They are a callow lot. Hughes, who spoke so strongly against the measure last evening, knows all about the instrumentalities of the States, how extensive are their activities, ancl how necessary it is that they shall be assured an adequate revenue to carry out their work. why he sought to withdraw the per capita payments in 1919-20? Labour party did not wish the principle to be embodied in the Constitution. The record of the Treasurer himself cannot be compared with that of the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), who also is opposed to the bill. Mr Watt has had twenty years' experience in the Victorian Parliament, holding office for some years as Premier and State Treasurer, and also has been Treasurer in a Commonwealth administration.

The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory); another opponent to the bill, has to his credit seven years' ministerial office in the Western Australian Government, and, because he knows how this measure will affect his State, he is strongly opposed to it. In the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) we have another man who has had long experience in a State Parliament. With his ripe experience of State ministerial problems, he also is cannot help against this bill. My own respected leader, Mr Charlton, had considerable training in the New South Wales Parliament, whilst the latest recruit to this House, Mr Theodore, a former Premier the and Treasurer of Queensland, and one who has attended several of the conferences with Commonwealth Ministers over this particular issue, has warned honourable members that the carrying of this measure will seriously in jure the State of Queensland. The judgment of the honourable members to whom I have referred is convincing evidence of the unwisdom of the bill. The honourable member for other honourable members who contributed to the debate, unwittingly let the cat out of the bag.

As a Labour representative, I Avould scorn to vote for any measure Avhich, whilst it might advance the interests of my party, would be"" injurious to the people generally. The financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States should not be vicAved in any narroAv way. Because the Labour party is in poAver in five of the States, that is no reason Avhy the Commonwealth Government should do anything to deprive. them of their legitimate share of the Customs ancl excise revenue. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro asked why Ave should come to the assistance of five State Labour Governments by handing them this money. Whose money is it? It is the people's money. Wales, for example, contribute to the revenue from Customs and excise, and are entitled to share in it. We are told that the State GoA'ernments can impose direct taxation; but if they do so they will'derive no advantage from the taxation imposed upon their people through the Customs House. I do not desire to see the Commonwealth Government humiliated, but honourable members opposite must know that the proposal now under discussion is not popular. If the passing of this bill were not made a party question the majority of honourable members would reject it, because the proposal has never been put before the people. When it was recently proposed to put some questions to the people by Avay of referendum the Government must have had this proposal in mind, if, as it is claimed, it was part of the mandate given them by the people, and Avhy then did they not submit it to the people with the other questions submitted at the referendum? then before the Parliament. kept it up its sleeve and gave the people no chance to deal Avith it at the referendum. If this measure were submitted to the people it would be rejected by a majority of four to one. ment cannot point to any State or any body of opinion demanding that it should proceed with this measure. The Treasurer believes that there should be only one collector of taxation, and claims that it would reduce the cost of government if the field of direct taxation Avere evacuated by the Commomvealth. He overlooks the fact that the States must vrovide machinery for the collection of direct taxation. such machinery in most of the States. monAvealth Government would save money now spent to collect direct taxation if it eA'acuated that field; but the State Governments would have to increase their staffs to cope with its collection. We have listened to some lectures upon the extravagance of the State Governments. I have no Avish to institute The people of NCAV South comparisons, but the expenditure of the CommonAvealth Government is.far greater than that of the State Governments. When the Treasurer first entered this chamber he continually denounced the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and others because of the extravagance of the then Commonwealth Government. He demanded that light should be thrown upon its expenditure. But the expenditure of the Government of Avhich he is himself a member has far exceeded that of the Government he condemned. able gentleman talked about then is Avell covered up now! that the light will be turned on when honourable members opposite go before the country on the next occasion.

I had the pleasure of going from Queensland round to ""Western Atistralia with a commission, and was very pleased to observe that there appeared to be abunAfter carefully following the debate, I am dant prosperity and progress in every one of the States. We are told of the great debts of the States, but if Queensland and the other States are to construct railways, and open up the country for settlement, they must borrow money for the purpose. This proposal will check railway construction and development in the different States. The Commonwealth Government can construct railways for the purpose of development only within territories under its control. might be something in the proposal if it were provided that the money now covered by the per capita payments would be expended in the unification of our railin the population of Australia. In that way gauges. That would give employment to the people, and would relieve the State authorities of some of their burden. What is proposed is that the State Governments shall be deprived of over £7,000,000 derived from Customs and excise taxation, and they will then be invited to meet representatives of the Commonwealth Government at a conference, where they will be told that they will be allowed to impose direct taxation. What a very generous offer! We know that the collection of taxation is not popular, and because there are five Labour Governments in the States, honourable members opposite propose that they should be made unpopular by compelling them to levy direct taxation. The members of the party on this side stand for the distribution amongst the States of a certain amount of the revenue derived from Customs and excise. No State should suffer as the result of any action taken by the Commonwealth. If , at the time of Federation, it had not been made clear that, under the Constitution, the State authorities would receive part of the revenue from Customs and excise, there would have been no Federation. The States then trusted the Commonwealth Parliament, and have continued to do so for a quarter of a century. It behoves the present Government to act in good faith towards the States by withdrawing this bill, or modifying it in such a way as will promote harmony between the States and the Commonwealth. merits of the Government's proposal have been fully discussed, and its good poiuts as well as its weaknesses brought out. convinced that the per capita payments as such must either cease now, or in the very near future. During the last financial year they amounted to £7,530,615, and as the population of the different States increases, the total amount of the per capita payments must also increase. I remind honourable members that the British Government advanced £34,000,000 to the Commonwealth to assist migration. We are all agreed that Australia must There have a larger population, and if the methods adopted by the British Government and the Commonwealth are successf u l the result should be a large increase event, the Commonwealth Government will be placed in the position of having to find 25s. per head for each of the new arrivals, in addition to the £7,530,615 it is compelled to hand, over to the States at the present time under the arrangement to make them per capita payments. Many members of this House believe in a protectionist policy for Australia. I have myself advocated protec tion for some industries with which I am concerned. It is the object of every good protectionist to make the tariff effective against the introduction of goods from abroad. If our tariff is to operate in this way I cannot see how any Commonwealth Government is going to raise sufficient revenue from Customs and excise to meet the demand of the States for the continuance of the per capita payment. An effective policy of protection should mean that the present large revenue from Customs and excise would cease. I am very sympathetic towards the State authorities in view of their responsibilities and the need for development in all the States. I am aware of the splendid work they have accomplished in the way of railway construction and inland settlement. But I cannot -understand what",26,Revenue Per Hea D From Taxation

It is said that the Commonwealth Government is adopting a wrong method in dealing with the question. Some honourable members have said that, before 2'assing this bill, a conference w i th the State authorities should be held to see whether some mutual agreement cannot be arrived at. The Commonwealth Government has met representatives of the Statesi n conference, not once, but three times, and nothing useful has resulted. It apparently has come to the conclusion that some gentle persuasion is necesasry to convince the State Governments that it is sincere in its desire to abolish the per capita payments, believing that some more equitable method of dealing with the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States should be arrived at. conference. posed after the passing of this bill. Some of making honourable members contend that this States is wrong, and very rightly it legislation should first be withdrawn and says that some action should be taken we should then repeat the farce of the to remedy what it regards as a defect.

All these methods n.ould States, whether they liked it or not, be thoroughly discussed, and along those would be compelled to agree to some allines I think we could arrive at some teration. I do not blame the Treasurer solution of the difficulty. But it is an or the Prime Ministerf o r taking the undoubted fact that the obligations of stand they have taken during the last the Commonwealth have considerably in fortnight. No self-respecting Ministers creased. Por instance, we have taken could do otherwise. over practically the whole of the expenmembers have altered their opinions on diture on immigration; and, although the the merits of the Government's proposals; matter has been subjected to a good deal of criticism, we have provided money for the construction of State roads. I am satisfied that none of the States would have spent their proportions of the money on these roads had it not been for the generous offer of the Commonwealth, and,' in. any case, no matter where the money comes from it is pleasing to the people to know that they are being provided with better means of transport in country districts. We have also taken, up the question of national insurance, and in years to come very material assistance will be given to the people of the Statesi n that direction. Another step involving considerable expenditure is the appointment of a Health Commission to co-ordinate the health activities of the States. We have also set up a council to bring about an improvement in scientific and industrial research. We have, therefore, incurred heavy financial obligations in many directions. During the course of the debate on this bill the Government has beeu given a considerable amount of But there is to be a advice, but the whole position can be summed up briefly.

I do not think the Government would be justified in withdrawing a bill of such importance. It would be far better for Ministers to suffer defeat, knowing that they had the courage of their convictions, than to be dictated to by a few leading members of their own political party, or by the press of Australia. shall be brief in ray remarks, because a good deal of the matter I have collected has already been made use of in admirable and powerful speeches which have not yet been answered by the Government, simply because the arguments advanced in them were unanswerable. I put the blame for this legislation on the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page). I am not a member of the Country party, but I have been a country member all my life. I do not care so much how things get on in the cities; for the f u l l 35 years of my political life my influence has always been used for the benefit of the primary producers and rural districts. At the outset of my remarks, I wish to know why there is such a desperate rush to pass this legislation at a time when we have other matters of pressing importance to consider, and when it is recognized that within three or four weeks the House must adjourn for the celebrations during the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York, and the opening of our permanent home at Canberra? We are told that the Government had a mandate for this legislation. It has been made as clear as noon-day that no such mandate has been given, and that the Dandenong speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) contained nothing more than a simple reference to the recommendation of the Western Australian Disabilities Commission that there should be a review of the whole financial position as it affected the States and the Commonwealth. The right honourable gentleman said that that suggestion "" was to be conI f , because of tbe sidered."" farmers' man, and yet he is doing his level best to, injure the farmers by supporting an outrageous proposal for which there has been no mandate. There was a mandate given by the people at the last elections, a more definite mandate than had been given at any previous election, and that was to clean up industrial troubles. If it had not been for the feeling that then existed throughout Australia, supporters of the Government would have had a pretty tough fight; but it was as easy as falling off a log for them to be elected. The people said, ""Nothing else counts; clear up this industrial trouble."" Yet that important mandate was only partly observed, and financial questions of great importance have been put to one side. For the last two or three years this House has had no proper opportunity to overhaul the finances or investigate with any degree of thoroughness the public expenditure. It has not had time to do so. Whether by design or not, these important questions always have been left to the concluding weeks of Parliament, when they have been rushed through without proper consideration. Yet they are bread and butter matters, about which the people should know a great deal more than they do. The financial arrangement with the States has been in existence for 27 years, and it has not given any trouble, save to bring about periodical discussions, mostly^ academic, which have led to nothing. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) was striking below the ben when he made certain charges against an old friend, in connection with fhe revision of the per capita arrangement. The honourable member did not know what he was talking about. Apparently he could not distinguish between the conditions prevailing when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, and those existing to-dav. Moreover, the proposals he now condemns were those of the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), and the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was not responsible for them, because, accompanied by",28,Revenue Per Hea D From Taxation

When the present Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), as Treasurer, presented a budget, the simplicity of which captivated the whole community, because it could be understood so easily, the present Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) had a good deal to say about it. I advise honourable members to read Page on Bruce, and Bruce in reply to Page. Yet to-day we find these two honourable gentlemen cheek by jowl, like two blind sisters, in agreement to dive into expenditure never dreamt of before. The extravagances which attracted the unfavorable comment of the present Treasurer were a mere flea-bite to those of to-day, the only difference being that the latter are covered up in the budgets of to-day.

We have been told that the representatives of the States Avould not meet Commonwealth Ministers in conference. That is true, but the unfortunate State TreaThey used to surers Avere in. desperate straits because of the financial embarrassment resulting from enormous and annually increasing liabilities, such as could not have been anticipated. When their existing troubles Avere added to by the Commonwealth proposal to discontinue the per capita payments, they regarded it as so unfair that they refused to discuss it.

He refused to do so. conference, fhe Government's scheme was submitted and discussed. The Premiere were invited to state their vieAvs. They refused to do so.

Nevertheless, the Prime Minister's explanation does not alter the position A-ery much. I am not prejudiced as to the form any financial adjustment shall take. I am one of the few Liberals in this House who believe in having one taxing authority, and in the Commonwealth withdrawing from the field of direct taxation as soon as possible. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have declared very definitely that there is no constitutional, legal, or moral obligation on the CommonAAealth to continue 7 the per capita payments to the States. I admit that there is no constitutional or legal obligation, but there is an implied moral right in the States to share in the Customs and excise revenue.

99,Mr Foster,"I am glad to have to achieve a true federation. The opiniou of the delegates was that, ou account of our immense territory, the development and defence of Australia would be best assured by a federal form of government. All constitutions then existing, including those of the United States of America, Canada, Switzerland, and the various States, were examined by the delegates, who were big men, rich in ability and wide in outlook. When they gor. down to the financial provisions their difficulties began, but, as the result of many sittings in committee, a plan was evolved for the States to participate in the Customs and excise revenues to be collected by the Federal authority. Tn accordance with that agreement, the States for some years received three-fourths of the whole of that revenue, and had the exclusive collection of direct taxation. It was very difficult to get the people to consent to the union, which meant the surrender of some revenue to a new central parliament. The States had very slender resources; low prires ruled for all products, and every State Treasurer had to look carefully at a pound before spending it. There were few ministerial jaunts in those days; a Minister could not even go to Victoria or I New South Wales to study what was being done there, because the State finances would not bear any additional expense Nowadays one can rarely enter a railway carriage without being crowded out by politicians travelling in search of information. A few days ago I was speaking to Sir Josiah Symon, who was one of the legal giants of the Federal Convention, and chairman of the constitutional committee at its meeting in Adelaide. His reputation in South Australia as a constitutional lawyer is such that, if ever an amendment of the State constitution is proposed, the people in every electorate ask, "" What does Symon say?"" He still follows federal politics as closely as he did when he was a cham! pion of State rights in another place. I When he heard of what this Government, is proposing with regard to the per capita payments, he said, "" You are going mad. It is incomprehensible that a Nationalist Government should want to commit political suicide by seeking to destroy the States."" When Sir Josiah was a member of another place, he said many times, "" God forbid that the great corner-stone of federation-the constitutional provision which ensures the safety and solvency of the States-shoul d ever be jeopardized or injured."" He expresses the same sentiment to-day. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), when Treasurer in 1919, proposed to tamper with the per capita payments. At that time the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) and his lieutenant ( Sir Joseph Cook) were in England. The Australian people were staggering under financial burdens which appalled even the stoutest hearts, and the Mother Country, in glorious self-sacrifice, although bearing the financial burdens of her allies as well as her own, handsomely offered to relieve Australia by advancing the money for the feeding and maintenance of our soldiers abroad. Up to that time the strain had bern almost unbearable, but with good seasons and good prices for wheat and wool we soon were able to breathe more freely. It was because this Government did not know which way to turn for money that the then Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer ( Mr Watt) put his proposal before the States. The Liberal party refused to accept it, ami so it was dropped. To-day the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) made a speech that had no semblance to his former speeches in which he cried about the needs of Tasmania and the way in which that State was being ruined by federation. The framers of the Federal Constitution worked day and night at the convention to provide for the safety of the State's, and particularly of the smaller States. At that convention were men of wide experience from Tasmania, and they hung grimly together with Sir Edward Braddon as their leader. The convention, from the beginning, realized that Tasmania required nursing. For that reason a portion of the Commonwealth's Customs revenue was set aside for the States, and particularly for Tasmania. The Constitution also provided for additional assistance to necessitous States. Such assistance has been given, and it will continue to be given. I am surprised that a representative of Tasmania in this House should support the withdrawal of the per capita payment to that State, especially in view of its parlous financial position. The State of Western Australia has a great future, and is, therefore, entitled Jjjo special consideration. Eor some time' that State collected its own tariff revenue, and it has also had considerable assistance from the Commonwealth. We are putting money into a good bank, because Western Australia is bound to be a great country. of rapid development, to which most States in money, and in other ways. Are we justified in so precipitately cutting off from the States a wise provision that has been justified a thousand times over during our 27 years of federation? All the States say "" No."" With them it is a question, not of politics, but of financial life or death. The great banking interests, the financial experts, and the great commercial leaders of Australia are practically all united in their opposition to this measure. Sir Henry Braddon, the president of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, and one of the Prime Minister's ablest financial advisers, recently passed through Adelaide. The Chamber of Commerce there asked for his advice on this subject. He replied that he had been swimming in figures for weeks, and had come to the conclusion that the Australian States could not long survive the withdrawal of the per' capita payments. The Government's proposal, if given effect, must bring about a calamity; but I am not taking a gloomy view, because I am certain that it will never operate. may pass this House by a small majority, there is still the Senate to be consulted. No government, especially this composite ministry, could survive the storm of protest that must arise if this pronosal is forced on the country. number of people say flippantly that the people outside are taking little notice of the Government's proposals. opinion, they think a lot more about what is done in this Parliament than those inside it and about the cities. Our best citizens are in the outback country. On Sundays, in places where no church is in the vicinity, these men read Hansard. They know what is being done in this chamber. The per capita provision was made for them. There is a iTr. Foster Country party in this chamber, and I have been told that the Treasurer has ten-twelfths of them in his pocket. What sort of a party can it be? This measure affects the producers more than any other section of the community. Under existing conditions the passage of the measure by a majority of four or five votes would be almost equivalent to defeat. I shall stand by the It has reached a stage per capita principle and by the States. People say that this is the day of young are contributing in manhood, men, and so it is. They have glorious opportunities, but how many of them are cutting out a track to enable them to shoulder the responsibilities that were undertaken by the men of the past? The great majority of our young men are absorbed in pleasure, and in anything except real downright work and a conscientious endeavour to shoulder their country's obligations. A contemptible and paltry reference that we very often hear to-day is that State righters are little Australians. Unless we give the States fair play we shall never have a happy Commonwealth. Only prosperous States, big or little, will make a prosperous Commonwealth. This Government and its followers are putting a dagger into the heart of this rock-of-ages principle that was designed to ensure the safety of the States. A certain person at the Eederal Convention caused a lot of trouble. He was a "" Yes-no "" delegate; although his counsels prevailed at the finish. He and many others at the Convention wanted to make the States safe for all time. Although the measure Now this Government proposes to nullify their' work by withdrawing the.per capita payments. Are we not dangerously near, the track of unification, leading to financial strangulation and the desertion of the people on the land, unA doubtedly the best citizens of Australia? We are deserting them. I know that nn adjustment which may be as good for In my the States as the per capita payment may be made; but will it be made? The Government is now suggesting generous treatment of the Statesi f they will reason with the Commonwealtb, will consent to put their arms round each others necks, and agree. It is contemptible to thrust a dagger into a man, and then say, "" We will confer with you.""' It is not Liberalism; it is not even honest. There is an implied obligation in the Constitution. Whatever adjustment we make now should endure, and would endure if we treated the States decently. The moral obligation may some day be essential for adjustments on the side of the Commonwealth, as it is essential to-day for adjustments on the side of the States. The amendment of the Constitution cannot imperil tlie nation in time of war, for the humanly possible to prevent this bill from Government, if necessary, can again havo recourse to emergency legislation. In war time that would be the proper thing to do. unificationist; he has distributed pamphlets on the subject, and has advocated unification on many platforms. When the Federal Constitution was drafted every statesman in England said that it was the finest instrument of government that had ever been given to a free and enlightened people. When five of the framers of it took it to England to have it passed through the British Parliament, all the newspapers in the world eulogised them and those associated with them in its production. It is now proposed that it should be amended. Mr E. TiiLEY -B y inexperienced men. Many amendments are needed in the Constitution, but they cannot be made, because the people-and I do not blame thorn-wil l not trust this Parliament. Does it ever occur to those who worry themselves about amendments of the Constitution that this Parliament has many powers that it has never exercised? It is a scandal that this Parliament has never dealt with the marriage laws. The highest principles of humanity demanded consideration of that subject long ago. For how many years did the provision relating to tbe insolvency laws lie hidden in the Constitution before we attempted to legislate under it? Members of the commercial community in overy State were humbugged and suffered enormous losses, but it was very late in the day when this Parliament set itself to pass an act which is not in working order even now. would accomplish more than he is doing if he gave his attention to such common sense matters. If all honourable members wore free to vote faithfully for the people on this big constitutional question, there could be but one result. bers on the Government side free men? demonstrate. I know that the interests and safety of this country are in danger, and therefore I shall do everything that is being passed. Something has been said about a mandate; but the Government has other mandates that it has not exThe Treasurer is a confessed' ecuted. Those who say that no great moral principleis implied in the Constitution in regard to per capita payments are dangerous men to this Commonwealth. There has been some talk about a constitutional session. The holding of such a session would do no harm, and may brighten up the minds of some people and educate them on the foundational principles underlying the safety of this country. That form of education is badly needed. Buti f the question is put to the people, I am willing to give odds of ten to one that they will not approve of the change. Switzerland is one of the most democratic countries in the world; but in the matter of changing her constitution is one of the most conservative. Proposed amendments of the constitution of that country are submitted to the people year after year, and are turned down for eight or nine years, until the people, wearying of well-doing, allow them to pass. It is much the same in Australia. Again and again attempts have beeu made, with no result, to obtain the people's endorsement of proposals to alter the Constitution. To the representatives in this chamber of country constituencies I say, with all the earnestness nt my command, "" If you forsake the farmer now, God help you, for you will meet the fate you deserve."" The Prime Minister has admitted, and the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) has stated, that the principal advantages of the Customs tariff are obtained by two big cities. Who, on the other side, balances the ledger? It is balanced by the small States and the primary producer, who The Treasurer is the base of all our prosperity. How did we get through the war?

Wool is still saleable at a satisfactory price, and is the best line of produce that we have; but the price of wheat is near the bare cost of production. is a large one. The burden placed upon the wealthy farmer has to be carried by the small, struggling farmer. The big man, by employing the latest implements, can reduce the cost of production and show a satisfactory result, but the little man, who cannot afford the same facilities, is having a bad time. one. Parliament passes this bill, the people will wipe the Government out of existence. Australia is a high tariff country, and, as a rule, this House and the producers' representatives in it have been most generous to the secondary industries. The manufacture of agricultural machinery in Australia has been of great benefit to this country. The employees iu that industry do not "" go slow."" They receive big wages, and Australia can afford to pay big wages to those who earn them, but, when a couple of men put together a few sheets of iron, I object to the Minister for Trade and Customs declaring that another great industry has been established in this country. And up goes the tariff! Up-to-date machinery'and the best brain-power available are required to produce efficiency in manufacture. It would be wrong, however, to place the States on an unfair competitive basis. The Government, by this measure, is deserting the men it ought to assist, and they, with others, will rise in a mighty army and tell the public that in some of the big manufacturing establishments high wages are being paid to men where there is not efficiency. During the last keynote was industrial efficiency, and I on the industrial system in vogue in Canada and the United States of America. The Treasurer, who recently visited these countries, must be aware of the local conditions. The honourable gentleman has been travelling about Australia in an aeroplane; but, if he would come down to earth, and deal with bread and butter affairs, it would be advantageous to the people. What authority has the Government for opposing the States' demand for a share of the Customs revenue? I know something of the difficulties associated with. State administration, and I agree with the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) that the State financial responsibilities have increased enormously of late years. The population in the various metropolitan areas has grown to. such a remarkable extent in the last twelve or fifteen years that, despite the tremendous capacity of the water supply systems, they are not nearly big enough to cope with the ' i creasing demands.

We know that States that have not been extravagant are in a serious financial position. I have faith in the common sense of the people, and even in the wisdom of this Parliament. If the bill should be agreed to. in this House, by a majority of four or five, the position of the Government would be almost as humiliating as if the measure were defeated. Fortunately for the country, it must run the gauntlet of the other branch of the legislature, where 1 wish it good luck. the House dealt with the Estimates last two election campaigns, my session I clearly defined my attitude towards this measure, and I do not prospoke for almost an hour pose to repeat what I said on that occasion.

110,Mr Bell,"I understood that that was be a matter for Parliament to decide.capita payments. I differ, however, from the Government as to the advisability of withdrawing them now. In view of the unanimous opposition of tbe various State Governments to the abolition of the present system, it is not right to abolish it. ments to the States was decided upon in 1909, it was not regarded as ideal; it was the one to which the least opposition was offered at the time. Prior to the Great War the Federal Goveniment had imposed very little direct taxation; but the heavy war burden made such, taxation necessary. If the per capita payments had ceased then that action would at least have beeu logical; but, unfortunately, expediency, not logic, is frequently the motive guiding political action. The Prime Minister argued that it was wrong that those States which had become wealthy by reason of our fiscal policy, should, because that policy had also increased increased payments by meaiis of the per capita grant. We must not lose sight of the fact that those States whose wealth and population have increased, have a greater taxable asset than bave the smaller aud the undeveloped States. If the Commonwealth vacate the field of direct taxation, the position of the more populous States would be better than that of the States whose population is small. The rate of increase in the wealth of the States has exceeded that of their increase in population. have increased with the growth of their population. greater responsibility rests upon the undeveloped States. To many people it seeing absurd that revenue collected by the Commonwealth by means of direct taxation should be returned to the States as surplus Customs revenue. present system, we should enlarge it. The system of paying to the States, on the basis of population, a proportion of the revenue collected either from Customs, or direct taxation, or both, tends to adjust inequalities between the States. The framers of the Constitution appear to proposals all the States would become richer or poorer, according to whether their population increased or decreased. The several States are so different in respect of their area, climate, and resources, that it is obvious that they cannot all have the When the per capita basis of paysame power to contribute towards the expenses of a central Parliament. The revenue necessary for the needs of the Commonwealth is contributed by the States; yet the Commonwealth has become a dictator, with power to direct the finances of the States. To take over the debts of the States would be a great step towards unification. If that were done, the States could no longer be permitted to borrow indiscriminately. Commonwealth taking over their debts, the States should not be allowed to borrow indiscriminately. We are doing our best to prevent it. their population, receive tice the system by which revenue is collected by the Commonwealth by means of direct taxation, and returned to the States on the per capita basis, effects many adjustments. One State may be affected by a drought, and thus be less able to contribute towards the expenses of government than another State which, being free from such a visitation, has benefited from that drought and become possessed of greater wealth. Having a greater taxable asset, that State contributes a greater sum to the Commonwealth than its drought-stricken neighbour; but, as the grants from the responsibilities Commonwealth to the States are made on the per capita basis, and not on the basis of the contributions by the States The to the Commonwealth, the present system, as a means of effecting adjustments between the Commonwealth and the States, is better than that proposed by the Commonwealth. In the interests of the smaller States, the present system should be continued. The contributions by the States Instead of abolishing the towards the expenses of the Commonwealth should be based on their power to fulfil their obligations. The best financial brains of the country have endeavoured to find a correct basis for the adjustment of Commonwealth and State finances, but, so far, without success. It is, therefore, not have based their financial likely that honourable members in this on the assumption that chamber will be more successful. In",35,Revenue Per Hea D From Taxation

114,Mr Bell,"And rightly so. In pracview of the opposition of the States to its proposals, the Government should no longer persist in them. The federation can be successful only so long as there is harmony between its constituent parts. The Government's proposal to abolish the -per capita payments will do more to disrupt the federation than anything that has been attempted since its inauguration. Notwithstanding its power to do so, the Commonwealth is not justified in asserting that power in the face of the opposition of the people. Whether the principle underlying the Government's proposals be good or bad, the Government has no right to fly in the face of the people. In pressing this question, the Government is making a great mistake. 1 regret that it did not heed the advice Government's scheme, but I can see of some of its supporters when this measure was first proposed. To-day, among many erstwhile Government supporters, there is opposition to the bill. Had they made their attitude clear at an earlier stage, 1 feel confident that the Government would not have proceeded with the measure. When the Estimates were under discussion last year, I availed myself of the first opportunity, as a member of this House, to protest against any withdrawal of the per capita payments. My views have not changed since then. I shall, therefore, be consistent and vote against the bill. have followed the debate on this bill very closely, and have listened with considerable interest to the views expressed by honourable members. Generally, the debate has reached a high standard, although, at times, the party note, which seems to be inseparable from discussions in this chamber, has been too much in evidence. Nevertheless, the debate has been one of the most stirring that we have had in this chamber for some time. people are vitally interested. two honourable members have asserted that the general public knows very little about this subject. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron) remarked that he had only the other day met an eminent legal gentleman in Melbourne who asked him the meaning of the ver capita proposal. I could take the honourable member into outback areas of my constituency and introduce him to some of my constituents who could not only quickly explain the matter to him, but who would express strong views on the manner in which the Government is forcing a decision on it . During my speech in the budget debate last year I observed that there was doubt as to the wisdom of this proposal, and that, in view of the promise of the Prime Minister that a constitutional session would be held within a few months for the purpose of revising the Constitution, I thought it would be wise to postpone further consideration of it until then. I have listened with an open mind to the debate on the merits of the no . reason for changing my view. In fact, I am more than ever convinced that it would be wise to postpone the matter. I listened intently to the speech that the Prime Minister delivered a few days ago, very little of which is remembered by honourable members, for the reason that very little of it was worth remembering. The attitude of the right honourable gentleman suggested to me, though I may be mistaken in this, that he was not as comfortable as he generally is when he is speaking in the House. His heart was not in his job. I listened also to the excellent speech of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), and to the illuminating remarks that the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster). made this afternoon. Whatever we may think of that honourable gentleman's view on this or any other subject we know that he is never guilty of insincerity. I feel bound to observe that throughout the debate, right down to the quiet but well-reasoned speech that the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) has just delivered, it has been plainly evident that if a vote of honourable members could be talken upon the merits of this bill it would be defeated by an overwhelming majority. this be treated on party lines? treated, but, unfortunately, it has been made a party questiou. bers on this side of the chamber.",36,Revenue Per Hea D From Taxation

As a rule, I enjoy listening to the Attorney-General, for he never abuses anybody. misrepresenting them. Mi-. STEWART -Unfortunatel y the honourable gentleman is severely handicapped by his inability to divest himself of his legal habits. His address last evening was quite characteristic of him. When I speak in debates in this House, I provide myself with a few notes, and with their help express my views as well as I am able; but the Attorney-General rarely fails to arm himself with huge legal volumes, and seems always to have at his fingertips some judicial decision or other-it may be one that was delivered in the time of Queen Anne, or it may be one delivered from our High Court bench the day before yesterdaywith which to rebut the arguments of his opponents. With legal books to the right of him, legal books to the left of him, and the Australian Constitution in front of him, the honourable gentleman proceeds to battle. In one sentence he directs a heavy blow at one section or another of the Constitution. He immediately follows that up with a decision by one or more learned judges, and so bewilders the issue what is intended to be a blow on the solar plexus, with a reference to a legal decision given in the middle of last century, and the whole assault is complete. The honourable gentleman evidently recognized last evening that he had a most difficult duty to perform, and he proceeded with great care and deliberation to set up an Aunt Sally, and then to knock it down. He occupied about ten minutes of his speech in arguing that Parliament had power to pass this bill, and it may be said that he proved that part of his case up to the hilt. But, unfortunately, for him, not one speaker in this debate, has argued to the contrary. The honourable gentleman expended his time and energy in proving the obvious. Doubtless he was making the best of a bad situation. Nobody questions the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to pass this measure; but I would say, in the oft-quoted words of ShakespeareOh, it is excellent To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant. Eveni f the Government could prove that it was desirable and necessary to pass this bill, it would be unwise, in the circumstances, for us to do so. But the Government has proved nothing of the sort. It has made assertions, but has not supported them in any way. We have been told that the existing system is wrongthat it is a pernicious principle for one Government to collect money, and for another Government to spend it .

If he did not make that admission I do so now. nicious principle is also being adopted, as provision is made for the payment of grants to Tasmania and Western Australia. The Commonwealth is to collect hundreds of thousands of pounds from the taxpayers and hand it over to Western Australia and Tasmania. As the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) said, those States are entitled to some consideration; but the money is to be paid over without any conditions being laid down as to how it shall be spent. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) instanced the case of money paid to the States under the PederalA i d Boads Act, and whilst I do not desire to unnecessarily repeat points already made by other honourable members, I think it should be emphasized that that point has never been effectively answered by the Government. Under the PederalA i d Eoads Act, the Government, in collaboration with the States, lay down certain conditions concerning how the money advanced under that act is to be spent. that the money was spent under a mutual arrangement with the States. Can any one say that an agreement made in the circumstances, so fresh in the minds of honourable members, is a mutual one?

In the case of New South Wales, mentioned by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), such an arrangement has not yet been entered into. The Commonwealth Government is collecting a petrol tax which New South Wales consumers have to pay, but the Government of New South Wales is in the unenviable position of having the money thus extorted from its taxpayers now lying idle.

137,The Case Of New Dr. Earle Page,"No, for sixteen16 years matters not. The point is that this Government made the discovery that escaped the attention of every previous government-that a pernicious principle underlies this payment. When the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page) embarks upon the formidable task of replying to the facts that have been established during the course of the debate, I ask that he produce evidence of the manner in which it has proved to be pernicious, and to mention what States have been debauched by the receipt of these sums. It has also been stated repeatedly that the States have no constitutional, legal, or moral right to this payment. If that be so, one is bound to ask upon what basis the payment has been made and continued? If no constitutional, legal, or moral right exists, why has it been considered necessary to introduce this measure? Accepting the contention of the Government, the payment has been made unconstitutionally, illegally and i m morally during the last six years, at least. Honourable members have listened to interesting speeches by the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( Mr Hughes) and the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) . Both of the present system is unjust and unfair. It those right honourable gentlemen have a lonar record in the public l if e of this country, and grappled with these problems before either the Treasurer or the Prime Minister passed the portals of this chamber. with this problem-the y shirked it . deavour to show some justification for their own inconsistency, the Government have descended to the levelling of that charge at others. They say that the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney and the right honourable member for Balaclava have been inconsistent in that, having suggested an alteration in the system., they now oppose that which is proposed. Their action does not prove anything of the kind. We are not solely cerned with the merits or the demerits of the per capita payments. H a d the Government met the Premiers of the Statesi n conference, and made with them an arrangement for the substitution of some other system, I should offer no objection to the alteration. My chief objection to this proposal is that the per capita payments are to be discontinued despite the united opposition of every State in the Commonwealth, and, against the wish if thf) party whips were taken off-of a majority of honourable members of this House. If the Government hold the belief that they are not acting contrary to the wishes of the people, let them test the matter by submitting it to a referendum. But no appeal is to be made to the people, because the answer would be disastrous to the Government. The Prime Minister deplored the feeling of hostility that has been growing up between the States and the Commonwealth. I know of no honourable gentleman who has occupied the position of Prime Ministeri n this country who, either wittingly or unwittingly, has done more than the right honourable gentleman to engender that hostility. I have before me one of the weekly statements that are issued by the Eederal Country party, and are circulated extensively in my electorate. It reads. The Bruce-Page Government is the first Government to recognize this position. . . . The vital principle on which it stands is that has asked the States to meet it in conference to discuss alternate proposals, but the Stites have vigorously refused to attend any such conference, and have, consequently, left th* Commonwealth Govermnent in the position that the only proposal it can bring forward is one which requires nothing other than Commonwealth legislation to carry it into effect. . . . The main opposition to the present proposal is that tlie conference should be held first and the bill for the abolition of the per In a desperate encapita payments carried afterwards. The answer to this is that the one point upon which the Bruce-Page Government is satisfied is that the present system is wrong. That system, in any case, must cease. The only point, therefore, to consider is, what is to be substituted for it? I ask honourable members to note particularly the phraseology in the latter portion. Apparently, the view of the Government is that the present system must cease, whether it be right or wrong. ing to Fullarton? gospel, whatever it is based upon.

In that speech the right honourable gentleman undoubtedly suggested that it was the opinion of the Government that an alteration should be made in the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States; but he did not give the slightestindication of the determination of the Government to abolish the per capita payments either with or without the consent of the States. The right honourable member for North Sydney was correct when he said that this matter was overshadowed at the elections by another and a greater issue. Throughout the country fcinphasis was laid upon the one issue of constitutional government versus mob rule. Compared with that great issue, everything else was but leather ancl prunella. The claim of the Government that they received a mandate to deal with this matter raises an important that the States will gain by the adoption question. If a government deliberately of the proposal. If they do, then the concentrates on one issue, and keeps Commonwealth will lose to the extent others in the background, what is the that the States may gain. But thnro is extent of the mandate that it receives? a marked difference of opinion on tliis The right honourable member for North aspect of the proposal, for, whilst it is Sydney asked whether any honourable stated that the Commonwealth will give member had, during the election camup a considerable portion of its revenue, paign, been questioned regarding the per the States, for their part, state that they capita payment. Not a question on that also will lose. On this point, the Premier matter was put to me. I submit that if of Victoria( Mr Allan), in his policy the Government have been given any speech, delivered at Kyabram on the 7th mandate it is that they should not alter inst., saidthe existing financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. The with its iproposal to abolish the per capita honourable member for Fawkner( Mr payments, the finances of the State will be 'in Maxwell), who is a prominent member payments of the National party, last evening £2,144,000. There would be great difficulty in quoted the following plank from the making up this amount in direct taxation. It platform of that party:The maintenance of the 25s. per head payments to tlie States until such time as a satisThe Treasurer of Victoria( Sir Alexander factory alteration is agreed upon. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr well versed in the history of the per Maxwell) says that he considers himself bound by that plank. All I can say is that if he is bound by it, so also are the honourable member for Corio( Mr which the Federal Government proposes to Lister), the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Hurry), the honorThe able member for Kooyong( Mr Latham), and the right honourable the Prime Minister himself. Can one party in the Commonwealth sphere to-day say that it has a definite mandate to do what this Government is proposing to do? If so, let them produce the evidence. It is true that there was reference in the policy speech to the desirability of an alteration of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States; but that, I submit, is a different proposition entirely from that contained iu the bill now before the House. It has also .been stated that the measure is urgent. Up to the present, sound reasons for its urgaicy have not bean given. What has happened during the last two or three years to make it necessary for the Government to hold up public business in this way in order to rush the measure through ? Labour Governments in power!

The Commonwealth Government, rightly or wrongly, wisely or unwisely, pursues a policy of high protection, which vitally affects the finances of the States. Undoubtedly, high protection adds to the cost of State services, and makes it increasingly difficult for State Governments to finance their public works schemes, and pay the salaries of their public servants. In short, whilst high protection depletes State revenues, it fills to overflowing the coffers of the Commonwealth Treasury. declares that it will end all tliat when it gets into power. in what way the Labour party could out-Herod the political Herocls in the Ministerial corner. One reason why the primary producers are so much opposed to 'the high-tariff policy of this Government is that, whilst its effect is to increase the cost of primary, production, it does not adequately protect Australian industries. for Wakefield did not take that view. the honourable member for Wakefield said. I am stating my own view, ancl I care not wketlnr it squares with the views of the honourable member for Wakefield or not. Tho fact that huge sums of money are being received through the Customs shows conclusively that the tariff policy of the Government is not effectively protecting Australian industries. If it were, the Customs receipts would not be at their present high level. In the circumstances, it is pertinent tc ask what is the motive underlying the tariff. Has it been framed for the production of revenue, or for the building up of Australiau industries? Up to the present we have not been sufficiently informed on this point. The Treasurer won his way to place and power in the Commonwealth sphere by his advocacy of a policy of moderate protection; but, unfortunately, since his accession to office there has been no modification of the Government tariff policy. On the contrary, we have had increase after increase in Customs duties. At one time he chided his present chief, ancl informed him quite bluntly that he should go into sackcloth and ashes because the Customs and excise revenue, at that time, had reached the huge total of between £22,000,000 ancl £23,000,000. To-day the revenue from the same sources amounts to between £42,000,000 and £43,000,000. and yet the Treasurer smiles as if all is well with the country. is being received on a much higher tariff. the Government's tariff policy, I repeat, is to increase the cost of State services, whilst at the same time it is filling the Commonwealth treasury to overflowing. Nearly every State Government to-day is faced with a deficit. Last year Victoria endeavoured to square the ledger. Tn view of the Treasurer's declaration that the State Governments can automatically occupy the fields of taxation vacated by the Commonwealth, it is interesting Lo remember that when the Victorian Government endeavoured to square the ledger by increased taxation, the proposal was rejected by the Legislative Council. Honourable gentlemen who are supporting this bill apparently overlook the fact that it is easy enough for one government to relinquish taxation, but that it is extremely difficult for six governments to reimpose it, particularly in the circumstances in which the present State Governments find themselves. I have no doubt that the statement made by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), and repeated by other honourable members during the debate, that the State Governments will not be able to aggregate income taxation is absolutely correct. to aggregate land taxation either.",41,Revenue Per Hea D From Taxation

166,Mr Stewart,"In those days, inlimbo of tbe past. It has now but one advocate in this chamber, and that is the honourable member who was good enough to remind me of this point. I believe that the honourable member for New England is still sincere in his new State views, and still hopes that something will come of the policy. eggmember for New England has been good enough to ask me, in the cross examination I am undergoing from his corner, if I did not assist him to have the new States question listed for consideration at the proposed constitutional session. I did, and for the strongest of reasons, and the honourable member has again reminded me of something which, but for his interruption, I might have forgotten. The fact that a constitutional session of this Parliament has been promised is one of the strongest reasons why this bill, instead of being bludgeoned through, should be referred for consideration to that constitutional session. I protest with all the emphasis at my command against the action of the Government in attempting to force this measure through the House. It has declared that it is urgent, but has given no evidence of its urgency. It has declared that the per capita system is pernicious, \ nicious effects arising from it. The bill is being persisted with, in spite of the fact that the State governments and the people are against it. I go so far as to say that, if the measure were left to the unfettered vote of members of this House, it would be found that the majority of them are against it. It is possible that in another place the vote on this issue may be against that recorded here. of another place arc going to be put to a crucial test on this very important issue. I hope that they will show just whether they _ are prepared to carry out the functions for which that chamber was established. honourable member not to continue in that strain. a word or two concerning the action of honourable members on this side who have taken a stand against this measure. There are members of the Nationalist party who have refused to view this proposal through party glasses. They are prepared by their voices and by their votes to defeat this proposal, and that is somethine which, in my opinion, redounds very much to their credit. It will be a bad day for this country when, in the settlement of issues which mean so much to the people, and so little to party, members will be found ready to carry out the desires of a political party against what they honestly believe to be the wishes of the people of Australia. The first ground upon which I offer my onnosition to the nroposal contained in the measure before the House is that it is a distinct violation of a principle definitely set out in the articles of faith of the Nationalist party. The rule broken by this measure has been quoted before, but I shall quote it again to give it a little more emphasis. This is the article of faith of the organization responsible for the return of the Nationalist members of the present Government to which I referThe maintenance of the per capita payment of 25s. to the States until such time as a satisfactory alternative is agreed to. The Government cannot plead ignorance of that article, because' they have aphut has been unable to refer to any perpointed a representative to the organization for the purpose of keeping it in touch with the political side. A representative of this chamber is also a member of the executive of the organization, and was appointed for a definite purpose, and at the invitation of the organization, as a kind of liaison officer between the organization and the government in power. The Government was returned upon that definite article of faith which I have I point out that members quoted, and this bill is a distinct violation of it. Every honourable member must be aware that it is. The man who will not stand by that article of faith has no right to profess to be a Nationalist. My second objection to the bill is that the Government has sought no mandate to depart from that article of faith, nor should it, because the Prime Minister himself, in unambiguous terms, set out a policy whicli was perfectly in line with that of the Nationalist organization. .",43,Green I S The Honourable Remedy For Economic Ills But The New

It is a remarkable coincidence that Mr 87 of the Constitution is a dead letter. Lawson, the leader of the Nationalist Federation in this State, and a former Premier of the State, is to-night, in another part of this city, pleading for the maintenance of the per capita payments. There is a definite conflict between the two leaders, one the official head of the political organization, and the other the official head of the present Government. My this measure at this juncture is that it does not give a square deal to the States. As has been well enunciated during the course of this debate it is a fundamental principle of government in Australia that unless the Commonwealth and the States co-operate in rendering services to the people there can be no true national development. vernment that seeks to disorganize the finances of the States that it is dependent on the goodwill, co-operation, and machinery of the States for carrying out four of the star items in its programme. These are:-An immigration policy estimated to cost £34,000,000; a main-roads scheme, for which £20,000,000 is to be provided; a housing scheme, which will cost £20,000,000; and a scheme for the distribution of wire netting at a cost of £3,000,000. Altogether these and other items involve an expenditure of £92,000,000. It is a policy of financial munificence, yet we are told by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Australian or British goods. There is Ley) that the Commonwealth has no money-that it has nothing it can divide with the States. have misrepresented the honourable member; but the burden of his speech was that the Commonwealth had no money to divide with the States. excess of Customs and excise revenue for division with the States.

Yet the honourable member for Barton tries to make us beI remind a golieve that the Commonwealth is impoverished. As a matter of fact, it has a buoyant revenue quite beyond the imagination of the framers of the Constitution. We have to-day a Customs revenue of about £42,000,000. It is really a reflex of the extravagance and bad administration of the Commonwealth. We have what ought to be a real protective policy, but that policy is steadily undermined when we have the States and Commonwealth going abroad to borrow money. The latest fetish is to borrow money in America, which means that we merely establish a credit in America with which to buy American goods as against no other way in which we can get the money from America. It is, I repeat, an unsound policy, which is undermining the whole economic fabric of the nation. naturally. It may simply mean the transfer of dollars to London. when we borrow in America we are not bringing specie to Australia, and it is I said that there was no not sound finance to borrow in America for the purpose of settling trade balances between America and England.",44,Green I S The Honourable Remedy For Economic Ills But The New

We must bring out the equivalent of the money in goods, settle balances in England, or bring specie to Australiawhich we are not likely to do. It is a positively unsound policy which places Australia's revenue on a fictitious basis, because what we levy at the Customs House is practically a subtraction from the amount we borrow. To that extent, therefore, we do not get the full effect of and thinkers outside this chamber the borrowed money. When we make a levy on the goods we buy with borrowed money, it is simply a case of setting aside portion of the borrowed money, putting it in the national pocket, and calling it revenue-a n unsound policy from every economic aspect. A young country seeking development has a right to borrow when mouey is cheap and when long terms can be obtained; but recently Australia has obtained loans abroad to such an extent that I am afraid it has deprived itself of one of the opportunities that borrowing abroad offers. The power to raise such loans, apart from national development, should be one of those national reserves on which a nation may rely in time of stress to avoid unemployment, or to tide it over a difficult crisis. Its credit should be kept as a national reserve for such occasions, but if Australia continues at its present rate of borrowing it will exhaust its credit. Supplies will be cut off by our creditors overseas. However, I do not desire to press the matter further than to Bay that it is not right at this late day to claim that we are relying solely upon our Customs revenue for the payment of the per capita grant. It has been the definitely settled policy of the Commonwealth for 27 years to assist the States in carrying out their functions. The responsibility for disturbing that arrangement rests upon the present Government. I do not say that the time has not arrived for a reconsideration of the arrangement, but it is quite unBritish to call people into a conference about a matter when they are gagged before they come there. Eor the Commonwealth to predetermine all the vit.il matters upon which it would confer with the States, and practically deprive them of their financial independence before discussing their position with them, so undermining their position as to cause them to come to a conference as mendicants or suppliants, is certainly not the way in which the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States should be readjusted. I am sorry that it falls to the Nationalist party to have on its head the odium of being associated with this proposal. Organizations are all anxious to give the States a fair and square deal, because they recognize that the States are our co-partners in rendering services to the people of Australia. It has been said before, but I . want to repeat it, that the States render more direct services to the people than does the Commonwealth. The fields in which they do so have already been mentioned by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), but they will stand repeating. Health, housing, land settlement, transport, water supply, charities, the care of the sick, hospitals, and education are all matters, controlled by the States, that enter into the daily life of the citizen. Reduced assistance to the States means impoverished services from the States. We know that the Commonwealth is calling the States into co-operation to render more services to the people, which will increase the cost of State administration. Although the provision of money for the construction of roads is very important, the subsequent maintenance of those roads is a permanent cost that will fall on the States. It will be hard for them to find the necessary money. Then there is the question of the relationship of bodies subsidiary to the States. The maintenance of roads is undertaken by the States through local",45,Green I S The Honourable Remedy For Economic Ills But The New

The service thus rendered is given gratuitously by a very fine body of men in the various country districts of Australia whose own contributions to the cost of the maintenance of roads are subsidized by the States. If the lutter are compelled to withdraw those subsidies, the work of these local bodies must become less valuable. I can clearly understand the feeling of the States in this inatter. The faot that there has been at one, two, or even three conferences a failure to arrive at an agreement as to what is a fair contribution by the Commonwealth should not be taken as meaning that failure will follow further attempts. There are changes of government. New Ministers have different viewpoints. I still think that, in the light of the valuable discussion we have hud in this Chamber on this bill, the States and the Commonwealth will find a more reasonable basis of negotiation.

This Parliament is going to the new capital, but as the result the Commonwealth. of this bill-on e of its final acts in this State after 26 years of federation, will leave behind it a very regrettable odium. time to take such a drastic step as this. The Commonwealth is financially affluent, but nearly all the States greater and more difficult responsibilities, have deficits. obliged to have the per capita payment supplemented by a special grant to enable them to cope with what they call their State disabilities. We have ample evidence that the revenues of the States will not go round. The cost of management of all State departments has incre .r d. Yet this is the time selected by the Commonwealth to withdraw the king pin of the States' finances. The per capita | payment is the one item in their revenue upon which they know they can rely as an ever-increasing item. Around it are built others that go to make up the Consolidated Revenue of each State. Its withdrawal will leave the States in a position of insecurity. After all they have as much right to their essential and over-endow the unessential. share of the revenue as we have, if we are to ask them to carry on the services which they now render to the people of Australia. Thp Customs revenue is the easy money of the nation. Direct taxation is unpopular. It is impossible for Government activities in these days-rail ways and such liketo show a surplus. Nearly all the Australian railways show deficits. member suggest that the Commonwealth should make up the deficits on State railways ? ing that the State railways are showing deficits. They have been showing them for the last 26 years, and the honourable member will not contend that the per capita payments during those years have been paid to the States to enable them to make up for the losses on their railways.

The Commonwealth has been entrusted with the easy work of the nation, and the average taxpayer feels that in his everyday affairs he receives from the States a more direct and adequate return for the taxation he pays. The Commonwealth deals with foreign affairs, which do not directly affect industry, and with defence, which does not give positive and tangible results to the individual citizen. The same remark applies to most of the other federal functions. But nearly every one of the State activities is essential to the daily well-being of the taxpayers and the conduct of industry, and it would be false economy, and bad policy to weaken the The time is ripe for a full reconsideration of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States.

There are other items that might very well be adjusted in a general scheme of financial revision. This measure is ill-advised, aud the procedure adopted by the Government is wrong. The proposal is opposed to the wishes of the people. There is no demand for it, and nearly all the organized bodies of the nation regard it as an unwise step to take at the present time. However, all that can be done by those of us who are opposed to the bill is to take our stand upon the declared principles of our party, and I warn the Government that victory gained under such conditions as these may prove a pyrrhic victory, ultimately doing more damage than good to the Ministerial party. I think the Treasurer is over keen on this proposal, and is persisting with it against the better judgment of the nation. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was right in saying that the fight will not end with the discontinuance of the per capita payments. The Government may gain a victory in the first action, but the campaign will continue, and eventually the nation will either restore to the States the per capita payments or make other reimbursements sufficient to enable them to carry on their functions. debate has now lasted for two weeks, and applying the remark of an old Scottish laird, after the signing of the covenant which marked the termination of the border wars between England and Scotland, I hope that "" this is the end of an auld sang.""

As a rule, one finds that Government supporters vote for the Government, and the Opposition members against the Government, and a clear line of demarcation between the parties is assured. Honourable members opposite have played their traditional role, but, as a novice in politics, I have been astounded to see some honourable members on this side accepting the assistance of members of the Opposition to score points against a Government measure. I have noticed Opposition members bringing to honourable members on this side marked copies of Hansard, and other documents, as ammunition to be used against the Government, and, in the lobbies, where one always sees interesting things, are to be found so-called Government supporters whispering and colloguing in corners with members of the Opposition.

His political experieuce, who constitute what his debating powers, and logical reasonapparently regarded as the ing make him a valuable acquisition to this House. But when he condemns bludgeoning he is like Satan reproving sin, because the records of the Queensland Parliament during recent years reveal a good deal of bludgeoning, of which the honourable member is not entirely guiltI t looks suspiciously less. I am also amazed to bludgeoning in this Parliament. that the Government has not resorted to bludgeoning.

The honourable member for Dalley spoke of a mandate. There are 52 Government supporters in this House-o r there were-and surely that is a mandate as against the majority with which the honourable member for Dalley, when Premier of Queensland, and Mr Lang, the Premier of New Soutn Wales, carried on. The principle of the per capita payment has always been a vexed question. First of all the Braddon section of the Constitution operated until 1910, and from then onwards the principle of the per capita payment was a subject of controversy. Both the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr consistency in its views. In this way, Watt), and thp right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), as Treasurer and Prime Minister respectively of this country, have opposed the per capita payments, yet, on this occasion, they have spoken bitterly against the Government's proposal. for North Sydney has never opposed the per capita principle. able member to read extracts from a speech of the late Prime Minister at a Premier's Conference held some time ago, as quoted by the Attorney-General( Mr whicli the same position would arise? Latham) last night. I wish now to deal with the proposal that the right honourable member for Balaclava put forward when Acting Prime Minister. Let me give one illustration in the homely language to which 1 am accustomed. A man has a property, which is managed by trustees, and the annual revenue from it is £1,000. The trusteesI am speaking now of the present Government-sa y to that man, "" Why should we manage this property for you ? We consider that you should manage it yourself and collect the income of £1,000."" That is, in a nutshell, what the Government proposes to do. What the right honourable member for Balaclava proposed to do was this: He said, "" You go back to your property, and year by year we will take a paddock from you, until we resume the whole of the property, leaving you nothing at all."" members. As an owner of land, I prefer the proposal that the Government has put to the States to that of the right honourable member for Balaclava. Again we find that at the Preposal, little different from the present, one, was nearly accepted. The honourable member for Dalley, as Premier of' Queensland, was certainly inclined to accept it. The honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) has already quoted extracts from the speech of the honourable member for Dalley on that occasion. It is interesting to compare the attitude of the daily press at that time with the attitude of the Melbourne evening newspaper to-day. The Minister for Markets aud Migration ( Mr Paterson) last night quoted certain paragraphs from that newspaper, and showed clearly that there was little newspapers undoubtedly do a great deal of harm. . At the last Premiers' Conference I sat in this chamber and listened to the discussion. As the right honourable member for Balaclava has said, the State Premiers acted like sulky children and would do nothing at all except lay claim to the per capita payments as their moral right. 1 think that it is apparent to all that the States have neither a moral, constitutional, nor lesjal right to the per capita paynients. As the question has already been discussed in conference, what is the use .of holding another conference at There is not the slightest benefit to be derived from such a conference. By ""assing the measure we shall form a basis for negotiation. That may be said to be unfair, but I can only quote what many honourable members said during the last Federal election"" Trust the Prime Minister."" That cry was used by every supporter of the Government at that time. Has the Prime Minister so changed that this trust should be withdrawn from him? His recent work abroad should have intensified the trust that we repose in him and in his Government. This proposal means nothing to the taxoayer. The change-over will not make the slightest difference to him. That must be apparent to most honourable The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) spoke of the land tax.

As an owner of land, I contend that a land tax is better imposed by the States than by the Commonwealth, because there are different conditions and Honourable indignation of the States and their opposition to the proposal. We have been told that a great revulsion of feeling against the Commonwealth Government caused the defeat of the last referendum. Speakingf o r New South Wales, I say with pride that that State carried the referendum. If some honourable members had put as much vim into the referendum campaign as they display in opposing this measure, the result of the referendum might easily have been different. During that campaign I spoke at several meetings in my electorate, and referred to the withdrawal of the per cavita payments. found no opposition whatever to the proposal. I think that that was the experience of most of the representatives of New South Walesi n this chamber who spoke on the subject at that time. street is not interested in the subject. not studied it at all. Apartf r o m the oppositicn of the State Parliaments and the indignation which seems rampant in the city of Melbourne, there is little objection tc the Government's proposal. I support the Government, because I have the utmost f a i th in it . The development of this country lies in the hands of the Commonwealth Government. State Governments have, to a great extent, ceased developing their own areas. They appear to be concentrating more on enlarging the loan moneys for this purpose. Parliaments wrangling institutions, devoted to the preparation of e-jpensive baits for the electors. The States are, to a great extent, to blame for their parlous financial position. During the last two or three years they have indulged in an orgy of extravagance, with no thought for the future of the unfortunate taxpayers. An act which was recently passed by the New South Wales Government w ill cause much sorrow and tribulation to the man on the land. Por that reason everything should be done to curb the power of that Government, and to place its finances on a proper footing. The right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) and other honourable members, have referred to the chaos that w ill result to the States circumstances in every State. if theper capita payments are withmembers talk of the drawn from them. I would point out that the Government's proposal only means that the States will raise their own revenue, and w ill cease to obtain remittances from the Commonwealth. The per capita payment to New South Wales is approximately £3,000,000, and the yearly Consolidated Revenue of New South Wales is £39,000,000. What difference can £3,000,000 make to the finances of t r t State, when it has the same field to raise the money in as the Commonwealth now raises it in for the State? Yet honourable members say that chaos w ill be created by I this change. Chaos has been created there long ago, and this change w ill not add to it . The dreadful scares created by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) in the would be much better if used in broadcasting bedtime stories for little children, T h a t is so. He has instead of for the purpose of frightening grown-up men in this House. I support this measure to the fullest possible extent, and I deplore the attacks that have been made on the Government by its supporters. Having listened to this debate for some time, and having heard nothing but a farrago of abuse of the Government by its erstwhile supporters, I The went to the newspaper room to seek a little solace and turned up the speeches made by some honourable members before the last general election. They were capital cities, utilizing very different -from the speeches heard State in this debate. Theni t was "" Trust the are largely political Prime Minister,"" "" Bruce won't let you down,"" and "" Stick to this Government, which has stuck to you.""

My reason for doing so is that when one views the financial arrangement that has existed since the inception of federation with, it is true, one change, one realizes that it has broken down. The States find it impossible to finance themselves, and are at their wits' end to carry on from one year to another. therefore, this is the time when a new arrangement should be entered into. The Government has been accused of acting hastily, of trying to bludgeon the States into the acceptance of its proposals; but any one who is conversant with the political affairs of this country for the last four or five years, knows that that is a misstatement. It has been pointed out that in 1922 the Prime Minister, when speaking in Brisbane, said that the per capita payments must continue u n t i l there had been a fundamental change in the government of this country. I admit that no great fundamental change in the government of this country has taken place, but financial aud economic conditions have changed owing to the introduction of the 44-hour week. That has made the machiuery of the State Governments almost unworkable. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore), when the industrial branch of the movement to which he belongs brought this subject un for discussion at a Labour conference, opposed the proposal as only he could. On that occasion he was supported by his colleague, the present Premier of Queensland, and his opposition, in fact, almost lost h i m the leadership of the party. ber has misunderstood the situation. I did not oppose the proposal for the 44hour week, but supported it at the convention. I gained from reading what may be called the oflicial organ of the Queensland Labour j>arty, the Brisbane Daily Standard, was to the effect that the honourable member, who was then the Premier of Queensland, opposed the introduction of the 44-hour week, and pointed out. that it would be impossible for him, as the head of the Government, to carry on if it were introduced. ber is wrong. I explained to the unions the reason why we did not proceed with I support the b i ll wholethe reform in 1923, but at the convention that year I supported it , and it was carried unanimously. the honourable member an injustice, but I think I am correct in saying that he at first opposed the proposal to the utmost, and that it was only when he found the Surely, numbers were against him that he agreed to it . A t any rate, the introduction of the 44-hour week has added to the burdens of the governments of this country, which now find themselves in a very serious position. The Commonwealth Government asked the State Governments to meet them at a round-table conference to discuss the question, and every opportunity was given to them to put forward a scheme that would be acceptable to both parties. Unfortunately, it was found impossible to come to an agreement, and a deadlock ensued. The Pederal Government either had to allow things to remain as they were, or endeavour to force the States to accept a change that would be to their advantage. The bill will put. an end to the per capita paynients and the States will then have an opportunity of meeting the Federal Government in conference. When that conference is held, the honourable member for Dalley knows that the State of Queensland and every other State w ill receive a f a i r deal from this Government. It has been said by some honourable members that the attitude of the Government to the States has been intolerable, and has been characterized by a lack of courtesy. No statement could be farther from the truth . As a matter of fact, no other Government in the Federal sphere has done as much for the States. It has come to the assistance of the States to the tune of £5,000,000, which it has written off the land settlement scheme for soldiers.

The honourable member for Gwydir mentioned especially the lett). It is true that the honourable member for Henty fired the first shot, but other honourable members who have opposed the bill have expressed agreement with him. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) in his concluding remarks, said he felt positive that if honourable members were free to give an unfettered vote, the bill would not pass; and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), the right honourable member Hughes), and the honourable member repeated that opinion. Those honourable members know f u l l well that there is not a scintilla of truth in the suggestion. The honourable member for Fawkner need only cast his mind back to an occasion during the regime of a previous Government. The phrase "" reasonable justice "" was used in a bill. On the ground that justice cannot be qualified, the honorable member for Fawkner moved in committee the omission of the word "" reasonable."" The North Sydney, who was then Prime Minister, called out the army, had the Riot Act read, brought out the party, and lined up the six or seven men who dared to support the amendment for the omission of that word. yesterday we heard the right honourable member speak of the party whips being cracked. need to be told that there is no such thing as a party whip on this side of the House. Never was there such liberty of action as we on this side now enjoy. The members who have made those insinuations know that they are untrue; but the people outside believe them when they see them printed in the newspapers. When a man of the reputation of the honourable member for Henty, and of the other honourable members. I have mentioned, make such statements, the public believes that there must be some truth in them. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that politics make us acquainted with strange bed-fellows. He was referring to the fact that the right common with the honourable honourable the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who were at one time members of different parties, are now working together in harmony. But what about the bed-fellows of the right honourable member for North Sydney? On his left sits the right honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) , and on his right the honourable member for Wimmera; and those honourable members who are conversant with the inner history of this House during the last eight or nine years know what that means. Itmeans that the right honourable member for North Sydney would make friends with the ex-Kaiser, whom he formerly threatened to hang, if by so doing he for North Sydney( Mr could bring about the political undoing of the Prime Minister. The Prime for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), Minister has been guilty of one sin, and one only, in his eyes-h e has been a success in the office that was uot of his own seeking, but was thrust upon him. order. The honourable member for Oxley has said that for political gain the right honourable member for North Sydney would associate in a friendly way with the ex-Kaiser.

It has been stated that the people are opposed to the withdrawal of the per capita payment. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Abbott), in reply, declared that the people of New South Wales were behind the Government in its proposal. weeks ago I attended a public meeting in Brisbane which was addressed by the honourable the Treasurer. A t that time feeling ran f a i r l y high concerning the Government's proposal.

230,,"I was pointing out Mr DUNCAN-HUGHES (Boothby)payment on a moral right. lawyer that means an admission on their part that they have no legal right to the continuation of the payment, and goodness knows what a moral claim is. If we are to begin to conduct the affairs of the nation on moral claims, we had better jettison all our laws and inaugurate a new method of government. For years the States have avoided any settlement of this matter, although they have discussed it frequently. I am not speaking with any heat. It is natural and right that they should seek to protect State interests. If we were members of State houses it would be our duty to see that the States' rights or claims were safeguarded in every way. Personally, I do not cavil at such an attitude; but I point out that for years the States have avoided It they have discussed in conference with Prime Ministers, there has been at least one State that, at the last moment, has failed to come into line, and the whole of the negotiations have broken down. The subject has been postponed for future consideration, and the per capita payment has continued. That was inevitable. Further, the present State PremiersI think I may say without undue prejudice in the matterare, with one exception, not of the same political party as the Prime Minister and his colleagues, and, in spite of the fact that the proposal Avas clearly placed before them, they have made no attempt to suggest an alternative method. I consider that they have made a very grave mistake. Even assuming that the. suggested arrangement was not a good one, they might at least have put forward some alternative scheme Avhich could have been considered, particularly since they had no legal standing. By refusing to consider it, hoAvever, they put their States in a false position. coming from a lawyer, is putting the States in a false position? They have had a legal right to the payment of 25s. per head of the population for the last sixteen years. the States have no standing in regard to the per capita payment. terminated any moment, without any To any alternative payment, or compensation Avhatever. In spite of that, the State Premiers practically said, in conference, ""We admit that we have no legal right to the payment; but Ave say that A\'e havo a moral right. Therefore, Ave refuse to discuss the question ; it must rest on our moral right."" Any laAvyer realizes that that was an exceedingly weak position for the States to assume; it amounted really to bluff. The Premiers rendered a very grave disservice to the people they represented. They had an opportunity a year ago to put forward their suggestions in conference, and, perhaps, to obtain better terms than they were offered in the first instance; but they did not take advantage of it. Further, the Premiers refused to coming to a settlement. accept the proposal that the Prime Minwill be found that whenever ister made about three Aveeks ago, that a the matter special commission should be appointed to inquire into the figures and report if any of the States Avould be at a disadvantage under the measure. That seemed to me most reasonable and fair; though it did not mean the re-opening of the whole question. Members of Parliament-a t least I speak for myself-ha d come to a decision before that timts. I certainly had, but the Prime Minister told the State Premiers, "" We are not prepared to open the main question; but as a proof of our good faith, Ave are prepared to go into the question of the amounts that the various States Avould receive under this scheme, to see if there is any truth in the claim that they Avould be worse off in the future than they haA*e been in the past."" The State Premiers again refused that offer, and, in doing so, I think they did a further disservice to the people. It Avill be admitted that for a long time the States have urged two things rather strongly. The first is that there should be a remission by the Federal Parliament of some direct taxation. Under the present proposal it is intended that that shall be done. In the second place it has been repeatedly emphasized that the taxing authority should tax for itself and not for another authority. It is intended under the bill that that principle also shall be applied.

A to support the Government's proposal is the Prime Minister to act fairly towards the States. .1923, we had before us a bill for the extension of the railway south from Emungalan to Daly Waters the then honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) moved an amendment which was based on the unwillingness of Labour members to trust the Prime Minister to carry out what South Australian members regarded as the more important part of the contract with that State, namely, the commencing of the work from the south end. Honourable members on this side of the chamber, believing that in good time the Prime Minister would honour the contract which had been entered into, voted for the continuation of the work should commence at the northern end. That the work of extending the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs has alan amendment that has been ready commenced is evidence of the Prime Minister's bona fides. Asi n this matter also I believe that the Prime Minister and his Ministry are prepared to act f a i r l y towards the States, I shall support the Government. I u any case, I decided last year that in supporting the Government's proposal I should not be violating any principle; and seeing that no change which has since been made in the detail of procedure has caused me to think otherwise, I shall vote for the bill. was not my intention to address the Housei n relation to this measure, but circumstances have arisen which make it incumbent on me to do so. As I approached the chamber just now, I heard some one exclaim, "" Here comes one of the If the honourable memsmall gulis."" That is true. How could I , after only eight years in this House, attempt to equal the great display of eloquence that we have had in this chamber within the last few days?

One might well ask, as many honourable members have already done, why the Government introduced this proposal. In my opinion, it is for the same reason that has caused several of the banks of Australia to amalgamate. that has preceded it; In the last few weeks we have read of instance after instance of big banking institutions coming together and consolidating their forces. The managers of these banks can see financial trouble ahead, and they are consolidating their resources in order to prevent a bank smash such as Australia experienced years ago. I believe that the Prime MinisterI am a much happier and the Treasurer can see international trouble ahead, and they have introduced this proposal so that Commonwealth and State finances may be put on a better footing than at present. They believe that, in the event of trouble occurring, it is highly desirable that we should have a clear deck. These remarks may sound strange to honourable members who heard me make a certain speech in this House some years agoa speech for which I was ridiculed everywhere. I suppose it was rather dangerous for a politician to tread I was not. on that ground; he took the risk of being considered balmy. I have not altered my views at a l l ; but I wish to say that fro m information I have received from foreign sources-au d I have many friends on the other side of the world-ther e is a probability of international trouble arising, not only out of the Chinese situation, but otherwise.

Every one realizes that anything may come out of the I am happy to follow Chinese situation.

For to assume that because the Governholding a conference with the States they will not deal reasonably with the States. proved abortive, the Government had to deal with the matter along the lines proposed. In private or business life an existing contract is first disposed of before a new one is entered into.

Apart altogether from its actual scope it has proved of extraordinary value, in that it has induced honourable members to acquaint themselves with the basis upon which the financial provisions of the Constitution were built up. It has led them to peruse the convention debates to ascertain what was in the minds of the founders of the Commonwealth, and, in addition, the reports of proceedings at the different Premiers' conferences which, since the establishment of federation, have endeavoured to determine what would be acceptable to the States and the Commonwealth. Those who have taken the trouble to do so must have noticed that the guiding principle in the Government's policy is a fundamental fact of the Constitution; that is, that the Commonwealth, which is a federation of all the States, cannot afford to allow any one State to be permanently financially embarrassed. A l though interesting, the debate has been considerably wide of the issue that is before the House. We have had discussions regarding methods of taxation, and its incidence when levied by State and [14] Federal authorities. Plausible excuses have been made by ex-ministers of the Previous conferences having Crown, State and Federal, to account for their attitude to-day being different from what it was when they held office. Several honourable members have endeavoured to justify their opposition to the bill by giving differing versions of the policy of the Government which was enunciated at the recent election, and the mandate which the Government received. It has been suggested that the figures on which the various proINow that there is a possiposals of the Commonwealth have been based are not accurate. This Government has always been prepared to submit its figures to' the examination of the I am not concerned officers of the States. In the agreement which was arrived at in 1923, for instance, we said, "" We will wait until we get the actual figures. We are prepared to place the States in a better position, to the extent of £100,000, than [10.35] -Whateve r political those figures disclose."" In the recent discussions we urged that the various taxation and treasury officials of the States and the Commonwealth should investigate these matters, and, subsequently, we offered the States a royal commission upon which they would have representation, to ascertain whether our figures were accurate, and by the result of which we agreed to be bound. The Commonwealth has always been prepared to submit, in substitution for the per capita payments, proposals which would be more generous to the States than the present arrangement is. But that is not the issue now before the House. The real issue was put by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) when he intervened in the financial arrangements debate, through the courtesy of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). The right honourable gentleman detailed the various amendments which the Government desire to have inserted in the bill, and gave the reasons for those amendments. In the first place, the passing of the bill will be an expression of opinion by this House that the present system of uniform per capita payments to the States is unfair and unsound. It also will impose a definite time .limit upon the operation of the present system, because in its amended form the proposal for the cessation of the per capita payments will come into operation in",59,Speaker The Behind The Government But Who Vote

The tendency during the debate has been to concentrate on only one solution of the problem dealt with in the bill, to the exclusion of all other proposals, although, by the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States is open to discussion. Much of the opposition to I shall deal with the bill has been based on the assumption that in it the Government seeks a readjustment by which the States will be obliged to impose the taxation which is to be discontinued by the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister tried to correct that impression, and to give a definite lead to honourable members. In his speech he indicated the various possibilities which presented themselves to his mind as of taxation in substitution he spoke. He spoke first of the the per capita payments to evacuation of fields of taxation by If we had gone on the Commonwealth, and suggested that that might well be the subject of inquiry. Another proposal suggested for inquiry was whether the Commonwealth should take over the whole or part of the States debts, or provide sinking funds. There was also the question of modified payments, whioh might be made on some other basis than that of a uniform per capita payment such as has been adopted in other federations. Finally, at such a conference, the States would have an opportunity to offer entirely new suggestions.

266,Dr. Earle Page,"Afte r discussionit might be possible to evolve some new plan which would prove better even than any which has been suggested hitherto. So far as this House is concerned, however, a discussion of these matters is not proper at this stage. The time for discussion is when the conference is being held. The reason why it is absolutely essential that the measure should be carried is revealed by an examination of the history of negotiations with the States. Much of the debate has had relation to what has been described as the Braddon blot. That section provided for the payment to the States of three-fourths of the Customs revenue for a period of ten years. During the last five or six years of that period, numerous conferences were held between Commonwealth and State ministers to determine a satisfactory basis hence. In the meantime, the whole field for the future, but on each occasion new proposals were made by the representatives of the States. The Commonwealth, in 1904 and 1905, brought down certain proposals, and in 1909, less than a year before the expiration of 'the ten year period, two attempts were made to arrive at an agreement. In March, Mr Andrew Fisher, who was then Prime Minister, went to a conference of the State Premiers at their invitation, and, in view of previous experiences of such gatherings, he intimated that he had not come with any new scheme because so many of the amendments proposed by the Commonwealth had been turned down. All he wished to say was that the time limit fixed for the operation of the Braddon section would expire in the following year, and that it was essential that a satisfactory basis of agreement should be arrived at before the termination of the period named. The States then submitted a proposition which was not acceptable to the Commonwealth. In August of that year, and within ten months of the date of the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, the State Premiers and Commonwealth Ministers were able, for the first time in ten years, to arrive at a solution mutually satisfactory to the Commonwealth and the States. If , in 1910, the Surplus Revenue Act had been carried in such a form as to make it operative only for a period of ten years, after which, as in the case of an ordinary contract, its provisions would cease to have effect, the right honourable member for Balaclava would have been able to strike a satisfactory agreement with the State Governments in. 191819. But, because the duration of the per capita payments was left undetermined, the State authorities felt that it was better that they should be continued than that a scheme should be adopted whose results in the future might be unknown. They, therefore, refused to come to any agreement. We say that the history of these conferences between the Commonwealth and State authorities indicates that there is not the slightest chance of a satisfactory issue from another conference, unless a definite termination is first put to the existing arrangement, and the Government proposes that it should terminate fifteen months of inquiry is open to discover the best solution of the financial difficulty. the numbers, why does the honourable gentleman get excited about this? cited, but I wish to put on record for the information of the people of Australia a definite statement which will indicate the reasons actuating the present Government. Those reasons are, in my opinion, irrefutable; they bave not been met by any arguments that have been advanced during this debate. When Mr Fisher met the State authorities in conference, he said that the only thing he did which he felt might be wrong was to give rather too long a period for the operation of the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act. For the last eight years there have been continuous attempts to try to bring about a satisfactory conference to deal with this matter. In 1919 the right honourable member for Balaclava met the Premiers as Acting Prime Minister. In 1920 they were met by the right honourable member for North Sydney, who put forward various proposals that were very keenly debated. In 1923 the present Government came into the field and recognized the necessity for the establishment of some sort of security and some definiteness concerning the whole field of taxation. To secure the financial independence of the States certain proposals were brought",62,Speaker The Behind The Government But Who Vote
267,Mr Watt,If the Government has,63,Speaker The Behind The Government But Who Vote
268,Dr. Earle Page,"I am not exforward and transmitted to the State Premiers. They sent back a counter proposal to the effect that they were prepared to give up the per capita payments if the whole field of income taxation were, vacated by the Commonwealth. Commonwealth Government said, ""Let us discuss the matter,"" and the spirit of conciliation which marked the negotiations by the Commonwealth is evidenced by the fact that at that conference a compromise scheme was proposed half-way between the demand of the State authorities that the Commonwealth should evacuate the whole field of income taxation and the proposal of the Commonwealth Government, while ceasing to make the per capita payments, to continue to a certain extent in the income tax field of taxation. That compromise scheme was accepted by the representatives of five of the six States, and subsequently a resolution, which was adopted unanimously by the representatives of all the States, was carried expressing appreciation of the attitude of the Prime Minister. In 1926 the Commonwealth Government put before the State Premiers the very scheme of which they had previously expressed their appreciation, and to which the representatives of five of the six States were prepared to agree. That scheme was again submitted to them in a more liberal form, because the scheme proposed in 1923 dealt with the payment of interest on transferred properties. The scheme of 1926 made no reference to the transferred properties, but only to fields of taxation. ""When the scheme of 1926 was put before the State Premiers they refused to discuss it at all, saying that they had a moral right to the per capita payments. wrong, of course. wealth Government put before the con ference figures which it was prepared to submit to the scrutiny of State officers. Its only object was to secure such a transfer of the fields of taxation as would enable the State taxpayers as such to be £100,000 per annum better off in each State than they are at the present time. Tbat is to say, the State Governments would be able to recoup themselves for the loss of the per capita payments and to levy taxation which would give each of them £100,000 per annum more than they then received through the per capita payments. I mention these facts to indicate the difficulty The of securing unanimity, and that agreement between the Commonwealth and State authorities, of which so much has been said during this debate. All previous attempts to deal with the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States have involved loss of revenue to the States. When federation was consummated, the State authorities were mulct to the extent of one-fourth of their Customs and excise revenues. In 1910, when the uniform per capita payment system was brought into existence, the States lost a further £3,000,000. When the right honourable member for Balaclava brought down his proposal, in the next six years it would have resulted in a loss to the States of £4,000,000 or more. When the present Government brought down its proposals, its definite intention was to secure that under them the States would be better off, because it regarded the problems to be solved by the State Governments as very difficult indeed. Honourable members will see, therefore, that there is no truth in the stories which have been told suggesting that it is the object of the Commonwealth Government to try to starve the States into submission or to enslave them. I wish to make two newspaper quotations) which were published in 1923. One is from the Sydney Morning Herald. It said at that time. Tlie effect of such alterations is that the Commonwealth Treasurer desires to make the States supreme in the matter of finance, and not the Commonwealth. Honourable members may remember that at the same time the Melbourne Herald dealt with the proposal in an article headed, "" Mr Bruce Surrenders to the States,"" in which it was contended that to give away the fields of taxation as proposed would render the Commonwealth Government impotent. does not seriously quote the Melbourne Herald? the Sydney Morning Herald in answer to those who endeavour to create the",63,Speaker The Behind The Government But Who Vote

The question now before the House is, first of all, whether honourable members believe the uniform per capita system is unsound, and, secondly, whether the Commonwealth Government is approaching in the right way. It proposes that a termination shall be put to the present system by this Parliament, and that a conference shall be held in the meantime at which every other possible solution of the problem may be considered, in the hope tliat a mutual agreement may be arrived at which will be beneficial to the Commonwealth and State authorities, and also to the people of Australia.
