The Petiuon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) Your petitioners believe in the principle that every Australian child, irrespective of the school he attends, is entitled to economic suppon for his basic educational needs from the funds placed at the disposal of the Australian Government through taxation. Further, they believe that this economic suppon should be in the form of per pupil grants which are directly related to the cost of educating an Australian child in a government school. (2) Your petitioners believe that in addition to this basic per pupil grant additional assistance should be provided in cases of educational disadvantage, but they believe that the appropriate instruments for reducing economic inequalities are taxauon and social welfare systems which deal with individuals and families and not with schools. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that, as an interim measure, the Government will immediately increase the current grants being made to children in non-government schools to at least SO per cent of the cost of educating children in government schools, thus enabling the non-governby Mr Morris. ment schools to continue to exist and fulfil their function of educating Australian children.

That a properly constituted meeung of students supponed the policy of the elected Students' Representative Council that Union facilities should be the first priority of the Institute. That the S.R.C. formulated a definitive plan that is an acceptable constructive and reasonable amendment to the present planning schedule at the Institute. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House ask the Australian Commission on Advanced Education to consider in their 1976-78 Triennium Repon on allocation of funds to ensure the provision of Union Facilities at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Lloyd. Petition received. Universal Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representauves in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that all Australians irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (ii) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus ensuring that citizens will no longer be burdened with additional psychological strains because of inability to meet the high cost of medical treatment. (iii) It is committed, in principle, towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost of health services should be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people who derive the most nnancial benefit from our society should give the most for its suppon. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupation of their choiceThe care of the ill and the prevention of disease. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will hasten to introduce this much needed scheme so that health care services in Australia can begin to function equitably, efficiently, and economically.

Does the Prime Minister recall on 24 September the taped 'AM' broadcastI have the exact quote here-in which he supported the concept that tariff slashing was to be commended even though it meant a certain amount of unemployment and characterised as 'nervous Nellies' those people who were frightened of a certain amount of unemployment?

30,Mr Lamb,"My question is directed to the Minister inform the House whether the unemployment ngures now prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics refer to applications for employment or registrations of unemployment? What differences do any new calculations reflect upon the actual level of unemployment and what effect will the fiscal proposals outlined by the Prime Minister in this House last night have on those levels of unemployment? wealth Employment Service records the number of people who register as seeking employment. They can conceivably be people who have lost a second job-that is, a second part time job-and who are seeking to get back again a second part time job or a part time job. The figures do not represent the number of people who are actually unemployed but the number of people who are seeking employment. However, there has been a downturn in the overall level of employment. But it is important to know that the registrations are for people seeking employment rather than for people saying that they are unemployed. The fiscal policies announced by the Prime Minister last night and the monetary policies announced by the Treasurer at the weekend, will, once the necessary time lag that always occurs when such action is taken has elapsed, give quite an enormous fillip to the level of employment. The policies will increase industrial activity and industrial House, following the lease of 7 floors of IAC expansion. One can say with absolute certainty that when the time lag has expired Australia once again will be in the same very buoyant position that it was in right throughout the whole of last year until the world economic situation, over which, of course, we had no control, caused ripples on our shores.

Only yesterday in the United States it was announced that in the motor car industry 88,000 men had been retrenched on in previous 24 hours. In West Germany there have been very heavy retrenchments in the motor car industry. The same thing is happening in France and in Italy. The same thing is happening in the United Kingdom. Even in Spain where there is no problem of tariff reductions or tariff increases and where the wages are relatively very low some of the motor car multinational companies have had to close down their Spanish subsidiaries. The fact of the matter is that the motor car industry all over the world is over-stretched. It is able to produce motor cars quicker than it can find customers.

The policy of the previous Government was to build on a site at Wooloomooloo. This would have over-centralised the area of Sydney by putting a further 15,000 Commonwealth public servants there. It would have created further chaos because of the over-centralisation of Sydney. The Whitlam Government has set about developing Sydney in a rational way by decentralising office accommodation for Commonwealth public servants.

They know that wage indexation is just and that its introduction is probable but they are caught in the dilemma of opposing the inevitable or the desirable together with their State colleagues or of accepting a desirable reform. There is no doubt that wage indexation together with the reduction of income tax payable by middle and lower income people will be the most positive method to break the wage-price spiral which has hitherto been devised. It is significant, of course, that honourable members opposite have been caught completely flat footed by these proposals. like everything else. gentleman who interjects never found any merit lowances for some contingencies.

If the right estimates in detail for both the deficit and the honourable gentleman wants a forecast as to domestic deficit?

Of course, there could be a lesser amount than that involved, in which event there could be a larger number ofloans. It seems to me that that would probably represent the needed input into the building industry to maximise its capacity and to bring it to a desirable state of buoyancy. One must not think of this injection of an additional $150m in isolation from the other very significant initiatives already announced by the Treasurer in respect of the amendments to the savings banks regulations, which could have the effect of putting $250m out for these purposes in the short term. In addition to that, there is the range of initiatives being taken in the public sector, which include an extra $75m over and above the Budget announcement for public housing. There is also additional money for defence service homes purposes and an additional $8m for the Queensland Housing Comniission.

The total perspective for this would seem to me to indicate that builders and others associated with the building industry have very good cause for confidence. I know that the building societies must be encouraged to have received the imprimatur from the Government and they too are likely to have a significant degree of success in attracting investment into the permanent building society area. The allocation as announced by the Prime Minister will be expended on new homes, existing homes and extensions for homes. I am personally very pleased that he emphasised the need to include the consideration of housing advances for females as well as for males. Minerals and Energy)-Pursuant to section 45 of 5 seats.

That answer was given in response to a question I asked regarding the impact of the submissions made by the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labor Party for redistribution purposes when read with the New South Wales results of the 18 May election for the House of Representatives. In my question I asked the Minister whether the impact of his Party's submission would produce in New South Wales 29 ALP seats out of 45 and in percentage terms 64 per cent of the seats in New South Wales. I now name the seats that formed the basis of my question. Mr DalyI raise a point of order. The honourable member is not explaining where he has been misrepresented.

Bennelong ( Mr Howard) referred to an answer which I gave to a question asked by him yesterday. The fact of the matter is that the honourable member has now produced some statistics and he has not said where he got them. For all I know he could have got them from out ofhis head. The honourable member has taken statistics that suit his own point of view and has then endeavoured to prove his case. Any person who assesses electoral results and applies them to one election only is on very weak ground. If one went back to two or three elections before the one the honourable member is talking about totally different results would be given. Mr HowardIriseto order.

The point I am making is that the honourable member has misrepresented my answer in that he has taken only one set of statistics. If he goes back over other elections and averages thefigureshe will find that a totally different result is given. In this respect I point out that the statements made by the honourable member in this House yesterday are completely without foundation. personal explanation. honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? the Prime Mimster said that a tape recording device in the Prime Minister's room had been used and that he gave instructions for it to be dismantled. I have spoken about this matter on so many occasions that it is almost dull and unworthy of comment except that it is wise to have the record put straight in this House. The simple fact is that when I became the Prime Minister there was such a tape recording device that went into the office of the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister. This device was not under the supervision or jurisdiction of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisauon. It was for the use of the public relations officer if he thought it was desirable. It was never used by me. It was tested once and found to be completely ineffective. SoI said: 'Do not bother about it any more'. I now want to say something about the timing of the dismantling. Some ume before ceasing to be Prime MinisterI gave instructions that the Prime Ministerial suit was to bereconstructed.I did not go into that suite during the election compaign as the office was being rebuilt and neither did Mr Whitlam. SoI would say this injustice to him: He would not have been able to use it if he did so. Whether he said the recorder was not to be reconnected when he inherited the rather beautiful suite that I designed, in co-operation with others, is an entirely different matter. I think the House can rest assured of this. As one who detests listening devices of any kind-unles s there is agreement between the parties that they ought to be used for temporary record purposesI must say that I would not use them, nor do I like them.

71,Mr Mcmahon,"This morning, Mr Speaker,Discussion of Matter of Public Importance the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr ment or at the Conference itself, but simply bePeacock) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to permit debate of its would give because they did not wish to be seen foreign policies in this Parliament and the need to have such in a poor light, not because they had any moral debate on international issues of concern to the Australian basis or any initiatives to put forward at all. people. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in thenplaces) Speaker, this matter is before the House not as a partisan matter but as a plea to the Government to produce its policies in this chamber for the information of members of Parliament and, of course, the public. It will be recalled that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) yesterday gave notice ofhis intention to move a motion of want of confidence in the Treasurer ( Mr ing that the relations between the 2 countries are Crean). The Government has refused to allow debate on that motion to proceed, placing the Treasurer in an impossible position. But we are going ahead with a debate on this matter of pubUc importance in Ueu of debate on that motion. The last time a major international affairs statement was delivered to this ParUament by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) was 24 May 1973. The man who held himself out as not merely the great reformer but also the great performer has not performed in this chamber in the area of international affairs. He has prevented urgency motions from coming on. He has allowed his party to gag the Estimates debates. The statement of the Mmister for Foreign Affairs (Senator WUlesee) to the Senate upon return from his most recent visit to North America consisted of one and half pages simply advising where he had been and whom he had seen and did not contain discussions of policy matters in any depth. But there has been nothing from the Prime Mmister himself. It appears that the Government's foreign poUcies have been just as damaging externaUy as it has admitted that its domestic poUcies have been internally; yet no explanation is given from time to time in this Parliament. We have even seen the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt), not the Mmister for Foreign Affairs, not the Prime Minister, attending the World Food Conference in Rome. There the Government determined that it would give a certain amount of money to endeavour to meet the world food crisis, not on the basis of guide lines laid down in this Parliacause Canada had decided to give in excess of $30m. As most major newspapers reported, the Minister, for Agriculture telephoned the Prime Minister and upped the amount that Australia Recently the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea was in this country. Only the weekend before last he visited Australia and had discussions with the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison), who is at the table, and with the Prime Mimster. Not one word has been given to about what is transpiring in Papua New Guinea, about the continued transfer of administrative and legislative functions from Australia to that country, or about the post-independence relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia. There is no doubt that that country wUl achieve independence next year. We ought to be ensurwell worked out before independence. Yet we would not know whether discussions are being carried out on that basis. Nothing is being put to this ParUament; nothing is being put to the Australian people. That special relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea, which we hope wUl continue in the post-independence scene, is not being guaranteed. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. sitting for lunch I was giving the background to the discussion of the matter of public importance and then moving through various matters that were to be discussed. I was discussing the lack of information that had flowed from the Australian Government in relation to post-independence relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia and other factors leading up to the independence of Papua New Guinea. I do not want to dwell, in the short time that remains to me, on that matter. It is, though, one of the most singularly important matters and again an area in which we have not been informed sufficiently by this Government. WhUeI have been talking about a small area, the area which I want to pass on to before moving to the basis of the strategic assessment contained in the Defence Report is a territory of Australia which is smaller in area than Papua New Guinea-the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.",27,Personal Explanations

74,Mr Peacock,"Prior to the suspension oftheThe Territory is not within the ambit or control of the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison), who is at the table, but in the control of the Special Minister of State( Mr Lionel Bowen). This matter is covered by the wording of the motion. Again we have received no information from the Government and no opportunity to debate the Territory's future. Recently the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea came to Australia. Mr John Clunies-Ross, of the Clunies-Ross estate, also visited Canberra some weeks back for talks with the Government. We have not been advised of the outcome of those talks. We ought to be advised. There is, of course, a discrepancy in the Government's stand on the future of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Government, in the United Nations in December 1972, shortly after assuming office, voted for the independence of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Yet in 1973 the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) indicated that independence would not be granted to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. That was an entirely different approach. Subsequently a Committee of Twenty-four from the United Nations has been making an assessment of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and will be reporting in due course to the United Nations. Reports in newspapersfiledby New York correspondents indicate that aspersions may be cast on the way in which this Government has handled the administration of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I remind the House that in 1972 I personally visited Cocos and reached agreement ters. I asked questions on notice about why these matters had not been pursued and followed up. I have been informed that the agreements reached covered not only the acceptance of sovereignty but also related to the codification of the criminal law, education facilities, health matters and the like, have been lost by the Department. If that is the case I ask the Minister to advise this Parliament of the Government's intentions for the future of that Territory and how on earth this Government can allow a situation to develop within the framework of its continued maladministration whereby agreements entered into between the previous Government and Mr a statement to the Parliament on an overseas Clunies-Ross are not in the control of this Government. Our major complaint is that matters are not major international relauons debate which took placed before the Parliament. There is a lack of place in May of 1973. When he came back and information. I question, for example, the subindeed while he was in Japan he indicated that stance of the Government's planning of its the Treaty of Nara was one of his and his foreign policies and its defence policies. I refer to Government's greatest achievements. In reality the alleged no-threa t theory of the Government the Treaty does not exist. The purpose of the which ignores the instability in the region, particularly in Indo-China, and which ignores the instability and fragility in regard to detente itself. The Defence Report goes on even further and says: 'If there were any threats we would all have plenty of warning'. That, apart from being an inept statement, is historically incorrect. It ignores the confrontation which caused the outbreak of World WarI , the way in which the Korean war was started and indeed the Middle East conflicts of 1967 and 1973. The Prime Minister's own words at the United Nauons, using almost alarmist terms, destroy the no-threa t theory of the Government. Yet the Government does not present itself in this Parliament to tell us whether in fact its assessments are different. I will quote some of the Prime Minister's own words at the United Nations. He said: A drift away from international order today He also said: A sense of events out of control When referring to the world in which we live he said: A nightmare world He also said: The courses of conflict multiply andThe threat of war for the possession of resources All this phraseology was used by the Prime Minister and yet this Government maintains that there is no threat to the security of this country for ten tofifteenyears. We live, the Government alleges, in an idyllic and tranquil environment. Yet that is the antithesis of the phrases used by the Prime Minister when he addressed the United Nauons. Why have we not been told about the change in the Prime Minister's attitude over economic nationalism, which was so ridiculed by the Prime Minister at the United Nations? Yet when he returned to Australia and to the Press he seemed to endorse the policies of the Minister for Minerals and Energy( Mr Connor). What of the Treaty of Nara that was indicated after the visit? The only time that I can recall the Prime Minister making visit-and there have been plenty of them-wa s when he returned from a visit to Japan and China last year.

There is no treaty in existence. It may occasion yet another visit by the Prime Minister to sign a treaty next year, but there is no treaty in existence today. I have already elsewhere cautioned the Government about treating Japan in an exclusive relationship in the sense that I believe it is wise for Australia to be entering into joint ventures over resources with a number of countries. Until the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) visited the United States in the last week we have seen a scenario painted time and again that this country is not interested in entering into resources discussions with other countries unless they can simply reach an agreement to agree. For example, it was heralded before the Shah of Iran came here that so many worthwhile agreements would be reached between the Government and the Government of Iran. Again, only an agreement to agree was reached. So far as Japan is concerned the Treaty of Nara does not exist. So far as resources diplomacy is concerned we have changed tack so many times that no one knows in what direction we are heading or indeed whether we are prepared to enter into arrangements. The 'Financial Review' of this morning quotes the Deputy Prime Minister as saying: We've been a bit slow in denning our positionandWe need investments to get our economy going. A couple of years ago it might have been strange with which our aspirations are symbolised more for the Opposition spokesman on foreign policy than they are with China? Of course not. But we to have raised questions on resources relations cannot get a debate going on these subjects. AllI and economic matters in a foreign policy debate, can do is raise these matters seemingly in little but there is no way in which the foreign policy of more than headings in a 10 to IS minute disthis country can be conducted without having cussion.

The has raised a number of issues, each one of Government still talks outside this Parliament of which-and I would be very happy to take him alleged zones of peace and neutrality as if they are immediately achievable. We challenge that view. We challenge the Government's view on economic nationalism. We challenge its view on the inconsistent attitudes over the Baltic States and in regard to the Ermolenko affair. What of the visit of the Prime Minister to the Soviet Union that will take place in another month's time? The Prime Minister, I understand, is visiting Europe. We do not know yet of the countries he is to visit, though it has been alleged he will ' not be going to France. That is interesting. Scared of the paranoid attitude of certain groups in the community, he not only shrinks from debating foreign policy in this House but also shrinks from discussing his difference face to face with the Government of France. When he goes to the Soviet Union what will he tell the Soviet Union? Will he ask for an amelioration of attitudes over the treatment of minorities within that community? What will his answer be to questions about the extraordinary statement he made when he was in China? The Soviet Union, with its conflict with China and the conflict over borders will be interested in the statement made by the Prime Minister when in China in which he said: With no nation is our new aspiration symbolised more than it is with China, a power not only in our region but in the world. How will he answer questions by the Soviet Government over that?

The record of the Senate shows that in the course of this year there have been 12 opportunities for debate on this subject.

There was Likewise, in this House there have been 4 the defence debates. There have been several debates in this House on defence. I was a little disappointed in the remarks my good and learned colleague made in relation to the Australian Government's attitude towards food and the humanitarian aspects of a problem that I believe every member of this House should be gravely concerned about. He erroneously criticised us for our failure to spell out our policy towards food aid. In the short time. I have been a member of this HouseI have found it curious that the Opposition, particularly the Australian Country Party, interest in humanitarian ideals is directly related to whether there is a surplus of Australian agricultural products.

I was rather disappointed in my honourable colleague criticising the Australian Government's role in the World Food Conference which is now taking place. At that Food Conference Australia made the most forthcoming statement that it has ever made in terms of assisting the underdeveloped countries in this world in a problem that we all recognise and appreciate. He seemed to make light of that Conference because Australia was represented at it by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt). He seemed to be saying that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should have been there. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was at another meeting. But because this is a matter of concern related to food it was quite appropriate-in fact, in the Government's viewpoint it was essential-that Australia should be represented by the Minister for Agriculture, and that we were. We are taking an important and positive role in that World Food Conference. I will take up another point. My honourable grown constitution. The debate on the Comfor Kooyong would agree with it-ha s been to resist making any statement that could be interpreted or misinterpreted as intervention of The honourable member will also be aware that we have had a series of debates on enabling legislation relating to Papua New Guinea that I have brought into this House. I have been most appreciative of the understanding displayed by the honourable member for Kooyong in these debates. SoI think it is absurd for him now to say that he has not had an opportunity of discussing these matters. He has had an opportunity of debate on a series of Bills on Papua New Guinea which were discussed this year and last year. He also knows very well that discussions are continuing with the Papua New Guinea Government on the arrangements for devolution of powers arrangements for independence at a time which both Australia and Papua New Guinea decide upon and also for post-independence arrangements. I stress this point once more: Any action by us to make a statement that is relevant to the discussion by the House of Assembly, which is an autonomous body, could be seen and could be interpreted as an intervention in its affairs. One of the other propositions put to the public by the honourable member for Kooyong relates to the Australian Government's attitude to South Africa. During the debate on the Estimates the honourable member for Kooyong raised this matter. In that debate, in response to the honourable member for Kooyong, I put forward very clearly the attitude and the reasons for the attitude of the Australian Government towards South Africa in the United Nations context. I believe that that attitude has paid dividends in its results. I am sure that honourable members will have seen the statement made by Mr Vorster, the Prime Minister of South Africa, following the action by Australia in the United Nations under Article6 of the United Nations Charter to support the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations because of its consistent and persistent breaking of the spirit of the United Nations. Mr Vorster made a plea for the world to give him 6 months to produce changes in the international standing of the Republic of South Africa. This followed from a deliberate decision of the Australian Government made in the light of the persistent violations by South Africa of the United Nauons Charter. If the Opposition had been the government, it would not have hadI use the word advisedlythe guts to make such a proposition. I am not saying this is so of the honourable member for Kooyong, but he knows as well as I do that there are many members sitting behind him who are pro-South African and pro-Rhodesian. We made our view known and we made a statement in the United Nations condemning South Africa for persistent violations. Now we are starting to see the results of that action that we had the fortitude to take. We as a Government which believes in the basic freedoms of all people cannot continue to maintain within the United Nations a country that violates every one of those freedoms. This is the strength of our foreign policy. For the first ume Australia is making its own voice heard. has expired. know that today there is a considerable growth in activities and relationships between countries through diplomacy. We also know that in the history of Australia there has always been an unfortunate tendency to delude ourselves into believing that Australia can stand aloof and shut herself away from the world's problems. Today we are entering an increasingly interdependent world and our attitude towards national sovereignty and other problems will undoubtedly be affected by the situations we see in other countries. For that reason it is the responsibility of all governments, regardless of their political colour, to ensure that they bring to the attention of the Australian people, through the Australian Parliament, the activities, the problems and the solutions which the government of the day sees as being best fitted to the interests of this nation. This Government has been in power now for 23 months. During that period, despite the comments made by the Minister for Science( Mr Morrison), the fact still remains that only one statement on foreign policy has been made in this House. I am not commenting on statements made in the other place. The fact of the matter is that a statement on foreign policy has been made on only one occasion in this House and that was on 24 May 1973. Since that date the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) has made no fewer than 11 visits overseas to no fewer than 25 countries. This is a remarkable record and it has not been equalled by any Prime Minister since Federation. I do not quarrel with the principle of the rights of a Prime Minister and leaders of a Government to ttavel overseas to ensure that they are up to date with trends and expectations of other nations, but what I do comment on is that on their return it is the right of the Australian people through their Parliament to know what the Prime Minister and the Ministers have learnt by their experiences. It is not good enough just to swan around the world using taxpayers' money and then returning to ominous silence. We do not want silence from a government. We want to know what its policies are and the people of this country want to know what sort of leadership they have both domestically and in a foreign context.",30,Australian Government Foreign Policies
79,Mr Speaker,Order! The Minister's time,33,Australian Government Foreign Policies
80,Mr Connolly (Bradfield) (2.42),"We allWe have seen for too long-in the last year in particular-the shambles which this country has been reduced to because of the Government's lack of specific economic policies. Are we to see a similar situation develop in our foreign relationships? The implications are clear and the dangers which face us today are just as relevant as they were to previous governments in earlier times. We have been told that the Government's foreign and defence policies which of course should always be interrelated are based on the principle that Australia is not likely to face a threat for some 10 to IS years. At the same time we have a government which allows Indonesian fishingfleetsto go into the north-west shelf area of Australia because we lack the capacity to stop them. If we sent our entirefleetof small ships up there we would leave the rest of Australia more or less denuded of naval defence. I do not wish to discuss defence in the context of this debate but the fact remains, as the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock) so rightly pointed out, that no country in today's world is able to sit back and say with any conclusive reliability that no likely threat will occur within the next 10 to 15 previous Liberal Prime Ministers. He failed to years. We have seen in the last few months the enunciation of a new doctrine of nuclear war by the United States Secretary of Defence. The implications of this for countries like Australia are of considerable importance. We want to know what the Government thinks of this. Why should not the people know the importance and relevance of the bi-polar axis? Why should not the people of this nation be given a chance to appreciate that although we must live in the bi-polar context the fact remains that there is a considerable growth in technology which has developed through nuclear capacity? This is growing all the time. We must be aware that within the next 5 years many more states will either have the atomic bomb or have the capacity to build it. This is relevant to our policies. It is relevant to Australia's defence, especially when we see the nations to the north of us-India, and Indonesia in particular-already , in the last 2 months, coming out with a statement which to say the least was ambivalent but which would give reasonable expectation that they too are now prepared to get on the nuclear bandwagon if they can do so. We have also seen in the last few months the especially the Japanese-woul d be prepared to United States making the decision to supply negotiate on such an extraordinary basis. technology and uranium reactors to both the United Arab Republic and to Israel. The implications of this are enormous. Again we need Minister for Immigration who joined the Prime to know the Australian Government's view. We Minister in overseas visits. They visited the are well aware, through the comments made in the United Nations and elsewhere, that the Government is against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and so are we. But is the Prime Minister when he goes to Moscow at the end of this year going to make it quite clear to the Russians where we stand and how we expect to see the Russians assist the United States in coming to a reasonable arrangement with the states which already have nuclear capacity to ensure that we do not have this proliferation any further? Let us get the facts understood. Let us learn the situation as the Government sees it. It is not good enough for the Department of Foreign Affairs to be the sole purveyors of information. If this is a democracy and if this Parliament is to be active as it is supposed to be in the interests of the Australian people we need to discuss these matters. Isolation, as I said earlier, is a reality in Australia and it is something which has to be broken down in the interests of this country. The Minister for Science made the comment that monumental bungles had been made by give us any specific examples except to suggest the Press is now able to travel faster than aeroplanes. I do not regard that as being particularly relevant. There are, however, a number of points worth raising in the context of this Government's foreign policy. For example, we had the Asian forum, an idea which the Prime Minister went to great length to expound in the early days of his first Ministry. Since then there has been dead silence. Why? Because he tried to launch an idea in the Asian region which the region was not prepared to accept at that time. Then we have the insults to Mr Nixon. Regardless of the past, the fact of the matter is that Mr Nixon at that stage was President of the United Statesa country with which we were supposed to be allies and with which we had very good relations. Yet, this Government was quite prepared to insult President Nixon to an unprecedented extent. Then in October 1974 3 Ministers went to Tokyo allegedly to talk about minerals and energy matters. They had no policy when they got on the plane. They tried to prepare one on the way to Tokyo. The3 Ministers concerned all spoke with different voices and, of course, the Japanese did not give them an inch because nobodyMore recently, we had the case of the exPhilippines and assured those people that the White Australia policy was dead and that there was nothing more to worry about. What was the result of this quaint use of words? We had 10,000 Burmese trying to invade our embassy in Rangoon. We had Burmese selling our immigration papers on the streets. Thousands of Burmese returned to their families and villages and were able to say, with the knowledge of their own experience, that Australia was not genuine-that they had gone to the Australian Embassy and they had been turned away from the door. The same thing happened in the Philippines. The statistics are quite clear. I ask honourable members to examine them. If they do so they will see that whenever the Prime Minister or Mr bate. Rather, foreign affairs debates in this place Grassby visited South East Asia there was an enormous increase in applications for immigration to Australia. Let us be 'fair dinkum' for a change. Let us give this country and this Parhament a fair goa term we have heard used so much in other quarters. Let the people of Australia know the Government's expectations because unless our future is secured and unless we are in a position to be able to look forward and make reasonable assessments as to our future, this country will no longer be secure. opposed to the basic idea behind this discussion which was introduced by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock), which is that we ought to have from time to time proper debates on foreign policy in this Parliament and that we ought to have a reasonable amount of time to conduct such debates. I think that we all accept the principle that the people of Australia, generally speaking, are not well informed on foreign affairs or defence matters. When we debate such matters in this Parliament we tend to debate, on both sides of this House, in fairly simplistic terms trying to extract political advancontest this fact-enjoy s the involvement that he tage rather than trying to develop a well informed electorate. But I would not like the idea to gain currency that this failure to have proper debates on foreign affairs matters is something that took effect from December 1972.1 have been in this Parliament since early 1962 and I well recall the hiatus in the last couple of years of the former Liberal-Country Party Government when it was very difficult to get debates on foreign affairs. That Government was prepared to debate foreign affairs matters when there was some political advantage in debating them but was completely unprepared to debate such matters when it was obvious that the people of Australia had turned against the Vietnam policy which was rejected not only by a majority of the people of this country but also by a majority of people throughout the world. record to see the number of foreign affairs debates and the issues that were covered. I think we all ought to be honest enough to admit that we have never had the sort of free ranging foreign affairs debates that one has in the House of Commons where the important issues of the present and future are properly canvassed by public dehave hinged on the particular political advantage of the day. When one thinks of the infinite number of debates we had on Vietnam until Vietnam went sour and the Opposition would not debate the subject because there were no votes in it. I agree there are many matters of great importance to this country that we ought to debate. It is a fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee) is in the Senatea fairly new development-and that a number of statements have been made in the Senate. The opportunity has been there to debate those statements but that opportunity has not been taken up by the Opposition in the Senate which, as honourable members are aware, is in a rather more competitive position than the Opposition is here. I do not contest the fact that debates should take place in this House. Let us look at the reason that, in this fairly difficult situation when domestic policies are demanding so much attention we have so little time to do this. I am sure that the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam)I do not think any honourable member on either side of the Parliament would has in foreign affairs. I think that he has brought to foreign affairs, in the period when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs and since, a great deal of capacity, leadership and new direction which was badly needed. I am sure the Prime Minister would have welcomed very much a discussion of this nature but earlier this year the Opposition brought us to a double dissolution and drove like a steam roller through the parliamentary program for this year. Since we have come back this Government has been wrestling with the rather important economic issues that have plagued not only this country but also other countries.

The Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act has been in operation for more than 7 years and the Handicapped Children (Assistproved benencial and during these years both my Department and the voluntary organisations through which the various services are provided have learned a great deal. The number of disabled employees in sheltered workshops in 1966 was just over 2,000. 10,000. The gross production income of sheltered workshops in 1966 was $2.2m. By 1974 the income had risen to $16m. But it had become clear that there was need for further improvement, not only in the basic services that were being provided, but also in the peripheral activities that help the handicapped people to participate more fully in the general life of the community. These questions were discussed at length with representatives of the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled, the Australian Association for the Mentally Retarded and the consultants engaged by my Department to assist the voluntary bodies to develop effective sheltered workshops and hostels. The program that was evolved as a result of those discussions forms the basis of this BUl. Although the Sheltered EmChildren (Assistance) Act will be repealed, the main provisions of those 2 Acts are to be continued and expanded. It is designed to cater for the needs of handicapped children and handicapped adults who do not require constant medical attention but who, nevertheless, need special facilities to enable them to take their place in the community. The broad details of the new measures were this year, when I outlined a 15-point program for the welfare of handicapped people. This Bill gives effect to those of the 15 points that require of the more important provisions. The subsidy for establishing sheltered work-",35,Australian Government Foreign Policies

87,Mr Hayden (Oxley,"Minister for Social legislative action. I should like to refer to several$4 for every $1 raised by voluntary organisations. This will take effect from the date the Act receives royal assent. The extension of the rental subsidy to many new types of projects will, I am sure, result in the provision of many additional and much needed services. It will also enable organisations with very limited capital resources to provide facilities. The renting of an exisung large home for use as a half-way house for handicapped people beingre-establishedin the community is but one example. The Bill also transfers the provisions relaung to the handicapped children's benefit, which is now administered by my Department, from the National Health Act to this Act. In doing so the rate of benefit has been increased from $3 to $3.50 a day, and provision made to enable short absences, such as when the child returns home for a weekend, to be disregarded. Voluntary organisations are being faced with increasing overhead expenditure, especially on wages and salaries. And they have all had the experience that, while it is still possible to get donations towards the cost of a tangible project such as a new hostel or workshop, it is much more difficult to raise charity funds to meet operational costs. The Bill introduces a salary subsidy of 50 per cent for approved staff. This provision, which previously applied only in relation to sheltered employment, will now apply to the whole range of prescribed services. With new ventures 100 per cent of staff salaries may be paid for up to 2 years to enable the service to become established. Also as aresultof this Bill voluntary organisations will be able to obtain subsidy assistance towards the cost of establishing activity centres for those handicapped people who cannot meet the requirements of a sheltered workshop. The Bill will also assist the development of recreational and rehabilitating facilities that are anciling. It is a privilege to be able to join forces with lary to either the workshop training centre or activity centre. It will encourage organisations to put greater emphasis on the social interests of the disabled. It is not enough to provide these people with training, sheltered employment and accommodation. They also need encouragement to lead a more normal social life and to develop the capacity to accept and be accepted by the society in which they live. At this point I would like to express my appreciation of the work of the voluntary agencies. There is a very special role for them to play for there are many people whose needs are best served by these organisations. Although the Australian Government provides for the general economic welfare of the disabled, it is the voluntary organisations that are able to help, in a way not always possible for a Government department, in the personal day-to-day care of many mentally or physically handicapped people. Voluntary organisations have an 'individual touch'. They can deal with the person as a whole, helping with not one but perhaps four or five interlocking personal difficulties. And they can be so much moreflexiblein their approach. This personal interest is irreplaceable and this is why co-operation between the voluntary agencies and the Government is so vital. The Australian Government has thefinancialresources; the voluntary agencies have the grass roots understanding. By working together we have achieved much. This Bill opens the way for us to achieve more. The provisions that are contained in this Bill constitute the Government's considered program for an area of special need. It caters for physically and mentally handicapped children and adults most of whom require assistance by way of training, supervision, employment or accommodation if their lives are not to be wasted. It provides a balanced and integrated program that is intended to serve an area of social need bounded on one side by the program of the Australian Assistance Plan and on the other by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. It will also be necessary to ensure that the assistance provided for handicapped children is coordinated with the activities of the Schools Commission. All of the measures contained in this Bill deeply involve the community. But they are measures that the community wants and, indeed, in many cases has taken the initiative in supplythese voluntary organisations and so make their efforts more effective. We, in this Government, accept that a Government's duty is not discharged simply by assisting handicapped people to live in comfort. We accept as a challenge the role of joining with community organisations to broaden the horizons of handicapped people, to promote their abilities in both occupational and recreational activities and, overall, to improve the range of their social opportunities. At a time and in a country where expectations of higher life styles are continually rising from a base of affluence and social improvement we want to ensure that the needs and aspirations of all Australians are met. I believe that some Australians whose legitimate claims on the social conscience of our community have been the highest have, in fact, been short changed. The morality of the social contracts written by There were, however, some difficulties in the way past governments for some of these groups has of applying the same adjustment method to penbeen very much open to question.

This Bill is designed to introduce several reforms of a fundamental nature to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and also to make a number of fairly minor amendments of a procedural nature. It also proposes consequential amendments of the Senate Elections Act 1903-1948, the Senate Elections Act 1966 and the Representation Act 1903-1973. Taken overall, these various proposals are intended to allow for, firstly, a speedierfinalisationof federal election results; secondly, improved voting facilities for electors; thirdly, the introduction of some new or changed procedures; and, fourthly, the correction of some obvious defects in the existing electoral law. Australians can be justly proud of their electoral mapreservation of the voting entitlement of Auschinery. We have not suffered the electoral malpractices common in many other countries. However, Australian governments in the past have tended to become unduly complacent and sometimes have shirked the difficulties involved in any attempt to remedy defects in our electoral practices. This Bill amounts to one of the most comprehensive attempts ever made in this direction. The Bill is therefore far more substantial than that allowed to lapse in 1971 by the coalition government. In this second reading speech, I will be paying particular attention to those provisions which the Government regards as being of major importance. Though reference will also be made to some of the less substantial amendments, such references, of necessity, will be brief. I shall optional preferential marking of ballot-paper; printing of party affiliations of candidates on ballot-papers; registration of political parties for purposes of identification and printing of affiliations on ballot-papers; introduction of mobile polling booths at hospitals and similar institutions; drawing for positions of candidates on House ofRepresentatives ballot-papers; closing of the polls at 6 p.m. rather than 8 p.m.; requiring a candidate changing his name within 12 months prior to nominations to declare the change, and providing for the former name to be included on the ballot paper; prevention of persons enrolling or nominating for election under changed names in certain circumstances; an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and for the return of postal votes direct to respective returning officers; restricting postal vote application forms to be used at an election or referendum to those specified by notice in the Gazette; prohibiting the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in certain specified circumstances; providing postal voting facilities for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; increasing the amount of deposit required with nomination and varying the conditions under which deposits may be saved; tralian citizens posted overseas in the service of the Crown, and retention on the roll of the name of an elector temporarily absent from his address; precluding nomination for election to the Australian Parliament of a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory; prevention of a person from nominating as a candidate for more than one Federal election held on the same day: protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-vote cards; change in qualifications for enrolment, voting and candidature from 'British subject' to 'status of a British subject';",39,Defence Force Retirement And Death Benefits Pension Increases Bill 1974

Several of the more significant proposals contained in this Bill are intended, either in whole or in part, to enable the final result of a Federal election to be known more speedily than has been possible hitherto. One such proposal relates to the introduction of optional preferential marking of ballot-papers, which will result in a speedier count for Senate elections in particular. However, this intended modification to the existing exhaustive preferential voting system is also aimed at allowing electors the maximum degree of choice in exercising their democratic voting rights. Under the existing preferential system, each voter, irrespective of his individual wishes in the matter, is compelled to rank in order of preference all the candidates on the ballot paper, whether this requires the marking of only 2 squares or, as was the case in the most recent Senate election in New South Wales, not less than 73. This often means that an elector, in order to record a valid vote, is compelled to express a preference for candidates whom he may not know or for whom he has an extreme dislike. Faced with this meaningless, undemocratic requirement, many electors either intentionally failing to correctly mark all necessary squares on the ballot paper. Furthermore, during the scrutiny process, the time needed to check the validity of Senate ballot papers in particular causes excessive delays in finalising the result. The existing system of preferential voting has resulted in an average informal vote of about 10 per cent at normal Senate elections. Any voting system which leads to the disfranchisement of such a large number of electors should not be tolerated. It is therefore proposed to require an elector to mark his order of preference on the ballot paper only up to the number of candidates to be elected. However, and I cannot stress this point too strongly, an elector will retain the freedom to express a preference for as many additional candidates as he pleases. Supporters of one political party who wish to exchange preferences with the supporters of another will of course still be able to do so. As members will appreciate, the present system involves intolerable delays infinalisingthe election results. To abate this situation, the Bill contains several amendments affecting postal voting, two of which merit some comment here. Firstly, it is proposed that an earlier deadline be fixed for the return of postal votes. Secondly, it is proposed that postal votes be returned direct to the relevant returning officer, by the elector or his agent, rather than through an assistant returning officer, some other returning officer or a presiding officer as allowed under the existing law. At present, a period of 10 days' grace after polling day is allowed for the receipt of postal votes by the relevant returning officer, of votes posted direct to him. This practice presents many obstacles to any attempt to speed the count, especially for Senate elections. For instance, under the proportional representation system used for the Senate, the quota for an election cannot be determined, nor can the count commence, until the exact number of formal votes cast is known. At the recent Senate election, the precise number of formal votes was unknown until over 2 weeks after polling day. Therefore, not a single senator could be elected until about 3 weeks after polling day. While the proposed introduction of optional preferential marking of ballot papers will speed up the counting process, especially for the Senate, this advantage will be largely lost if it remains necessary to wait for posof writs, without any precise knowledge as to tal votes for up to 10 days after polling day. It is therefore proposed that postal votes be returned so as to reach the appropriate returning oincer not later than the close of the poll. As far as can be ascertained, no other country allows the admission of votes returned after polling day. This proposed legislation also takes a significant step forward in making it easier for aged and ill persons to exercise their franchise by the introduction of mobile polling booths at hospitals, rest homes and similar institutions. This reform will, at the same time, serve to minimise the possibility of the aged and infirm being subjected to unscrupulous practices on the part of overzealous campaign workers. Current practice provides for the establishment of a polling booth at each hospital or similar institution containing SO or more beds, where suitable arrangements can be made with the appropriate authorities. However, these booths are confined to fixed locations and, in practice, serve only staff and ambulant patients. Thus, in order to vote, patients conrelevant election, except in the case of an election fined to bed must at present make an application for a postal vote prior to polling day. Under the proposed reform the presiding officer, by arrangement with the appropriate authority at a hospital, institution or rest home, will take the ballot box from bed to bed and ward to ward. Of course, scrutineers will still be permitted to accompany polling officials. This Bill also makes provision for votes to be recorded at specially designated hospitals and institutions before polling day itself. Thus, the past practice of party workers invading such institutions for the apparent purpose of assisting postal voters should be largely eliminated. As the Government is particularly anxious, as I feel all honourable members are, to prevent unscrupulous persons taking advantage of aged or infirm electors, it is also proposed to prohibit the inspeccently where persons have sought enrolment as tion of postal vote applications for the purpose of listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes at an election, except where such listing is genuinely required in connection with an mquiry into possible malpractices. The Bill contains a further provision designed to eliminate the possibility of postal voting malpractices. Under a proposed provision, the only postal vote application forms which may be used at an election will be those specified or declared to be applicable by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer. This proposal is designed to curb the current dubious practice of having thousands of postal vote applications completed months in advance of the next ensuing election, then forwarding these to electors at or about the time of the issue whether the persons concerned are, in fact, entitled to vote by post. Another reform contained in this Bill, which I believe will be welcomed by all electors, relates to the printing of party affiliations of candidates on ballot papers. This measure will greatly simplify the voting process for electors, especially for the recent arrivals to this country who do not know the party affiliations of many of the candidates. The Government anticipates that one of the beneficial results of the printing of such affiliations on ballot papers will be a reduction in the level of informal voting, particularly when added to the introduction of optional preferential voting. This reform will necessitate the registration of political parties and provision is made accordingly in the Bill. For the purpose of recognition as a political party under these amendments, it is proposed that a party must have candidates officially nominated for not less than one-fourth of the vacancies to be filled at the to fill a casual Senate vacancy or a by-election for the House of Representatives. In these cases, a party must have had candidates officially nominated at the immediately preceding Senate or House ofRepresentatives election, in accordance with the formula specified. Another long overdue reform contained in this Bill provides for the drawing for positions of candidates on the House of Representatives ballot paper. This will remove the advantage taken by certain candidates in the past of changing their names in order to get top position on the House of Representatives ballot papers. It is also proposed that persons be prevented from enrolling or nominating under changed names in certain specified circumstances. Cases occurred re'A' (without any christian name), 'XXX' (without any christian name) and 'White Australia'. In one case, a person successfully enrolled as 'HBerrill (Surname) Stop Asian Immigration Now' (other names) and was a candidate in that name at the recent Senate election. thing about it is that she was not elected. The Senate is in enough trouble now.",40,Electoral Laws Amendment Bill

Under the provisions of the Bill a person may be nominated for election only in the name under which he is enrolled or, if he is not enrolled, in the name under which he is entitled to enrol. I now turn to another important area awaiting fore, just as it has been considered appropriate in reform, one which has been highlighted by the the past for a member of a State legislature to be most recent elections. I refer to the amounts of ineligible to stand for elecuon to the Australian deposit required to be lodged with nominations.

Although no specific debarment is ing of the poll will permit an earlier indication on mcluded in the existing law, it was surely never polling night of the possible result of an election intended that a person should have the right to and it will also ease the burden a little on the dual nomination and an appropriate provision is thousands of poll workers without, I believe, embodied in this Bill. inconveniencing the electors. It is already the practice in Queensland to close the polls at 6 p.m. In order to prevent any possible misunderstandat the possibility of a candidate assuming the ing, I must stress that people who, because of name of, say, a sitting member, primarUy for the their religious beliefs, are precluded from voting purpose of gaining some poUtical advantage at during certain hours will retain the right to apply an elecuon and thereby causing confusion in the for postal votes. This Bill also clarifies the circumstances under specified in the nomination paper shall be which an Australian citizen in the service of the printed on the ballot-paper, in addition to the Crown posted overseas may retain his right to name under which the candidate is actually vote at federal elections. Under the existing Act, nominated. This wUl not relate to a change of a person loses his enrolment entitlement if he name by marriage. ceases to live in the subdivision for which he is enrolled. This Bill now proposes that where a person, who is qualified for enrolment, is living donations and prizes by candidates to clubs or outside Australia as a result of a posting in the organisations within a specified period prior to service of Australia, a State or other prescribed polling day. Under the existing provisions it is an authority, he shall, if he has a fixed intention of offence for a candidate to make a gift or donation living in a particular subdivision when he returns to, say, a club within 3 months of polling day but to Ausualia, be entitled to enrol on the roll for he could be unwittingly in breach of the law by ofhis overseas address. I now refer to another aspect of the Bill which requires some clarification. At present there is doubt as to whether or not a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory could, without resigning his position on that body, also stand for a seat in the Australian Parliament. The Government believes that there should be no uncertainty in this matter. ThereProvision is also made in this Bill to prevent a the 1969 elections, a person stood as a candidate for the Senate election in South AustraUa, as well Some concern has been expressed in the past minds of electors. This Bill therefore makes provision so that any former name of a candidate Another provision in this BUl deals with gifts, making a gift or donation at a time which subsequently turns out to be within 3 months of polling day. To meet this situation, it is proposed to give a candidate a defence against a prosecution if he proves that, at the time when he made the gift, donation, prize etc. he believed on reasonable grounds that the polling would not be within 3 months. Two proposals concerning the appointment of Distribution Commissioners merit a brief reference. Firstly, given that it has not always been possible to obtain the services of the Surveyor-General of a State or an officer having similar qualifications for the purpose of redistributing a State, it is proposed to provide that one of the Commissioners shall be a registered surveyor, which will enable greater flexibility in the selection of a surveyor. Secondly, it is proposed that provision be made for the engagement of adequate staff to assist in the work of a distribution and that the fees and allowances paid to Distribution Commissioners and other such assisting staff shall, as is the practice now, be determined by the Minister. It is also proposed that the provisions relating to enrolment and nomination be amended so that the wording 'status of a British subject' is substituted for the term 'British subject'. The term 'British subject' is not defined in the existing Act, being governed by the provisions of the Austrahan Citizenship Act. Following amendments to that Act in 1969, the term 'British subject' is obsolete for these purposes, having been replaced by the wording 'the status of a British subject'. While a section of the Australian Citizenship Act makes it clear that that Act applies to the Electoral Act, the continued use of the term 'British subject' in the Commonwealth Electoral Act would be inappropriate and potentially confusing.

Australia The provisions in this Bill also revise and update many of the penalties, some of which have remained unchanged since Federation. There are a number of other provisions in this Bill which are mainly procedural in nature.

BILL 1974 Bill presented by Dr Patterson, and read a first highest in the world, a long-grain rice industry time. Second Reading Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (3.42)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a grant of mittee, established in 1973 on the initiative of the $3m to the Queensland Government towards the cost of constructing a weir on the Burdekin River near Clare in North Queensland. The Burdekin River basin, to the south and west of Townsville, is situated in the dry tropics of northern Queensland. It is the largest undeveloped river basin in Australia close to well developed infrastructure with an annual basin discharge estimated at 8.6 million megalitres (7 million acre feet). Only about 3.6 per cent of the total runoff is at present committed for industrial, urban and agricultural use. Eungella Dam on the Broken River, with a economic evaulation of Clare Weir and its storage capacity of 131,000 megalitres (106,000 associated development indicates a sound return acre feet) and Gorge and Blue Valley weirs on to private and public investment on the basis of the Burdekin River with a combined storage of conservative assumptions on commodity prices, 12,600 megalitres (10,200 acre feet) are the only especially in relation to the current state of the inexisting surface water storages in the basin and ternational sugar and grains markets. No untheir assured yield is fully committed.

Rainfall is the major limitation to agricultural production in the area and supplementary irrigation would secure the efficient production of a large range of crops, thereby considerably enhancing the flexibility of the agricultural economy in the region. Sugar yields on the already established cane farms in the region are among the has made good progress over recent years, and the potential for establishing a viable soybean industry has been demonstrated at the Millaroo Research Station under simulated commercial conditions. Other possible enterprises of economic significance are seed beans, horticulture, maize and cattle production. The Federal-State Burdekin Project ComAustralian Government, is at present assessing the potential for development of resources of the basin for industrial, urban and agricultural development, for power generation and for flood mitigation. A request from the Queensland Government for financial assistance for the Urannah Dam-Clare Weir proposals was first made in 1971 and renewed to the present Government with a high order of priority. The Department of Northern Development, with assistance from State departments and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, carried out a comprehensive appraisal of the proposal. The The development which would be based on large enough to make a significant contribution to the stability of flows in the lower Burdekin upstream concrete cut-off to bedrock.

96,Debate (On Motion By Mr Mcleay),"steel shutters about 2 metres in height will be installed to provide the required storage of 15,500 megalitres-12,600 acre feet-and to allow the passage of major floods in the river. In conjunction with unregulated flows, the weir would assure a supply of some 25,000 megalitres-20,00 0 acre feet-for agricultural use on some 2000 and 3000 hectares-5000 to 7500 acres. Clare Weir is estimated to cost $3.4m and the associated pumping, reticulation, drainage and other ancillary works $1.2m. Escalation over the construction period would probably bring the total cost to $5.8m. Clare Weir represents the first significant step in a partnership with the State in the development of the Burdekin Basin. While the programme of studies in progress under the supervision of the Burdekin Project Committee might eventually indicate a range of development options to meet the needs of industry, agriculture, mining and so on, Clare Weir would be an essential regulatory component of any plan for using water released from a major storage on the river system for agriculture along the lower Burdekin or for reticulation to urban and industrial areas along the coast. Clare Weir can, in fact, berightlyregardedas a pilot scheme for future development of the vast resources of the Burdekin Basin. The full development of theresourcesof the Burdekin Basin will be of a long-term nature with considerable national significance for industrial and regional development. It is now over 25 years since the first bold concept of a development plan for the Burdekin Basin was conceived and had the support of the Chifley Government. Clare Weir will now provide the first impetus from an Australian Government in this direction. I commend the Bill to honourable members. adjourned. Bill presented by Dr Patterson, and read a first before the next wet season. The works are time. Second Reading Dr PATTERSON (Dawson-Minister for total estimated cost of $300,000. Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (3.49)I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The purpose of this Bill is to enable a grant of up further Australian Government assistance for the to $120,000 to be made available to Queensland complete flood mitigation scheme will be confor the construction of urgently needed flood sidered when the detailed investigations are mitigation works on the Proserpine River. The completed. In keeping with the Australian grant is conditional upon matching expenditure being provided by the Queensland Government and the Proserpine River Improvement Trust on the basis of 40 per cent Federal, 40 per cent State and 20 per cent local authority contributions and is consistent with the Government's overall approach to the problem of flood mitigation. Following the extensive and disastrousfloodswhich occurred throughout Queensland earlier this year, the Australian Government offered to undertake investigations jointly with the Queensland Government for the preparation of a State-wide plan on flood mitigation. The Australian Government's intention was that such a plan could form the basis of consideration for financial assistance. The Queensland Government, in responding to this approach, indicated that one of the works which was considered most urgent involved a flood mitigation scheme for the Proserpine River. In the past, land-owners along the Proserpine River have constructed levee banks to protect their properties, but the capacity of the middle and lower reaches of the river are inadequate to contain even floods which are estimated to occur once every 3 years. The town of Proserpine and adjacent rural areas are therefore likely to be flooded relatively frequently and a scheme for diverting flood waters upstream of the town has been proposed. Detailed investigations of the complete scheme are still in progress and I have arranged for the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to provide expert advice on the proposed scheme. Thefloodsof January 1974 created an urgent situation by damaging some levee banks and greatly eroding an existing natural floodwater 'break-out', with the result thatfloodingcaused considerable damage to property and crops. This has created the need for urgent restoration of the damaged works before the next wet season to prevent further widespread damage from even a minor flood. The Australian Government has considered assistance for these restoration works as a matter or urgency to facilitate construction already in progress and include reinstatement of the damaged levee banks and the provision of better control at the floodwater 'break-out' at a This Bill will enable the Australian Government to provide funds towards the cost of construction of these urgent works.

100,Debate (On Motion By Mr Mcleay),"making the contribution of $807,905 the Australian Government is confident that the States will meet their commitments to the water quality assessment program so that the objectives endorsed by the Water Resources Council may be achieved. The proposed legislation does not, of course, cover the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory as it is expected that these will be provided for in appropriations for the Department of the Northern Territory and the Department of the Capital Territory respectively. It was originally intended that these grants would be available to the States prior to the commencement of the 1974-75 financial year. However, due to unforeseen delays brought about by the election in May 1974, the Bill has been held over until now. Despite this, the Australian Government has decided to make available the full amount requested by the States for the remainder of this financial year. I turn now to the Bill itself, which is in the form of amendments to the States Grants (Water Resources Measurement) Act 1973. Section4 provides for an amendment to section 3 of the principal Act to set out the scope of the word 'Assessment' so that it now includes water quality measurement in addition to water quantity measurement. The Bill also amends the machinery provisions of the principal Act by altering the provisions for the submission of progress reports. Thus, it can be seen that sections 8 (1) (b) and 8(l)(c) allow the States an extra month in which to submit their reports. This is considered necessary due to the increase in the number of State departments that will be involved in collecting the extra data and also the increase in the data itself. Provisions for increases in the grants of financial assistance related to State expenditure is provided for by sections 9 and 10 which amend Schedules 1 and 2 of the principal Act. These increases in grants have been allocated between the States on the basis of thenown proposed programs. In order to implement a planned program in the water field for the conservation, development and proper management of Australia's water resources it is essential that a national water quality assessment program be implemented in conjunction with the present water quantity measurement program to provide the necessary basic data. The program of water quality assessment which forms the basis for this Act and in which all Governments in Australia will be participating has been devised with this end in view. Such a program was in fact envisaged in the water policy statement that the Minister for Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass) released on 10 October 1973. I now have pleasure in commending the Bill to the House. adjourned. Bill presented by Dr Everingham, and read a first time. Second Reading Dr EVERINGHAM (Capricornia-Minister for Health) (4.3)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to correct some anomalies in connection with the conditions of employment of staff of the River Munay Commission. An almost identical Bill was passed by this House in March this year but lapsed when the double dissolution occurred before it was debated in the Senate. Because the River Murray Waters Act preceded the Officers' Rights Declaration Act and the Superannuation Act, there have been problems in the application of those Acts to staff of the River Murray Commission. Furthermore, the Commission is not an agency of the Australian Government. The proposed amendments will ensure that members of the Australian Government services will not be disadvantaged if they obtain employment with the River Murray Commission, and will enable staff recruited by the Commission from other sources, who are not covered by superannuation elsewhere, to be covered by the Superannuation Act 1922-1973. In addition, under the Remuneration Act 1973, salaries of statutory officers are now to be determined by that Tribunal. Section6 in the River Murray Waters Act is being amended accordingly, although under present conditions no salaries are payable to the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. I would stress that this Bill deals with amendments to the River Murray Waters Act which refers only to the Australian Government, and does not affect the River Murray Waters Agreement in which the 3 River Murray States are also involved. In addition, I should mention that a good deal of thought is being given to much more extensive amendments to the River Murray administration, but these must be expected to take a good deal of time to develop, and in the meantime it is desired to correct existing anomalies in staff conditions. I have much pleasure in commending the Bill to the house.",52,States Grants Water Resources Assessment Bill 1974

Malak Primary and Pre-school, Darwin Housing and Construction) (4.5)I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1974, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: Construction of Malak primary and pre-school at Darwin. The proposal is for the construction of a facility for 800 primary and 100 pre-school students to serve the subdivision area of Malak in Darwin. The school will have the following major elements of accommodation which are planned to achieve optimum functional relationships: Administrative, library/resources centre, learning areas, multi-purpose areas, pre-school. The building will be constructed of steel columns supporting steel rafters, with non-loadbearing external concrete block walls and coloured steel deck roofing. Lightweight internal partitions will be installed, and carpets and acoustic ceilings will be used to reduce the general noise level. The building will be air conditioned andfireprotection systems will be installed. The building design utilises verandahs with wide roof overhangs to reduce glare and the load on the air conditioning system. The site will be landscaped. The estimated cost of the proposd work is $2.8m at October 1974 prices. I table plans of the proposed work. Question resolved in the affirmative. Central Hospital Service Complex, Australian Capital Territory Housing and Construction) (4.8)I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1974, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: Construction of a proposed warehouse and workshop as stage 2 development of the central hospital service complex in the A.CT. The proposal is stage 2 of the development proposed to supply eventually the support services needs in a central facility for all present and future hospitals and other health institutions in the Australian Capital Territory. The proposal involves construction of a warehouse, workshop and minor other facilities. Construction will consist of reinforced concrete floors with triangulated steel space frame roof structures, supported in the warehouse on reinforced concrete columns, and in the workshop on perimeter steel columns, external walls will be concrete blockwork, with metal framed windows, metal deck roofing, and metal fascias. Certain areas will be air conditioned with the main warehouse area heated. Reticulated systems such as compressed air, etc., will be provided to the workshop. Roads and car parks will be integrated with the stage 1 works, as will landscaping of the area around the stage 2 proposal. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $2.35m at July 1974 prices. I table plans for the proposed work. Question resolved in the affirmative. AIR NAVIGATION BILL 1974 Bill presented by Mr Charles Jones, and read a first time. Second Reading for Transport) (4.10)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Frequently since attaining office this Government has drawn attention to the vast gulf between the cost of providing, operating and maintaining our aviation infrastructure, and the revenue received for the use of the various facilities. In 1973-74 the cost to provide, operate and maintain Australia's airport and airways systems amounted to $ 140m. Only $75m or 54 per cent pf that amount was recovered. The Australian taxpayer, rather than the users, was called upon to meet the $65m deficit. This Government intends to increase substandally the rate of recovery from the users and, indeed, already has embarked on such a program. There is absolutely no justification for continuing the heavy subsidy support of the general aviation industry which makes heavy demands on aviation facilities and on the funds to provide and maintain them. Special aerodromes for general aviation aircraft, Archerfield, Bankstown, Jandakot, Essendon, Moorabbin and Parafield, have been provided in all capital cities-by the taxpayer. Last year, these aerodromes alone cost $10m to operate and maintain. In addition, faculties have been provided at other aerodromes largely for general aviation aircraft, things like light aircraft aprons and taxiways, traffic control andflightservice units, communications and fire units. Yet our total recovery from the general aviation industry including air navigation charges, commercial revenue and aviation fuel tax amounted to less than $4.5m, a recovery rate of only 44 per cent. The Government sees no reason why all sectors of the aviation industry should not pay their way",53,River Murray Waters Bill 1974

In 1960 the then Liberal-Country Party Government adopted a long term policy for ultimate full recovery of costs of air transport faciliexpended by the Department to achieve this. For ties provided by Government However, no target date for achieving the objective was set. This Government decided last year to set a target date and to accelerate the cost recovery program. It was then announced that an 80 per cent recovery rate was to be attained by 1978. In the first year following the announcement the recovery rate was increased from 49 per cent to 54 per cent. This was achieved, with the co-operation of industry, by both increasing revenue within the statutory limitations where they apply and by a more efficient allocation of resources through a vigorous pruning of costs wherever possible. By continuing to pursue this policy the Government will achieve a balanced, co-ordinated transport system. Resources will be properly allocated on the demonstrated needs of the community and a system will be developed in which each transport mode performs the role best suited to it. In this way the maximum benefit will accrue to the nation. While this policy caters for 80 per cent recovery of the costs attributable to the provision, operation and maintenance of the airport and airways systems attention has also been focused on the cost to the Government of providing the many other services for which no charge is made. Therefore, consistent with the cost recovery policy and also with the broader policy that the user should pay, the Government has recently decided to introduce fees and charges for a wide variety of other services provided to the aviation industiy by the Air Transport Group of the Department of Transport. The Air Navigation Bill 1974 enables the Air for many other services provided by the DepartNavigation Act to be amended to provide authment. The specific services mentioned are illusority for fees and charges to be imposed through trative only. It is further intended that the full the Air Navigation Regulations.

As would be expected traUan Air Force for relatively short periods. this general description embraces various types of differing services which are too extensive to describe fully. This country has sustained an enviable air safety record over a long period. Much effort and financial resources have been example, considerable effon has been directed to ensuring that proficiency is attained and maintained by both pilots and operators. It is now proposed to charge for services provided in the issue of flight crew and air service licences. Similarity, it is proposed to introduce charges for the many services provided in respect of airworthiness matters. These charges will include appUcation fees for such services as the issue or variation of certificates ofregistration,the issue or renewal of certificates of airworthiness, the issue of certificates of type approval in respect of a type of aircraft or aircraft component. Authorities intending to erect buildings on Government aerodromes are required to first obtain the Department's approval to ensure that siting considerations are met and that the proposed buUding meets both structural and architectural standards. It is proposed that applicants for such approvals be required to pay a fee in a simUar manner to the buUding permit fee imposed by local councUs. In the case of aerodromes owned and operated by local authorities, private individuals or business undertakings, a licence is issued by the Department before the aerodrome can be made available for public use. The issue of the licence is preceded by consultation concerning the standard of aerodrome and inspection of the site to determine that the Department's standards have been met in order to ensure that the aerodrome is suitable and safe for the proposed operations. It is proposed to charge for this service. It is intended, of course, to charge Another significant effect of this Bill is to In recent years privately owned civil aircraft These aircraft have beenflownby members of the Defence Forces in the course of their duties for such purposes as flying training and surveys. In accordance with the Air Navigation Act 1920-1973 these aircraft are 'state aircraft' as defined and, except where the Act makes an express reference, are not subject to the Act. Difficulties have arisen, and would continue to arise, in such circumstances. Particular problems have involved maintenance, pilot licensing and investigation of accidents. For instance, the Defence Force has been expected to institute its own maintenance procedures for hired aircraft. Notwithstanding this, on the return of the aircraft to civil operations, its airworthiness could be in question due to the possible consequences of its time spent beyond the control of the Act and the Regulations. Therefore, it is most desirable that the provisions of the Air Navigation Regulations should continue to apply to civil registered aircraft which are under the temporary control of the Defence Force by virtue of a contract of hire or charter and are beingflownby members of the Defence Force in the course of their duties. On the other hand, honourable members may be assured, if an aircraft is hired or chartered by a part of the Defence Force for a lengthy period, or if for any special reason it is desirable that it should not be subject to the provisions of the Air Navigation Regulations while under hire or charter, the registration of the aircraft can be cancelled on the application of the owner. The aircraft will then be under the complete control of the service department concerned. The opportunity has also been taken to substitute, in the Air Navigation Act and the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act, references to 'Director-General of Department of Civil Aviation' by 'Secretary to the Department of Transport', and 'the Commonwealth' by'Australia'. I commend the Bill. adjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 October, on motion by Mr Les Johnson: That the Bill be now read a second time. Housing and Construction)Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this BillI would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Housing Agreement Bill 1974 as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, that the House permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate. the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. sition certainly agrees with the idea of considering these 2 Bills together. Let me say at the outset that the Opposition does not intend to oppose either of them. One Bill seeks to introduce certain amendments to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement which was negotiated last year. We will support those amendments. The other Bill seeks to arrange for the transmission of funds to finance this Agreement. I think that at least one State-probabl y more than one State-ha s already passed complementary legislation. For this reason the Opposition agrees that it is important that these BUls be passed as quickly as possible. The fact that amendments are now necessary, so soon after the original agreement was negotiated, supports the views which we have expressed and which the various State Housing Ministers have expressed that the 1973 Agreement was no improvement on earlier agreements. In fact, it was generally accepted on our side of the House that it was a retrograde step. Under the 1945 original agreement-and those operating while we were in government-the concessional rate of interest was related to the long-term bond rate. In operation the interest charge under the 1945 agreement was pegged at 3 per cent although the long-term bond rate rose from 3V4 per cent in 1945 to 5 per cent in 1956. The concessional rate while we were in government-to be fair I will say 'with minor exceptions'-wa s always maintained at 1 per cent below the long-term bond rate. I beheve that the concessional gap which exists today of 4 per cent and even 5 per cent is grossly out of balance. Mr Les Johnson-Was it too big? ment this tie with the long-term bond rate was abandoned. Advances to the State Housing Authorities and to the home builders accounts from which loans are made to co-operative building societies and, in the State of South Austraha, State banks, werefixedat 4 per cent and 4Vi per cent respectively.

Although not formal, the guidelines were clear enough, and overtime was never included in the applicant's income.

The third proposed amendment alters the Agreement to make it possible for supplementary advances to be negotiated during a financial year. This suggestion, as the Minister will well remember, was also made by the State Ministers and was also turned down flat by him.

However, with some ofhis typically quick footwork, he has been able to predict the change and make it look as though it came about by his own initiative.

Just6 or 8 weeks ago he was talkchurns out daily and which are frequently picked money they can use to bund more homes for the lower income earners. I am sure that he will nod low incomes. PerhapsI should put them in the form of questions. In this regard I think that we Statistics from the Taxation Office are always 2 years old and are quite irrelevant. I put it to the Minister, without trying to score any political points from him, that this area of the activities of the Bureau of Statistics should be, to use an expression, jazzed up. No matter which party is in Government it cannot make a proper assessment if it does not know how many people it is catering for. Let us think in terms of a rough graph on which the peak is the average weekly wage. We do not know how many of the people on the left of it go down to, say, $70 or $80 a week and we do not know how many people are on the longer, tapering out line on the right which goes up to $210 a week. I have mentioned thosefiguresdeliberately. The way in which the legislation is drafted people on 95 per cent of the average national weekly wage will receive this low interest money. But we do not know how many there are. We do know that they will get this money at an interest rate of 5% per cent. If a person is on $ 120 a week or, in the case of South Australia, $110 a weekbeing a South Australian you will appreciate this point, Mr Deputy Speaker-and has been for the last 6 months he can borrow at 5A per cent interest but if he is on $ 121 a week in the case of the nationalfigure,or $ 111 a week in the case of the South Australianfigure,he will be lucky if he can borrow anything but if he can he could have to borrow at all sorts of rates of interest including up to 12 per cent from a building society. SoI ask the Minister to take this matter up with the Special Mimster of State( Mr Lionel Bowen), who, I believe, now administers the Bureau of Statistics. I do not believe that this arbitrary cut-off figure is fair in any way whatsoever. The Government makes a great deal of poUtical capital out of the fact that it is supplyingfinanceto low income earners, but I suggest that not very many of the people in the community who are earning $110 a week in the case of South AustraUa or $120 in the case of the national figure wUl be able to take advantage of this low interest money because they still have to overcome the deposit gap. I would Uke the Mimster to teU me whether it is possible to buy a house anywhere in Sydney for $20,000. Is it possible? It is certainly not possible in most of the places to which I have been. If one can buy a house for $20,000 and one can borrow the money at the rate of 5% per cent interest one has still to overcome the deposit gap of $5000. Of course, it is more Ukely to be $8,000 or $10,000. I do not know whether the Minister is interested in this problem, but it seems to me to be the nub of the issue of the Government's making money avaUable to low income famUies. It is no good making it avaUable if they cannot use it. Another problem which is related to this matter and which affects not only people on low incomes but also people on aU sorts of incomes is the cost of buUding. I do not think that the Minister is going to make any effort to acknowledge my comments at this moment because he is at present conducting an animated conversation, although presumably he is interested in the matters in which I am interested. I have had a question on notice since, I think, 7 July about the cost ofhousing. I cannot understand why the Minister does not answer it, although I could hazard a guess. Perhaps he wUl give some sort of indication by way of nodding his head. Taking the cost of housing as revealed by the consumer price indexfigures,it does appear as though the cost qf buUding a modest dwelling for about $20,000 is escalating faster than the national average wage. WhUe the cost of housing is going up at this rate and the deposit gap is widening how can the people he claims to be helping with low interest 3 money get any advantage? The Minister does not seem to be interested in answering that question either. At some stage I should like the Minister also to indicate what he believes wUl be the shortfaU of houses because Opposition members believe that at this moment the shortfaU is at least 50,000 and by thistimenext year could be as high as 150,000 or 160,000, which represents one year's supply of dwelling units throughout AustraUa. I feel sorry for the Minister that in the short time he has held this portfolio he has presided over the destruction of the buUding industry and has adversely affected the possibUity of people ever achieving home ownership. This will not be a pleasant label for him to have to wear for the rest of his life in Opposition. The Minister asked me to give him the benefit of the Opposition's views on the question of interest rates. I have already told him that I do not believe that concessional rates are a good thing in the long term, but there is really a jungle in the interest rate situation in AustraUa today. I do not know how any young person or any person about to buy a home can manage. People do not know where to go to seek information or just what to do. One of our poUcy initiatives in government will be to set up a housing guidance bureau. Mr Kevin Cairns-That is a good idea. It shows great imagination. because this policy proposal for a housing guidance bureau was the brain child of my colleague from the Lilley electorate in Queensland. When we are returned to government we will see that its establishment becomes a fact. However, let us examine the variations in interest rates. The Minister has provided a concessional interest rate of 5% per cent. In South Australia even if people are able to bridge the deposit gapI suggest that not many can these days-ther e is an 8-months delay for a new home and a 2-years delay for a lived-in home at the concessional rate of 5% per cent. The next interest rate is 6% per cent which is that which applies to loans to qualified people from the terminating building societies and the Savings Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of South Australia. This relates to people who have an income in excess of $109.50.1 cannot tliink of any more effective way to make all Australians equal than the way in which this Government has messed up interest rates. As I said, 6% per cent is the rate from those banks in South Australia for people who are above the 95 per cent income figure. I should imagine this rate applies to terminating societies throughout Australia. A person in South Australia who wishes to negotiate a loan goes to a bank. His gross income is assessed. The bank takes into account the amounts involved in his first and second mortgage repayments, his hire purchase commitments and his rates and taxes, which are escalating at an inconceivable rate under the Dunstan Government. If, after these amounts are deducted, the person has a surplus of $55 a week he can negotiate a loan of $15,000 which, I believe, is to be increased to $17,500. But that person still has to raise sufficient bridging finance to meet the deposit. With private banks interest rates are from 10 per cent to 11 per cent according to the value of a property. For lower priced properties one can negotiate loans at lower rates of interest. If a perhatred. One can almost sense in their words at son lives on the property he is entitled to a lower rate of interest. I have already mentioned rates of 5% per cent, 6% per cent, 10 per cent and 11V4 per cent. This is not a bad splash of different interest rates. The most favoured rate with the Commonwealth Bank is 9Vi per cent. The poor old permanent co-operative societies provide loans at 11% and 12 per cent. The last time. I checked, bridging finance-if you can get itcommanded an interest rate of 19Vi per cent. The interest structure is an absolute maze. This Government will cause more and more trouble for itself by messing about with the interest strucvice, the details of which have already been cirture and by messing about also with concessional rates of interest which I do not believe should ever apply in the housing industiy. The Government is talking of injecting more money into the banks but we do not know how this is to be done. Probably the Minister does not know yet and I doubt whether the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) knows. How is money injected into the banks? Will the banks get it from the Reserve Bank? If so, what will be the rate of interest? I am referring now to the Prime Minister's statement of last night. Mr Les Johnson-We will introduce legislation. the Minister dollars to doughnuts that it will be at a concessional rate of interest-a t yet another rate of interest to add to the rates I have already listed. Perhaps the Minister is not yet in a position to say what that rate will be but until we can get away from this proliferation of interest rates I think the future for home builders and home seekers will be bleak. We do not oppose the amendments; we support the legislation. with interest to the previous speaker, the honourpity that over and over again members of the Opposition concentrate an attack on creating division and divisiveness and in trying to present a picture of continual acrimony and bitterness between various levels of government. This is something on which their ideology is baseda class society. They cannot accept that government within Australia and the management of our nation are matters in which all Australians should participate and in respect of which there should be a common objective. The bitterness of having been defeated in 1972 and again a few months ago has not been digested by members opposite. They do Australia and the people of Australia a great disservice by continually presenting a picture of bitterness and of almost times the hatred they have developed towards Canberra. They forget that most of what happens in Canberra was developed, enlarged and expanded upon in policies laid down during their 23 years of administration. It seems almost a betrayal of their own actions to continue along on that course. The honourable member for Boothby spoke about the establishment of the housing advisory bureau.

It is alien to their pollittle itical nature to advocate responsible action. There are some other comments made by the and former member for Wentworth in that debate operations which are worth drawing to mind. They relate tocommodation which is what AustraUa badly needs overall. the emphasis which the 1973 Housing AgreeThose comments were made not by a member of ment gave to the building up of a stock of rental accommodation for those sections of the comthe Government but by a then member of the munity unable to afford their own homes.

We heard the honourable member for Agreement Boothby emphasising this when he talked about the concessional rates of interest for home building.

Again, this is in contrast to the picture another. This is arequirementwhich is most acutely felt which the previous speaker tried to conjure up of amongst the lower income groups. I do not believe that the housing commissions run by the States, which differ very acrimony and argument between the Australian basic problem. That is more rental accommodation, parhousing, for the lower income group. Unfortunately, housing for rental has declined for a number of reasons, tion that this is what they want to do above all.

It should be used to improve the lot of the lower sorbed altogether too much of their total resources. Every house which the housing commissions build and merely rent freezes their funds for a long time and they do not get the joy degrees misapplied. For instance, many houses sold by capital gains for their purchasers. There is a great contrast between the automobiles and the other exhibits of wealth which surround many housing commission homes the incomes of those within them. In this field I believe that the Minister is right in tilting the housing commission much more towards the provision of rental acwho was a former Minister for Housin the Liberal-Country Party Administration a former Treasurer of that Government. He made those only 17 months ago. We on this side gives to rental accommodation and Government's commitment to assisting ownership is also underlined by the year of preventing the allocation of additional Mimster for Housing and the respective State Ministers. I repeat that the latest amendment to the legislation has been agreed to by all State Ministers as a sensible and responsible approach to take. It is a pity that the Liberal-Country Party the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr members of the State parliaments cannot pass over to their opposites in this place some of the capacity to have dialogue with the Australian Government. I also applaud the exclusion of overtime from a person's income in determining his eligibility for a Home Builders Account loan, which has been made in response to representations from the co-operative terminating society movement. I also welcome the undenaking given by the Minister, and agreed to by all Housing Ministers at their meeting on 11 October to look at a new formula to establish eligibility within the means test under the agreement. As honourable members will know, the percentage of average weekly earnings used under the agreement is based on the December quaner ngures-traditionall y the highest for the year. In an inflationary situation v however this is no longer necessarily the case. As a result it is possible that a person who qualifies in the December quaner, might lose his eligibility during the year but become eligible again in the next December quaner. By establishing a new basis the obvious difficulties caused for some people will be overcome. I also want to congratulate the Government on under this BUl at 4 per cent to State housing the significant moves taken to reverse the very reauthorities and at 4% per cent for the Home cent decline in building industry activity.

The intention to increase the proportion contains sound and simple common sense and of funds that can be allocated to the Home which any government ought to follow if it had any common sense. A number of points which were touched on by Morris), who has just spoken in the debate, and by the honourable member for Boothby deserve at least passing comment. If there is an umbrella which covers the administration of any housing agreement or any housing policy, that umbrella has to consist of the experience of interest rates in a country. The level of interest rates is one aspect of economic and social life which cannot escape our concern. There are 2 areas of Australian economic life where one cannot pass the buck any further. One is our balance of payments position and once that is in serious jeopardy something has to be done. The other area, which applies in a domestic sense, is interest rates. If the level of interest rates is unsatisfactory something should be done about them. In many ways this BUl is a reflection of the concern the Government has about rising interest rates in Australia. The Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr Les Johnson) is to be congratulated for one or two features of the agreement which he was able to obtain through his own party last year. The fact that he was able to obtain money at an interest rate of 4 per cent is a very great achievement and he deserves to be congratulated for it.

127,Mr Kevin Cairns (Lilley) (5.7),"I wish to mortar but in the sense of families wanting toBuilders Account is very welcome. IfI may mention a little piece of history, this proposal is almost a repetition of the great battle that Senator Spooner had away back in 1956 when he sought to get an adequate proportion of funds made available for the Home Builders Account for use by the co-operative terminating building societies. On that occasion the argument was, and I believe that the argument remains now, that money spent through these sources is spent more efficiently than money spent through the other sources of funds that are available for welfare housing. Money made available through the Home Builders Account will be well and efficiently utilised and will give a maximum return. I have only one doubt in this regard, and that arises from the fact that co-operative terminating building societies are scattered very sparsely throughout Australia. I hope that the State Ministers will utilise the flexibility contained in this Bill and will allocate more money to these areas because no doubt they are aware of the fact that there are many large cities, especially large provincial cities, which are inadequately served by terminating building societies. I hope that the Minister for Housing and Construction will prevail upon the State Ministers to use the facilities available to their own departments to take up the slack. I come to a second feature of the Bill which has do not comprehend the essential measure of povbeen applauded so far, but which disguises some erty which has to be available and disposable very great difficulties that will be put upon the family income, according to circumstances. State authorities. I refer to the imposition of the needs test. Immediately one says that one does not think the needs test should be imposed by a ing I hesitated to interfere in imposing a means central government, there is a response from test because I judged then, as I judge now, that people such as the honourable member for those officers in State housing commissions, Shortland such as: 'Well, of course, you are not trusts or authorities who are dealing with cases interested in the poor'. But that is absolute nonindividually are better able to judge relative sense. The imposition of a needs test from Canneeds. Any monetary criteria which are bena on State authorities which have to adminisattempted to be imposed from this place have to ter these funds can cause a very great injustice. I fall into serious error. They put people in the would like to give honourable members a couple same circumstances who are not in the same cirof examples. To relate the needs test to 95 per cumstances. They advantage some and disadcent of average weekly earnings of the main vantage others. I recollect that the Tasmanian income earner of a family forgets that the criGovernment was always concerned to make its terion for determining need used by the Henderown judgments and to set its own criteria in this son Commission and by every other inquiry into area. I suggest that a return to that kind of situpoverty or relative affluence in a community is a ation would not be a disadvantage to the Bill. family income. As far as I can see, that essential criterion is needs, but in trying to develop and to set criteria being put aside and ignored altogether in respect I think he is setting himself an almost impossible of the needs test which is being imposed under task. I do not suggest for one moment these this Bill. For example, does the Government sugmeasures have been taken out of ill will, a lack of gest that in a time of rising unemployment a famconcern or a lack of sensitivity as to what is ily which hitherto had 2 income earners and needed in these areas, but I suggest that unless which now has only one income earner who receives say 85 per cent of average earnings and whose wife is unemployed, is not in a different position and that for all practical purposes the needs test applying to this family has not altered? Of course it has. The status of that family has altered. The income available to that family has altered. But yet, as I understand it, and as implied by the needs test, there is no change. So in a time of rising unemployment-seriousl y rising unemployment-the needs test is rather torn to pieces in this respect. I believe that the needs test is torn to pieces in another respect. An allowance of $2 per week is given for each child above two in a family. I am not sure what the calculation is concerning the needs test at the moment. However, say it is $ 100 or 95 per cent of average weekly earningsI think that this was the figure at the December quarter. This would be the level of a needs test for a family consisting of a man, his wife and 2 children. Are we to say that if a family has 6 children and the needs test moves up to $ 108 a week that family is in exactly the same position as a family on $100 a week with 2 children? That is the implication of the needs test. That runs contrary to the eminent common sense utilised by Professor Henderson in the principles of his own reports on poverty. People who try to impose a needs test like this make a very grave error and For thatreasonwhen I was Minister for HousWhileI say this I do not want to criticise the Minister. He has a concern for poverty and for proper many other criteria are used by its very nature the legislation is wrong. Children cannot be kept on $2 a week, and to make distinctions of that nature is to make a mistake. I have one further characteristic to add. It still another area. Savings banks make funds availseems that Hargreave's Law applies with respect to the family situation and it still seems that families with more than the average number of children tend to be poorer families. This operates particularly in the area in which these housing commissions are involved. I refer to the less wellto-do families in Australian life. I ask the Minister to consider this matter. I in no way mean it to be other than an objective comment while discussing this matter. Since discussion has been entered into in a passing manner on other housing policies, I stress that the difficulties of implementing this Bill reflect the difficulties that are occurring in the other areas of Australian life. I suggest that many more people will be shunted into making appeals for housing commission money than would hitherto have been the case. Savings bank interest rates cannot be altered without making variations in this area. Availability of money from finance companies cannot be altered without putting people into these areas. The same applies to permanent building societies. One of the tragedies that has occurred in respect of housing during the past 12 months I believe has been the activities of some savings banks as they affect those who apply for housing commission loans, agreements orfinance.Over the past year the Commonwealth Savings Bank on all the available criteria, has attempted to impose its own credit squeeze on funds available for housing in Australia. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation report shows that it has quite clearly entered into money market and bond buying activities to an extent that has never hitherto occurred in Australian life. The Savings Bank which was developed to assist housing, was not set up for that reason. bank. member for Boothby, who has an mtimate understanding of all these things, says, it is supposed to be the people's bank. The Commonwealth Savings Bank became a principal buyer of government bonds in order to keep up the demand for bonds on the market. Insofar as it did that its own proportion of assets which it made available for housing fell to a very low level and fell continually during 1973-74. The private savings banks, on the other hand, raised the proportion of their own assets which was appropriated to housing. That affects this Bill because funds not available to people in one area will cause people to apply for funds in able to people who are just a little above criteria usually set for people who apply for funds from housing commissions and funds which are made available through this housing agreement. This fact cannot be ignored. As I said earlier, the ripple effects in one area of the interest rate market affect every other area of the market, and certainly in this area. One of the other tragic consequences of what has happened, because a credit squeeze has been maintained in respect of reasonable interest rate housing funds available, has been that for the first year ever, I believe, more funds were made available and had to be sought through finance companies for these fields than from savings banks. That situation has never applied before. The difference in interest rates between savings banks and finance companies of 4 per cent, 5 per cent, 6 per cent or 7 per cent means a penalty to borrowers of $ 10, $15 or $20 more a week because they are driven to finance companies. The consequences cannot be ignored. FinallyI return to the precise content of this Bill and the agreement which has been proposed. The Bill, insofar as it deals with interest rates of 4 per cent and 4% per cent, is very generous. I do not know the kind of battle the Minister had, but if he can get interest rates down to that level he should be applauded for doing so. It is a very commendable achievement. I remind him that this Bill and this agreement cannot stand alone. Those people to whom funds will be available are those to whom funds are not available from permanent building societies, savings banks and finance companies. The Bill also relates to those people who are unable to pay the rates of interest required from each of the other levels of Australian life. I return to the second point I made. I think it is an appropriate proposal. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the details of the needs test which he requires, the relation of that needs test in terms of growing unemployment in Australia and the essential criteria for determining the position of a family's income. I suggest that unless the Minister puts many more variables into the testI do not believe he can rightly do so-it may be best to leave the determination of those who should be able to apply for these funds to the goodwill, the sense of tradition and the judgment of State housing authorities.

I remind the House that the Opposition has been strangely silent on this scheme. I would like to hear what Opposition members have to say about it. They denigrated it, of course, when it was first proposed and compared it with the housing grant that was given previously, but I have not heard very much from them lately. The reason is quite obvious; our new scheme is much better and provides much more. I believe that, once and for all, the Opposition members should state unequivocally whether this scheme would be one of their victims of the expenditure cutbacks which they have been proposing.

135,Mr Corbett (Maranoa) (5.40),"The OpThat is surely the desirable and legitimate objective of every Australian. At any rate it is in the opinion of honourable members on this side of the House. It is contended by people with expertise in the field that a person should earn $10 a week for every $1,000 he borrows to buy a home. So even a $20,000 loan would require an income of $200 a week. How many of the people this Bill is designed to serve would earn $200 a week or $10,000 per annum? Even if some did, where would they buy a house for $20,000? In all probability a house would cost them in the vicinity of $30,000. That means that they would require a $10,000 deposit to be able to get even a reasonable house with a $20,000 loan. The very high cost of interest, which has to the Mimster that this is something to which he reached record heights under this Government, ought to give serious consideration.

That point needs Government came to office. emphasising. How many people will be able to take advantage of the legislation even though it offers preferential interest rates? The point is that no matter how much money is welcome the introduction of such a scheme, I provided by the Government that, in itself, does think it is a good idea. Let us have an apprentice not mean that people can move into their own scheme by all means. But I say to the Minister homes for the reasons that I have stated.

It is going to a substantial amount of money but at the same time there will be a large gap left in providing housing for the community generally throughout Australia, despite the fact that these provisions are being made. We also run into the problem of the utilisation of these funds in the provision ofhousing. When we speak of trying to increase activity in the home building industry we should bear in mind that there is only a limited number of builders who in fact carry out work in this particular field. There are a variety of reasons for this, one of which is that this work is of a specialised character. Consequently the injection of even $300m may not do as much for the home building industry as we would like to see it achieve. We have got to get over those problems.

The outlook for their prospects of employment is tragic. I feel very sorry indeed for those people-a n increasing number of people-wh o generally want to work. I feel particularly sorry for the school leavers who want to start out in Ufe and who are not going to get an opportunity. This is one of the things the Government should be thinking about. It comes into the area of this BUl insofar as the provision of homes for the people of AustraUa is concerned. I think that governments might be well advised to examine opportunities for providing homes for thenemployees. I intend to speak not only about what this Government could do but also about what the State governments could do. Quite recently I had an appUcation from a branch of a teachers' union at Stanthorpe in Queensland asking for the provision of homes for the members of the union employed in Stanthorpe. I wrote on thenbehalf to try to encourage the provision of adequate accommodation for these people. I think the State governments should undertake this sort of work. In that way it would help decentraUsation and it would encourage people to go to Uve in those areas. Not only does that apply to the State governments, but also it appUes to the AustraUan Government in just the same way. I have received simUar requests from employees of the Postmaster General's Department at QuUpie. They have been looking for homes for a considerable time and I would hope that the Government wUl provide those homes for them. The latest information I have is that they are looking around to try to find some homes that might be avaUable for sale. I think this is a rather short-sighted policy if, in fact, they are having any difficulty in finding suitable homes. I hope that both the State governments and the Australian Government wUl look at the prospect of being able to provide sumcient homes for their own employees for a start. That might ease the strain on those who want to provide other homes. If government employees take advantage of the finance that is bemg provided in these BUls, it means that someone else has to go without. The honourable member for Diamond Valley fact-that people who are in receipt of a substantial income are in a better position to provide homes for their famUies. They might be in a better position but unless they are in receipt of a very substantial income they have difficulty also in finding homes for their famUies. They are in difficulty in a number of ways. They are in difficulty because of the shortage of materials for contractors. They have difficulty in getting contractors to buUd their homes. Here again, if finance were made avaUable to more people to buUd homes on their own initiative and if these inhibitions on the buUding of homes were not there, there would be more homes for rent and there would be an easing of the whole situation. Under the present circumstances people have to have a very substantial income to be able to buUd even a reasonable home if they are to pay the interest rates, the costs of construction and the high prices for land which prevail at the present time. The honourable member for Diamond Valley spoke about the massive increase to $318m. I have already covered that point to some extent by saying that it wUl provide only a comparatively small percentage of the homes that we want to provide. To compare the actual amount of money that is being provided in these Bills with what was provided previously, disregarding the rate of inflation and the extra costs involved, is to make a comparison which is not real and fan . I want to be completely fair to the honourable member for Diamond Valley, but even allowing for the rate of mflation, if we take the total conditions under which people have to buUd homes today and compare them with conditions when we were in government, we will find that it was easier for the average wage earner to buUd or to rent a home in those days than it is today. That is the acid test of whether we are making progress with regard to the provision of homes, apart from the provision of money. While we appreciate the fact that the Minister has sincerely endeavoured to do his best in this direction because of the general policies of this Government his efforts and the general progress towards home ownership for the Australian people has been undercut. The Opposition welcomes this Bill. We realise that it will not go nearly far enough unless the Government somersaultsI notice that those words were used in the morning Press-toward s the poUcies that the Opposition has advocated for a number of years.

The Opposition, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Boothby( Mr living in garages and sub-standard accommoMcLeay) who led for the Opposition in this debate, agrees with the contents of these 2 pieces of legislation. I think we should realise, however, that the Government's decision to increase expenditure to more than $ 116m, or 60 per cent, during 1973-74 was perhaps required more because of the shambles which we find today in the Australian housing industiy than because of some charitable concept it may have for looking after those who are in need. One of the speakers for the Government made in the social well-being of all Australians, the point that previous Liberal-Country Party regardless of their economic or social position. governments had shown a constant lack of capacity to appreciate the problems of those who are in need in thefieldofhousing.

Approvals and commencements have fallen dramatically, interest rates are at an all time high, and housing and land costs have soared. There are shortages of serviced land, materials and labour. All of these shortages have now reached alarming proportions. The Government has failed completely in the field of housing. It is no good taking housing out of context. We have to look at the entire economic situation, because housing is a vital factor in the economic well-being of this community and is a vital factor With regard to the section of the community ter for Housing( Mr Les Johnson) on other field. There is undoubtedly a role for the Federal Government to play in terms of overall housing at the level offinance,but the actual activity involved in the construction and As one who served in the Public Service for to be able to appreciate at the grass roots level the real problems of society as found in the large The ultimate result of the Government's The field ofhousing in many respectsI think the Minister will agree with me on this pointhas failed fundamentally because there has been a tendency not to compare in terms of reality the role of the Federal Government and its relationship with the States. For a long time, and still today, Australia has been faced with a shambles in relation to uniform building codes. Attempts to improve have been made. The previous Government attempted to get the State authorities to see the situation. The present Government is also moving in that direction. This is a major consideration which has to be seen for what it is. It is not possible to cut down the cost of overall housing expenditure in terms of per unit cost until we can come up with respectable and applicable uniform codes throughout Australia. This can be achieved only through the close co-operation of the State authorities with the Commonwealth. In my opinionI know my Party would accept this-w e need to recognise that the transfer of resources from private to public housing in the traditional sense is slow, difficult and often a very wasteful process. This has been amply illustrated by the fact that the present Government in 23 months of rule has failed in its attempt to reallocate funds into certain other areas of the building industry. In fact, it is but another example of a growing list of economic failures which have resulted in the average Australian today being in a poorer situation than he was in 3 years ago. My Party is sympathetic to that section of the community which needs our assistance. We have always been sympathetic, and I would like to see any honourable member in this House be prepared to deny the right of every Australian, regardless of his economic or social position, to live in a decent manner, to house his family. But I do question the fundamental need to construct a sizable section of the housing industry on the premise that people should only pay rent. Those who have gone into and lived within large areas of rental accommodation in this country and elsewhere would perhaps note one important characteristic, that is, that the fact of ownership changes people's attitude towards their houses, and I would suggest that it changes their attitude towards what goes on in a home. In other words, there is a very close correlation between people's economic and social well-being in terms of their capacity to play a full and purposeful role in the community and their ability to have the pride of ownership. Above all, in the family context it enables them to be a good parent and to give their children a better environment in which to grow up. At the same time there is quite obviously a section of the community which is often movingeither coming into Australia or going out, as many people are doing at the moment-o r transferring occupations which would suggest that there is a need for some rented accommodation. It has been shown in recent years that there is no incentive in Australia for the private sector to construct rented accommodation to the degree required. All of a sudden the Government has decided that it can achieve its so-called socialist and sociological goals by applying vast sums of money to the State housing authorities for the construction of accommodation, ostensibly for that 6 per cent of the population which needs assistance. Mr Kevin Cairns-It is more than 6 per cent now. under the present economic circumstances it is more than 6 per cent. Regrettably we do not have statistics to back us up on that at this moment. However, in the last 12 months housing costs have risen on a national level by 21.5 per cent. That is enormous, when it is related to the increase in funds which the Government intends to allocate. It suggests that from the vast sum of $160m-odd 21.5 per cent has to be deducted before we will get to a realfigureupon which we can compare the situation with previous fundings for this type of housing. There is no doubt, as I have already pointed out, that there is a pressing need for an effective housing policy for Australia. I think that it is also quite within reason to expect that if the public sector of the economy, through the Government, is going to contribute, as it has up to now, approximately only 6 per cent of the need the private sector must continue to fulfil a very real role in the future. The Government's policies, especially economic policies, have done their best to break that down, but the fact still remains-and I wish the Minister to recall once again the statistics which I have already mentioned in this House-that according to the projections which were prepared by the Housing Industry Association in 1975 we will need over 184,500 new homes and that by 1980 the number will increase to over 207,000. I would like to remind the House that those statistics do not take into account the fact that we are at least 60,000 homes behind what we should have had last year. With the growth of the Australian population-the anticipated increase in the number of families in the Australian population-the fact of the matter is that the building industry today is indeed in a very parlous state.",71,States Grants Housing Assistance Bill 1974
139,Mr Connolly,"I agree entirely. ObviouslyHousing and Construcuon) (6.8)-In reply-In the S minutes or so available to me I would like to deal with several of the points which have been made. Primarily we are talking about the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill and the Housing Agreement Bill. The States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill involves the process of facilitating or appropriating $310m for Statehousing authority purposes. It also involves amending the Housing Agreement. Principally the change concerns the question of making it possible to spend more than 30 per cent of the money for Home Builders Account purposes and removing overtime from the considerauon of the means test for Home Builders Account purposes. It is a very laudable proposition. I am pleased that the Opposition has not opposed the propositions involved. In fact, the House will be pleased to know that they were supported by the State Ministers for Housing in their entirety. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr He is deUghted that we have been able to do Connolly), who preceded me in the debate, drew attention to the housing situation in AustraUa. What he should realise, of course, is that the housmg situation is not an isolated situation but is a trend throughout the world. I have just returned from the United States of America and Canada. The amazing feature of the situation in the United States of America is that the year bewouldfindthemselves faced with an impossible fore last there were 2.6 mUlion housmg commencements and this year there are expected to be 1.2 miUion. There has been an enormous downturn in the industry there. Of course, the cost of land and the inflationary situation are such that people are unable to afford the traditional house-the single fanuly house. So there is a doubUng of the number of people who are going into apartments or, as they are caUed there, condominiums. There is a doubling of the number of people who are using transportable homes and the number of people who are using single famUy homes has been reduced by something like 60 per cent. That is the kind of trend which is in evidence throughout the world. We have been holding out much better than a mending appropriation announced. number of comparable countries. It has been difficult to follow the debate because there have been inconsistencies in the attiOrder! Is it the wish of the House to proceed to tude adopted by the members of the Opposition. the third reading forthwith? Firstly, there was opposition today by the who is the spokesman for the Opposition on I trust that this is therightpoint at which to raise housmg, to the acquisition of land at Glebe and a point of order?

It is strange that there was no opposition to that proposal when the BUls deaUng wish of the House to proceed to the third reading with it were before the ParUament. opposition. position ( Mr Snedden) did not oppose that proposal. He certainly made no contention along the Unes that we were proceeding unconstitutionally; yet that is the contention which was made today. The thing which stood out more sharply than anything else today was that the honourable member for Boothby, without much equivocation or ambiguity, was making the point that the Housing Agreement was bad in principle because it provided for concessional loans to low income earners. He thought it was a very bad principle to allocate funds at 4 per cent and 4'A per cent for Home BuUders Account purposes. But I was pleased to see our colleague the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Kevin Cairns), who was once Minister for Housing and who obviously knows what this business is about, saying that it is a highly virtuous characteristic. something about it. What a good thing it is, he said, that we have acted because there is this economic situation characteristic of the inflationary trend around the world and if we had not initiated the 1973 Housing Agreement the people who depend on housing commissions for their rented homes or for their home purchases proposition. What the honourable member for Boothby is really advocating is that we eliminate these preferential interest rates. Of course, that would have the effect of forcing up rents. It would result in people being evicted from housing commission homes. In addition, it would make it impossible for people to purchase. Because of the time factor I cannot proceed with the debate any further. I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. BUl read a second time.

In 1972-73 there were 249 capital grants, total general purpose capital funds were $982m and capital grants as a percentage of total general purpose capital funds were 2S.4 per cent. In 1974-75 there were 327 capital grants, total general purpose capital funds were $ 1,027m and capital grants as a percentage of total general purpose capital funds were 32.1 per cent, to which I have previously referred. The increase in the basic loan programs for the States was increased in two stages for the 1974-75 nnancial year. At the 1974 meeting of the Loan Council, approved programs for the States totalled $934,919,000, that is $925m and the $9.9m in temporary allocation to Queensland. An announcement was then made at the time of the 1974-75 Budget that the Austrahan Government had proposed that the States' basic programs should be increased by 10 per cent to $1,017,500,000. The decision to provide this increase was made in a frantic attempt to respond to the growing realisation that inflation was accelerating towards at least a 20 per cent rate by the end of this year. Because of the Government's assumption of full responsibUity for financing tertiary education from 1 January, 1974, the States' basic programs take into account estimated capital expenditure of which the States have been reUeved. The reduction agreed at the Premiers' ConferenceLoan Council meeting is $65.4m. When adjustment is made to take into account these differences so that comparison can be made with 1973-74 it shows that the 1974-75 basic program for each State is 20 per cent greater than in 1973-74. However, in view of the fact that the 1974-75 Budget was formulated on the expectation of an mflation rate of 20 per cent in 1974-75 the States are receiving no effective growth in funds avaUable at all. In fact in the current year further wage and cost pressures stand to undermine further the purchasing power of the funds that have been avaUable to them. The 20 per cent increase in funds avaUable to States such as Tasmama. For example, whUe the States in 1974-75 must be viewed in compariTasmama is suffering from the most acute case of son with the huge 32.4 per cent increase in Fedunemployment in Australia and the Federal eral Government spending which the Labor Government's squeeze on funds to that State Government has voted itself. One of the greatest acts of hypocrisy of the Prime Mmister( Mr Whitlam) is evidenced by his behaviour in this area. At the June Premiers' Conference he made a plea to the States for restraints as he promised that the Federal Government would be alongside them as they aU tightened their belts to fight off accelerating inflation. The Budget, only 3 months later, revealed the detaUs of Labor's inflationary spending spree in complete contradiction to the Prime Minister's earUer promises. On an overall basis the States have been allocated an increase of 38 per cent, including the Loan CouncU Program. However, this is a misleading measure. Specific purpose grants have been increased by 67.7 per cent while general purpose grants have been lifted by only 22 per cent. In real terms, that is, corrected for inflation, therefore, the funds provided directly for the funding of the States' own programs have not been increased at all. The Federal Government's policy in regard to the States wUl add materially to cost mflation as State governments implement compensating increases in State taxes and charges. Unless an agreed system of revenue sharing on a fixed proportional basis is adopted, State governments wUl be placed hi an impossible position; that is, they will have the responsibUity for exercising clearly defined constitutional responsibilities without the necessary resources. The 1974-75 Budget makes a great stride towards just that outcome. In so doing it completely abrogates the commitments given by the Federal Government as to matching restraints of Federal outlays. The Liberal Party has just put forward a revenue plan that would be adopted with tremendous benefits for the States as soon as we return to Government. The proposal calls for a supplementary grant to the States to enable them to maintain their essential services without recourse to new or additional State taxation. This system contrasts strongly with the Federal Labor Government's attempt to gain political capital by making piece-meal grants to various institutions and industries. The smaller States in particular wUl benefit by having made avaUable to them adequate funds which allow them freedom to allocate them as they see fit. Statements by Ministers of the Labor Government when referring to the States give a very clear indication that they are completely out of touch with conditions, particularly in the smaller exacerbated its serious economic problems, the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. J. F. Cairns, told Tasmanians: 'Stop whinging-Tasmanian s are on velvet'. The policy we put forward in our Party platform includes the following vital aspects: Financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States to provide adequate and assured sources of revenue with which to carry out their constitutional responsibilities, such sources to provide the States with substantial income under their own control. The guaranteeing of an adequate proportion of Commonwealth personal income tax revenue for the purposes of the States, such proportion to be determined by the arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. Continuance of national purpose grants, but grants to the States being free of restrictions in detail that infringe on the right of the States to determine policy in their areas of responsibihty. The Opposition Parties are very seriously concerned at the trend that the Labor Government's attitude to the States has shown. The trend that is evident has far-reaching implications for the federal system of Government. The Liberal Country Party believes strongly in the retention of Australia's federal system of Government. We do so because this system is most conducive to the progress and the well-being of Australia, and most conducive to the democratic protection of the freedom of the individual. Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill goes to the very root of the problem of Commonwealth-State financial relationships. Unfortunately this is a very poorly understood matter despite the fact that it is the basis of one of the most highly publicised controversies in contemporary Australian politics. The debate surrounding this controversy has been disappointing in that it has usually developed into a slanging match between the State and Federal governments, regardless of which parties happen to be in power at either of the levels. That in itself is a matter of deep concern because the progress of this nation will be limited for as long as State-Federal rivalries dominate the mainstream of political thought. I have said that this controversy has been States receive for capital and recurrent expendimainly between the State and Federal Governture comes under the heading of specific purpose ments irrespective of the parties. To illustrate this grants. These have increased from $1.5 billion in I think one needs only to point to the feud which round figures in 1973-74 to $2.6 billion in used to be waged between the Gorton Federal 1974-75, that is, an increase of 64 per cent in Government and the Bolte Government in Vicadjusted terms. This has meant that the total altoria. However, despite that fact, there is no location to the States under all 3 headings has question that the degree of animosity has increased sharply as a result of the election of a Federal Labor Government. State Premiers have become much more vindictive than they ever were before. I think to discover the reason for this increased animosity it is important to have a general understanding of the changes that have taken place in State-Federal financial relationships. There are 3 categories under which the Federal Government makes finance available to the States. The broad headings are general revenue assistance, general purpose capital funds and specific purpose payments. I will examine specifically the changes that have occurred in the general purpose capital funds and the specific purposes payments. The States Grants (Capital Assistance) Bill makes available to the States funds under the heading of general purpose capital funds. These funds come within the categories of borrowings and capital grants, which are interest free non-repayable grants. These borrowings and grants are available for capital purposes only and recurrent expenditures are found from other sources. The origin of this Bill goes back to the June 1974 Premiers Conference when the Loan Council program was agreed upon between the State and Federal Governments. At that time it was agreed to increase the allocation to the States from $0.8 billion in 1973-74 to $0,935 billion in 1974-75 including nearly $ 10m in extra borrowings for Queensland to overcome the problems created by the floods. In September of this year the amount was increased to just over $ 1 billion, making an increase of 21.5 per cent over the 1973-74figure.Of this amount $0.7 billion was in the form of borrowings and $0,326 billion was in the form of non-repayable grants. I think it is important to take account of the proportion that was made up of grants as opposed to borrowings. The grants have increased from 24.3 per cent in 1970-71 under the previous Federal Government to 32.1 per cent under the present Government in 1974-75. That in itself is quite significant in as much as the amount that is non-repayable has increased from one-quarter to nearly one-third of the total amount made available under these arrangements. The other main form of assistance that the",79,States Grants Capital Assistance
173,Mr Dawkins (Tangney) (8.49),"The Statesincreased from $4.3 billion in 1973-74 to $6.1 billion in 1974-75-an increase of 40 per cent. SoI think that when one considers the program in totala 40 per cent increase being made available to the States when the increase in expenditure of this Government is of the order of 33 per cent-the wailing of some of the State Premiers has to be taken with a grain of salt. Indeed, the total increases that took place in the last year of the previous Government were of the order of 18.4 per cent. In the first year of this Government the increases amounted to 20.6 per cent and, as I said previously, for this current year they will amount to 40 per cent. One of the things that some of the Premiers complain about is that, when the Australian Government takes over total responsibility for some areas, a balancing reduction is made in general purpose grants. The Prime Minister( Mr CouncU programs. This amount represented Whitlam) made this point very clear both at the 1973 Premiers Conference and at the 1974 Premiers Conference. At the June 1974 Conference, he said: The Australian Government is firmly committed to this principle and will pursue its application wherever appropriate. I have informed the Premiers of our intention to do so in respect of initiatives we are taking in the fields of Aboriginal affairs and assistance for deserted wives, and I expect that further cases could arise as we develop our policies in other areas. These intended areas of involvement in Aboriginal affairs and assistance to deserted wives followed the AustraUan Government's assumption of complete responsibUity in the area of tertiary education. In response to the words of the PrimeI dunk that the attitude of the Premier is douMinister, the Premier of Western Australia, Sir blyridiculouswhen one realisesI understand Charles Court, issued the following circular to his that this is the case-that his circular was also Ministers: The Commonwealth Government has introduced a wide area of total Australian Government responsirange of programs under which funds are offered to the State bUity. For instance, it would be absurd if fbr specified purposes subject to the approval of the program teachers colleges which are autonomous and by the Federal Minister concerned. In many cases, the grants are payable under conditions Government were asked to go into an involved which may require the commitment of State funds, either as and compUcated process before they were able a specified proportion of the expenditure involved or in the form of maintenance of existing levels of State expenditure. to receive any assistance from the Australian It is a firm policy of the Commonwealth Government that is the sort of intimidation that is inherent in the where the Commonwealth assumes responsibility for programs so as to relieve the State of expenditure, the State's circular which has been circulated by the PremFinancial Assistance Grant and Loan Fund allocation are ier. I think that only indicates that many of the reduced by a corresponding sum. Consequently, an apparState Premiers have grossly over-reacted to the ently attractive proposal may offer no real financial advanchanges which have taken place. They do not tage to the State when this subsequent adjustment is taken into account. Adjustments of this type have already occurred as a result of the Commonwealth taking over the responsibility for of many of the States faUing to come to grips financing tertiary education and welfare housing and, at the with the problems which were crying out for solrecent Premiers' Conference, the Prime Minister announced ution that the Australian Government insisted on that the Financial Assistance Grants would be funher taking an active role in areas which had reduced as a result of Commonwealth initiatives in the fields of Aboriginal Affairs and assistance to deserted wives. lt is essential that the nnancial impUcations of any proposed arrangement with the Commonwealth be fully examined before any decision to participate in the arrangement is made and preferably before negotiations are Tar advanced. Accordingly, the Treasury should be informed immediately of any financial proposals put forward by the Commonwealth at Ministerial or depanmental level and arrangements made for a Treasury oflicer to be involved in any negotiations. Would you please advise your departmental officers of this requirement. Sir Charles Court's remarks would not appear to be too unreasonable but an examination of what has happened in the area of tertiery education upon the assumption of total responsibility by the AustraUan Government shows that his is a fairly shallow sort of threat. In fact, as a result of an AustraUan Government taking over responsibUity for tertiary education, an adjustment of $2.7 mUUon was made to the 1973-74 Loan expenditure for the half-year because the assumption of responsibUity by the Australian Government took place on 1 January 1974. In 1974-75 the Western Australian Loan CouncU program was reduced by $5.4m. This matter has to be seen in the context of the increase in total expenditure in the field of tertiary education in those 2 years. The combined capital and recurrent expenditure on universities and colleges of advanced education increased from $ 15.7m in 1972-73 to $43.6m in 1973-74, and in 1974-75 it is intended to be $69.6m. One can clearly see that the increases far outweighed the reductions which took place in the Loan Council programs. sent to some of the institutions which are in the which are funded directly by the AustraUan Government for any specific programs. Yet this reaUy take into consideration the reason for this change having taken place. It was only as a result previously been the province of the States. One only has to point to the areas of eduStates and the wholefinancialrelationship which cation, Aboriginal affairs and the extension of exists between this Federal Government and the urban facUities, which are 3 areas of very gross State system. I am seriously concerned at the dineglect when they were the sole province of State rection that Federal and State relationships, in governments and one only has to look at the financial terms, are taking.

Mr DuthieI disagree with that. care to disagree with that. I would be prepared to suggest that what I am saying is completely defensible. I said earlier that what is going on here in Canberra amongst the people who run government-the people who, outside government, have influence and exert pressure on the decisions that are made here-is that there is a philosophy in relation to the States which is that they are a damn nuisance and we have to do our best to wipe them out. That is the attitude that is taken by the Government of Australia today. It is that philosophy which is behind so much of the legislation that has come forward. This Bill, I suggest, is just another example to force the States into a more difficult and more humihating iinancial position and to throw much more power, in terms of control over State affairs, into the hands of Ministers in Canberra. ting out ofit? much money they are getting out of it.

We have to stop this tying up, by way of special grants and tied grants, of so much of the money which is being allocated to States in different areas. This is just not on. I am prepared to admit that there are some areas in which a national approach needs to be taken, and I would not disagree with such a thing as a national highway because it seems to be obvious that the States have not met their responsibilities in that area. If the Federal Government does not intervene we will not get an efficient transport system in the way of roads around this great and large country. AlthoughI think that there are special circumstances such as that, I am prepared to say categorically in this House this evening sorts of tied grants, these condition-attached grants, are not necessary, nor should they be necessary, nor are they acceptable. They will not be acceptable under our administration, and they are certainly not acceptable under the State administration. The position is quite plain. If the States do not accept the conditions they do not get the money. That is not good enough in this day and age when we are deahng with responsible and democratically elected governments which have their own responsibilities in their own States. We have heard tonight that there is solid reason for instituting a program which has led to grants of this nature being passed through these Houses of Parliament. The basic reason behind it is to ease the interest burden which is felt by the States. Those programs have been worthwhile because in fact they have been worth something like $5 9m or $60m to the States in the current financial year. We have to put this into perspective because half of the State interest bill which is paid by charges and the other incidental means by which the States can recover funds.

Such increases would have an inflationary effect. But the States have been put into a position in which they have no choice but to increase charges. The cost of petrol in New South Wales is to increase by 6c a gallon. What effect will that have on the transport industry? What effect will that have on the cost of living of the private individual? What is that going to mean to somebody like myself who travels in excess of 1,000 miles a week or the honourable member for Riverina, who travelled 2,000 miles around his vast electorate last weekend?

190,Mrs Child (Henty) (9.24),"The Australianway to publicise his appreciation of the Government's action, but that is just about par for the course for the Premier of Queensland. The States have been relieved of the responsibility of financing tertiary education. The basic program for each State is 20 per cent greater than last year's proposal. The sum of $326m has been provided by the Government to the States as capital grants. They are interest free grants and there are no strings attached to them as to the spending of thefinance.Those States which constantly criticise the Government for tying grants and those honourable members who constantly join in with the criticism neglect to say that this year the States will be getting 8 per cent more than last year in interest free, no strings attached grants and $126m more than when the scheme was started. In September of this year the Australian Government proposed, and the States agreed, to an increase of 10 per cent in the basic program. This agreement will be formally approved at a later meeting of the Loan Council. It is a great disappointment to me personally that local government bodies do not have a voice of their own on the Loan Council. There are over 900 local government bodies in Austraha. Their responsibilities to their ratepayers over past years have increased rapidly. These local government bodies are becoming heavily involved in social welfare, conservation, child care and the provision of pre-school facUities. Thenaccess to finance should be considered. The refusal by the States to aUow local government bodies to be represented in their own right was deplorable to me. I was also disappointed to find that New South Wales was the only State which saw the Ught in the recent referendum and voted for respresentation. The Government has, of course, initiated access to the Grants Commission, which does give some straight out grants with no strings attached to local government bodies, but I still beUeve that they should have their own voice and thenown representation on the Loan CouncU. The Government makes no apology for putting particular emphasis on the funding of specific purpose programs. We have never attempted to make any apology about that. We beUeve that the funds which go to the States, as distinct from capital grants, should have strings attached to them. At the June 1973 Premiers Conference the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) said: From now on, we will expect to be involved in the planfar behind schedule. In Victoria the State school ning of the function to which we are financially committed. buUding program is faUing to keep up with the That sounds Uke good common sense to me. If new schools that are so desperately needed. In one puts money into something one wants to see my own electorate I know of schools that should that it is spent in the way in which one envisaged its being spent. After some of the experiences we have had with the States in the past I do not have quite the same confidence in them as the honourable member for Hume appears to have. In particular I am thiriking of the library grants by the Commonwealth which went through the Department of Education in Victoria as distinct from the ones which went to private schools in that State. The Commonwealth moneys spent on Ubraries by the private schools resulted in the construction of beautiful buUdings and the standards were superb. Altogether they were buUdings and equipment of which to be proud. But that was not so with respect to the spending by the Victorian Government of Commonwealth money on Ubraries for State schools. One of the reasons I am wedded to the idea of specific grants is that one knows one is going to get what one has said the money is for. I point out that the AustraUan Government now makes over 100 grants to the States for specific purposes, which is a great increase on the grants in previous years. There can be no substance to Opposition statements that the Government is not catering for the needs of the States. As I stated earlier, the number of capital grants has increased quite significantly since the Government took over. As well as the increase in the actual number of grants the States have benefited from having grants replace borrowings. For instance, as grants replace the borrowings that would have otherwise been made by the States there have been substanual savings by the States in debt charges. These savings have been estimated at around $59.7m. One does not hear much mention of that by the State Premiers. To me it is quite a large sum of money, but they seem to have been able to sweep it under the carpet quite easUy. The interest-free capital grants are designed to help the States tofinancethose capital works from which the States cannot expect a return-schools , police buildings and the Uke. Under a separate BUl a record amount of money is being provided to the States for welfare housmg. A moderate rate of interest is to apply. Homes wiU be built specifically for renting or purchase by low income earners. I repeat that I am wedded to these specific purpose grants because we know that the money will be spent on what is most needed and where it is most needed. It is regrettable that in some of the areas where this Government does not have a say projects lag be bulldozed and replaced with buildings in This wUl mean that the States wUl be scratching, which teachers and students alike could work in as the honourable member for Hume suggests comfort. Schools in Victoria, and for that matterthey are scratching now. I do not know where he in other States, still have playgrounds defaced gets hisfiguresbecause last year Victoria alone with collections of chicken coops, formerly returned $8m of its money to the Commonknown as portables, in which students freeze in wealth because it could not spend it. The honourwinter and boil in summer, and reach them able member for Hume spoke also of transport either through a mat of dust or a sea of mud, charges being increased and of the very poor serdepending on the season. By comparison, in the vices the States are providing.

192,Room In Which To Sit And Work Instead Of A Staff Mrs Child,"I thought the honourable memrelations instead of the usual reaction we have been getting. Recently in Victoria the Victorian State Health Minister stated rather petulantly that child care centres that accepted Federal money would not get State money. That attitude seems absurd to me. The Victorian State Minister for Transport boycotted the public display of a prototype railway carriage because the Federal Government built it. This is 1974 and people are facing problems. Surely we can face these problems together and move away from such churlish behaviour. standing all my gallantry I must disagree and be at cross-purposes with the honourable member for Henty( Mrs Child) who said that she does not support Staterights.To give her her due, she said that she supports people'srights.As I see it, in supporting Staterightsmembers of the Opposition are supporting the State rights of the people of those States, and this is the fundamental issue. In depriving the States of their rights the Government is depriving the people of the States of the rights they now enjoy. The honourable member for Henty referred also to the Opposition's proposed 8 per cent across the board cut in government expenditure but like other Labor Party members she made her own assessment of what the proposed cuts would involve. Government supporters do not realise that when the Opposition is returned to government it will adopt economic policies which will enable the 8 per cent cut to be made without the drastic results envisaged by Government supporters. I agree with the honourable member for Henty when she said that local government bodies should be represented on the Loan Council. She referred also to the activities of the Grants Commission with respect to local government. In view of the funds that the Grants Commission has provided for local government, I believe it has been a dismal failure. I know of some councils that have not received anyfinancialassistance at all. The present Government has taken over responsibility for what it calls national arterial roads but in so doing it has taken funds away from rural arterial roads with the result that shire councils, which were dependent largely for work for their employees on the Main Roads Department, for which they acted as constructing authorities, are now putting off men who have given long and faithful service. This is directly the result of the policies of this Government which is claiming some credit for accepting responsibility for national arterial roads. It has assumed that responsibility at the expense of rural arterial roads and other rural roads, and shire councils are suffering greatly as a result. The Grants Commission scheme could have been good but it has turned out to be a real failure. The Grants Commission has been a big disappointment to local governments in Queensland, particularly to those shires which did not receive even one cent. Other shires did get something. This Bill is similar to legislation which comes before the House annually. But this year, the aim and thrust of the Bill are different, thus reflecting the attitude of the Government. We must beware. We cannot accept with outward calm the implied threats contained in the legislation. Ever since 2 December 1972, the notes have been slowly dribbling in and the message is clear: The small will be swallowed by the large and the large will be swallowed by the huge. We lament this environment but unless State and local governments unite to repel the invader the incurred wounds of centralis tic control will take a lot of curing. The medicine will be drastic. We must shoulder the burden to overcome the suspicion that permeates the Australian economic and social scene today. Let us analyse the position of the States. Table No. 8 which is headed 'Securities on Issue, Australia and Overseas, and Total per Head of Population as at 30 June 1950 to 1974' which appears at page 25 of Budget Paper No. 6, 'Government Securities on Issue at 30 June 1974' is a most enlightening table.

The honourable member for Maranoa issued another challenge when he said: 'Will someone tell me when this Government will co-operate with the States?'

They said that the programs that have been introduced by the Federal Government for the benefit of all Australians have beenfinancedat the expense of State and $l,923m in 1973-74 and $l,701m in 1972-73, which was the last Budget that was brought I will take thosefiguresa little further.

Part of the outlays of the Austrahan Government for 1974-75 will be directed specifically to certain areas in the States.

214,Mr Stewarti Merely Suggest That I F,"behalf of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Lynch), who cannot be here this evening. The BUl before the House seeks to amend the Pay Roll Tax (Territories) Act 1971-73 for the purpose of increasing the rate at which payroll tax is levied in the territories from 4V2 to S per cent. The legislation is pursuant to the statement of the Treasurer ( Mr could lead to anomalous situations. For instance, Crean) to this effect in his Budget speech. The passage of this legislation will bring the rate of payroll tax levied in the Northern Territory and the Austrahan Capital Territory into line with the rate which, as from 1 September, has already been introduced into some State parhaments. The rates of payroll tax levied in the States and the Territories originally moved out of line following the transfer of payroll tax to the States. This measure followed the 1971 Premiers' Conference where it was agreed that payroll tax would be transferred to the States in order to give them access to a new growth tax to assist them in the budgetary difficulties which they were facing at that time. The States at that stage were anxious to obtain a new area of growth revenue to finance improvements in State services. The Australian Government continued to impose its own tax on the territories at the existing rate at that time of 2.5 per cent, with the rate being subject to review in the Ught of changes the States might make in their individual domains. The differential between the rate of payroU tax levied in the States and that levied in the territories at first developed when the States raised theh rate from 2Vi to 3V4 per cent, but the Federal Government did not foUow suit in respect of the territories. The Coombs Task Force, reporting on the continuing expenditure poUcies of the previous Government in June 1973, criticised this differential as a disguised expenditure. It said that it took the form of a concession to employers in the AustraUan Capital Territory and the Northern Territory by comparison with their counterparts in the States. The Task Force estimated the cost to revenue of the differential in rates-operativ e at that stage-a t $2m in 1972-73 and 1973-74 and $3m in the following 2 years. The rate of payroll tax levied in the territories was brought into Une with the States since then, when in 1973 it was increased from 2Vi per cent to 3 Vi as from 1 September 1973 and to AVi per cent from 1 July 1974. However, since the States raised their rate to 5 per cent from 1 September this year, the territory rate is again lagging. During the debate on payroll tax adjustment gift duty. Three decades or more later it is reasonable to last year, the Opposition expressed its agreement examine the permanent consequences of these changes as with the Government that there was no good reason why the territory employers should not be caUed upon to meet taxes and charges comparable with those borne by employers in the States. The Opposition recognises that the Federal Government is in no way bound to follow the lead of the States in fixing the rates of payroll tax. However, the maintenance of a differential rate the operation of a lower payroll tax in the ACT would provide an artificial advantage to Canberra-based businesses as opposed to those based in Queanbeyan paying taxes to the New South Wales Government. The Opposition made it clear during the previous debate on this issue that we accept the standardisation of payroll tax as a general principle. However, at the same time we also stated our view that there could be valid reasons why certain special provisions should be made in respect of the Australian territories. In certain circumstances the operation of a differential rate of payroll tax could be considered, for example, to provide stimulation to the business community in a particular area. This possibility could be considered in an area which experiences particular difficulties and is isolated, for example, the Northern Territory. Another possibUity is for the Federal Government to use funds raised through payroll tax in the territories for the purpose of assisting areas which suffered from particular disabUities. Such funds raised in the Northern Territory could perhaps be applied to the development of this area and for providing facUities which the Territory could not normally provide because of its sparse population and the difficulties and expenses involved. It is worth adverting to the original purpose of payroll tax. The levy was introduced by the Commonwealth Government in 1941 as a companion measure with the Child Endowment Act. Subsequently, payroll tax was paid mto ConsoUdated Revenue, out of which chUd endowment was paid. Therefore, a tax originally introduced to finance a particular welfare expenditure has simply become a further element of a complex revenue raising system. The Asprey Committee's preliminary report referred to payroll tax in the foUowing terms: Many of the key features of the present tax system were introduced in the 1930's and 1940's for good short-term reasons connected with the depression and World War II, without much thought to their longer-run implications. This is true, for instance, of the adoption of sales tax in 1930, of the discontinuance in 1940 of company tax rebate on dividends to individuals, and of the introduction in 1941 of payroll tax (now under the control of the States) and Federal",94,Table No 8
215,Mr Garland (Curtin) (10.2),"I speak onwell as to take stock of the piecemeal accumulation of minor changes that have since occurred. The Asprey Committee's preliminary report does not provide a basis for any re-assessment of payroll tax. Regardless of the original purpose of payroll tax, this levy is now well entrenched in the system netting an annual figure of a not insignificant $700m. In terms of the territories the growth has been particularly rapid as would the burden of the levy as the rate has been doubled in just over a year. The increase from 2Vi per per cent to 3V4 per cent operated from 1 September 1973 and the increase to 4Vi per cent operated from 1 July 1974. The increase to 5 per cent will come into operation in respect of wages that become payable on or after 1 December 1974. This doubling of the rate in respect of the territories in such a short time should be compared with the fact that payroll tax when this Government came to power in December 1972 was still being imposed at the same rate as that originally introduced in 1941, that is, at the rate of 2Vi per cent. The impact on businesses in the territories of by employers in the States. I just ask: Why?

I include the Minister for cable. The fact that the States have been forced to so ably when he was the Minister for the Northmake frequent and substantial increases in the ern Territory that he knew nothing whatsoever rate at which payroll tax is levied is an indication about the area. If he speaks in this debate let it be of the inadequacy of the funds allotted to them recorded in Hansard that he is completely by the Federal Government. The burden which ignorant of the feelings of the people in the this tax places on all Austrahan businesses Northern Territory and of what is going on there. appears to have been completely disregarded by the Federal Government in its decisions on funding for the States and its decisions to make so place in the Northern Territory the Prime Minispany taxation. An additional facet of this tax said: 'We are the people who care. We are the which should be considered is the huge increase ones who will give you a vote in the Senate'. Let in the amount of tax as a percentage of rapidly him put on a vote in the Senate for the Northern increasing wages, not all of which are recoveraTerritory any time he likes. I want to get this ble in increased prices. The Opposition Parties, however, support the proposal before the House to standardise this tax as we believe that under the present system anomalies in the rate between different business communities could operate to the detriment of the States. However, we stress that this area is one in need of review and we express the hope that the final report of the Asprey Committee will provide a thorough appraisal of the situation and suggestions which can restore the use of this levy to its rightful perspective in the overall taxation mechanism. (10.12)-It is accepted that payroll tax in the Northern Territory is to be raised by the Commonwealth Government from 4'A per cent to 5 per cent. I note that the Minister for Social Security( Mr Hayden) who is probably not the Minister who will speak on this Bill, stated in his second reading speech-h e was then the acting Treasurer-that there is no good reason why Territory employers should not be called on to meet taxes and charges comparable with those borne Virtually everything in the Budget, while not Manufacturing Industry( Mr Enderby), who will probably speak in this debate.

They blithely say what was said in the second reading speech of the then Acting Treasurer. I emphasise the fact that this tax is blithely introduced. I know that it has to be imposed, but it is the attitude of the people who impose it that is so riling to us who Uve there. For a reason which is very apparent, no AustraUan Labor Party candidates were voted mto the new Legislative Assembly. The people of the Northern Territory know only too well-Government supporters can say what they like when they speak in this debate-that they have absolutely turned their backs on the Labor Party and its policies. Northern Territory is one area which cannot be cut up by having a redistribution, and the Mmister for Services and Property( Mr Daly), who is at the table, should remember that. By all means give the Territory a couple of senators. It has been talking about it ever since I have been a member of the ParUament and now it should do it. spruiking about it ever since I have been a member of this House.

I suggest that the honourable member should remain away from the microphone or he wUl deafen somebody. We have heard so much from the Minister for Services and Property. He cannot cut up the Northern Territory to suit the Labor Party so that it wUl get back into office forever, as he had told me, on this very bench, that it will. Let the general pubUc know that, if he is considering a fair distribution of seats, I trust that the Labor Government will give the new Northern Territory Legislative Assembly a fair go when it discusses this tax and other matters. I know it must have been very distressing for the Government to have fielded a candidate in every electorate but one, and to have lost in all of them. And all the Labor members of the former Legislative Council were defeated. I ask the Government why it is rushing this sort of BUl through the House when it has not been considered by the Legislative Assembly, the brain chUd of the Prime Mmister( Mr Whitlam). He said that regardless of how long it would take to organise, there would be a fully elected Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory before December 1974. The Legislative Assembly is now a reaUty but it so happens that there are no Labor members in it. That is just too bad for the Labor Party. I want to know why this BUl, which is the sort of legislation that would normally be considered by a State Parliament, has not come before the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. No one has said what the executive powers of the Assembly will be; no one has said what its responsibilities will be and no one has said what the remuneration of its members wUl be. I say again that this BUl and the Northern Territory (StabUisation of Land Prices) Bill are being forced through this Parliament when they should be the prerogative of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I am sure that the members of the Assembly are prepared to take the responsibUity. They are Territorians of long standmg.

But let him remember that on 25 October 1972, the previous Government made an offer to the Northern Territory to give it responsibility for a range of functions. Let us face it; that offer did not mention payroll tax, but it covered such things as State type taxation, stamp duties and succession duties. It also included the control of the Northern Territory police and urban lands. This is why I am saying that these Bills should not be rushed through this House. They should be withdrawn, redrafted and either presented to the Assembly by whatever mechanism this Government intends to use to get its legislation through the Assembly or they should be introduced by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly itself. What is happening is typical and exactly what one would expect of the Labor Party. It called for a fully elected Legislative Assembly, yet although elections for the Assembly have been held, the Government is determined to put these Bills through this House and not consider the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I say that these Bills should be withdrawn, redrafted and presented to that Assembly. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901-1973 to express distances referred to in the Act in terms of kilometres rather than miles. The change arises of course out of the metric conversion program. forthwith. Under section 5 of the Act every writ of summons to which an appearance is required to be time. entered by the party to whom it is address must contain a notice requiring that party to show on his appearance an address for service of documents within 5 miles of the office of the court out of which the summons is issued. Section9 of the Act makes a similar requirement in respect of appearances entered by or on behalf of a defendant to a writ of summons served under the Act in accordance with the requirements of the metric conversion program it is necessary to remove these references to miles and insert appropriate distances expressed in kilometres. It has been decided to provide in sections 5 and 9 of the Act for distances of 10 kilometres in each case, this being a conveniently rounded figure. The amendments made by the BiU are, by clause 4, to apply to any writ of summons issued after the commencement of the Act and to any appearance entered after that time, including an appearance to a writ of summons issued before that commencement. The Act would of course commence on the 28th day after it receives the royal assent. As 10 kUometres is a slightly greater distance than 5 mUes the change has the effect of allowing parties to summonses served and appearances entered under the Act a greater radius within which an address for service must be shown. I have given my colleagues, the Attorneys-General of the States, and the legal profession generaUy notice of the proposed amendment so that parties affected by the change may be aware of what is intended. The amendments set out in the Schedule to the Bill are of a purely formal nature, for the purpose of applying current drafting practices to the provisions of the principal Act. I commend the Bill to the House. is an amendment to one of the oldest Acts of the Commonwealth which has stood the passage of time, unlike much of the legislation that is going through the House at the moment. It has remained on the statute book for 70 years untrammelled.

234,Mr Ellicott (Wentworth) (10.28),"This(10.29)-On 23 September of this year, the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) was present at a dinner hosted by the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association. He made certain remarks which were reported in the Australian Broadcasting Commission program 'AM' the following day. He said that he was a strong supporter of the Rattigan plan for rationalising industries, that is, for closing down inefficient industries and making their members unemployed. He castigated as 'nervous Nellies' those who were frightened of the consequences. The Prime Minister then went on to say: 'Do not exaggerate. It is not as bad as people say-that 900 people were laid off in Launceston. Only 360 were laid off.' This morning I asked the Prime Minister a question relating to the policy of tariff slashing. II suppose I might as well cite the textile industry. Some of asked whether he recalled the 'A.M.' broadcast in which he supported the concept that the tariif slashing was to be commended even though it meant a certain amount of unemployment and he categorised as 'nervous Nellies' those people who were frightened of a certain amount of unemployment. The Prime Minister denied that he had said these things. As it happened, I had in my hand the actual transcript of what he had said. But I have gone better than that.

I've scarcely known the man, but I've admired him for years.

I cannot play it but it is there. I will be willing to make it available to honourable members afterwards. The Prime Minister said further: But I do get a bit irked, not with your membership, not with this association, but with some others that spread panic. you have heard me mention in the past during last April and May, by an extraordinary coincidence. I remember there was one company in the Latrobe Valley which said that it would have to sack 300 people if we didn't reimpose quotas or embargoes or the 25 per cent tariff. They've never employed more than 65, and recently, I haven't read the report in detail, but I had a glance at it today, Clyde Cameron showed it to me, there've been allegations that textile companies have had to put off 900 people in Launceston. The department made an investigation. There were 360 laid off. I think that my question in the House today fairly summarised the position which the Prime Minister took up. He was in favour of tariff slashing in order to create a certain amount of unemploywhen the economy was buoyant, surely one cannot go about tariff slashing when the economy is jobs available for people who lose their jobs by further jobs available when manufacturers disare to have tariff slashing it must be done-and I do not say it should be done because I am one of the people who believe in a high Australian coneconomy is buoyant.

This morning's 'Financial Review' discloses the result of some few years investigation by investigators. According to a report tabled in the New South Wales Parliament yesterday they have established that a 10-man syndicate of highly disciplined and skilled share traders made almost $5m in profits from insider trading, that is getting the information from the inside. The article in the 'Financial Review' goes on to say: was prepared by 2 special investigators acting for the New South Wales, Victorian and Tasmanian Government. Every Australian is aware that quite recently Mainline Corporation, the former gigantic private enterprise company, crashed, bringing about the ruination of many workers who depended on Mainline for their income and thenjob. Many small investors lost the money they had invested in Mainline. But two of the directors of Mamline were also directors of Endurance mining company. They were Mr Baker and Mr O'Neill. According to the article in today's 'Financial Review' and similar articles in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' and the 'Australian', these people have made virtually hundreds of thousands of dollars out of their crook practices connected with insider trading.

As a result those who swung to it have been disillusioned and dismayed by the spiralling events since 1972. From the day the Austrahan Labor Party was elected to office we saw a new style of government in this country. In the first 10 days there was a 2-man Ministry. A plethora of advisers, of armchair strategists, was called in to fulfil the charter of advising the Government on ways and means of restructuring the economy and of reallocating resources. There was to be a new rationalisation to achieve the socialist objectives. Decision after decision was taken rushing the Australian people and the economy into confusion. Soon the private sector got the message as to what the Government was about and all confidence took flight. One recalls the memorable phrase in this year's second Budget speech of the now discredited Treasurer. Is he Treasurer tonight? Will he resign tomorrow or the next day? Is he going to be sacked? The Treasurer ( Mr Wheat is today selling on the overseas market at Crean), in the pivot to his Budget Speech, said: The relatively subdued conditions and prospects in the has refused to increase the first advance on this private sector provide thefirstopportunity we have had to year's crop beyond $ 1.20. It is not a handout that transfer resources to the public sector. Last night we were treated to the third Budget in vance from the Reserve Bank of Australia in 3 months. On the face of it, it is a complete relation to which the wheat growers themselves somersault. The Prime Minister is now trying to will have to repay both the capital and the convince the business sector, the multinationals interest.

I am surprised that the honourable member for Robertson has not been informed about it because his good judgment might have had some influence upon the result. The Prime Minister postured at the United Nations in New York just recently, saying that Austraha had the capacity to produce food for the starving peoples of the world and giving the impression that the Government would provide an incentive to the wheat growers to help them to produce the grain that is necessary to feed the starving millions. The Government is helping to starve thousands and thousands of people throughout the world by its policies. The Government has failed to provide any incentive although it has had a chance to do so.

(4) Will he table the results of the studies referred to in parts(2)and(3). able member's question is as follows: (1) The selection of the process or processes for the conversion of coal to oil will depend on their technical and economic feasibility. (2) (a) An additional $100,000 to the normal allocation of $260,000 has been made available in 1974/75 to the National Coal Research Advisory Committee for specific allocation to oil from coal research. A total of $135,000 has been granted to the Australian Coal Industry Research Laboratories for research into the production of synthetic oil and chemicals from Australian coal. (b) Until demonstration plants have been constructed and operated, there can be no cenainty as to the costs of production of synthetic oil. Although it has been claimed overseas that synthetic crude oils could be produced at costs ranging from SUS3.25 to SUS4.00 per barrel from coals priced between SUS1.2S and $US3.2S per tonne, it will be impossible to verify the validity of these claims until demonstration plants have been operated.

The honourable member will appreciate that one of the functions of the Norfolk Island Council as the elected representatives of the people of Norfolk Island is to advise on the peace, order and good government of Norfolk Island. On7 August 1974 that Council resolved as follows, 'Council disassociates itself from the recent publicity in the Australian and local press concerning a visit to Norfolk Island by a United Nations delegation and further emphasises that the Norfolk Island Council has not considered such action. Furthermore, no poll was ever conducted to ascertain the views of all Councillors concerning a proposed visit of a United Nations delegation to Norfolk Island.'. I have told Council that 1 am sympathetic to them assuming increased local executive authority and responsibility. In this respect I have offered assistance to the Council in formulating its proposals. I refer the honourable member to my reply on 19 September 1974 to Question number 846 asked by Mr Peacock.

Australia has now sent such information to Canada in respect of financial years 1974-75 and 1975-76. Desk officers have also been appointed in each country to keep informed on developments in the other country and to be focal points for information and action. Where both countries have identical or closely similar requirements, there will be further consultation on the scope for co-ordinating the procurements. Also, as opponunity offers, there will be discussions on defence procurement co-operation during visits of Ministers and officials to Ottawa and Canberra. The foregoing will supplement existing arrangements between Canada and Australia under which there is a regular exchange of defence information, including on equipment. (4) See(3). (5) The procedure outlined in (3) is similar to arrangements already operating satisfactorily between Australia and New Zealand.

327,Council Of The Shire Investigation Of Beach Mr Hayden,"The answer to the honourableJanuary-March 1974 April-June 1974 I have had the situation revealed by these ngures and those of the other organisations referred to examined by my Department. I am informed that the organisations are acting within the terms of the legislation in admitting persons to special account. It must be realised that the special account system was designed by the previous Liberal/Country Party Government to prop up the health benefits funds and the legislative provisions are loosely framed to permit the organisations to take advantage of the subsidies it provides to a much greater extent than this Government believes is proper. There is not even power in the Act for the responsible Minister to withdraw the special account subsidies from an organisation. This fairly wide margin of interpretation permitted organisations is reflected particularly in the statistics for the Medical Benefits Fund, Queensland, which indicate that this organisation since 1972 has availed itself more and more of the special account subsidies. This point has been demonstrated above and is emphasised sail further in the following table in respect of the hospital fund of that organisation: MBF (QLD)-HOSPITA L FUND Amount of Fund Benefit Paid Whole Fund 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 Annual Percentage increases in Fund Benefits Paid percent 1972-73 1973-74 Ministerial Councils: Contact with States (Question No. SO) Mr Snedden asked the Mmister for Defence, upon notice: (1) Will he provide a list of all formal committees, councils, etc., that have been established which enable him or officers of his Department to maintain contact with State Government Ministers or State Government Officers.

Wilcox Mofflin Ltd (QuestionNo. 1126) Mr Snedden asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has written Government approval been given for the English Barrow Hepburn Group to take over Wilcox Mofflin (6) What recommendations of any kind has the ComLtd. If so, why. (2) Is Wilcox Mofflin Ltd the biggest hide processor and exporter in Australia. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Government raised no objections to a merger of Wilcox Mofflin Ltd and Colyer-NZT Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the Barrow Hepburn Group. Implementation of the proposal would initially give Barrow Hepburn Group a majority of the shares in the merged enterprise. However, Barrow Hepburn Group has undertaken that, if the merger is effected, Australian shareholders will appoint a majority of the board, of the merged enterprise and majority Australian ownership of Wilcox Mofflin will be restored within a specified period. In the latter regard, it is relevant that Barrow Hepburn Group acquired a 36 per cent interest in Wilcox Mofflin before the introduction of the foreign takeover measures on 26 September 1972 and that the proposal submitted to the Government envisaged that any increase in the Group's shareholding above 40 per cent would be temporary only. In the foregoing circumstances, I was unable to satisfy myself that foreign interests would be in a position to exercise effective control of the merged enterprise. I therefore found that action was not available under the Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act in respect of the proposed merger.

On present estimates some 6,500 women are currently being assisted under NEAT. 4. The types of assistance offered to all who seek training under NEAT are applied without discrimination as to sex.
