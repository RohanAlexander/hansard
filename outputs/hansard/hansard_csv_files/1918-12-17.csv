33,Mr Watt,"Speaking from memory,Johnson) I have received from the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the failure on the part of the Prime Minister to keep the Government informed as to the position in regard to copper."" Five honourable members in their places, Question proposed."" assure honourable members that only the extreme urgency of this matter prompts me to occupy the time of the Housei n this way at such a late hour of the session. Honourable members w ill recollect that for many months past. I have endeavoured to get, through the Acting Prime Minister, relief for the copper producers. I asked the honourable gentleman if he would ascertain from the Prime Ministeri f Australian copper producers would be allowed to sell their product to Allied markets if the British Government declined to buy after the 31st December next. Prime Minister endeavoured to get the in formation, and he either told the House on his own account or conveyed an intimation from the Prime Minister that it would be time enough for the producers to ask to be allowed to sell their copper to Allied countries when the British Government definitely refused to buy after the 31st December, 1918. About a week ago, the Acting Prime Minister told us that the Prime Minister was endeavouring to sell copper to the British Government up to the 30th June next year, or for three months after the war, whichever period was the longer. the Acting Prime Minister whether he had anv information in regard to copper, and he replied that he had received no word from the Prime Minister since that intimation came to hand. I read in this morning's press information which w ill have proved very profitable to some people, and very unprofitable to others. In the Age appears this statementThe latest London metal quotations show A fall of about £12 per ton, to £112 per ton,, in the rate for "" standard"" copper on. both> positions, while electrolytic has dropped £11, to £134 per ton. It is stated that this is due to "" official control of the metal having been released."" Upwards of 800 Hampden-Cloncurry shares changed hands at the lower price of 13s. 6d., while Mount Cuthbert, after free quittance between 2s. 9d. and 2s. Od., finished upon offers at 2s. in a wide market. The Mount Cuthbert shares have fallen during the last two weeks from 12s. to 2s. r due largely, I admit, to labour troubleshaving risen and the presence of Industrial Workers of the World wasters on the mines of No r t h ern Queensland, but due partly to the u n certain position in regard to copper. The Prime Ministeri n London is supposed, in conjunction with Sir Joseph Cook, to beattending to the interests of Australian metal producers, but the Government know absolutely nothing about the fact that theImperial Government have released control of copper, and that there is apparently a free market all over the world. Doesnot that disclose a serious state of affairs ? on the Stock Exchange can get in for m a tion which ought to have come as soon asThe Acting possible from the British Government to the Commonwealth Government so that everybody interested Avould be in an equally good position.

The cable shows that when the British Government made the announcement the market at once fell. The announcement that the Imperial Government had released its control over the market for copper, and that the electrolyticmetal had fallen £11 in price, to £124 per ton, This_ morning I asked was contained in a cable message received during the afternoon by the Australian Metal Exchange.

During recent months, we have been constantly compelled to take our information from the newspaper cables, which have, in certain cases, been subsequently confirmed by cables sent from the Secretary of State for the Colonies through the ordinary channels, or by direct cable from the PrimeM in ister. The cable lines are in a very congested and unsatisfactory state. Frequently three days have elapsed between the despatch and the receipt in the case of cables sent by the Prime Minister. cable messages are three weeks in transit. I understand that the tion in regard to private cables, but M in isterial advices are supposed to be "" clearthe-line cables""; that is,' Government messages of importance are supposed to be given a certain amount of priority.

It is all too frequent for it to take .a week or more to get a. reply now to a cable. We have had numberless cases of that k in d in the past, but we are not responsible for it , nor can we control it . The British Government, through its press bureau and its method of publicity, is responsible for the way it sends its information abroad. Frequently we get it through the press first, and lately that method of public announcement of news has been increasing in frequency. No one can blame the Prime Ministerf o r that. It may be that there is a cablegram en route, but the last wire which I had made it perfectly clear that he was doing all he could, and expected to succeed, in connection with copper.

They appear to be surrounded by pressing problems of immense and far-reaching importance, with all kinds of new prospects opening up on the termination of these controls. No man can predict what will happen when they do terminate. In the case of lead, the reverse rethem. I think the British Government sult followed, because, as soon as lead was freed, it jumped in the market by from £11 to £14 per ton, Wheu copper was freed, having apparently been kept at too high a level, it fell in equal and opposite ratio. I do not think that for this the head of this Government, or the British authority, can be blamed. I should certainly prefer, if it was possible, to get information here that could be published by the Government simultaneously with the publication in Great Britain, but that we cannot control. If the honourable member for Capricornia suggests that the interests of the copper producer, or of the holder of copper shares, have been neglected or hurt by the action of this Gomation coming as it has done, but that vernment, or by any carelessness on the part of the Prime Minister, he is doing both the Prime Minister and the Government an injustice. All we have been anxious to do is to help the industry, and we have gone so far during the three months since the Prime Minister left, before the June to December contract extension was made, as to arrange an advance for the whole of the copper producers of Australia, and I am doing that now for the first three months of 1919. We are going to take a Tisk in that regard. We are doing the same thing also in regard to tin, our desire being to sustain these industries, as it were, until the producers _ of these metals can see what post-war conditions mean to them, .and are able to make their own arrangements accordingly. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -Has there been ' fresh cablegrams in the last few days. Surely the honourable member for Capricornia will see that, were the Government ever so wise, and ever so well-informed, they could not avert the dislocation or change upward or downward which will be the inevitable result of the release^ of these metal and other controls ? It is the lack of information that I am complaining of. the cause of the difficulty in the copper situation, and do not mind expressing were powerless to combat the American influence. I have said that to my colleagues all the time. If the British Government had been in possession of the bulk of the supplies, they could have exercised a more potent influence on the market and on the purchasing arrangements for the war, but America supplies the bulk of the copper production of the world, and the nation that supplies only a minor proportion cannot exercise the influence which it otherwise would. copper market. fact.

56,' Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"are bound to occur. I would, therefore, ask the Acting Prime Minister to consider the desirableness of instituting better business arrangements on the other side of the world. I know his hands are pretty f u l l with the making of business arrangements ou this side, but if he made a suggestion on these lines to the Prime Minister he would probably find that, as we have a H i g h Commissioner and a big staff, they could do something in a business way to supply us with information. The Prime Minister has done well in big things in England, but he has never been looked upon as a champion in matters of detail, and it is desirable, in the interests of a great many industries, particularly the big mining enterprises of t in and copper, which are the life-blood of this country, that we should have first-hand information. The only way that we can get it is by some system on the other side such as I suggest. Surely we have enough people in the High Commissioner's office to see that our interests are properly safeguarded. I have no objection to the press getting information first, because it gives the information out again right away, and everybody sees it ; but it seems an anomaly that the British Government should take an important step like this, and that we should get the news of it in a second-hand way. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to have something done on the lines I have suggested. Acting Prime Minister has done everything possible to help and safeguard this great industry, yet, unless we have proper arrangements on the other side of the world, I fear that some terrible difficulties will arise here owing to the want of business arrangements in detail, for which the Prime Minister is not famous.

Attorney-General) [11.47] I moveTint this Bill be now read a second-tTrne. This is a B ill to make certain amendments in the Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration legislation. It may ""be regarded as more or less in the'nature of a temporary measure; it is not intended as a review of previous legislation or to meet the need for amendment generally. TheB ill practically deals with three poiutsthe position of the Deputy President of the Court, the enforcement of awards, and the position of returned soldiers in rela' tion to awards or agreements made under the A ct which accord preference to members of organizations. Under section 14 of the existing Act the President of the Court has power to appoint a Deputy with capacity to exercise, during the pleasure of the President, such powers and functions of the President as the latter may .think fit to assign to him. The appointment of the Deputy does not in any way affect the exercise of the functions of the President himself. By section I 4 A power is taken to appoint aDeputy President whenever the President is out of the Commonwealth, or is for any reason unable to appoint a Deputy. It is proposed by the B ill to repeal both section 14 and section 14A. Litigation is in progress with respect to section 14 as regards the validity of appointments made under it .

91,Mr Tudor,"Has the litigation reJournalists' case. considered that his position was so seriously in question that he did not feel justified in continuing to act as Deputy without an amendment of the law as is now proposed. Clause2 provides(1) The Governor General may, by instrument under his hand, appoint any Justice of the High Court or Judge of the Supreme Court of a State to be the deputy of the President in any Part of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity to exercise'such powers and functions of the President as the Governor General thinks lit to assign to the deputy. (2) The deputy so appointed shall be entitled to hold office during good behaviour for the unexpired period of tlie term of office of the Court from applying penalties for breaches of President for the time being, and shall be eligible for re-appointment, and shall not be removed during the said period except by the Governor General on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying. for such .removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. (3) The appointment of a deputy of the President shall not affect the exercise by the President of any power or function. This only deals with future cases. It was not considered advisable to do more than is now proposed. that the decisions given by Justices Powers, Rich, and Isaacs w ill be upset. any comment upon that aspect of the position. The question of the enforcement of awards having arisen in connection with the Waterside Workers Union versus J . W. Alexander Limited, a series of questions were placed before the High Court. The questions asked were: (1) I s the constitution of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration beyond the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and in particular as to (a) tbe arbitral provisions, and (b) the enforcing provisions? (2) I s the award invalid by reason of the appointment of the President for seven years only? (3) I s the award enforcible by the said Court? The case was fully argued, and the judgments were carefully considered. I do not propose to quote from the long and elaborate judgments delivered in that case, but, perhaps, I may conveniently summarize them by saying that the majority of Judges held that the arbitral provisions of the Arbitration Act were Mr Justice Powers valid, but that the provisions relating to the powers of the Court as to the enforcement of the awards were invalid. Mr Justice Higgins gave a short summary as to the effect of the judgments which, perhaps, I might be permitted to mention'. A f t e r the decision of the H i g h Court was given, he saidI am told that a great deal of misapprehension has arisen as to the effect of the decision given by the High Court last Friday in the case of the Waterside Workers Federation versus Alexander, that the decision referred to has the effect, as I understand, and I have no doubt about it, of preventing the Arbitration awards. .But"" the decision of the High Court in no way interferes with the power of this Court to make compulsory awards as before. The only point of difference is that after an award has been made, this Court has no power to enforce it. Enforcement of awards must be done by the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, or otherwise, as the case may be. It may help parties who are interested in cases actually pending, or to be brought forward, to know that the Arbitration Court goes on as before That means that the Arbitration Court can go on making awards and giving decisions which are binding on the parties concerned, but that difficulty has arisen with 'regard to the enforcement of such awards, and for the purpose of clearing up the position it has been thought advisable to introduce the amended provisions now under consideration. Section 44 of the original Act states1. Where any organization or person bound by an order or award has committed any breach or non-observance of any term of the order or award any penalties which the Court has power to impose may be imposed by any Court of summary jurisdiction constituted by a Police Stipendiary or Special Magistrate. Different opinions were expressed by the Judges of the H i g h Court with respect to this section, and difficulty has arisen with regard to the words "" any penalties which the Court has power to impose."" It has been held that the Arbitration Court itself has no power to impose penalties, and therefore, a Court of summary jurisdiction cannot, because it has only the same power to impose penalties as the A r b i tration Court. In order to inform honourable members of the difficulty that has arisen from the conflicting judgments, I",32,Second Reading

Tliat the .first item in the Estimates under DivisionI , The Parliament, namely, "" The President, £1,100,"" be agreed to. view of the long period that has elapsed since the delivery of the Budget statement, it is rather difficult to deal with the matters that are embodied in the Estimates in the way that they ought to be dealt with. livered his Budget speech on the 25th September last-almos t three months ago. A t that time a-number of the questions which> were dealt with by him, were fresh in the minds of honourable members. But since then many of those matters have been disposed of. Now the real object of a Budget statement is to afford the Treasurer an opportunity of outlining proposed taxation measures, of forecasting expenditure during the financial year, and of allowing honourable members a chance to discuss these questions, in order that the Government may derive whatever advantage is to be gained from such an interchange of ideas. I am not one of those who imagine that all the ability of this Farliament is centred in the occupants of the Treasury benches. Only the other day I remarked that in all probability the Estimates, which provide for an expenditure of nearly £100,000,000, would probably be dealt with in the early hours of the morning, when there were perhaps only a half-adozen members present. To-day we are witnessing the fulfilment of my prediction. The lack of interest which is taken in the discussion of the Budget is reflected in the poor attendance in the Chamber at the present moment. By postponing the consideration of the E s t i mates until practically the eleventh hour of the session, the Government are not doing what is best in their own interests, or in the interests'of the'community, and they are certainly not affording honourable members the opportunity to which they are entitled, of discussing the very many questions which arise out of the Budget statement. In short, Parliament is being denied the exercise of that control over our finances which is one of its functions. Government do the same thing? of contradiction that no Government has ever delayed the consideration of the Estimates u n t il within two or three days of the close of the session. year in which they were not brought forward t ill the close of the session, but on that occasion, they were merely discussed, not passed. if the Government were wise they would bring down a SupplyB ill to cover the period over which they desire, to adjourn -sa y some two or three months-and allow us an opportunity to exhaustively debate the Estimates when we re-assemble. One of the most important matters demanding our consideration is the control of the Northern Territory. W ill the honourable member for Denison( Mr Laird Smith), who has visited that Territory, tell me that two hours is sufficient time in which to discuss the estimates relating to the Northern Territory, or the Repatriation Department, or the Defence Department ? Yet that represents the period over which their consideration w ill extend if the whole of the Estimates are to be dealt with during the course of the next couple of days. I ask the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) whether he thinks that two hours are sufficient time to allocate to the debate of the Estimates for the Federal Capital site, which is only one of the many matters connected with the Works and Railways Department? I am satisfied that in the end the procedure which has been adopted throughout the war will be again followed in connection with the present session of Parliament. I mean that within the next two or three days , we shall be asked to adjourn unti l such time as the President and Mr Speaker may see fit to call us together again. Indeed, the adoption of that procedure is absolutely necessary if we are to avoid rendering illegal the collection of the whole of the revenue which has been derived from the Customs and Excise Bills that were introduced in 1917 and in September, 1918.

Similarly, the advance ' of the import duty upon whisky from 18s. to 25s. per gallon, has also resulted in the collection of a considerable sum. The Excise duty upon tobacco has also been advanced from Is. to Is. 8d.; upon cigars, from Is. to 2s.; and on cigarettes, from 4s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. There has not been so much importation of beer, because that has been a prohibited item as from 8th August last year. . The importation of spirits is being permitted to the extent of 70 per cent, of the importations in the previous year. tobacco has gone up from 4s. to 4s. 8d. With regard to unmanufactured tobacco, I am under the impression that about 12,000,000 to 13,000,000 lbs. weight was imported for the purposes of manufacture in Australia. At the time when the Budget statement was delivered honourable members had the whole subject fresh in their minds. was presented in this House six weeks before the armistice had been signed. -Since then the position has become entirely altered. It would have been wiser for the Government to withdraw their Estimates of Expenditure, based upon a full war year, and to have brought down a modified set of Estimates, dealing with the position as it now stands. Por example, in respect to Defence matters, expenditure is bound to be curtailed, Every ship-load of Australian soldiers returning home means a decrease in Defence expenditure, for the reason that those troops will be paid of f .

A cable message in last night's press-related that General Monash is busily engaged upon demobilization, and that it is expected that some 15,000 of our men will return to Australia each month. One of the objections raised by our boys in Great Britain has been that sailings are to be so limited that greater numbers than those I have just indicated will not be able to return during any one month. The Government realize, of course, that it would be unwise to throw larger numbers upon Mr Tudor. the labour market at any one stage. The fact remains, however, that as the men steadily return, and are paid off, there will be hugely less expenditure in the Defence Department. would be shown under the heading of "" Unexpended balances."" Treasurer would do as all Treasurers have been careful to do; that is, he would take care that the various Departments curtailed expenditure to the utmost limit, in any circumstances. But the trouble is that if a certain amount of money is available for departmental expenditure, Import duty on there is always difficulty in preventing the Departments from spending up to their limit. Take price fixing, for example. And, in regard to that phase of our war measures, honourable members recently were interested to read in the press an official notification that, so far as some half-adozen articles were concerned, there was It no longer necessity to deal with them with the price fixing machinery of the Government. I am not sure whether those six items included galvanized iron; but there were such articles as paper, soda, tartaric acid, and cream of tartar. What joy there must have been in the households of Australia when our women folk learned that such an enormous domestic item as cream of tartar,was to be freed from the clutches of the price fixers! At the same time, housewives, who have to purchase boots and shoes, and socks and stockings, know only too well that there has been no price-fixing machinery set in motion with respect to those highly important items. They are still aware, to their sorrow, that prices are about double what they were before the war. must accept a certain amount of responsibility for not dealing with matters such as those himself. mark is pertinent; but the Treasurer will recall that I resigned from the Government only about a month after it was learned that the Government had power to fix prices of various commodities.

I am of opinion that, the state of war having virtually passed away, the whole matter of price fixing w ill have to go by the board. Prime Minister informed us, in setting out a statement of Government business, that it was intended to put price fixing upon a firm basis, and to deal with it by means of an Act rather than under War Precautions regulations. that we should have an opportunity of dealing with it , but the official answer is that, since the armistice has been signed, it is not intended to .proceed with it . The Treasurer, in his Budget statement, saidIt is a matter for regret that the Commonwealth has relied upon the -British. Government to help in financing Australia's share in the war. The prosperity of Australia is remarkby an additional income tax. able, and at least we should arrange for tlie future that the current expenses of the Australian armies shall be met by Australian money. Estimates for this year have been framed, and there is reason to believe that flie British Gofortunate that we should have fallen into vernment will agree to fund the arrears of £38,345,000. I share the honourable gentleman's regrets. When the late Lord Forrest was Treasurer I urged that, since we were enjoying phenomenally good seasons and our producers were obtaining better prices than they had ever secured before the war, the income tax should at once be increased as a means of assisting us in financing the war. was then Treasurer, imposed an income tax running up to 5s. in the £ 1 , such a rate was undoubtedly high. Great BritainI do not think the income tax then reached that level. posed this gradually increasing tax by means of the remarkable system of curves which the present Prime Minister loves so much and which we have never been able to get away from. one understands. understands this system, and very few agree with the results obtained by means of it . The honourable member for Grey( Mr Poynton), who succeeded Mr. Fisher as Treasurer, proposed and carried an increase of 25 per' cent, in the income tax, but from that time until the present Treasurer took office, no further increase was made. The income tax, to my mind, is the fairest system of taxation that could be imposed. During the last few Last September the Acting days we have been dealing with a B ill to amend the War Time Profits Act. I do not know what the position is in regard to that B ill to-day, and I do not think that even a Ministerial supporter would hazard a guess with respect to it ; but I I was hopeful do know that the Treasurer's attitude ""is causing some consternation amongst his supporters. By means of the amending B ill an attempt is being made to patch up the principal Act ; but, as I said the other day, if some other means of reaching those who have been making extraordinary profits during the war could be devised, I should be prepared to accept it. In my view they can best be reached Previous Treasurers have made the mistake since the war of failing to obtain additional That is the basis upon which the revenue by means of the income tax, and I agree with the Treasurer that it is unarrears to the extent stated by him in financing Australia's share in the war. We should have obtained more revenue than we have done from those who have been enjoying magnificent seasons, and who have secured, during the war, better prices for their produce, both here and abroad, than were ever previously obtainable. When, in 1914, Mr Fisher, who As to the cost of living, there are many products the cost of which could not have been affected by the war. The produce Eveni n of market-gardens, for instance, has not been affected by the war, save, perWe imhaps, that on account of the number of enlistments skilled labour is not so freely forthcoming as it was before.

I am merely pointing out, in dealing with the cost of living, that the price of tsome commodities cannot be said to have been affected by the war. The Treasurer no doubt is on the lookout for new methods of taxation, and I direct his attention to the following telegram from Washington, published in the San ""Francisco Bulletin of 10th July last: framing the new war revenue Bill went forward in the House Ways and Means Committee to-day, with attention centering upon the list of suggestions for new or higher taxes on luxuries and necessities submitted yesterday by the Treasury Department. Members of the Committee indicated that the list would form the basis for consumption taxes in their draft of the Bill. Besides doubling present taxes on liquors and tobaccos, quadrupling soft drink levies and making general increases in other existing rates, the Treasury suggestions include :Taxes of 50 per cent, on retail prices of jewellery, watches and clocks (except those sold to army or navy men). Twenty per cent, on automobiles, bicycles, musical instruments, &c. Ten cents a gallon on gasoline, to be paid by the wholesaler. Ten per cent, on hotel bills for rooms over 2 dollars 50 cents a day or American plan over 5 dollars. Ten per cent, on all cafe or restaurant bills and taxes of unstated amounts on men's suits selling for more than 30 dollars, women's suits over 40 dollars and coats over 30 dollars; men's hats over 4 dollars; shirts over 2 dollars; pyjamas over 2 dollars; hosiery over 35 cents; shoes over 5 dollars; gloves over 2 dollars; underwear over 3 dollars; all neckwear and canes; women's dresses over 25 dollars; skirts over 15 dollars; hats over 10 dollars; shoes over 6 dollars; lingerie over 5 dollars; corsets over 5 dollars; and all furs, fans, &c., children's clothing, including suits, over .15 dollars; toilet articles over 2 dollars. In addition to all these taxes, which would be levied directly upon the consumer, the listI know that they have proposes doubling the present motion-picture admission tax and imposing a tax of 5 per cent, on moving-picture theatre rentals, with the present film tax eliminated. . A 10 per cent, tax on "" wire leases,"" intended to apply to telegraphs and telephones and other wires whose use is leased, is another of the Treasury proposals. The retail tax principle is new in the United States tax law, although it has been levied in England, France, and Germany. The Treasury suggested that 10 per cent, basis for this plan would be too low, and that any one wanting the retail goods would-pay as high as I do not say that they 20 per cent. The Treasury proposed a license tax of 10 dollars a year on soda fountains. The suggested tax on domestic servants would allow an exemption of one female servant. Others would be taxed as follows :First servant, 25' per cent, of wages paid; second servant, 50 per cent.; third, 75 per cent.; and on more than three servants (not counting the one female servant) 100 per cent, of wage paid in each case. I understand that under that system, if a man purchased a watch at a cost of £ 5 , the retailer would levy another £ 2 10s. T as a contribution to the national revenue. Again, the purchaser of a motor car costing £ 6 0 0 , would, if the tax were at the rate of 20 per cent., have to pay an additional £ 1 2 0 as a contribution to the cost of government. It may be said that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to collect such taxation, but if it has been possible to collect it in GreatB r it a in and the United States of America, there ought not to be any insuperable difficulty in the way of its collection here. been operative in Great Britain. not, I know that Treasurers are anxious to obtain as much information as possible as to new methods, of raising revenue, and I think this statement will interest the Acting Prime Minister. I have been very anxious for a long time that certain commodities should no longer escape taxation. I do not mind sharing with the Government, if necessary, the responsibility for the tax that has been i m posed upon colonial wines.

119,Mr Tudor,"Whethe r that is so orsuch a tax. I can see no more reason for imposing an Excise duty of 6d. or 7d. per gallon on colonial beer, than there is for imposing au Excise duty on colonial wines. Because of information that came to my knowledge when I was administering the Customs Department, I suggested that an Excise duty should be placed on spirits used' for fortifying colonial wines. The effect of that would be that the greater the quantity of spirit used in wine, the higher would be the tax on the manufacturer. creased revenue, would encourage the production of a lighter wine, which, I think, would be a very good thing for the community. I do not think that the Excise duty has been fixed high enough, being equal to only about 8d. per gallon. The price of beer at the brewery would be about Is. per gallon, or, with the tax added, 2s. per gallon. The. price of wine at the vineyard would be very much greater-pro bably 4s. to 6s. per gallon-and there is no reason why the tax on wine should not -be at least equal to that on beer, namely, Is. per gallon. Reverting to the importation of luxuries, I have complained ever since August, 1 1917, that the list of articles, the importasecondly, the increase of the Excise duty. tion of which was prohibited by the Government, was not large enough. honourable member for Flinders( Mr prohibition of the importation of perBruce) has stated that the luxury tax in England has never been enforced. Perhaps the Imperial authorities thought it better to deal with that problem through the income tax, or by some other means. The prohibition of the importation of luxuries into Australia was referred by the Government to a Committee, which included Mr Mcintosh, the manager of Ball and Welch. As far as I know, no honourable member of this Parliament has ever seen the report of that Committee. But the. Government, acting on the Committee's recommendation, prohibited the importation of-(1 ) ale and other beer, porter, cider and perry, spirituous, in bulk or in bottle; (2) potable spirits; (3) perfumed spirits and bay rum; (4) biscuits; (5) confectionery; (6) eggs, in shell or otherwise; (7) fur apparel; (8) perfumery; . (9) jewellery, imitation jewellery and imitation precious stones; and (10) bodies for motor vehicles, whether imported separately or forming part of a complete vehicle. The prohibition, so far as ale, porter, ""cider, and perry were concerned, meant practically nothing. In regard to potable spirits, which, of course, included brandy, whisky, gin, and schnapps, the Minister decided that the merchants should be allowed to import a quantity equal to 70 per cent, of the importations in the previous year. The importations in the previous year had That duty, besides yielding inbeen extraordinarily large, and honourable members will find that, as a result of that permission by the Minister, the importation of .spirits to-day is practically as large as it was in pre-war years. refers to the value? I think that statement will be proved by reference to Knibbs' Customs Statistics, which show both the quantity and value of the imports. The reasons for the great increase in the value of spirits were, firstly, the commandeering by the British Government of an enormous quantity of spirits for munition purposes, and, MT. WATT -And decreased production. fumed spirits and bay rum was to have been absolute. Bui as a result of complaints made by the importers, the Minister decided to allow those articles to be brought in to the extent of 50 per cent, of the previous year's importations. So far as I know, that permission is still in force. The importation of biscuits has always been very small. I believe that 90 per cent, of the biscuits consumed in Australia are made locally. The only importations are a few fancy biscuits by some of the well known manufacturers of the United Kingdom'. So far as the prohibition related to confectionery, it .was of great importance to local industries. Even to-day one can see imported confectionery in the window of every first class confectionery shop. But I am pleased to say that as a result of the prohibition, and the resultant diminution of competition from abroad, local manufacturers",39,Luxuries Hard Hit In Tax Bill Washington July 10 Preparation S For

I often think that in prohibiting the importation of eggs the Government must have had in mind the unfortunate experience of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) at Warwick. The prohibition of the importation of f u r apparel was not very important. I suppose that every Ministerf or Trade and Customs who has brought forward an amending Tariff has realized very soon afterwards that mistakes have been made. It is impossible to avoid errors when dealing with a Tariff of 400 items, many of which are subdivided under sixty heads. I admit that a mistake was made in fixing such a low duty on f u r apparel, and I hope that when an amending Tariff comes before the House a higher duty will be imposed. motor bodies has been held in abeyance from time to time, and I do not know whether or not it is absolute to-day. There is no reason why motor bodies should not be manufactured in Australia as in other parts of the world. Government find it necessaiy to repeal the prohibition proclamation they w ill in the amending Tariff deal effectively with such imports as interfere with Australian industries. cuits from abroad they should be prepared to pay a high price for them. And if the fixed duties, and the alternative ad valorem rate, are not high enough to discourage the importation of confectionery, the rates should be increased. The same remark applies to the duty on imported motor bodies. We can make them in Australia, and if the present duty does not give sufficient protection to local industry we must increase it . Sitting suspended from 12.58 to 2.S0 p.m. Mr Tudor. Budget speech, referred to the Wheat Pools, the Metal Board, and the general financing of the primary products of the since we discussed those matters that I I believe that do not intend to deal with them to-day. He referred also to the proposal to establish a Bureau of Science and Industry, to do which a B ill has been passed through the Senate and is now before this Chamber. If there is anything which requires discussion it is that proposal, but sufficient time is not being given to us to deal with it . Shipbuilding is another matter on which the House is to be asked to legislate before the end of the year. According to the Budget-papers, the Government has under construction twenty^ four steel vessels-si x at Williamstown, six at Walsh Island, two at Cockatoo Island, four at Maryborough (Queensland), four at Adelaide, and two in Tasmania.

Everyone can be wise after the event; the difficulty is to be wise before a thing happens. to go into foreign ports and purchase shipping at prices going up to £50 per ton. formation we have, regarding prices is contained in an offer from England to build ships for about £ 2 7 a ton. Freights jumped up enormously during the war. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, I did my best to keep track of these matters, because I wished to know the effect of freights on the price of commodities. A t that time the freight was £ 2 0 per ton from the Pacific slope to England, and about £ 7 10s. per ton from the Argentine to England. Subsequently rates went still higher. In three months, with freights at £ 1 0 per ton, a vessel doing a trip and a half would make £ 1 5 per ton. freight to Australia during the war? but I understand that it was something over £7 per -ton. Soon after the war started we were offered freight at £5 per ton, but the price jumped considerably. Before the war you could bring kerosene as deck cargo on a sailing ship from New York to Australia for 6d. per case, and before I left the Customs Department that rate had risen to 6s. per case, while the steamer rate had increased from 2s. to 3s. per case to 12s, per case. Australia kerosene is in general use, and this is the only country in the world, I believe, in which it is purchased regularly by the case or the tin. Before the war it used to cost 6s. or 7s. per case. Honourable members can see how the rise in freight must have affected its price. I hope that with the building of ships all over the world that is now taking place freights may drop. Recently when the subject was under discussion here, a member stated that freights would keep at T h a t was a rascally their present prices for some time to come. 25 per cent since then. have fallen 25 per cent, since the armistice was signed; but if they do not f a l l more than 50 per cent, it w ill be a bad lookout for some of our exporters. We can afford to pay a freight of I d . per lb., or £9 6s. Sd. per ton, upon meat, which is worth od. per lb., and upon butter, which is worth from Is. to Is. ""6d. per lb., and upon wool, but not upon commodities worth only I d . per lb., such as wheat and f r u it . It is most important that the shipbuilding programme of the Government should be carried out, and that the vessels should be built at as moderate a rate as possible. I do not think that we shall ever get back to the working conditions that prevailed in other parts of the world before the war. The Prime Minister of Great Britain( Mr Lloyd George), in his first electioneering address, recently stated that the physical condition of Britishers was worse than that of any others engaged in the recent struggle, and that that was on account of the industrial conditions sat on the Ministerial cross-benches, I described the conditions which prevailed in England when I worked there. Havi ng come to Englandf r o m Australia they appalled me. I saw children in Lancashire and Yorkshire going at 6 o'clock in the morning to work in the mills, their afternoons being devoted to their schooling, while other children had schooling in the mornings, and worked in the afternoons. It made my heart bleed to see children of twelve and thirteen In years of age treated in this way, when they should have been free to play like other children. I believe that the industrial conditions in the jute mills of Scotland are as bad as those in the cotton mills of Lancashire, or the woollen millsof Yorkshire. I hope, however, that the war has aroused England to a knowledge of her industrial conditions, and that these w ill be improved.

I am glad that Mr Lloyd George has stated that they must be i m proved. I certainly do not think they will remain as they are.

No one desires to see these vessels con-, structed at such a rate that those employed on them wil l be sweated in order that goods may be carried across the seas at cheap rates. There are many other points of interest touched on by the Treasurer in his Budget speech, but I do not desire to refer to all of them now. There is, however, one matter on which I should like to say a word. Two or three weeks ago I asked the Treasurer ( Mr Watt) a question in regard to the premature publication in some newspapers of the report of the Repatriation Board. This is a matter that has"" been referred to in another where it was stated that, although the report had been issued to the newspapers in confidence, to be held by them permission was given to publish it, two newspapers had broken that I well remember in 1914, when a new Tariff was introduced, that copies were sent to all the newspapers in Australia, right around from Cairns to Geraldton, under similar conditions. This of course, is desirable and necessary, particularly in the case of the Tariff, when the protection of the revenue has to be considered; and it is a great to tbe newspapers, inasmuch as they are able to have the information printing when the time comes, and all Mr Tudor. journals are placed on the same level. Unless some arrangement of the kind is made, the Melbourne newspapers, or the newspapers of whatever place is at the time the Seat of Government, obtain a great advantage; and that, of course, is not. desirable. In the case to which I am immediately referring, I understand that the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and the Adelaide Advertiser broke the trust that was reposed in them. Sir Langdon Bonython, the proprietor of the Adelaide Advertiser, is a member of the Repatriation Committee, and I acquit him of all blame in connection with this unauthorized publication of the report That gentleman is so much away from Adelaide, on repatriation business, that I It is feel sure that he had nothing to do with the breach of trust. The other two daily papers in Adelaide, the Register and the Daily Herald, honorably observed the conditions under which the information was supplied to them; but those who did not do so ought to be punished in some way; for if a newspaper will publish a report of that kind, they will publish any other information obtained in confidence. Yesterday, I asked the Treasurer ( Mr' Watt) if he would obtain for me the report of the Repatriation Board before the Estimates were disposed of , so that I might ascertain whether any action had beietn taken in regard to the Sydney Daily Telegraph and the Adelaide Advertiser. There is another matter in connection with repatriation to which I desire to place, refer. In connection with the-employment of returned men in various trades and callings, it has been decided to appoint committees representative of employers until and employed to watch over the interests of those concerned. When the value of confidence. the work done by disabled or invalid returned men is less than the r u l ing rate of wage in any calling, the Government make up the difference, and the representative of the employees procedure, is on the Board to see that fair play is observed, so that not only the ordinary workmen, but the taxpayers, may suffer no injustice, and the money not be made convenience use of for the purpose of helping certain businesses. ' The following letter was set up for addressed by the Deputy Comptroller of Repatriation, Major C. S. Cunningham, to Mr De Gruchy, the Secretary of the Tinsmiths and Sheet Metal Workers Union, Melbourne, on the 26th JulyThe regulations of the Department of Repatriation provide, inter alia, for the setting up of a Soldiers' District Industrial Committee which shall govern the training and employment of returned disabled soldiers in various trades or callings to which they may be trained. Regulation 30 lays down that a Soldiers' District Industrial Committee shall be formed as directed by the Minister, and shall consist of a chairman to be appointed by the Minister, two representatives of the employers in the trade of the trainee, and two representatives of the union covering the trade or calling of the trainee. It is desired that such a Committee shall be formed forthwith for the regulation of training, &c, in the tinsmithing and sheet-metal working trade, and I would be glad to receive at your earliest convenience, the nominations from your union, of its two representatives for this Committee. I attach hereto a copy of regulation 31 which outlines the functions of the Soldiers' District Industrial Committee. Regulation 31 is as followsA Soldiers' District Industrial Committee shall(a) Consider opportunities for employment of soldiers or their dependants; (b) Decide after trial as to the suitability of applicants for particular callings; (c) Assess the efficiency of the trainee after the commencement of his training; (d) Re-assess the trainee's efficiency every three months; (e) Periodically review the facilities for training in workshops and technical schools; (/) Deal with disputes between persons entered for training in private workshops under regulation 42, and the employer, in particular disputes arising as to what is the ruling rate of wages in any industry; and (<?) Have power to call for and take evidence when necessary. The union held a meeting and appointed representatives, and on the 16th August wrote to the Repatriation Department stating that Mr R. C. West and Mr de Gruchy had been chosen. This letter was acknowledged by M a j o r Cunningham on the 19 th August, in the following terms:I beg to acknowledge yours of the 16th instant, informing us that Mr R. C. West and yourself have been nominated as representatives on the Soldiers' District Industrial Committee. You will be notified in due course the date of the first meeting. Thanking you for your assistance and courtesy. That is the last that the union has heard of the matter, and the Board has not been called together, although there are returned soldiers working in the industry. Mr de Gruchy, in a letter he sent to the Repatriation Department, dated 16th September, saysAt the present time returned soldiers are being employed in a certain factory, and have been for several months, where the employer is only paying the men 40 per cent., and the Department of Repatriation is paying the balance, 60 per cent.; and I can assure you from information we have received, the employer should be paying the men at least 80 per cent, for the -class of work they are on, which Bhows the necessity for this Committee to meet in the best interests of the Repatriation Department. the Repatriation Department visit this factory ? is only right that, in the interests of the returned soldiers, the union, and the taxpayers, the Department should not pay too large a proportion of the wages involved. I am quite prepared to take the word of Mr die Gruchy that the employers should pay at least 80 per cent, of the wages. Only recently, along with several honourable members, including the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), I had the pleasure of visiting the Working Men's College, where a number of returned soldiers are being vocationally trained. We there saw one man who had lost his right arm, but who, with an artificial limb, was able to hold metal, and turn out first-class work. If that is possible in six weeks under tuition at the College, I think it will be found necessary to re-assess the value of such work, not only every three months, but at much shorter intervals. I understand that it is a rule in Government Departments for someone to go through the Hansard reports and collect such portions of the debates as are of in terest and importance to the Minister of any particular Department; and I hope that this matter w ill be brought under the notice of the repatriation authorities. I am extremely anxious that the returned men should be properly trained, and,",42,Smith Wha T Was The Which Had Prevailed I N 1901 When I

142,Mr Tudor,"I do not know, but i tsecondly, that the workers and the taxpayer should receive a f a i r deal. to send on the letter you have read to the Ministerf o r Repatriation? to do so. Last week I brought under the attention of the House the treatment which the wif e of a wounded soldier is alleged to have received from one of the officers of the Repatriation Department. I not only wrote to the Ministerf o r Repatriation (SenatorM ill e n ) , but saw that gentleman in regard to the matter, and he promised that if the lady would go down to his Department and identify the man, and if the facts were as she had stated, he would do all in his power to. see that such a thing did not occur again. I would like to bring under notice the case of Major Carroll, in connection w i th which the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) asked a question on the 3rd October last. I should not refer to the case on the present occasion if it were riot that Major Carroll is to retire within a few weeks. Honourable members who have been in the Housef o r a few years w ill remember that in 1914 a Select Committee was appointed by the Senate to deal w i th this case. In reply to the question asked by the honourable member for Capricornia, the Crown Solicitor has given an opinion upon the case, evidently as submitted to h i m by the Defence Department in 1916. Turning to the report of the Select Committee on ithe 14th. September, 1914, page 6, question 89, it would appear that the facts upon which the Crown Solicitor gave his opinion were inaccurate. The following is a portion of the evidence to which I refer:Are you "" Captain"" Carroll or "" Major"" Carroll?I am Major Carroll, according to the Gazette, according to General Orders of the Commonwealth Military Forces, and according to Army Orders issued in South Africa. On my return from South Africa to Queensland, Colonel Ricardo would not recognise my rank as major, on the ground that to do so would be to put me over the heads of other officers. When I was retrenched in Queensland, and sent temporarily to New South Wales, I continued my correspondence on the subject of the recognition of my majority, and I was so certain of my rank that I asked that the matter should be referred to tbe highest military authority in Australia. I take it that that is the Governor General. I wrote to the Chief Staff Officer in New South Wales, calling attention to the fact that I was addressed as "" Captain,"" though I had been promoted to the full rank of Major, and although that rank was recognised in the ComI shall be very pleased monwealth Military Forces in a General Order published in the Gazette No. 29, 1902. M a j or Carroll is to be retired, as major at the age of fifty-five. He has obtained his promotion, and he contends that he should have had it in 1901. His case is important, in view of the fact that we shall have many men returning from the Front holding various ranks; and it may prove an object lesson, and prevent officers who have stayed at home taking precedence over those who have served abroad. Captain Carroll was not serving with the Queensland contingent, but waa serving with the 20th Battery Royal Field Artillery , as can be seen from the following extract from A r m y Orders, South Africa, dated the 14th October, 1901: Appointments -Subject to the approval of the Queensland Government, Capt. J. W. M. Carroll, Queensland Permanent Staff, to ba Major, supernumerary to establishment. Dated 7th July, 1901. It is also proved by the following memorandum, which is Exhibit 23, to the Report of the Select Committee: Captain J. W. Carroll, C.M.F., was attached to the Royal Field Artillery (20th Battery R.F.A.) on the departure of his contingent (the 1st Q.I.B.) to Australia in. 1901. He was appointed Major in Army Orders, South Africa, dated 7/7/01 (certified extract attached). He commanded the 20th Battery R.F.A. daring that period of 1901 when Major King was in command of a column -H . A. Coddington, Major, CO. Natal District. Lord Kitchener cabled to Queensland asking if the Government would consent to this promotion to the rank of major. This was granted, as can be seen in Queensland Government Gazette dated 29th November, 1901. TheK i ng then promoted Captain Carroll to the f u l l rank of major. He continued to serve with the 20th Battery Royal FieldA r t i l lery as a major of .the Queensland permanent staff u n t i l his recall in 1902. The following is an extract from Cape Colony Orders, dated 27th March, 1903: Major J. W. M. Carroll, Queensland Permanent Staff (attached R.F.A.), is granted leave of absence in Cape Colony for six weeks",44,Smith Wha T Was The Which Had Prevailed I N 1901 When I

South Africa, because, on Major Carroll's return, as shown in General Orders dated 10th A p r i l , 1902, the name of Major Carroll appears among the commissioned officers mentioned as being due to arrive at Albury on the 20th A p r i l , 1903. As Major Carroll is to retire/ before this House may meet again, he is putting forward his claim, which I am voicing. He has been deprived of his position, and men who have not had the service he had in South Africa, or service in the present war, have been promoted over his head. As he will be fifty-five years of age next year, he will have to retire, this being the be exercised in regard to financial matage of retirement for majors. He claims that he is entitled to the f u l l rank of major from the 7th July, 1901; and that as promotion comes every five years, he should have attained the rank of Lieut colonel in 11906, and colonel in! 1911. He would not then have had to retire at the age of fifty-five. This morning, Mr Speaker, in answer to a question as to whether the officers and servants of this Parliament had received consideration in the matter of promotions and increases of pay, said that their claims had been given consideration. The increased cost of living has affected every one. House rents have gone up, and the price of clothing, food, and every necessity has increased. every arbitration award provision has been made for increased wages. The Estimates show that the foreman gardener attached to this building was paid £ 1 6 8 last year, and receives the same amount of wages this year. I admit that it is promotion, because, unfortunately, his predecessor passed away last year. Three other gardeners were employed last year, and were paid £445. There are only two of 'them employed this year, and the item has been reduced to £ 3 1 3 . I appeal to the House Committee to consider the position of these men, with a view to granting them an increase of wages on account of the increased cost of living. mittee gave the gardeners an increase a little while ago. honourable member's statement. My ignorance on the point shows positively Commonwealth acknowledged the that the men have not spoken to me in regard to the matter. About a fortnight ago J asked the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr. Wise) whether the services of members of the censorship staff had been dispensed with,"" and this morning he informed me that the services of several members of the Censor's staff had been dispensed with. I cannot see the need for retaining more than one or two censors in each State. I know that the Acting; Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has told me that it is absolutely necessary that newspapers should be prevented from saying anything likely to reflect on an All y , and that care should ters, and I agree with him to that extent; but beyond retaining one or two censors in each State, I think we should throw the whole of the responsibility on the newspapers themselves. I do not know of an instance of any newspaper having published one of the orders issued under the censorship regulations, and there have been hundreds of them issued. Some newspapers have published matter which was not permitted to appear in other pub-' lications, while members of the Censor's staff have been practically living on the premises of other newspapers. It seems to me there is no need to retain the huge censorship staff which has been employed during the last few years. If we were to follow the recommendations of the ConIn ference of Editors, which met in A p r i l last and dealt with the question of the censorship, I think we could do away with many of the censors. I shall deal with the question of non-official postmasters and postmistresses and with the Defence Department's treatment of dependants when we come to the respective items if the opportunity presents itself for doing so. I know what will be the Treasurer's reply to any advocacy of an increase in the rate of pension paid to invalids and old-age pensioners. He w ill say that the matter was dealt with in 1916. I have not the figures with me, and I do not know what the increase in house rents and in the price of groceries and meat has been-thos e are practically all of the items that Mr Knibbs deals",45,Smith Wha T Was The Which Had Prevailed I N 1901 When I

146,Mr Tudor,"T am glad to hear thewith-bu t I know that there has been a greater increase in the cost of clothing than there has been in all the other items put together. This increase has not been included in Mr Knibbs' figures. It would be a difficult matter to calculate it . Suits of clothes vary considerably in price. A suit that could be bought for £ 6 6s. a littl e while ago costs double that amount to-day. to wear less clothing. to go about without boots. a condition of affairs in Australia in which children have to go about without boots because their parents cannot afford to buy them, it is high time that the Government took a hand in the matter. Evidence has been given before various Commissions showing that the cost of distribution of boots'is more than the cost of production. Allowing the cost of raw material at 6s. and the cost of manufacture at 4s., the cost of ' distribution, wholesale and retail, is very often as much as 5s. or 6s. A t Port Pirie the smelting company, for the protection of its work'ers, has been compelled to establish shops for the distribution of goods, in order to avoid some of the charges imposed by middlemen. However, in regard to old age pensions, I hope that the Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) w ill be able to reconsider the should have a littl e of both. matter, and see whether it will not be possible to give the pensioners an amount equivalent to the value of the 10s. per week they received when the pension was first established in 1909. If he says that the conditions obtaining tb-day are not permanent, and that we are likely to get back to times when prices will be more normal, some temporary arrangement might be made by which these people who find it difficult to exist to-day will be able to live under more favorable conditions. Monaro) [3.15] I do not propose to take up the time of the Committee at any length, because we have reached such a late hour in the session. Estimates are brought forward under the old custom or practice, namely, that we should address ourselves to grievances before granting Supply. We cannot do that on this occasion; but such a disability is not unusual, since there has grown up amongst Governments the custom of living on Supply Bills and dealing with the Estimates at practically the last moment. We have had some shocking examples of that system, and, having regard to them, we have not too much to complain of to-day. The circumstances under which we are dealing with these Estimates are unique, It will be necessary for us since they were submitted to us in time of war, and we are called upon to discuss them in time of peace. No one can say when the peace terms will be actually If we have reached signed; but the position to-day is very different from that which prevailed when the Budget speech was delivered. T therefore think that we could not have a better chance of cutting down the Estimates than that which now presents itself. We cannot go on living at the present rate. I do not offer this criticism in a factious spirit. As one who does not enjoy good health,-, it would be better for me, from a personal point of view, to swim with the tide, and not to make statements to which Ministers object. But the general opinion is that we are living at too high a rate, and' that we must either cut down the national expenditure or increase taxation. do both. Taxation to-day is heavy enough; but I do not throw the responsibility for it solely upon the shoulders of the Government. They, after all, are only the servants of the people, and have to do the best they can in the circumstances. They have done very well, and I take no exception to their action. They naturally slip at timeseven the Acting Prime Minister( Mr. W a t t ) occasionally slips; but no one wants to say an unkind word of him. The only complaint that I have to make against him is that he is attempting too country should be governed by one man, and that is the position to-day. cosiplaint was that the country was being governed by Boards. remind the honourable member that I am not prepared to take a punch in the eye",46,Smith Wha T Was The Which Had Prevailed I N 1901 When I

I am told that to attempt to reduce these Estimates would be to censure the Government. I do not share that view. In the New South Wales Parliament we used to send back the Estimates, and we have had them reduced by as much as £50,000. In those days we had in office men of the Parkes and Dibbs type, compared with whom recent-day Ministers are but political pigmies. Those men realized that they had to pay some attention to the desires of the people, and surely I am entitled, as a representative of the people, to express my views and to propose to reduce the Estimates without having laid against me the charge that I am seeking to censure the Government. I remember Lincoln's advice, "" Never swap horses while crossing the stream."" We are crossing a turbid, swollen stream at the present time, but the reins are being held by men of experience, and they should know exactly what course to follow. The Acting Prime Minister, in answering questions put to him in this House from day to day, is a perfect political eincyolopsedia, and displays a knowledge of detail and a grasp of the situation such as no ordinary man could be expected to have. When I say that he has taken too much upon himself,I do not wish to cast any reflection upon him or his colleagues.

During the good seasons we have enjoyed we ought to have imposed more taxation, but we neglected our opportunity. Men and women, who have made hundreds of thousands of pounds, should have contributed more to meet our requirements when trouble comes upon the community. What w ill happen if we strike years of drought and depression ? now all the available sources of revenue? tapped a good many of them. The Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton) made an interjection regarding the war expenditure. Surely the honourable member knows that, on a population basis, our expenditure is nearly up to that of Great Britain, and we have not finished with it yet. Hundreds of thousands of our men are still overseas, and surely no honourable member will contend that we should not look after them when they return. But what provision are we making for them ? Our per £144, Britain's debt bill of £ 1 5 7 . Honourable members will see that we are very close to the border line; we cannot go much further. There are means of overcoming this trouble-wh y do we not utilize them ? I find that the Estimates include an amount of £6,421 for the Commonwealth Police Force. honourable member defend that expenditure ? I do not wish to discuss the reasons as to why that Force was created. were passing through strenuous times, and desperate remedies. I can quite understand that in the stress of trouble some expenditure has been wrongfully incurred. But what is the proper thing for us to do to-day? We must use common sense, and realize that if we continue spending as we are doing now, we shall go headlong down the hill to ruin. We should realize that there is no need for the continuance of this Police Force. I read recently that Sergeant Kenny, who minently in the Warwick incident, has beeu promoted. Does that fact suggest that he had overstepped his duty and had done anything wrong? I shall listen with pleasure to any honourable member who will t r y to convince me that the provision of £6,421 for the Commonwealth Police Force is a reasonably sane p r o position. We know that the Estimates are prepared by public servants. I have nothing to say against public servants as individuals. It is cowardly to attack men when they cannot defend themselves. But the Service, as a body, is overnot tapping staffed. In a community of 5,000,000 people there are 240,000 public servants. We have I thank God that we have some good public servants, who will stand up to Ministers, and to anybody else, and fight for the interests of the taxpayer; but there are tens of thousands of them who are overpaid and underworked. On the other hand, many thousands of them are doing nothing. I say that a man is doing nothing when he merely sits in a room and writes a minute to an officer in the next room and sends for a messenger to register it . Thousands pf men are doing little more than that. We know Federal and State debt b ill , that often a junior officer makes a recomhead of population, is now mendation which is initialed by a senior as compared with Great officer and placed before a Minister who is too busy to analyze it . Because of these red-tape methods the Commonwealth, has the huge number of 240,000 public servants. I am often told that, in criticising the Service, I am "" batting on a wet wicket,"" because numbers of public servants and their W ill any relatives live in my electorate. But I tell them on the platform that the present state of things cannot continue. It is We the officers who are responsible for many of the items which appear on the Esticases demand desperate mates.

If at any time. I have occasion to criticise him I shall do it when he is present. We must all admit that William Morris Hughes did a lot for this country. the hour of stress and trouble he stood out in bold relief, and the people looked to him to protect them from the noisy minority who might possibly become a majority. Sir Edmund Barton estimated that the new services of the Commonwealth would cost the country £300,000 per annum. Somebody at that time estimated that the expenditure would be nearly £750,000 , and Sir Edmund Barton said that the statement was extraordinary. I wonder what he thinks to-day of new services costing £15,000,000. Has our population increased so wonderfully ? Have we progressed so very much ? Is the position of Australia greatly improved ? I do not think it is. good deal about the expenditure that has taken place in London. A previous Government provided for the building of Australia Housei n London at an estimated cost, including land, of between £300,000 and £400,000. The actual expenditure including furnishings, has been nearly £1,000,000 . We have read particulars of the great apartments 60 feet long, and the audience 'chambers. It has been said that Australia House is better than Buckingham Palace. If so, it is "" some house."" suitably housed ? but he should also be suitably worked. I have nothing to say against Mr Fisher as a public servant; but what is he doing ? We have two Ministers at Homei n addition to him, and yet it is said that another Minister is to be sent, though when I and other members ask questions on the subject we receive no definite reply.

The Government pays 5 per cent, interest on that little parcel of paper. Where does that sort of financing lead us? We know the banks have behaved well. them. But God knows where we should be were it not for their generous business spirit. rich and poor people of this country.

They have been of service to us, and I take no exception to them, so long as they are handled on proper lines; but they are growing to an alarming extent, according to my idea of finance. The Commonwealth Bank is, I believe, well conducted, and has some of our brainiest officials in the conduct of its affairs; but, on the word of men who ought to know, I have no hesitation in saying that the Bank, to a large -extent, lives on ness. vernment money lying in the Bank with mo return in the shape of interest. I do not wish to be misunderstood when I am speaking of this matter. I do not blame the Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) , though I hope he has made some alteration. All Mining has been I can think is that he must be too busy, because, from the little I know about him, he is too "" k e e n "" to stand that sort of business.

They are always ready to stand up against Ministers, members, or anyNevertheless, the body else; and that is a good thing. But the Bank should not be able to issue great balance-sheets, principally at the expense of Government business, and attempt to show successful results on such a basis. I find that the State and Federal debts now run into more than People rail at £700,000,000. That is not much when you say it quickly, but it will take some paying for ; and I should be very glad to The banks belong to the hear some honourable member outline a method.

If that be so, the country will simply topple over with its growing expenditure.

Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) is evidently of the same opinion as myself, because in my absence he asked the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) to give time for the discussion of a motion I have on the notice-paper to call a convention, with a view to cutting down the number of governmental authorities in Australia. However, the honourable member accepted [351]2 the bland statement of the Acting Prime Minister that he would consider the matter. The honourable gentleman considers many things, and that is the end of them. There is too much duplication all round, and in this connection I should like to take the Acting Prime Minister to task. On one occasion, in a speech, he said that this duplication must be stopped; but I ask him, what about the Income Tax Department and the Land Tax Department? I remember that on one occasion he offered a State to collect its income tax for one-third of what the collection is costing to-day. I £1,500,000. save that amount, not that it would be saved on the Estimates. people have to find the money. Why not have one Taxation Department? Why not follow the example of little Tasmania, and have one electoral roll for both Commonwealth and States?

My own opinion is that, in' the future, we shall see ships crossing the ocean, crowded like motor buses in the street, bringing hundreds of thousands to Australia; and that is our hope, for the more people we have, the more easily we shall be able to meet the inevitable taxation. No one can say that there is no room for new industries, for we must have them if we are to prosper. I do not object to a large expenditure if it is reproductive, and gives the people a chance. I appeal to the Acting Prime Minister to "" get a move on,"" and reduce some of our enormous expenditure. What about the Northern Territory mess?

A t that time, I pointed to two places in my electorate, where, since then, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been wasted; and this only shows our inefficient system of government.

That decision Whether he knows it or not, met with the f u l l approval of the people of Australia, with the exception, perhaps, of those residing within territory I am quite sure that he cannot bordering on the Federal Capital.

248,Bv The Honor,"Mr Watt I do not know whethershould not be frank if I did not tell the Committee exactly what I think with respect to the subject. The honourable member for Eden Monaro suggested that these Estimates should be taken back. I do not know whether he has done himself the justice of reading them. If he has, he will recognise that if the Committee were to carry his amendment, the Government would not be able to save £10,000 on the Estimates as presented. That is not only my own opinion, but the opinion of the best judges in the Department who operated with me in the compilation of the Estimates. It does not refer to the back pages of these Estimates, and it is in respect of them that I think the honourable member-if I may say this of so old a Parliamentarian-is committing a blunder. these Estimates passed in the sense that I would use the word, but they have all been authorized. None of the items from page 303 onwards will appear in the Appropriation B ill . The Appropriation Bills will cover only the items to be found on pages 1 to 303 inclusive. As to them, after many months of work upon the Estimates, and after mature consideration, I venture to express the opinion that neither with the help of the microscope, nor the pair of scissors to which the honourable member referred, could he pare off £10,000. of opinion. not merely my own view, but the opinion of the men best able to judge of the facts. I have worked on the preparation of these Estimates with the responsible officers of the Department, and have checked this opinion, since this matter came up, with some of the most responsible minds in the Department, and I say that the Estimates could not be cut down to the extent of £10,000. regard to the pages from 303 onwards, honourable members know f u l l well that they appear merely as a plain statement, with no legal effect whatever, to show what the total expenditure of the nation is. The items appearing on those pages were authorized when our loan flotations were authorized, and at the present time, as honourable members know, in addition to the money which has been gathered in as the result of the last two loan operations, we still have the authority of this Parliament to raise and to spend another £54,000,000. Throughout the period of the war, whether wisely or not, authorizations for the raising and disbursement of loan moneys have been given en masse, and they are not affected at all by the items in these Estimates. It is true that in the case of these later loan Estimates there will probably be some shrinkages if the peace terms are signed at an early date. I know the basis of those items. I have already ticked off many of them in respect of which I think large savings in our loan expenditure will take place. penditure ? items paid out of loan account which, if they had to be met in ordinary times, would be provided for out of revenue. The Commonwealth Shipping Board, for instance, is provided for out of loan account. How soon we can scrap that machinery with safety to the producers of this country, I cannot now say; but of the £10,000 provided for that body, several thousands may, perhaps, he saved, although the provision made for one-half the financial year has already been expended. Then, again, there are items in respect'of recruiting, for special audits of war accounts, and for other matters of the kind attaching to war expenditure. guards, with which we are rapidly doing away. the home service guards were required during the period of the war, but at the present time they are gradually being diminished. Those items will be saved. The Leader of the Opposition referred to this very phase of the expenditure; With and I want to assure him that the Treasury will take good care that the Departments are not allowed-merel y because they have nominally obtained this authority under either, the Loan or the General Estimates-to spend beyond the absolute requirements of the month, or the",59,Chapman T H E N For Him To Fence The Question I N That

We do. that the Committee can refer back these Estimates, and order the Government to do its bidding, he makes a mistake. The Government will not do that bidding. I wish him to understand that plainly, not as a threat nor as a suggestion that he is not actuated by proper motives, but as a friendly intimation. The Government considered these Estimates carefully, and at the time they were introduced they were right. They are still right, and all the re-examination of them that the honourable member proposes will not save £10,000. W it h regard to other expenditure which will not be included in the Appropriation B ill , we shall save all the money that it is possible to save, but beyond that we cannot go. If the Committee decides to send these Estimates back for re-organization it must take the consequences. I wish honourable members to understand that. Every honourable member must have been pleased with the debate which has taken place between the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Chapman) and the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) , but been perfectly clear to all the officers that the in justice to both of them. I intend to reproduce in Hansard the finding of the Royal Commission which inquired into the Federal Capital administration. If ever a Commission was justified, it was that one; if ever a Commission's findings were flouted, the findings of that Commission were. The inquiry was based mainly on charges made in the House by the present Postmaster-General( Mr Webster). not worth the paper they are written on. lieve them than I would believe the honourable member when he speaks in that way. I am confident that over £250,000 has been lost to this country, and I wish to read the report of the Royal Commissioner, so that the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro may be understood. The Acting Prime Minister, with all his eloquence, and ability, and charm of manner, tried to discount what the honourable member said. This is what the Royal Commissioner ( Mr Wilfred Blacket) reported. Upon all the evidence, and particularly upon that which has been stated or referred to in When he tells us in his suave way this report, I find that the reasons why Mr Griffin between 18th October, 1913, and 15th November, 1915, performed no substantial pari of his duties under his contract with the Commonwealtli are as stated in four of the five charges advanced in his behalf, viz., charges 1, 2, 3, and 5, and are as under: 1. That necessary information and assistance were withheld from him and his powers were usurped by certain officers; 2. That he and his office were ignored, his rights and duties under his contract denied, and false charges of default made against him; 3. That the Honourable W. O. Archibald and members of the Departmental Board endeavoured to set aside his design and to substitute the Board's own design; and 5. That there was in the Department a combination, including the Honourable W. O. Archibald and certain officers, hostile to Mr Griffin, and /to . his design for the Capital City; and that the Honourable W. O. Archibald and the officers mentioned in my references to the evidence under these charges are severally responsible to the extent already indicated by me for this result. But I think it necessary that I should emphasize the fact that ufteTMr Archibald's accession to office it must have Ministerial policy was direeted against the carrying out of Mr Griffin's design, and any acts they did «n frustration of Mr Griffin's efforts were tnerefore done in furtherance, as they believed, of the Minister's desires. I cannot say that this excuses them; still the greatest responsibility in respect of the obstruction to Mr GrirTin >n ' with the Minister. Holding the views that ne did as to the "" grave mistake"" that he considered had been made in the engagement of Mr Griffin, he should have adopted one of two alternatives; either to have cancelled the contract and reverted to the design of the Departmental Board, or else to have allowed Mr Griffin's I would sooner becontract to be performed and his design carried out.

One could speak for hours on the of the Budget and the evils of the present moment, but I shall confine my remarks chiefly to one subject.

I know the horrore Mr Bingle, also a member of the that followed the crash of the boom.

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro justly said that it is not ' economy to sack the workers, because they are the spenders of the community, every penny that they earn going into circulation. We were willing to pour out millions for the conduct of .the war, and we should be prepared to spend hundreds of thousands in keeping our people employed. Wool and wheat are the twin brothers of our natural resources. What are we doing with our wool? We send it across the sea to be made into cloth, and when we get that cloth back we have to pay, not only for the making of it , but for the worth of textile machinery has been exfreight across the sea and back. It is to the eternal dishonour of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) that he has said that we do not want any new industries in Australia. He has crucified the industry which produced the coat which I am wearing. The men engaged in this, industry are not getting a dog's show. They have to sell their cloth at 15s. a. yard to Buckley and Nunn. Foy and Gibson have promised to do all that they can for them, but some of the yarn that is being supplied by the Government mills is worse than shoddy. Any one could easily untwist it so 'that it would fall apart, being of such short staple. weavers justly said to me, when I spoke to him at his loom, "" If a suit of clothes were made for you out of yarn like that, you would not want to buy such cloth again."" I am proud of the cloth I am now wearing. One of the biggest experts that ever came from England, who is employed by the Commonwealth Government as an adjuster of wool, said that that cloth, although it cost only 15s. a yard here, would bring £ 1 a yard in England at the present moment. Yet, instead of hundreds of our men being employed inweaving, only about a dozen are so employed, and men who have risked their lives at the Front, and have been injured, are fined the amount of their pensions when they take up this work. Is that the way to repatriate soldiers? Mr Prendergast, the Leader of the State Opposition, some' members of the State Parliament, and others, have had suits made of the cloth that has been woven here, but we cannot get it now without going to Buckley and Nunn. This cloth costs from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per yard, so surely the profit made on it is sufficient? Although the Commonwealth Government, together with theImperial Government, control the shipping that comes to Australia, the weaving industry has not been allowed sufficient machinery to deal with our wool' in all the processes that are necessary toconvert it into cloth. I have here an article that I would commend to every honourable member, but there are so few present that I ask for a quorum. [Quorum formed.] Some £1,827,000 ported from England, and in placing these figures before honourable members. I am pleading for employment, not for a few, hundreds, but for thousands of people. To British East India the British Government allowed £624,942 worth of textile machinery to be sent. Of course,in the East Indies there is any amount of cheap labour; but to Australia, where there is, perhaps, the highest paid labour, only £26,680 worth was permitted to be exported, in spite of the fact that manufacturers here were calling out for it . Russia, we know, at the present moment is in a most unfortunate position, but, the misfortune is not greater than the One of the misunderstanding regarding her; and I ' am waiting natientlv to find out the real' truth of the position. right if the other Powers will let her alone. in that remark, though, of course, onecannot say. A t any rate, to Russia textile machinery to the value of £226,380' was sent; and to Japan, which producesonly about £18,000 worth of wool, £202,000 worth. Japan is going to supply us with yarn, though we could make it here if we were allowed to have the machinery. Textile machinery to the value of £94,546 was sent to SouthAmerica, or nearly four times as much as was sent to Australia. In the publication from which I am quoting there is aparagraph showing the relative quantities of wool raised and manufactured in the various countries.

If we had a Government strong and determined enough to see that we were enabled to manufacture our wool, we should command the world to purchase our f oods. I believe that no less than about 6 per cent, of the wool imported into Europe and America is produced in Australia. Owing to our splendid climate we produce a wool of a very fine and high quality, and we are not taking advantage of our circumstances. All through the dreary war years manufacturers here have been asking by deputation and otherwise, for machinery, and this .Government has a Minister of Repatriation, in the person of Senator Millen, who says that he does not believe, in new industries.

Without any qualms, and notwithstanding it was pledged to prohibit the importation of luxuries, the same Government allowed the following (amongst other) sums of money to be sent right out of Australia during the twelve months ended 30th June, 1918, to pay for articles we could very well do without, if we could not make them ourselves:£2,115,227, for silks. £1,010,025, for velvets. £470,868, for ornaments for hats. £500,991, for silk and wool stockings. £326,920, for fancy goods. £394,512, for musical instruments. £157,360, for perfumery. £410,778, for jewellery. £1,039,605, for whisky. £174,880, for brandy, gin, and rum. £127,174, for cigars and cigarettes. £853,925, for fish. £245,809, for fruit. £285,099, for nuts and pickles.

300,Dr. Maloney,"I should like towas sold for £42,903,000. Every part of the Commonwealth contributes something towards this total, although New South Wales, whose share is 50 per cent, of the whole, is the largest America, 10.67s., operating expenses, contributor; Victoria produces 17 per cent.; Queensland, 18 per cent.; South Australia, 0.4 per cent.; Western Australia, G per cent.; Tasmania, 2 per cent.; the Northern Territory, .0 per cent. If we multiply the value of the rough wool by thi*ee, we reach its manufactured value. That, however, does not completely explain the position, because there have to be added freight, commissions, and so forth . If the wool were manufactured in Australia, we would get its f u l l value, and the money would be circulating amongst ourselves. It is as true to-day as when Abraham Lincoln said it , that if we manufacture in our own country, we have the locomotive and also the money that is spent in making it ; but if we send elsewhere for a locomotive, our money goes out of the country, possibly never to return ; and, when the locomotive is worn out, we have lost both it and the money we paid for it . If the value of last year's clip was £48,000,000, we can roughly put its value in the manufactured state at £146,000,000. But to this there has also to be added the original value of £48,000,000; so that, by doing all the work in this country, we would create wealth to the amount of £200,000,000. ""We all know that, in Australia, 100 years ago, 5 lbs. of wool from one sheep was considered phenomenal, so much so that Captain McArthur recorded such an event as historical. To-day, however, 40 lbs. has been taken off a single ram, showing what can be achieved by careful breeding. We have to remember that sheep are lian K n it t i ng Mills at Richmond, in Vicgoing to be raised in most countries in toria, Foy and Gibson's, at Collingwood, the world.

Some years ago an interesting comparibecause this Government is not asking son between tlie profits of the wool in the Imperial Government to put textile dustry in Australia, South America, and machinery on the priority list. One firm the United States of America was drawn sent to the United Statesi n order to get up for the information of the American the machinery it requires, only to find Congress. The report showed the receipts per head of the sheep to be as follows:-In the United States of 8.77s., leaving a profit of 1.9s. j in Australia, 9.16s., operating expenses 3.95s., leaving a profit of 5.21s.; and in South America, 8.75s. operating expenses, 4.77s., leaving a profit of 4s. Although the receipts per head in the United States of America are higher than those in Australia, the profit -in the United States of America is only 1.9s. per head as against 5.21s. per head in Australia, where, during normal years, receipts from other sources often pay working expenses, leaving little, if any, charge against the wool. The Australian Woollen Mills Limited at Marrickville, near Sydney, specializes in the manufacture of serges. In fact it is the only mill in Australia employed exclusively in the manufacture of worsted material. About 2,000,000 lbs. of greasy wool per year is purchased for treatment in this factory, and from this material is produced 1,000,000 lbs. of tops. The tops are spun into thread at bhe rate of 4,000 lbs. of hosiery and knitting yarns per week, and 10,000 lbs. of yarn used chiefly for indigo serges, cloth for the A r m y, Navy, railway, and tramway services, the balance of tops being supplied to the local manufacturers for spinning into hosiery yarn. Over 1,000,000 yards of 18-oz. khaki serge have been supplied for the A r m y, and 83,000 yards have been supplied to the Navy. Honourable members can see how easily this business could be increased. Already there are thirty-seven factories, the principal of which are controlled by the following firms:-AustraI n every case these firms require textile machinery for spinning. Some mills have had to close their doors that all machinery for combing wool is made in Europe. Motherland, to which we owe so much, would rather let her child have the machinery for making the products, which she m.ay have to purchase fro m us in the future, than supply the requirements of the British East Indies, Japan, South America, Russia, the United States of Americai n this respect. representations to the Home Government? Deputation after deputation has waited on them with the request that they should do so. We are exporting thousands of pounds worth of wool, yet our manufacturers are crying out for machinery that may give sufficient work to our returned soldiers, and our men and women who are now out of employment. The manufacturers are not asking for bounties; they are simply asking for shipping space to bring out the machinery of which they stand so much in need. What greater instance of the unfairness of the present situation is there than the fact that during 1915, 1916, and 1917 only £26,000 worth of this machinery was sent to Australia, whereas £624,922 worth was sent to the British East Indies? I have been courteously permitted to make use of some notes prepared for Mr C. S. Nathan, of Perth, by MrA . D . Rankin, a highlyqualified accountant. cate that they should be printed and circulated throughout Australia, because they would show the need for some different procedure on the part of the Government more clearly than could any speech, no matter how brilliant or how eloquently delivered. In the course of his notes Mr Rankin saysI t was recently announced in the press that machinery are lying on the wharfs in the Commonwealth Government had made arrangements for the establishment in the near future of a complete plant for the manufacture of yarn from raw wool; but I have since been informed on excellent authority that the Government will not proceed with this scheme, but will rather concentrate upon the creation of facilities for the importation of the necessary machinery or yarns in order to assist private enterprise. That is what I am asking them to do. I would rather extend our factories so that they could manufacture Dr. Maloney. first stage of the taking of the wool off I am sure that the the sheep's back to the last stage of turning out the very finest woollen goods. One stock argument which has been used to my knowledge for over twenty-five years is that we cannot expect to have the patterns for the tweeds and so on that would require to be made. I have shown or that 66 per cent, of the wool that goes to America and Great Britain comes from Why will not Ministers make Australia. If these tweeds are made in GreatB ri ta in or America, surely we can bring to Australia the artisans, the clever designers, and those who are skilled in manipulating the weft and the warp of the loom, so that we may secure a variety of patterns. It is true that we could not do a great deal if we had only the market of the 5,000,000 people of Australia to supply, but surely we can look farther afield. No other country in the world can grow wool so cheaply. America can only make a profit of 1.9s. per sheep, whereas we in Australia can make a profit of 5.2s. per sheep. There is already a large Australian market at hand, and wo have only to introduce Australian tweeds, to the notice of the people of Australia to find them quite content to wear them. It was only to-day that a gentleman stopped me in the street and asked me whether he could obtain a further quantity of hand-woven tweeds made by reI strongly advoturned soldiers. He was .willing to buy £50 worth for the requirements of his own family and for some of his neighbours, but he could not be supplied. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) has decreed that this industry is to die. There is a difficulty in regard to supply of yarn. Our stocks of yarn come from Scotland, but yarn and GreatB ri ta in awaiting the Temoval of the priority list to enable it to be shipped to Australia. Some yarn is coming here from Japan, and if that country could manufacture textile machinery we could purchase it and have it brought here without any trouble, but it is incomprehensible to me that the Government w ill not t r y to stir up the British authorities and get them to put this class of maright from the chinery on the priority list. There is no bigger infamy than the list of non-essentials which are being imported and occupying cargo space which could be better filled by textile machinery and the yarn of which I have spoken. I purpose using a few of the arguments set forth in Mr Rankin's notes regarding the woollen industry. These are extracts he has made from various articles in the Industrial and Mining Standard of 18th April, 1918Strong complaints against Commonwealth Government. There are. twenty-two woollen mills established throughout the Commonwealth, the largest of which is that owned by Foy and Gibson. Threatened shortage of the wool yarn used for knitting, sweaters, jerseys, socks, and other tory price, £1,500)000, also some. £548,000 worth woollen articles.

All woollen yarn used by Australian knitting mills imported from Scotland. Only mill in Victoria making wool yarn is that of. Foy and Gibson, who spin portion of their requirements. Australian knitting mills would have put in a spinning plant eighteen months ago if it could have obtained the assistance of the Commonwealth Government in obtaining the necessary machinery from England. The Lincoln Knitting Mills,. Carlton, would also have made a start some considerable time ago, and, in their anxiety to make a start, had despatched a representative to America to secure the necessary machinery. . . . found that the combing machines were made nowhere but in Europe, and the rest of the plant would be useless without these machines. . . \are importing wool yarn from Japan at a price substantially higher than the same yarn could be manufactured here in Australia.

If the whole of the clip could have been dealt with. in our own factories, the factoryprice of the woollens produced would have been about £80,697,000. The value of woollen piece goods imported into Australia is; per annum, £3,200,000. And, in addition, there is a large quantity of hosiery and knitted goods that contain a certain proportion of wool. I hope that we shall blazon the word' "" Australia "" throughout the length and breadth of our continent, so that every man will be proud to wear clothing of Australian manufacture,and we shall look with kindly pity upon those who are so unpatriotic as to refuse to buy Australian goods. The report continuesIn one year Australian wool to the value of £523,827 is made up into goods valued, at facof wool is made into "" tops "" per year and sold out of the country for £1,204,000. The difficulty of Australian manufacturers has been greatly enhanced by the war conditions; manufacturers who had been in the habit of importing yarn for manufacture of underwear, &c, find their supplies cut off or limited, while those who desire to import extra machinery to meet the extra demand created by the difficulty of importing the usual quantity of finished material are unable to fill their wants. I express my gratitude to Messrs. Foy and Gibson for the assistance they have given those of our returned soldiers who are engaged in hand weaving. They promised to supply them with yarn. I hope the Government will cease sending the rubbish they have recently supplied. I am sorry to describe in that way anything of Government .manufacture; but while the yarn furnished by the Government is not shoddy-if by shoddy we mean yarn consisting of other than wool-it is so short in texture that it is worse than shoddy.

I make this suggestion to the Treasurer with no desire to reap a party advantage. our financial matters are a little smoothed down, when we have reached the limit of Dr. Moloney. our war loan flotations, and we can assess the total amount involved, the Government might appeal to the generosity and patriotism of those who invested large amounts in these loans at 4-J per cent, free of taxation, that on the 1st January, or any subsequent date, all holders of loan stock to the value of £30,000 and upwards should apply to have their bonds converted into interest-bearing bonds, which would be subject to taxation.

I wish to say a few words as to how economy can be effected. Let the Government take the people into their confidence. Let them ask the people, by a referendum, whether we shall have seven vice-regal representatives, seven Government Houses, seven Supreme Court Benches, six Agents-General, and a H i g h Commissioner, and seven different agency houses in London, varying in size and expense from the £1,000,000 building in the Strand to the relatively humble offices occupied by the Agent-General of Tasmania. on the Danish system, there would not be so much f r ill about the horse-hair divinities that sit upon the Bench. Economy could be effected in the administration of the Federal Capital Territory, and in the construction of Naval Bases. I have known from 30 feet to 40 feet of a mole to be washed away in a single night ; loaf sugar could not have melted more rapidly. Yet the engineers were throwing in load after load of material that dissolved away, discolouring the water so that it resembled weak coffee. They might as well have been throwing sovereigns into the sea. A super-dreadnoueht naval conditions is much like the old armoured knight of some centuries back, who, if he fell from his horse, required the services of two or three men to mount him again. Only one or two of the nations are rich enough to build these costly weapons of warfare. The defence of Australia must be intrusted to the aeroplane and the submarine. A superbattle-cruiser or a super-battle-ship costs with its equipment about £4,000,000, and carries many valuable lives. For that sum we could get 10,000 aeroplanes; and if we standardized our aeroplanes, with a factory in each of the six States, they would cost only about £250 each. means the loss of two lives only; but it may sink a leviathan man-of-war costing £4,000,000, and carrying many men. One hundred and twenty stations are all that would be needed for the defence of Australia, and six men would serve for each station, including mechanics and flyers, in addition to the. State centres. We can speak plainly now on these subjects, without fear of helping the enemy. We know that our mighty fleets were frequently bottled in for fear of the grey t in fish, as they were called. It was only by the magnificent energy and constant watchfulness of those serving on board them that our ships were able to go into the lone North Sea. When the battle of Jutland comes to be written, our Navy will receive more credit than it has yet received. A t the beginning of the war I feared that it would be decimated. I did not dream that it was possible to protect it so well and to keep r If our law were simplified it afloat in the most dangerous -sea in the world, through all the bitter winter, days and nights. If we decide to defend Australia with submarines acting in conjunction with aeroplanes, we may need different Bases from those that are now being carried out. Our boys have a temperament which makes them keen flyers, and their deeds in this war have proved their ability as flyers. Major Harrison spoke to me of the quickness with which the Australian youth learns to fly. T would say to Ministers, "" Keep a stern control upon the expenditure on the Naval Bases, and wait until we can get the best expert evidence on the subject of defence."" I think that with the aeroplane under present and the submersible, we should be able to defend ourselves in the future. I hope that there will be a great increase of population here before long.

Personally, it makes no difference to me, but I think it is always 'better if these matters can those who shall represent them. !be dealt with on their merits, rather than that the Government should regard any adverse criticism as amounting to a motion of censure, though, perhaps, under our constitutional procedure, it is diffiwritten law it is true, but one which stood cult to see how the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) could have adopted any other course. I repeat, however, that personally this does not make the slightest difference to my vote. If the question whether the Estimates should be reconsidered by the Government with a view to considerable retrenchment, had been discussed on its merits, I should have have invaded every avenue of taxation voted precisely as I intend to vote now. My somewhat long parliamentary experience has convinced me that it is the duty of a member to dp what he thinks is right on the particular occasion as it arises, and leave ultimate consequencies to conceive any avenue of taxation that is take care of themselves. There is no doubt that the expenditure of this country has grown to an extent which was never anticipated when Federation was commenced; and I am quite convinced that there is a unanimous feeling throughout the constituencies to-day that there must be a reduction. If we require any examples, I think that the Nationalist party has two very good ones. The fact that the selected candidate of the National party and the Government was defeated by both candidates at the Swan election comes as an intimation -that the people of Western Australia desire some change in the method of conducting the business of the country; and the recent figures from Corangamite, I say quite frankly, I regard as the handwriting on the wall. To me the meaning is that the people of Australia are rejecting the idea that the declaration that a man is either Nationalist or Labour is sufficient to return him to Parliament, and the electors of Corangamite will debeside the mere shibboleth of party. The introduced, however fatal it may be to some members of the House-and I think it will be fateful to a good number -is a proper indication of the duty we owe to the electors of Australia to give them as wide a choice as possible of As to the general expenditure, let us take the position of the Federation today. For many years after the inception of Federation there was a rule-a n un-that the Federal Government should as far as possible, obtain their revenue from indirect taxation, and that certain avenues of taxation should be left to the States. But what have we done ? Although we have not nearly reached the taxation limit which this Parliament will have to impose on the people of Australia, we that was left to the States. We have imposed an income tax and a super-income tax, a land tax and a super-land tax, an entertainments tax, and probate and real estate duties. It is difficult to now left as formerly to the States.",73,Messrs Fox And Gibson S Experience As Textile Machinery Builders

310,Mr Mcwiiliams (Franklin) [8.0 J .,"I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that the State and Federal. taxation invested in our loans w ill have a very serious effect on State finances in the very near future. I must confess that I never heard the Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) put up so weak a case as he did in reply to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman). said-and he not unnaturally took some credit for it-that he had reduced by £2,000,000 the Estimates presented to him; but what of that ? Every Treasurer, either State or Federal, has had to very materially reduce the estimates of expenditure as presented by the Departments, and nobody knows that better than the Departments when they set out to prepare them. room for reductions. MrM c WILLIAMS Of course they leave ioom for reductions. The heads of Departments know there is no Treasurer who can possibly give them the money they would like, and, therefore, they add a few millions in the sure and certain knowledge that a considerable proportion will be struck off, and in the hope that some of the excess will be allowed to remain. There is no worse possible guide that Parliament could take in determining the annual expenditure of the Departments than the Departments themselves. General( Mr Webster) say that? MrM c WILLIAMS if the Postmaster-General states his view he will tell us that he has had very materially to reduce some of the estimates presented by his officers to him. MrM c WILLIAMS It ha to be done. There is another statement by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) worthy of attention. I interjected when he made it that I had heard the same statement made by every Treasurer, either State or Federal, in discussing and defending his Estimates. The honourable gentleman told us that it would not be possible to take £10,000 off these Estimates. I do not think there is an honourable member in the House who will agree' fact that we omitted from with that statement. I shall presently money quote some figures showing how expenditure has increased; but the House cannot, and, I am sure, will not, accept the statement that, in a Budget like this, providing for such an enormous expenditure, it would not be possible to retrench to the extent of £10,000. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr. The honourable gentleman Chapman) said, we could start with the Federal police, and save very nearly that amount; and when that item comes before us it is my intention to move that it be eliminated. I have not heard one reason given yet why there should be a Federal police service. We know that it was proposed as the result of a very regrettable electioneering incident. The price is too heavy for the people of Australia to pay, when they are asked to contribute £6,000 or £7,000 a year for a staff, the value of whose services no one has been able to recognise in the faintest degree. If we look over the Departments for the last'five years we see that every one has shown a very considerable expenditure. We remember when the Prime Minister's Department was created, and how some of us opposed its creation, believing it to be unnecessary. The argument then was that the Prime Minister's Department would take over one or two smaller branches, such as A u d it , the Public Service Commissioner, and the High Commissioner's Office, and that the object was to provide the Prime Minister with an office in which he could carry out his great and important work, with, at least, a secretary of his own. The cost of this I guarantee that Department in 1912-13 was £57,559, and this increased to £155,797 in 1916-17, just multiplying itself by three. In 1917-18 the expenditure had reached £222,000, and for this year it is £187,000. Included' In some cases. in that is the High Commissioner's Office, s which costs over £30,000 a year. MrM c WILLIAMS T h a t is exactly the question which the people of Australia are asking.

But here is the absurdity of the position: If Mr member suggest in regard to the High Fisher had not gone Home as High Commissioner,the great probability is that he would have gone, as Prime Minister, to do the very work which it is said he is unable to carry out now. That is a fact which it is impossible for us to deny or to disguise. I say, deliberately, that if Mr by the Ministers who have taken charge of Fisher is not competent or able to carry out this work, the sooner he is returned to Australia the better. pointment. be better to make some arrangement by * which he may be practically compensated for loss of office, because we have come to the point that whenever anything important happens in England, we feel it necessary to send one, two, or three Ministers to perform the necessary work. I was one who opposed the increase which was madein the salary of the late Right Honourable Sir George Reid as High. Commissioner. It will be remembered that an increase of £2,000 a year was given to that officer, on the distinct understanding that he should not only carry out the ambassadorial functions of the office, but should also make his office the business centre for Australia-that he should, in consultation with the Agents General, provide a centre in which the affairs of Australia should be conducted, not by the High Commissioner himself but by the costly and valuable staff with which he is provided. What do we hear on all hands ? Several gentlemen who have returned to Australia have told me that, so far as they have been able to see, the High Commissioner has been practically superseded, that military officers have taken possession of his office, and that the out the work which he was sent to LonMinisters who are at present in London are doing Australia's work there. For all practical purposes, the High Commissioner evidently does not exist. Surely that state of affairs is wrong. Surely Australia cannot afford to pay £5,000 a year to an officer whose duties have been practically taken over by other persons. Commissioner ? called upon to do the work which he was sent to England to do. I have no desire to detract from the work that is being done the trading transactions in London; but I think that the High Commissioner and his large staff ought to be in a better position to attend to these matters than are Ministers visiting England from time to time. isters went to England in connection with the war and peace business, and not in connection with trading matters. isters went. away from Australia it was stated that some of the matters they would attend to, and which they would be called upon to deal with, were those relating to the sale of our wheat and minerals and kindred products of Australia. But it was to attend to those very duties that Australia created the position of High Commissioner, for whom we have erected an enormous and costly building, and provided a very costly staff. Now we find that the High Commissioner has failed to fulfil the functions he was appointed to deal with, namely, to represent Australia in the political and ambassadorial section, and to establish an office in which the whole of Australia's trading and commerf cial relations with Great Britain would be carried on. able member give the High Commissioner power to commit the Commonwealth to expenditure in Great Britain? trust Australia's highest official to carry don to do, the quicker the office is abolished the better.

If the H i g h Commissioner had any seriously important business to attend to, especially anything affecting a matter of policy, he would not commit Australia without first communicating directly with the Prime Minister here. While the expenditure in the Attorney General's Department was £56,917 in 1912-13, it amounted to £94,925 in 191617. In the Department of Home Affairs, the expenditure was £66,517 in 1912-13; in 1915-16 it was £484,274, an increase of £417,757. The expenditure in the External Affairs Department, afterwards included in the Works and Railways Department, was £539,722 in 1912-13; in 1915-16 it was £868,660, an increase of £346,942. In a l l the Departments there has been a greater or less increase continuing year after year, which we have permitted, and for which we must accept the responsib i l it y ; but the manner in which we have growth of expenditure in this Departdeliberately agreed to discuss the annual expenditure as contained in the Estimates makes it practically impossible for any retrenchment to be effected during the passage of those Estimates through has any honourable member to discuss the matters dealt with after sitting in the Chamberf o r twelve, fourteen, or sixteen hours at a stretch, and, perhaps, at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, or 5 o'clock in the morning, when we are practically bludgeoned into accepting the Estimates by physical disability to give them the consideration they deserve? No business concern would ever dream of conducting its operations on the lines followed by this Parliament ever since its inception. to have two all-night sittings upon these Estimates, whereas usually they are bludgeoned through at one all-night sitting , so that on this occasion we may have a better chance of discussing them. Another item of expenditure which keeps growing year by year is incurred in connection with our administration of the Northern Territory, which is most unsatisfactory. While the revenue of the Territory is only £102,980,, the expenditure is £699,400, showing a loss of £596,420. These figures include interest and redemptions amounting to £339,819,. and the startling item of £415,000 for "" Miscellaneous."" Our expenditure on the Northern Territory is increasing, but the population, which was 3,301 in 1911, when we took over the Territory, has increased to only 3,554. We are spending nearly £700,000 annually on 3,554 people. The accumulated deficit on the Northern Territory since 1911 has amounted to £1,576,000. The total cost of the Territory to the Commonwealth since it was taken over is £6,324,000. Another Territory, Papua, has a revenue of £63,568, with an expenditure of £83,740, the loss being over £20,000. I find it exceedingly difficult to get figures relating to the Customs Department, because they vary so materially. The fluctuations of the commercial, arrangement made in connection with sugar render it almost impossible to get at anything like a correct estimate of the ment Tor the last four or five years. I have omitted war expenditure in all the items which I have mentioned. I am dealing with the general expenditure Committee. What chance only, but there are some items which may be called war expenditure in connection with the Treasury Department. In this Department the expenditure was £762,000 in 1917-18. This year the proposed expenditure is £994,000. For the Shipping and Mail Service to the Pacifici t is proposed to pay a subsidy of £32,850 per annum, an increase of £10,000 on the amount previously paid. The giving of this subsidy is one of the most idiotic arrangements into which any sane Parliament could enter. It As far as I can see we are has been going on for many years, but while we have subsidized vessels to trade with the Pacific Islands, we have imposed such a Customs Tariff on the produce of those islands that it has been impossible for them to trade with us. As a matter of fact, we have absolutely forced the trade of the Pacific away from us. member wish to have the black-grown produce of those islands brought to Australia free of duty?",77,Messrs Fox And Gibson S Experience As Textile Machinery Builders
324,Mr Corser,"Does the honorableable member has put his finger on one of the difficulties, but it should be possible to enter into some arrangement by which we can trade with the islands without the black-grown produce coming into Australia and competing unfairly with the white-grown produce of Australia. If ^ it is not possible to trade with the islands we ought not to spend £32,000 on subsidizing vessels to visit them, because the value of the goods that we send to them from Australia is certainly not commensurate with that expenditure on our part. No doubt the indebtedness of Australia is a very serious pr'oblem. It may be news to some honourable members to learn that our indebtedness per head in 1916-17 was considerably greater than the indebtedness per head in Great Britain. The debt of Great Britain in that year was £4,064,000,000, or £80 per head of the population. borrowed more than that during the war. figures from the Statistician to-day.

She made, roughly speaking, from £125,000,000 to £150,000,000 worth of munitions for Great Britain. fit on that undertaking. is that we did not turn out munitions to the same extent and also make a profit on the enterprise. Canada manufactured munitions Britain was buying munitions from J apan and the United States of America, and surely it was well that she should obtain supplies as far as possible from one of the Dominions rather than from foreign countries. In addition to supplying munitions direct to the British Government,-she carried out portion of the contract which the United States of America had entered into with the Home authorities; and the amount received in respect of that work does not appear in the details of her direct transactions with the Old Country. She also lent Great Britain £100,000,000. In other words, she manufactured munitions of the value of from £125,000,000 to £150,000,000, and allowed most of the money due in respect of those munitions to remain on loan to Great Britain.

340,Mr Mcgrath,"But we owe the moneyborrow, boom, and bust. Tennyson's beautiful lines, it may be said of the policy of Australia that'Tis better to have boomed and bust Than never to have boomed at all. Before we shall have cleaned up the war our war indebtedness alone will amount to about £300,000,000, which will mean a permanent interest debt of £15,000,000 per annum for which we shall have no return, and to provide for the payment of which the people of Australia must be taxed. In regard to many of the problems that confront us, some of us will have to start anew. Australia for the first time has entered the troublesome sea of national politics. Prior to the outbreak of the war our national life had been the most placid and successful ever enjoyed by any country. The whole of this magnificent continent had been handed over to us as a gift. All that we had to do was to people it and to govern it in our own way. Ours was a wonderfully rich heritage, and we had merely to tax ourselves to provide for our own conveniences, emergencies and pleasures. We are now face to face with an entirely new aspect. We have not only a war debt of £300,000,000, but we shall have for many years to come a permanent debt in the shape of the provision to be made for war pensions and the maintenance of those who have suffered in fighting for our protection. No matter how strong the demand for economy may be, we must never unduly retrench in regard to the treatment of those who went overseas to fight for Australia and to preserve our liberty. When our men went away we promised them that we should care for them on their return. It is up to us to keep that promise, and I hope that it will be fully observed. A rather serious feature of the present situation is that production in Australia has not increased as some of us would like it to have done. There are not many lines in respect of which Australia can compete with the outside world. I would ask the representatives of metropolitan districts to examine the return showing what the agricultural and pastoral interests have done for Australia during this war. But for our great exports of wool, wheat, minerals, and other primary products, the rate of exchange which has been and still is disastrously heavy against Australia would have been very much higher than it is to-day. The export of Australian produce in 1915-16-the last financial year in respect of which the complete figures are obtainable-r-was of the value of £67,387,000, and our export of minerals was valued at £23,000,000. Our pastoral, agricultural, and mineral exports accounted for £90,000,000 out of a total export value of £95,000,000. Australia is beginning to recognise more and more what we owe to the great pastoral industry. I hope I may be wrong, but my reading leads me to the conclusion, that the wheat export trade of Australia after the war will not be a very important and flourishing industry. The production of meat and wool, however, will be for many years a constantly expanding industry. I have never been able to understand why in some quarters hostility should be displayed towards the man who goes into the interior and risks every penny he has in the effort to put our waste lands to productive uses. Practically only a small portion of Australia has been alienated. The greater part of the pastoral areas of Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales still belong to the Crown, and are a constant source of revenue. Turning to our stock returns, it is unsatisfactory to find that the number of sheep per head in Australia from 1860 to 1916 has been falling away to a very disastrous extent. In 1860 we had 2l£ sheep per head of the population, and the maximum was reached in 1890, when we had 31J sheep per head. Ever since then there has been a steady falling off, and in 1916 we had only 15$ sheep per head. The cattle industry of Australia must grow in importance, because year after year the country available for the raising of cattle is becoming less and less.

Hadi t not been for the attiasked to pass this week a number of meatude taken by some honourable members, the country would now be committed to a loan expenditure out of all proportion to its needs.

If the Government make the amendment a test question, that is no business of mine, and it w ill any one not affect my vote. A man must do what he thinks to be right, and take the consequences. The people, and also, I am sure, for, and confidence in , the representative who votes as his conscience dictates, than for the man who votes at the crack of the party whip. I feel that it is not right that we should pile heavy taxation on the people without making every reasonable effort to curtail expenditure. congratulate the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) on having given us an opportunity to discuss the Estimates. This is an improvement on the practice of the last few years. I have always protested against allowing the Estimates to remain unconsidered until the financial year had practically expired. There is no reason for that, even in war time, because the ordinary departmental expenditure has not been affected by the war. It is a refreshing change to have an opportunity of dealing with the Estimates before the We have Christmas vacation. A t the same time, I regret that the time allowed for their discussion is altogether too short. We are endeavouring to crowd too much work into a few days. Sound legislation is i m possible when work has to be scamped. In addition to the Estimates, we are to be sures whose discussion should occupy a considerable time, and, even by sitting night after night, we shall be unable to complete our programme.

363,Mr Charlton ( H UN T E R ) [ 9 . 1 0 ],"Ithat savings should be made where possible. In my opinion, a saving could be made in the expenditure incurred in connection with the floating of war loans. We have borrowed £148,922,368 w it h in Australia for war purposes, at a cost of no less than £358,322. I do not think that this expenditure can be justified. that we have received 100 per cent, of the amount borrowed. overseas, we do not do that. there is now before us a B ill , which the Acting Prime Minister says that he in tends to pass, which requires taxpayers to subscribe to war loans an amount based on the income taxation which they pay. Under this measure, more than enough money can be obtained for financing our -war expenditure, and meeting the cost of bringing back our soldiers. voluntary system of contributions is also to stand, it w ill mean that, when the next war loan is floated, an army of speakers will again be commissioned to solicit subscriptions, and large amounts w ill be paid for advertisements in the various newspapers. was being advertised, as much as 28s. an inch was paid to some newspapers. the inch? vertisements ran right across the page the charge was too high. column inch. Wales 295 newspapers were paid £7,482 16s. l i d . for war loan advertisements. In Victoria 231 papers were paid £4,316 8s. 8d., in Queensland 116 papers were paid £5,173 9s. 7d., in South Australia 58 papers were paid £4,200 5s., in WesternA ustralia 48 papers were paid £1,731 . 4s., in Tasmania 11 papers were ""aid £1,717 7s., in Papua one paper was paid £ 5 10s., and in the Northern Territory a paper was paid £ 8 . This shows that 761 papers were paid £24,635 Is. 2d. Great saving could be made in connection with the next war loan. All that is necessary is to dispense altogether with the [352] voluntary system and advertise through the press and the Gazette that a new loan is in course of flotation, and that the compulsory provisions will be put into operation. I venture to say that if this were done considerably more money would be raised than would otherwise be the case. the newspapers give au almost unlimited amount of space in helping the flotation In borrowing of the war loan. T h a t is so. But say that the newspapers did not give f u l l publicity to the loan; but, if they did so, they were well paid for it . MrJ . H . CATTS -The picture shows advertised the loan for nothing. that was the case, and there could be no better medium of advertising;. As to the If the rates per inch in the various newspapers, the Sydney Morning Herald was paid 18s. and 25s., and received a total of £708 15s.; the Sydney Daily Telegraph was paid 15s., 20s. 10d., and 25s., and received £1,195-I do not know how the Telegraph came to beat "" Granny ""; the Evening News, of Sydney, was paid 12s., and received £669 2s.; and the Sun was paid 6s., 8s., and 12s. 6d., and received £461 12s. It will be seen that 25s. per inoh, the highest rate paid, was to the Sydney Morning Herald. Amongst the weekly papers of Sydney the Sunday Times was paid 7s. and 28s -the highest rate of all-and received £261 18s.; the Sunday Sun was paid 10s. and 12s. 6d., and received £136; the Worker, which is the recognised Labour paper, was paid 6s., and received £7 4s. as contrasted In New South with the £261 paid to the Sunday Times. had been in office the Worker would have been paid 28s. an inoh. lieve the Worker would have got a squarer deal. So the list goes on, and it shows the very high prices the Government have been paying for advertisements. My point is that the flotation of our loans has cost £358,000, and that the present cost could be reduced by half if the suggestion I have made were adopted.

That is on the basis of the income , tax revenue of last year, and the revenue for this year will be in excess .of that amount, because the tax has been increased. The war loans raised in Australia amount to £148,922,268, and the cost of flotation was £358,022. On 30th June, 1918, there were instalments not paid, £12,943,901, and balance in hand was £23,710,066, or a total of £36,654,563 . Since then we have received about £43,000,000 fresh loan money, making a total amount in hand of £79,654,563 . The estimated war expenditure for the year 1918-19 was £100,044,411, and the amount to be paid fro m revenue was s £21,128,602 , leaving £78,914,809 as the amount of loan money required for the year. When that estimate was framed it was on a war basis, because the Armistice had not been sighed; and, with the £36,654,563, we have now in hand £79,754,000, or over £1,000,000 more than is required up to June next.

The money earned by the Bank does not go into the ordinary revenue of the country, and some arrangement should be made by which the revenue shall benefit in the way of interest. The Commonwealth Bank, I believe, is paid 5s. per £ 1 0 0 to cover its expenses in tbe flotation of loans, but the country should also have a share. tory to know that the money is lying in our own Bank, but, at the same time, it is not assisting in the reduction of taxation. wealth.

403,Mr Charlton,"I am sorry to saylonger fit for service. He leaves us to assume that the general demobilization scheme is not to be put into operation until some time later. In fact, he says that we cannot demobilize the men until peace is signed. with the Minister. These boys have done their part, and done it well. No one can make me believe that the Allied nations will keep a full standing Army in the field until peace is signed. It has been cabled to us that the Americans are making provision for the return of 1,200,000 men who went across to Europe two years after our boys went there; yet our men are to be kept on the German frontier ready to fight. I venture to say that Marshal Eoch would say that less than half his full strength would be sufficient for all purposes at the present timeprobably one-third of the Allied, Forces. If that be the case, why sbould not our boys come home? Great Britain can get furlough, and visit their homes occasionally. The soldiers of France can do the same. But our boys cannot; and yet they are to be expected to remain until peace is signed, when, perhaps, it may not be signed for three j'ears. If the Postmaster-General( Mr back 25,000 men who have been disabled Webster) is expressing the sentiments of the Government when he says "" Hear, hear!"" to the statement of General Monash that our soldiers cannot be demobilized until peace is signed, I tell him that I do not believe the people are behind them in that regard. be required in Berlin. plenty of men. The position is quite different now from what it was at the commencement of the armistice. The enemy is now thoroughly disorganized, we hold most of his fighting machinery, and we are in his territory. If he is prepared to fight again, the Allies have ample men available to put him in his place. I am sure that if the Commonwealth Government made representations to the Imperial Government, pointing out the time the Australians have been away from their homes, and the fact that they have been actually engaged in all the heavy fighting right through the piece, the reply would be, "" They have done well; make preparations to return them to Australia."" I would like to know whether the Postmaster-General is expressing the sentiments of the Government. There has been no statement in the House in regard to the matter. People would be up in arms if they had. any idea that there was any likelihood of our troops being kept on the frontier of Germany for four or five years, until the articles of peace are signed. We do not know when peace will be declared. It may be five or six months hence, or it may be in as many years hence. But there is no necessity to keep our boys in Europe all that time. If hostilities should break out again, endangering the Empire, nobody would return to the Front sooner than the Australian boys.

It ill becomes the honourable member to insinuate that I have said a soldiers may yet word to the contrary. Certainly, the wounded should be brought home; but I say, further, that the whole of our men should -be brought home. The Minister had no right to twist my words. My sympathy for the men who have done so much for Australia is as strong as his. I would do my best to help those who have made the sacrifice of. being wounded; but the point for which I am contending is that there is no need to keep our 100,000 men in the fighting line any longer.

418,Mr Charlton,"T h a t is so. If theshould be prepared to remit all penalties -as from the beginning of the war. I put a question to the Assistant Ministerf o r Defence in this House on 1st November last, urging the Ministerf or Defence to ""take into consideration the advisableness of making the regulation retrospective as from the beginning of the war. The reply I received was as follows: This was considered by the Government, but it was decided not to do as suggested. It has not been the policy of the Department to -make approvals of this nature retrospective, -e.g.., increases in the payment of separation allowance were recently approved to date from 5th April, 1918. A great deal of work would be involved in investigating past cases if the approval were made retrospective, and it is doubtful whether adjustment could be made in respect of casualties which occurred during the earlier period -of the war. No information is available which -would enable tlie amount of expenditure Which -would be incurred in back-dating the approval to be calculated, but it is estimated that between £60,000 and £80,000 would be involved. Approximately, 40.000 cases will require to be investigated, and it is estimated that payments -will require to be made in about 10,000 cases. Eveni f it would cost £60,000 or £80,000, this regulation should date back to the beginning of the war. These men took all the risks of fighting for our liberties, and they paid the supreme penalty. The least we can do is to see that their widows and families get the money which the Parliament intended they should receive. There is no justification for this attitude on the part of the Government. I come now to the position of munition workers. W ill any one say that a man who offered his services as a munition worker should not receive some consideration ? I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence the other day whether such men were to be provided with employment when they returned. Their contract extends from the day on which they leave until the date of their return. Immediately they land here they are paid off. ceiving only 6s. per day. Many of them have families to support, and, although while in England they received the ruling rate of wages, the cost -of living was such that they were unable -to .save anything. We should give them a t least a fortnight or a month's pay on their return, so that they may be able to support their families while they are seeking employment here. I do not know how many munition workers went to England, but there may be 10,000 of them. Under the'present system we bring then: back and cast them a d r if t to find work as best they can. That is not f a ir treatment. I brought under the notice of the Minister the case of a man in my district who volunteered as a munition worker. He was a small settler, and on his little holding had ' a three-roomed house, in which his wife and two children resided. While he was in England his wife and family l e f t their home one day, and on their return found that the house had been burned to the ground. They lost everything they had, and assistance could not be given them from any of the patriotic funds in New South Wales. The reply received in each case was that such funds could not be used to assist the wife of a munition worker. These different patriotic bodies extended their fullest sympathy to the woman, but that did not help her to get a roof over her head. She came to me a few months ago, and, after I had failed to secure any monetary assistance for her, she put her case in the hands of the secretary of the Newcastle Patriotic Fund. He got in touch with the State committee, and finally, after a sheaf of correspondence had passed between the different parties, the Minister for Defence, in July last, without admitting any liability, agreed to give her £ 5 0 to assist in the rebuilding of her home before her husband returned. Although that promise was made in July last, the woman told me a few weeks ago that the £ 5 0 had not yet been granted to her. I put the matter before the Honorary Minister( Mr Wise), and to-day I received from the woman the following letter, which had been addressed to her by the Secretary of the Defence Department : Dear Madam,-With reference to your communication of the 26th ultimo, relative to the I know that. non-payment of the grant of £50 approved by the Minister in your case, I have to inform you that, before payment of the amount in question can be made, it is necessary to receive the authority of the Honourable the Treasurer. When approached in regard to your case, the Treasurer intimated that the amount could not be paid. The Minister has directed, ihowever, that",89,Messrs Fox And Gibson S Experience As Textile Machinery Builders
419,Mr Webster,They have not been re,90,Messrs Fox And Gibson S Experience As Textile Machinery Builders
420,Mr Charlton,"the Treasurer he again approached in the matter, and that the special features of your case be brought under his notice, with a view to authority being obtained. A communication has, therefore, been addressed to the Secretary to the Treasury in this connection, and on receipt of a reply you will be further advised. We are all anxious to economize, but we do not want to retrench in that way. Surely this poor woman should not be deprived of the opportunity to rebuild her littl e home before her husband returns. She has been battling away in sparsely settled country beyond Dora Creek, and living with friends. It is just about up to the Government to give consideration to such cases. If our men are to be treated in this way I fear that, should it ever be necessary for us again to call upon our boys-and I hope it never will be-w e shall not have such a response as we have had in the past. Let me deal now w it h the Department of the Postmaster-General. that the honourable gentleman has saved a good deal of money, but at the same time, it seems to me that some of the economies practised by him are not in the best interests of country residents. Almost every day I receive from important towns in my electorate complaints that a letter delivery has been cut off. For some reason districts have been suddenly deprived of a letter delivery which they have enjoyed for years quite so. In most cases it is merely a rearrangement of the centre from which tlie letters are delivered. people who formerly had a letter delivery have now to go to the post-office for their letters. such complaint from the honourable member, or three complaints of the kind to the honourable gentleman. Two of these related to the towns of Charlestown and Stroud. are delivered to smaller centres of population than in any other part of the world. postal facilities for years, and the people when deprived of them naturally resent the. action of the Department. MrJ . H . CATTS -Such facilities should be extended rather than curtailed. Those, who go into the back country and t u r n our waste spaces into productive areas should receive every possible encouragement in the way of postal conveniences. If the Minister wishes to make his Department a paying concern he should see that the charges for city services are sufficiently high to make them payable. Once the Department cuts off telephonic, telegraphic, and postal services, great in j u r y is done. has been cut off. services have been refused in my electorate. I believe for new services might have been refused, but no services have been cut off. would do well to give as much attention as possible to the requirements of country districts. In that way only we can hope to develop Australia. If the Government do not do that they w ill be assisting in a policy of centralization. To-day every capital city contains about half the population of its State. Our duty is to develop the country, and to provide opportuniI do not think that is ties for our people. In regard to the shipping question, it has been argued that it was necessary to cut down the service on the coast as f a r as I only know that as possible, and for that reason a large number of boats have been taken off the coast and sent abroad. The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, made allusion to InterI have received no State and coastal shipping in these termsH The coastal shipping has also been greatly I mentioned two depleted by the transfer of Intcr-State vessels to service overseas. No less than fifty-three of such vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 195,017, have been taken off the coast.

I hope that this complaint will be conveyed to the Minister for Repatriation. repatriation scheme is to have that confidence of the people and the soldiers which is essential to its success, it must be operated on a basis satisfactory to all concerned, and we cannot submit to having in Sydney a State Board that refuses to deal in a reasonable way with applications that come before it from the Local Committees'. I hope that these Estimates will be cut down to the greatest possible extent. I believe that the Government admit the necessity for keeping down expenditure, and no doubt they have reduced the proposals of the Departments to a large extent. In regard to the claim of the Treasurer that he has already cut down the Estimates by £2,000,000, there never was a State or Commonwealth Government that d i d not cut down the Estimate"", even in normal times. mates are prepared by the Departments it is the Treasurer's duty to go through them with the pruning knife. lect that in the New South Wales Parliament Ministers used to complain sometimes that the Treasurer had cutdown their Estimates by from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000. times were good, and therefore there is .not very much in the Treasurer's boast that he has cut down the Estimates of , Commonwealth expenditure at this time when economy is so essential.

If we cut out works that are necessary, when men are returning from If the the Front, and we must find employment for them, we shall be throwing out of employment the men already in the Commonwealth, and an unemployment trouble w ill be created throughout the countryPossibly before next winter we may experience that trouble.

I listened with great pleasure and interest to the statements of the Acting Prime Minister this afternoon. The honourable gentleman certainly deserves all the sympathy and assistance that can possibly he given by this Committee. H is work is «xceedingly difficult. For months past he has had enough work to keep f u l l y ocditure. I am glad that of these three cupied two or three men of considerable capacity. A lot of the troubles he has had to grapple with are inherited; and he is struggling under a number of legacies, some of which aTe not too pleasant. T'he Act in g Prime Minister said that the Government have given every consideration to the matter of effecting economies, that he has done everything that he considered possible to reduce the Estimates, and that he would be prepared to continue his .scrutiny of them with the same desire. He definitely promised the Committee t h a t from a certain point onwards every line of the Estimates will be again scrutinized very carefully. I find that on gentleman referred the war loan expenditure commences, the of further scrutiny is no more than the Committee has a right to expect, because, so far as prospective liabilities are ^concerned, the conditions to-day are very different from what they were when the Treasurer delivered his Budget speech. It w ill be disappointing indeed to the Committee and the taxpayers if the altered conditions do not enable the Treasurer and the Government to make very extensive savings in war loan expenditure. The Treasurer said that he had done all t h a t was possible to reduce the Estimates, had a statement by the Minister conand that in that effort he had been given the assistance of the best official minds of the country. He did not say who they were, but I took it that he referred to the officers of the Treasury, and, if so, I have nothing to say against the statement, because I believe those gentlemen to be very able, and to (earnestly desire to do all that they can to keep the expenditure of the country within reasonable bounds. The honTherefore, orable gentleman said that he had reduce the Estimates hy £2,000,000 not a big saving on an expenditure of £37,000,000. He told us, moreover, that he had appointed three of the ablest men in the country to go through the Departments; very welcome information,because Parliament of late years has not exercised any proper control of the public expenmen one is' the accountant to the Post Office, Mr Haldane. His knowledge of departmental methods will be of assistance to the two gentlemen with whom he is associated, and he is, in my opinion, one of the prizes of our Public Service. I do not know h i m personally, but I know him through his reports. In every contribution that he has made to the annual report of the Postmaster-General, he has shown himself a man of considerable capacity, and, as the result of his work, the Minister has been able to bring the accounts of the Department out of a condition of chaos, and for the first time has been able to present a balance on the righ t side of the ledger. When asked by the the page to which the honourable honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr. Austin Chapman) the outcome of Mr. and therefore Blacket's report on the Federal Capital honourable gentleman's promise administration, the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) said that he, as Minister, took the fullest responsibility for what had been done, .and that subsequently the Government had accepted the responsibility for it . I do not complain of this assumption of responsibility,but I say that the honourable gentleman should have reported to this House the action taken as the result of the investigation of the Commissioner. In every instance in which inquiries have been made by Royal Commissions and Committees we should have cerned. These reports have been very disquieting. Parliament has not been told the outcome of them, so far as the officers whose carelessness or incapacity has resulted in heavy loss to the taxpayers were affected. The Treasurer has said that the re-ordering of the Estimates suggested by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro would not save, at the outside, £10,000. I shall not vote for the proposal of the honourable member to re-' got them. In the past even rudimentary duce the firstitem of the Estimates, beprecautions for eliminating blunders, cause I do not intend to vote against the minimizing extravagance, and obtaining Government, but I shall urge Ministers efficiency have not been taken.

439,Mr Richardfoster,"have been exceeded to an enormous extent; and I need only refer to a few of the principal public undertakings. When the Treasury building was contemplated, the State Government of Victoria was asked to undertake its construction .by contract, the work to be done by the State Works Department. partment put in a tender, but it was turned down, and then the Fisher Government decided to construct the building with day labour. . And what was the result? The building was constructed at a cost which exceeded the State Government tender by more than 60 per cent. The Federal Capital provides another instance, and honourable members know the awful losses which . occurred there. Then we have the Naval Bases and other Defence works, the East-West railway, the Northern Territory, and the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, all of which experiments have been carried out with day labour uncontrolled, and have meant the expenditure of millions. This Parliament has never taken the proper steps to put an end to that kind of thing, although day labour has proved a ghastly failure. There is no effective check against this disastrous system but the test of public tender; and a good many of us on this side of the House have done our best to insist on that test being applied, but have always found the numbers against us. I understand that this Government are introducing to a considerable extent the principle of public tender as a test of what public works ought to cost, and it is time the taxpayer ""came in "" somewhere, for he has not been considered for many years past. But while the Government are doing a . considerable amount of work after its submission to public tender, they are not doing half enough. Let me draw attention to one particular item that came under the administration of the present Treasurer ( Mr Watt) when he was Minister for Works and Railways. a great Railway Department to run the East-West railway, a work which is a calamity to this country. out success, to have an investigation; but if one had been made. I think this work would have been shown to be as great a disaster as the Federal Capital, or any of the other experiments of the Federal Government in the way of day labour. The cost of the railway was nearly double the estimate that was sanctioned by a previous Parliament, the excess expenditure being allowed to go on That Deby different Parliaments unti l an authorised expenditure of about £4,000,000 ran into £7,000,000. It is not finished yet. Then when the work was nearing completion and arrangement had to be made for running the railway, I asked, and entreated, the then Ministerf o r Works and Railways to let the question of running the line be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, that Committee to interview the Western Australian Government and the South Australian Government, with a view to their jointly running the railway for the Federal Government in the same fashion as the Melbourne-Adelaide express is run. The reply by the Minister of Works and Railways at the time was to the effect that it was the Government policy Minister? sent Treasurer ( MrW a t t ) , who said it was the policy of the Government to have its own Railway Department to run the railway. The people of South Australia and of Western Australia know a great deal better than those in Statesf a r removed from the railway what has been the result. If the Treasurer wishes to look into the public expenditure to find opportunities to save money, and with the object of avoiding the disasters of the past, let him send the Public Accounts Committee to investigate the rolling stock, plant, and all belonging to this marvellous Federal Railway ""Department between Port Augusta and Western Australia. pretty ugly story!

JOWETT -""What does the Railway Department cost per year? like to know; and that is a job to which t'he Public Accounts Committee could devote their time very profitably indeed. South Australia and Western Australia have all their railway administrative staffs in operation, and there need have been -.no further overhead expenses incurred by their management of the east-west Tailway. Under the circumstances, could not these two States have managed the rail-way more satisfactorily, and at very -much less expense, than could men living j n Melbourne?

I would very much like the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the Northern Territory expenditure, especially on railways, and see what the cost is as compared with that under the Railway Commissioner of South Australia. now. should be; but, so far, I do not think that the revenue, in its relation to the necessipossibility of having increased producties and the expenditure, will bear the light of day. 1 should very much like to deal further with the Northern Territory, but I have not time now. I should like to give honourable members two or three lines of figures to show how public expenditure has increased in the Commonwealth during the past eight years. In 1910, the Federal expenditure was £7,499,516, while three years lateT, in 1913-14, it was £15,458,770. In 1910 the revenue was £15,540,669, whereas in 1913-14 it was £21,741,745. It will be seen that in five years the expenditure increased by 100 per cent., and the revenue by 40 per cent. Most of that period was of unparalleled prosperity, «extravagance and waste. It was a day of .drift, day labour, and "" go-slow."" Discipline had disappeared; all control of public expenditure was gone. It is about time we got back to the public test in regard to our expenditure. If honourable members do not take these matters seriously the day is not far distant when they will be compelled to do so. On the 30th June, 1917, the public debt of Australia Was £62.1,612,933. I suppose that it will amount to £700,000,000 by the end of June of this yeara bigger debt than the national debt of Great Britain prior to the war. For the next ten years loans will have to be renewed by us at the rate of £22,000,000 per year, and we are now borrowing at the rate of £80,000,000 a year for war purposes. Treasurer has informed the Committee that we cannot expect it to stop for some time yet. These figures are startling. Every loan raised in Australia meanB that a certain amount of money has been withdrawn from the working capital of the country, money that would otherwise be available for the development of the primary and secondary industries of the Commonwealth. To meet our enormous liabilities we must economize, increase our production, or impose taxation. We should have economy first; we should tax last. There is not that concern about economy that there ought to be, and there is not much tion when we continue a policy of extra-? vagance, and are forced to bleed the country of money that ought to be employed in private enterprises, by compelling its investment in Commonwealth loans. I hope that the Government will justify -the expectations raised by the statement of the Treasurer to-day, particularly in regard to submitting everything in the shape of public expenditure to the tender test. Economy may be effected by a very necessary amendment, long overdue, of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Under the existing law arbitration has proved to be a disastrous failure in Australia.

Mr Knibbs says in his last Year-book that there were 444 strikes in the Commonwealth, in the previous year, affecting directly or indirectly 173,970 people, who lost 4,599,658 working days, representing £2,594,808. That was at a time when our brave Australian soldiers were fighting for our very liberties on the field of battle. ciple to the wage-earner. There seems to be no sign of any improvement. We ought to m'ake a start by amending our industrial legislation to remove the control of our industries from the hands of one man. imagining that we can continue to bear our increasing burdens until we have our industrial matters put right. orable member consider to be "" putting them right?"" first place, the men who are a danger and a menace to the community ought to be put out of the country, and I shall be very much disappointed with the Government if they are not put out of the country instead of being released and allowed to run at large to carry on their mischief-making designs by disturbing our industrial conditions, and destroying the very best interests of every true and honest worker in the Commonwealth. I do not believe in paying men poor wages; I would pay them well, but I would make them earn their money. I would have no slowing down. I would follow that principle in which the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Page) believes, which he has practised, and to which he ascribes his success in life: that is to say, I would introduce a little bit' of piece-work, not only in shipbuilding, but also in other directions. If it is a good principle to apply to the building of ships in time of necessity, it is an equally good principle to apply in the interests of the country for all time. I am pleased that the Government have dropped a good deal of the price-fixing business; I am sorry that they ever took it up. It is a policy that has never been successful anywhere. In America, where they generally know how things ought to be done, when the authorities wished to make sure of getting as big a supply of meat as possible for war purposes, they did not fix a minimum price, but they offered to buy all' the pork that could Be produced in America at a highly remunerative figure:. That is the way in which to increase proin wages duction.

ImI t is useless this Farliament no other question has occupied a tenth of the time that has been devoted to the matter of the betterment of the condition of the wage-earner. It. is the leader, or the misleader, of theworker who makes all the mischief, and' gets all the plums. To-day men of intellect, heart, and character among the> workers are casting off their misleaders. It is a waste of public money to have a section in Parliament that is not a representative party, but is merely a body that receives instructions day by day from, irresponsible sources outside. I want to follow these Estimates as-, closely as possible. If there are items in them which I have reason to believe can* be cut down, I am one to cut them down. E hope that the Business Committee whicli: is going through the Departments will: lead to a considerable reduction in the Estimates next year. I thought that the Public Accounts Committee was to be* brought into existence to deal with such? matters. The consideration of Estimates in the House of Commons is a relatively simple matter, because a PublicA c counts Committee has previously givers them a more thorough investigation than a Committee of the whole House can possibly give them. Of course, in Great Britain the Committee of Public Accounts is really a Committee of specialists. Our Public Accounts Committee and our Publio Works Committee ought to be Committees ot specialists as far as it is .possible to make them such; but I am afraid that members are appointed to those Committees more for Party reasons than from any desire to select the best men for the work, the Committees are expected to perform.",97,Messrs Fox And Gibson S Experience As Textile Machinery Builders

I regret that I was unable to accept the position. I am sorry that I have not been able to gain the experience that members of these Committees have secured. I thank honourable members of the various Committees for the light they have thrown on a good deal of our public expenditure since they have commenced their investigations. Their investigations should be invaluable in explaining to the Parliament the way in which public expenditure in the past has been incurred. I sincerely hope that we shall have from them a good deal of in formation, born of their special direct knowledge of the works of which they speak. I have listened with considerable interest to honourable members opposite in their endeavours to point to the necessity for economy in the public expenditure of the Commonwealth. I also have been in terested in an examination of the systems of government in operation in this country, and have taken out figures showing the extent to which the people are taxed in order to maintain the machinery of government in respect of both the Commonwealth and the States. From the Commonwealth Year-Book for 1916-17, I find that in New South Wales, for instance. £5,000 per annum is paid to the Governor, £400 per annum to his official secretary, £350 per annum to his private Becretary, £350 per annum to his aide-decamp, £796 for orderlies, £1,653 for additions and maintenance of residences for the Governor, and £1,547 in respect of miscellaneous items of expenditure associated with the Governor's service. This gives a total of £10.096, which is paid by the taxpayers of New South Wales for the privilege of having a State Governor. The following table shows the payments made by the Commonwealth and all the States for the privilege of having a vice-regal representative: I was Commonwealth .. .. £25,279 New South Wales .. 10,094 Victoria .. .. 10,410 Queensland .. .. 7,447 South Australia . . -. 5,311 Western Australia .. 6,965 Tasmania .. .. 3,856 Total. . £69,362 Mr J.

Thompson, the head of the American Red Cross Mission to Russia, and a multi-millionaire, ""speaking in New York, saidWe talk about patriots in this country, but we dp not know what patriotism is until we see in Russia examples of what I should call the patriotism of mankind. While in Russia, I met some real patriots. ThereI met men and women who, for the benefit of their fellows, had spent three-quarters of their lives in prisons and chain gangs. ThereI met the heads of the revolutionary groups, who for fifty years or more had been risking their all for Russian freedom-Madam e Breshkovsky, Thaikovaky, and Lazaroff. Think of Breshkovsky, the Grandmother of the Revolution, seventy-four years old, a prisoner and an exile for thirty-four years, still working night and day, with might and main, for the benefit of her fellow Russians. This group surrounded Kerensky, who believed in working out the social problem by the Russian Labour classes, in conjunction with the property-owning classes. Then', again, I saw the workings of another group, equally patriotic, who believed that ultimate freedom and the possession of the land could only be worked out by the working men and the peasants. I can easily sec how Marie Spiridovna, now a leading figure in Russian fife, believes that freedom is only to be realized by a Government of working men alone. The Russian revolution, only a few months ago, released this young woman, now only in the thirties, from fifteen years' solitary confinement in a Siberian prison.

Here is another statement that the honourable member for Dampier might contemplate in his spare moments. Mr Arthur Ransome,"" the Russian correspondent of the London Daily News, writing fro m Moscow, saidNo one contends that the Bolsheviks are angels. I ask only that men shall look through the fog of libel that surrounds them, and see that the ideal for which they are struggling, in the only way in which they can struggle, is among those lights which every man of young and honest heart sees before him somewhere on the road, and not among those other lights from which he resolutely turns away. These men who have made the Soviet Government of Russia, if they must fail, will fail with clean shields and clean hearts, having striven for an ideal which will live beyond them. Eveni f they fail, they will none tlie less have written a page of history more daring than any other which I can remember in the story of the human race. They are writing it amid showers of mud from all the meaner spirits in their country, in yours, and in my own. But, when the thing is over, and their enemies have triumphed, the mud will vanish like black magic at noon, and that page will be as white as the snows of Russia, and the writing on it as bright as the gold domes that I used to see glittering in the sun when I looked from my windows in Petrograd.

Furthermore, considerable saving could he effected by abolishing 'Departments which might be called the by-product of the various Parliaments.

What chance have we to endeavour to force the Government to reduce expenditure? ment ! fore, or with other form of pressure. I regret that we cannot make the public realize that at this hour a handful of honourable members should be dealing with Estimates which were submitted months ago. The debate, I dare say, will be pushed to its illogical conclusion, namely, the passing of the Estimates. I am sorry that I cannot congratulate honourable members generally on their efforts to do their duty to their constituents and the country by seeing that this enormous total of expenditure is not fully discussed, with the object of reducing it wherever possible. Undoubtedly, there is a drift going on. We hear honourable members talking about Unification. We hear them saying, "" Get rid of these other Parliaments. Give all power into the hands of the Federal Parliament."" We deserve it, do we not? The Government have said, ""We are going to end this session in a few days. It does not matter what time has been wasted; you must put the Estimates through in a few hours."" Talk about Nero fiddling while Rome burned! It is nothing to what is going on to-night. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) has been interjecting in a manner which does not suggest that he is impressed with the seriousness of the position. The honourable member may be very well satisfied with the Administration ; but I am not. When we look upon the enormous expenditure, which was estimated before the armistice and with the expectation of a full war year ahead, it is reasonably fair to ask that the Estithis year should show a large increase mates should now be reviewed with an idea of reducing expenditure in view of the altered situation. I would go further than the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman). I am dissatisfied, not only with the enormous .expenditure and with the puny effort being made to stop the growth of extravagance in the Federal Service, I am not satisfied with the Administration. The administration of the Government at present has tended greatly to cripple the primary industries of the country. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and there are many honourable members on this side who also should support it. gest, should be sent for if the Government are defeated? teach the Government the error of their ways' We have done so before. The Treasurer took credit for what the Government did in connection with the Loan Estimates; but they were forced to do what they did. The honourable gentleman told us what he did when he was Minister for Works, but we never heard a. single word from him then about the gross extravagance of that Department, though I admit it occurred chiefly prior to his taking control. Instead of creating a new Department to operate the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, the State Governments of Western Australia and South Australia should have been asked upon what terms they would run it. Now we have a new Commonwealth Department for the purpose, and it is carried on at enormous expense. I hope that the pressure from honourable members on this side, that was responsible for the reduction in the Loan Estimates, will be used to prevent much of the extravagance that is provided for in these Estimates. The Treasurer says that he struck out £2,290,000 which the different Departments had asked for. It was to be expected that within the last three or four years a certain increase in the cost of government would take place, but it is not reasonable that the estimates for upon the expenditure for last year. The Treasurer said that he could not reduce these Estimates further, but I see a vote of £20,000 for the Science Institute.",110,Brisbane Russian Consulate

In ' connection with a matter of urgency, and particularly during war time, I should be prepared to give the Treasurer any sum he desired, but no one can say that the establishment of the proposed ScienceI n stitute at a cost of £20,000 for this year is a matter of urgency. Let honourable members consider the vote for the Meteorological Bureau, which is proposed by this Government, who are going to save money. There is £2,500 increase set down for the staff of that branch, and a large number of increases are provided for. The salary of one officer is to be raised from £504 to £588 ; of another, from £466 to £522; and of three others, from £406 to £480. New appointments are also provided for. No one w ill say that weather reports are of such great importance that these appointments could not have been lef t for some future date. Let honourable members consider again the huge expenditure upon the Northern Territory. W ill any one dare to say that there is not an opportunity to reduce expenditure there? I have been looking up the Estimates of expenditure for the Northern Territory from 1913 onwards, and I find that it is like nothing so much, as a huge mushroom growth. In view of the high taxation which the people are compelled to pay, and in view of the money which must be provided if our returned soldiers are to be properly looked after, it is only f a i r that we should demand that there shall be no extravagance in the government of the country. I take the expenditure upon the H i gh Commissioner's Office,. I ask, in the first place, what is the H i g h Commissioner in London for? There has been an expenditure of nearly £1,000,000 in connection with the London Office. TheH i g h Commissioner was sent to London to look after the interests of Australia. He is there with a staff, but they are not permitted terests of the country. not assisting the State 'Agents-General to promote the interests of Australian industries. The Government w ill be in recess in a few days, and may then send to the Old Country any Minister they please. It has There are two Ministers there now interfering with the proper disposal of our products. What is Mr Fisheri n London for?

Although we have two Ministers and the H i g h Commissioner in London, the expenditure on the H i g h Commissioner's Office is increased this year from £8,925 to £10,650. The expenditure of the States and of the Commonwealth has shown an enormous increase during the past four or five years. In 1913-14 the expenditure of the different Governments in Australia amounted to £69,000,000. This year it amounts to £173,000,000. The war is, of course, responsible for a great portion of the increase, but not for the whole of it . In 1913-14, the taxation imposed by the States amounted to £6,304,000. This year it amounts to £8,984,000 or an increase of £2,680,000. The taxation of the Commonwealth amounted, in 191314, to £16,587,000; at the end of the last financial year it amounted to £24,523,000. We must come to a stage at which the people w ill be unable to bear any further taxation. The taxation of Commonwealth and States amounted, in 1913-14, to £4 14s. per head of the population, men,-women, and children, and this year to look after the ini t amounts to £ 6 17s. 5d. per head. They are In 1913-14, the public debt of the States was £294,000,000, and the public debt of the Commonwealth was £19,000,000, or a total of £313,000,000.

Some of the things that were done during the war were preposterous, and lent themselves to the favouring of the monopolist and the manipulator. The future of Australia depends on our pastoral and agricultural industries. In 1915-16 there were 12,484,000 acres under cultivation, hut the area next year was reduced to 11,552,000 acres, and last year to 9,698,000 acres, and I am afraid that it will be further reduced this year. This reduction in the area of cultivated land is due largely to scarcity of labour, but coupled with the reduction in yields, constitutes a grave danger. also been a decrease in our production of wool. In 1914, we produced 711,000,000 lbs. of wool in the grease; in 1915, 642,000,000 lbs.; in 1916, 550,000,000 lbs.; There has also been a big reduction in the yield of gold, and notwithstanding the big increase in prices during the war, the value of our minerals in 1917 was hot greater than in pre-war,years. These facts show that something must be done to assist our industries to a greater degree than they have been assisted in the past. made an announcement of its intentions regarding the coming wheat crop. I impress upon Ministers, too, the necessity when a guarantee is promised in connection with the wheat, for giving effect to it in its entirety. The Commonwealth does not give a guarantee wholly on its own, and when so much per bushel is guaranteed, the farmer, whose conditions are very hard, should not be kept out of his money longer than can be helped. a very difficult thing for him to carry on when he gets 3s. a bushel for his wheat to-day; another 3d. six months hence, and the promise of something more in the distant future. that there are difficulties in the way of winding up the affairs of the Pools, but the Government should endeavour to pay tbe f u l l amount guaranteed as soon as ?>ossible after the wheat has been delivered .tried to do that, as well as their finances have permitted. [353] the honourable member, knowing the way in which money has been expended in other directions. We have, approximately, 167,000,000 bushels of wheat in Australia to-day. The debit against that amounts to about £11,628,000, so 1 that there are 167,000,000 bushels of wheat and flour in the control of the Pool at the present time worth approximately £40,000,000. Surely, with an asset like that the farmers could be paid the f u l l amount guaranteed to them. The new harvest w ill shortly be garnered, and yet the amount guaranteed on the last crop has not been paid to the farmers. There has Honourable members do not' realize how badly the people in the back country are treated by the Postmaster-General.

615,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [2.20 A.m.],"than in the temper in which it waa submitted. The proposition is that the Committee should refer the Estimates back to the Government in order .that this'Committee might in some mysterious way obtain some guarantees of future economy. Honourable members have heard me on this subject before. I yield to no one in m y appreciation of the urgent need for economy in Australia, but I doubt if we could arrive at a more expensive way of achieving this result than by demanding, at this stage, that . a large number of clerks and other officers of the .Departments should be taken from their proper occupations and set to work to recast the Estimates, when all that is required is a guarantee that the Government will see that, so' far as possible, no money is wasted. given us that guarantee. satisfaction of knowing that quite recently this Government has given proof of its -sincerity in the matter of retrenchment. It has met my views, or, at any rate, a. great portion of them, in connection with -expenditure on the Naval Bases. It has met my views for a long time-and in this matter I was amused to find to-day that the views of the self-constituted leader of the Economy party in this debate seemed to be directly at variance' wibh my own, and I believe with those of every other student of economy in this -chamber in connection with the Federal Capital-in regard to steadying down expenditure there until we are in a position to know where post-war conditions will leave the Constitution and the Government of Australia. Holding these views on this .matter, I cannot vote for the amendment; but if I might at ""this late hour venture to place my views before the Committee, I would be grateful for the attention of such honourable members, as are awake. We have heard a good deal about the cost of running -this country. The cost is not only the cost of the various governing bodies. In >a truly ideal State, the Government, by wise provisions, guarantees that every citizen .is equipped in health, in mind, and in opportunity for the battle of life, [353}2 and protected in the enjoyment of -the production that he helps to create. Anything that hampers a citizen in the exercise of these powers is a direct tax on his energies, and harmful to the community over which the Government presides. In Australia to-day, not only have we State and Federal taxation hampering development, but we have also conflicting author*-, ties as between the States and the Federal Governments. You may take any industry you like, and you will find that the management pays far less attention to the' taxes imposed on it than to the -various laws that govern it. Industrial restrictions, as a rule, take up half the time of the management. "" These conflicting regulations operate as a direct charge upon industry, and are actually a greater burden than Federal and State taxation combined. It is difficult to live under the interpretation of all these restrictions. We have heard on every side, and recently from our own Prime Ministeri n England( Mr Hughes), and others in authority ^here, that the best chance Australia has of meeting her war obligations lies in in creased production; and if we are to achieve this desirable result, we must aim at increased efficiency in government d-n both State and Federal spheres. I do not wish to stress the matter, but I -do ask the Government to remember that a Constitution and system of governmenS good enough for Australia in the piping times of peace, .and before the. war had made its ravages upon Australian .finance, and left its mark, probably for years to come on Australian industry through the loss of Australian producers through the war, must, under these altered circumstances, be changed. The Government must realize this. They must set aside the vested interests of .politicians, and apply themselves to a consideration of the real interests of the community. People say these changes are bound to come. The sidine) has said that people will insist upon these changes. The longer I live, the more I irealize how strong are the vested interests of politicians. The general public are careless about these things; but it . is to the. interest of politicians to protect;",117,Brisbane Russian Consulate

The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN have ruled that I do not sustain it . your ruling on this point: The honourable member for Denison rose when the honourable member for Wentworth sat down. If you are going to give the call to an honourable member who resumed his seat while another honourable member was on his feet addressing you member for Den'son was on his feet addressing you, sir, when you put the ameudment, which was not heard here. In view of that fact, I ask you to rule whether the amendment was properly put. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN have no intention of ruling on the abstract point. I ruled on the facts as they presented themselves to me, and declared the amendment lost. I intend to adhere to my decision. If the honourable member for Franklin is not satisfied with that decision, he must. take the course that is prescribed in such cases. The amendment was resolved in the negative, and I cannot go back upon that decision. a . m . ] two most important Bills which recently occupied our attention, namely, the Wartime Profits BiU aad the War Precautions B ill , in order that I might not be accused of absorbing too much time, because I was very desirous of speaking upon the Budget. Yesterday the honourable member for Franklin was very emphatic in the expression of his views. As both of us hail practically from the same place, I cannot register a silent vote on this important question. I am bound to explain my attitude towards the Government, seeing that I intend to stand by them, at any rate during this session, because I believe they are justified in claiming my support. To-day I listened very attentively to the criticism of several honourable members, and subsequently I heard the reply of the Acting Prime Minister. In my judgment, he made a most excellent explanation of tlie position takeu up by the Government. He displayed a great knowledge of the financial situation, and demonstrated that he was desirous of The r e is a point of curtailing expenditure wherever it was possible to adopt that course without I detriment to the Commonwealth. I have every confidence in the honourable gentleI wish to have man, and I am of opinion that he also possesses the confidence of the great majority of the people of this country. We all know that he has experienced a remarkably trying time since he assumed the leadership of the Government, and every impartial critic must admit that he has exceeded all expectations by ' the He sat down. way in which he has filled the office of honourable Acting Prime Minister. That being so, I think that he is entitled to a fair deal, and that is all he asks for. I have never known him attempt to dictate to any member of this party. He has had, on occasions, to listen to most trenchant I . criticism, but he has never exhibited any bitterness as a result of that criticism. I think the honourable member for Franklin will admit that, because he and I have consistently striven to obtain from the Acting Prime Minister assistance to the fruit-growers of Tasmania in the direction of finding markets for them-, securing shipping space, and helping them in the evaporation of their product. Only last year we received an advance of 75 per cent, on the evaporated apples I abstained from speaking upon that we were unable to ship. The other day I experienced'a good deal of pleasure when I heard a number of Tasmanians eulogize the Acting Prime Minister for what he had done in the interests of the primary producer. I cheered their eulogies and I believe that the honourable member for Franklin did likewise. The Government have done something during these strenuous times towards getting our products transported overseas. That being so, would it not be most unjust for me to assist in bringing about a change of Ministry, thus handing over the reins of government to the Leader of the Opposition ? But even if that object were accomplished, we should secure no stable Government at this critical time. How could a Treasurer from the other side of the Chamber obtain such a grip of the position in which we find ourselves to-day as would enable him effectively to deal with the financial problems which will confront us within the brief period",119,Brisbane Russian Consulate

635,Mr Laird Smith (Denison) [2.39,"that remains of the current session ? And by whom would he be supported? By the same gentlemen who would have put this Government out? would they support an incoming Government? Just as long as it suited them, of course. Therefore, I contend that I am right in the attitude which I am adopting. 1 shall now give the reasons why I am supporting the present Government; and I have nothing to gain by stating my case. responsibility throughout my electorate, and, perhaps, I shall have the press of Denison against me. shall give my explanation so that it may be recorded f u l l y in Hansard, and in the hope that my attitude will be appreciated by the people of my electorate. There has been a great increase in expenditure, I admit, but if we are running an enormous business, and its scope vastly expands, the capital expenditure must be increased accordingly. days the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) can scarcely find an hour in which to remain in this Chamber, and participate in and listen to the debates. The reason for that is because he is so busily engaged in duties outside of the Chamber. from all over Australia, which are being introduced by honourable members. Tasmanian members, for example, had recently been waiting daily to secure an interview with MrW a t t . a deputation to introduce regarding a matter of great importance, dealing with one of our primary products. ing Prime Minister wasmost courteous. He indicated that he had gone to a great amount of trouble in communicating with the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in England, with the sole object of placing one of Australia's primary products on the English market. that he was doing all he could for us. ""Then, at the request of the Tasmanian Government, the Acting Prime Minister again received representatives of f r u it know how he intended to vote had a> growers, and heard their ideas, in the hope that he might be able to go further into the subject on Tasmania's behalf. If the small island State has taken up so much of the Acting Prime Minister's time, how much more do the interests of the bigger States demand his attention ? natured he is. How long are wearing him out, body and soul; and! then he has to listen to the most bittercriticism.

There* seems to have been no great desire to» carry the amendment. I do not complain of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro having gone away tonight, because he is practically always in an indifferent state of health.

The following materials have been utilized:with a man once to a meeting of a Khaki cloth, 4,280,000 yards; khaki cord, 2,020,000 yards; denim or drill, 0,014,000 yards; flannel, 5,200,000 yards. In addition, approximately 4,500,000 yards of flannel were issued to patriotic organizations, making 22,040,000 yards altogether issued by the Ordnance Department, or sufficient to reach from Melbourne to London. These particulars should demonstrate the necessity for large expenditure. Australia has risen to the occasion, and has served, the Empire faithfully and well. Her work has excited the admiration,' not only of Great .Britain and the other Dominions of the Empire, but of our Allies in the war. Since the outbreak of the war the Defence Department has shipped overseas 39.2S5 military horses, acquired at a cost of £788,810, o'r an average of £20 Is. 7d. per head.. In addition, the Commonwealth supplied 95,000 horses for the I mperial Government in India and France. The quality of the horses supplied may be gathered from the fact that two Light Horse Regiments trekked from 160 to 170' miles in thirteen days. The horses were ridden for fifteen hours, and were saddled up for twenty-five out of forty-eight hours. Of 900 horses only one knocked up, and all the rest finished fit and wellOwing to an expenditure of upwards of £750,000 between 1910 and 1913, the Commonwealth has been able to fully equip the Army sent overseas with small arms and field artillery. small arms were made in Australia, and the artillery was sent from Australia. Our' men were sent to the Front equipped as no troops were ever equipped before, and paid as no troops were ever paid before. All this is part of what the Commonwealth has done for the expenditure which has been incurred. It is said that Canada has done everything, and has sent munitions of war to England as.well as troops. has done something, as I have shown from the records of the Defence Department. Mr Laird Smith.

The Commonwealth Cordite Factory has supplied the propellant for the greater part of the small-arms ammunition used by the Australian Military Forces until their arrival in France.. It has supplied New Zealand also, and during the South-West African campaign we supplied the South African Forces. ""Gregory"" rifles? have that interjection. I expected that the-honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) would to-night have played the same old tune on the same old' violin, but for some reason or other he did not do so. What are the facts about the rifles to ' which he has so often referred? I was in the Defence Department at the time, and I know something about the subject. We equipped our men who went abroad with rifles made in Australia. They took the very best rifles made here. We got a report from an independent officer in Egypt, not an Australian, but an English officer, who pronounced our rifles to be first class. There was a very great demand at one time for rifles with which to train our men in Australia, and, to meet The the demand, rifles of all kinds were collected. The 200 rifles sent to Western Australia were not all made in our Small Arms Factory. Some of those rifles were made in Great Britain, but it was never intended that they should be taken out of Australia. They were merely used for training purposes.

I have here a copy of a letter sent on behalf, of the Hobart Marine Board to the Minister controlling the Meteorological Branch, in which the writer saysI have the honour, by direction of the Board, to forward herewith copy of correspondence with the Meteorological Department, from which it will be seen that the supply of daily weather bulletins, maps, &c., is to be discontinued owing to no provision having been made to meet the extra cost of paper and printing. The Board trusts that the Government will see its way clear to reconsider the matter, and continue the supply of reports, which are of the greatest use to the shipping community, and are very extensively referred to. The Board's offices are situated on the wharf, of the honourable member for Franklin and the reports are exhibited in a case outside, specially prepared for the purpose.

Some of us Were of the opinion that the presence of our splendid men in Europe, and the splendid work they have done at the Front, would give Australia such an. advertisement that it would be difficult to find ships in which to transport the people who would be flocking to our shores after the war But if people in the Old Country took up our leading newspapers and read therein the speech that the people of Australia are taxed to a other part of the world ; that they are on the verge of starvation, and homeless and helpless, while the Government are spending money like water, it is not to be expected that they would desire to .come to this country.

But this "" Do-Nothing Government,"" as tbey are called, are putting down bores at a distance of every 20 miles, and I believe are getting good water at 200 feet, so that this country may now be utilized for stock-raising. Afterwards we went in a south-easterly direction to the MaranboyT in Field, which we found was being developed in the most primitive manner. The men there were working with the hammer and drill,and I found that the man at the winch, being of an inventive turn of mind, had loaded the windlass in order to make it easier to turn.

We found there about 1,000 head of sheep. The ewes were lambing, and were doing splendidly under the care of natives. our t r ip we found splendid country, the development can best be achieved by the construction of a railway. When the line reaches Newcastle waters, I have no doubt that the Queensland Government will want to draw it over the rich Barklay tablelands, which Mr Kidman is reported to have said is the richest country in Australia. If we want to attract people to that country, we should run the line to Camooweal, and then, in justice to South Australia, carry a line down through the Macdonnell Ranges. I wish to refer again to a matter connected with the Post and Telegraph Department. . I find that, in the case of certain automatic public telephone machines at present in use in Melbourne, it is necessary for the user to press his foot on a lever ; and nine out of ten people, as soon as they begin to talk seriously, forget all about the lever. They lift the foot, with the result that the lever rises, and the connection is broken, so that the user has to put-another 2d. in the slot before he can renew the conversation. These machines ought to be removed -at once. * on trial. trial for a long time. The value of our shale o il deposits should be carefully in quired into by the Minister. From the "" W i l d O a t "" column of the Bulletin, of 88th November of this year, I extract the following: ""Good Australian"":-The good news.comes I never saw from Reno, Nevada (United States of America). A new process of treating oil shales has been perfected, not merely invented, for extracting crude oil from shales containing 30 to 40 gallons of oil, 30 lbs. to 37 lbs. of paraffin wax, 27 lbs. of ammonia crystals, 7 gallons of coal tar, and 45,000 cubic feet of natural gas. From the spent shale, after treatrftcnt, the inventor claims he can make a shale brick to be used as a solid fuel in place of coal. This br.ick gives 60, per cent, more heat than coal. The total cost of the treatment of the shale to produce these fuel bricks is less than 3s. 4d. per ton. This opens up a pleasant vista for Capertee and Murrurundi, and several other shale deposits in New South Wales. . It is claimed there is enough oil shale in the State of Utah to supply fuel for the entire United Ri?ht on through States for centuries. I do hope that the Minister-for Home and of which, I believe, Territories ( Mr Glynn) w ill inquire into this important question, with a view to utilizing the splendid shale o i l deposits which exist in Tasmania. I have spoken at some length to-night, because I realize that I shall have a pretty hard row to hoe at the next election, owing to the misrepresentation to which. I have been subjected.

But, unfortunately, owing to the way in which for generations past our country has teen handed over to foreign traders, we have not been able to face the financial trial which the war has imposed upon us iu the way that other countries have faced it. Chiefly owing to that misfortune we are confronted with the necessity for resorting to expedients which injure our national pride. But I am not going to advocate the wholesale curtailment of salaries or the dismissal of public servants T h is is the fifth honat the bidding of a few penny pilferers of the people's liberties throughout the length and breadth of this country. If we could afford to spend £1,250,000 weekly upon the war, surely we can continue to pay a living wage to our. public servants until we are able to adjust ourselves to our changed conditions, until we profit by our mistakes and choose a better path. Wholesale economy if put into immediate practice would only create fresh difficulties.

We have been told that the Government, by some miraculous power, are to do something which none of us has told them how to do. They are to reduce our expenditure by tens ofmillions of pounds, and at tlie same time are not to touch , any section of the community, but are bo lend a willing ear to the ever increasing demand for fresh expenditure throughout the various Departments. WhilstI have the fullest sympathy with every section of the community which is willing to work, either with head or hand -and I regard all such persons as workers, no matteT what may be their station, in lifeI recognise that we have to give some hostages to sincerity by showing that we are capable of self-sacrifice, and of making the concessions which we so loudly claim for others. ' I have endeavoured, even at the risk of being misunderstood, to urge the farmers of this country not to listen to blind guides, but to realize the position in which we are placed. quitted this House to-morrow, I suppose that I would be the only one who would go back to the actual work of wheat-growing, in which I have been engaged for the past twenty-nine years. .But, notwithstanding much that has been done contrary to the interests of the genuine farmers of Australia, I affirm that, because of the broad principles that were laid down to assist us during the war period, we have been saved from absolute extinction. In addition, the values of our properties have been maintained, notwithstanding that, in regard to details of administration, much has been faulty, imperfect, and extravagant. Concerning the Wheat Pool, I desire to make a few observations. It was first claimed that the originator of the pooling idea was the Victorian Minister of Agriculture ( Mr that the wheat could be landed in AusHagelthorn). that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was its author. NowI claim to have been a very close student of this matter. I was in the House when the idea was first promulgated, and I am sure that if the Leader of the Opposition were present he would confirm my statement that its real authorwas a gentleman from whom I differ upon, many mattersI refer to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Holman, Honourable members will recollect thatwhen the drought of 1914 was upon us, and it was clear that Australia was notgoing to produce sufficient wheat to feed her people-muc h less to provide seed for the next harvestMr Holman put forth one of the most statesman-like ideas ever launched. And, strange to say, hehas been more cordially detested on account of that very action than in regard: to anything else he has done throughout his career. He realized that New South Wales had sufficient wheat, at any rate, to feed the people of that State, but that the other States had not sufficient for their needs. He vainly strove to get the other States to engage in a co-operative system by which Argentine wheat could have been purchased for Australia to make up the 10,000,000or 12,000,000 bushels of which we were short. A t that time enemy raiders were in the Pacific. It was questionable whether the squadron of German, vessels If every honourable .member might not cut us off from our food supplies, and immediate action was necessary. Mr Holman, in his famous telegram of 18th October, 1914, asked the other wheat-growing States to join in at co-operative system-to purchase necessary wheat supplies at once, so as to makeup the quantity required in the Commonwealth. As a member of this House, in company with the then honourable member for Indi, Mr Parker Moloney, I consulted some of the members of the Labour Government of the day, and we asked them to take that action which the wheat-growing States had refused to take. About November, 1914, we asked the Federal Government to purchase at least 10,000,000 bushels, and to land it in theports of Australia. The then Minister for Customs( Mr Tudor) assured usLater we were assured tralian ports for 5s. 3d. a bushel. Therewould be no difficulty about that, if the Commonwealth Government had the constitutional power. .There was no War Precautions Act in those days, and the then Attorney-General( Mr Hughes) said the Commonwealth Government had not the power to distribute one grain of wheat throughout the opportunity like act was lost to the I regret the stunted nature of the powers of the Commonwealth Constitution, deprived all Australia of the great benefit which would then have been Some of the States had to purchase huge quantities of wheat at tremendous Mr Holman caused his Wheat tion Act to be introduced-an never would have been put on the statute book had all the wheat-growing co-operated as he had desired. I shall not discuss the merits of that Act, but at that particular time more than half the wheat growers even of New South Wales were absolutely without wheat, even for bread, to say nothing of seed. quently, an effort was made, under the Acquisition it may mers, terests of the consumers the was one of those farmers who parted with a certain quantity of our wheat for 5s. a bushel, and we thought it hard that in Victoria the few men who had wheat should be able to sell it for 7s. or 8s. a bushel.' However, the situation had the effect of quite a number of farmers putting in infinitely more wheat in 1915-16 than they had intended, for the reason that they were allowed to retain any proportion of the crop, which they had indicated, for seed. known that the Federal Government of the day, when passing the Freight Arrangements further than to supply shipping to the firms which < had hitherto wheat. upon' when the said firms, after ence, announced their intention to do no buying of wheat even after shipping had been provided, until such wheat was subject of sale contract overseas. now they were wise in that decision because of the wholesale commandeering of shipping secured under the.

Thus, and a charge was lodged against it that to perform a statesmanwhen the price was altered to allow the Commonwealth.

We have sold various quantities, I believe, up to 7s. a bushel in small markets which have been tapped by the Australian Wheat Board. Y e t a close examination will show that as to the Australian consumer who paid cash in advance, through the miller, for the wheat consumed, his quota bore no interest. And for that portion received by the millers It is not generally the ordinary 3£d. per bushel paid to outside handling agents Was not paid to the millers. They received l j d . a bushel.

The net result will go to show that the Australian consumer has been infinitely the best customer which the Pools and the farIt is clear mers have had up to date. We should remember, too, that the Australian consumer controls the majority of members of every Parliament; and, consequently, uncertainty with regard the consumer could have prevented the But to system of guarantees from operating. condition And while I do not' admit that we make money as wheat-growers under these guarantees, yet they assure for us. that there shall be no actual monetary loss; anda made it their business to belittle the very important point-the value of our efforts of the Wheat Pool, and to predict lauded property is being conserved. An outcry was raised against what was wondrousfield to operate upon because, really a fine idea of the Prime Minister unfortunately, the wheat-growers had met of policy when he sold 3,000,000 tons of when the 1915-16 crop, came along, and a Australian wheat, and got the money 2s. 6d. advance was made-which ' the without delivering a grain of it . cry was uttered by false guides of the amount was not sufficient to cover the exfarmers who had sought, for reasons penses of two seasons.

I heard -an honourable member last night depicting the fearful condition of the wheat industry of Australia at the present time. bad condition, but the reasons given by the honourable member were not quite correct. diminished, but why has it diminished?

Horses that were worth from £ 3 0 to .£40 each can now be bought for from £ 8 to £ 1 0 , and their machinery is worth next to nothing. who are to be pitied, and no provision has been made to enable them to take up mixed farming. I want to say that the sooner the people realize how dangerous is the position :in regard to wheat-growing, the better. We have to hope that we shall be able to keep our millions of tons of Mr Lynch. wheat fit for human consumption u n t i l ships materialize from ' some place or another by which we can transport it overseas. "" But the outlook is not too brilliant common-sense proposals were for us in view of the fact that America accepted, and there was not has a coming crop of from 700,000,000 to 900,000,000 bushels, and a crop of I 2,500,000 bushels of corn. It does not seem as if any special facilities are likely to be afforded for shipping wheat from Australia to enable us to compete in the markets of the world with the highly guaranteed crops grown in America and elsewhere. Whilst our position is not'hopeless, it is sufficiently grave to excite in us the I have therefore advocated that greatest concern. But, knowing the difficulties with which they are faced to finance the thousand and one ventures that are upon their hands, I decline to ask the Australian Government to guarantee to the wheat-farmers the impossible prices for their wheat which have been demanded, and to pay them on the spot. I realize that it would be absurd to ask the It is true that it is in a Government to give a guarantee in con-, nexion w it h OUT wheat which might u l t i mately land this community in losses The area under wheat has amounting to tens of millions sterling. If the wheat-growers get justice and f a i r play, and are protected from the "" sharks "" who, without protest, have been all-owed to prey upon them since the in ception of the Wheat Pool, their position These. may-not be so bad. They should be given a larger say as to the practical methods by which their wheat is to be conserved. . They should be 'taken f u l l y into the confiIn dence of the Government, and if they are given a f a i r say in the practical administration of the Wheat Pool, they w ill be perfectly satisfied. If the farmers are protected in those things which are necessary for their production, they will receive much of the assistance of which they are in need. Eancy a small settler having to pay to-day 30s. per cwt. for rock salt for These are the men his few sheep when, a few years ago, this article could be obtained for from 6s. to 7s. per cwt. The cost of everything else that the small farmer requires has in creased in like proportion. I have dealt somewhat at length with the question of wheat, because I realize ' that there is a grave misconception concerning it in tlie minds of the people. Men who ought to know better are trying to poison the minds of the farmers. I have no objection to farmers having a party of their own in Parliament or elsewhere if they please. Owing to the unbridled desire to mop up the people's birth right throughout the length and breadth of Australia, the genuine settlers have been relegated to out-of-the-way places, and have had to carry on their work under such conditions that permanent prosperity has been denied them. Is it any wonder that we should find opposition to systems and principles the adoption of which has robbed the people of their 'birth right? If we are going to weather the financial storm, we must develop truer and better systems of production and distiibution. This is essential if we are to make this empty continent the home of freedom for tens of millions of people that it ought to be. If we are not going to make of this'country a cockpit in which we shall fight in sections, to the detriment of true advancement, then sections of the community must realize that it is necessary to sacrifice a part at least of their privileges and the recognition of the rights of others must be maintained. I feel that the very necessities of our position begotten of the war will work the miracle, and will lead us from the path of selfishness which we have so long pursued. I am not a slavish follower of the Government. I differ probably from honourable members on both sides in my ideas as to how production may be best assisted and scientific distribution effected. I may differ from a majority even jsf the people who have sent me to this Parliament, but T shall not toady to them or to any one else by denying the opinions. I hold. I feel that the Government have made many mistakes, and that the interests of sections of the comnranity have been injured by the meddlesome officialdom that has 'been permitted to control important affairs. The Government can look forward to bitter hostility in consequence. many mistakes; buf I say that, with all their faults, no abler men can be found amongst the public men of Australia today to carry on the affairs of this country. WhilstI think so, and.whilst I deem'them worthy of my support, they shall have it . I do not think it is fair that men who were elected to support the Government at a crucial time should cut the thread of their allegiance at any moment they please. If members of the party on the Government side feel that they are wrong, there is a way in-which they can express themselves. They can maintain their promises in a wav which will result, not in injury to the Government or to the country, but to the profit of both. I believe that the members of the Governmentare not anxious to retain the tremendous special powers thrust upon them by reason of the exigencies begotten of the war. They are, I have no doubt, as anxious to be rid of those powers as we are anxious that they should be divested of them; but I differ from those who think that Governmental interference is not essential to production or distribution. We need to .evolve a system that will be truly scientific and which will induce every man and woman in this country to give the best that is in them to assist in the great work of establishing just systems of production and distribution that has been thrust upon this community. I am quite prepared to admit that criticism of the Estimates, after an all-night sitting, is not likely to be productive of very much improvement; but that is not my fault. It -is a necessity thrust upon me by the action of the Government, and I do not propose to set aside the responsibility I owe to the country and to my constituents on that acount. I remember that we were promised that this would be a financial session. We have dawdled through it for the greater part of the time in considering measures which have had nothing whatever to do with finance. Some of them have been of no great con r sequence to the country, and one or two of them have been, in my opinion, prejudicial to its interests. Now, almost at the last minute, we are expected to tackle I agree that they have made these Estimates in the spirit in which they ought to be dealt with. There is no doubt whatever that the present position is one of grave concern..",132,Brisbane Russian Consulate

There is one stern fact from which there can be no possible escape. avoid be before us morning, noon, and night, summer and winter,, year in and year out. It is the load of debt incurred by Australia on account of the war It w ill amount to £350,000,000 before we have squared everything up, and means an annual charge upon the country of more than the total net revenue of Australia in pre-war years. We shall have at least to double our net revenue in order to meet these obligations; and to a community so small as ours, that is a very serious situation to face. It is not, however, a hopeless task, and I do not want to appear unduly pessimistic-about the situation. There would be no reason whatever to worry about it if the people were seized of the facts, and if the Government showed any indication of tackling the responsibilities T have just indicated. I do not want to attack the Government on this matter. I wish it to be understood that my criticism is intended to direct them towards those steps that they ought to take, but that they have not taken, and do not appear likely to take, so f a r as I am able to view the situation. One has only to look back on the last four years to realize that Parliament has failed miserably in the duty put upon it by the Constitution and the people, and that various Ministers have taken advantage of that condition of affairs to deal with their duties and responsibilities in a manner that is not creditable either to them or to us. I am afraid this state of affairs w ill continue so long as the Westernport, as a Naval Base. I heard Government remains the master, and not the servant, of Parliament. We have seen enough during these few years to justify a determined attempt by Parliament to revert to the true conditions of constitutional government, -and to insist that the Government shall not rule, but shall serve, Parliament. If the Government refuse to accept that situation, they should make way for those who are prepared to do the right thing. In matters of administration, where we look to the Government for a lead to the country, we find, for the most part, a record of deplorable failure. The condemnatory reports on the administration of the , Defence 'and Navy Departments are We cannot of a character that we cannot afford it if we would. It will to regard with indifference. To me it is a matter of very grave regret that Parliament has not asserted itself as it should, and, in the face of those reports, have demanded that a change should be made in regard to the administration of those Departments. For the last twelve months recruiting was an absolute farce and makebelieve. There was nothing but waste in the expenditure of public money with very insignificant results. During the last nine months of the war, the so-called recruiting movement cost the country no less than £316,000. And when one recalls the voluntary ballot one is almost ashamed to belong to a Parliament that tolerated. such a thing. When we turn to the Naval Department we do not.find a much more satisfactory state of affairs. It is true that we have curtailed expenditure temporarily on the Naval Bases, where so much money has been wasted already, and in connection with which there has been so much mismanagement; but it is singular that the curtailment of expenditure is in relation to those Bases which our adviser at the outset indicated as being the most important of all, and that work is being carried on at the third Naval Base, the most insignificant of the three, and where extravagance and waste has been most apparent. I have endeavoured for some time to find out the reason for the extraordinary selection of that little shallow backwater known as Hann's Inlet, in ihe Minister for Defence put the responsibility on to Admiral Henderson, but Admiral Henderson had no more to do with it than I had. It seems to have been selected by some subsequent authority following upon Admiral Henderson's general recommendations, and I repeat that the best thing that could be done now is to leave it severely alone, because we shall only be throwing good money after bad if we continue with the work there. Before Hann's Inlet is made suitable for the functions which it is intended to perform, a much greater sum of money must be thrown into it than has been in dicated so far. A t any ra£e, I would remind the Government that their duty in connection with these Naval Bases is to carry out work on the more important of them and to leave the minor Bases se-. verely alone' for the present. Bothi n the public press and in the House of late there has been a good deal of criticism of repatriation. The Ministeri n charge (Senator Millen) is an able man, and he works very hard; but, unfortunately, his Department is smothered in red tape. That is always the trouble with officialdom, and I am one of those who believe that repatriation can be carried out more cheaply and efficiently by two or three . business men dissociated entirely from political activity and interference. They should be given practically a free hand, limited, of course, by the general supervision of the Government. Until something of that kind is done, I think there will be general dissatisfaction and friction, with consequent waste and unnecessary expenditure. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has challenged those members who have attempted t'he somewhat unpleasant duty of criticising the Government in regard to financial matters to show where, in these Estimates, any. very considerable sum can be saved. perhaps there is no particular item of any great magnitude that could be struck out; but the difficulty is not so much that there is any huge hole in the ship as that there is a large number of little leaks through which waste is occurring. would have been very glad if the Government had taken the hint given by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and had withdrawn the Estimates in order to discover some of the leaks and give a lead to the country in the matter of economy. As a rule, when a business is going back, the very first thing the responthey are given any chance whatever, are sible heads to do is to look around and see where the little leaks are, and there generally they find the real That is undoubtedly our position as a Commonwealth to-day. Here, there, and everywhere throughout the Estimates are indications of leakages which, in the aggrestand, these publicity officers are supposed gate, amount to a very considerable sum indeed; but more importantthan"" the actual loss of money is the moral effect, because, as I have said, the Government ought to give a lead to the people in economical administration. Mr Fowler. Ministers appear to ignore this phase of their duty altogether. When we look around and see the numerous Boards and Committees that have been appointed everywhere, the attitude of the Government appears to be the very abnegation of Ministerial responsibility. Some of those Boards are, of course, necessary; but little justification can be shown for many others, and there seems to be an 'absolute indifference on the part of Ministers as to the need for-economy and efficiency in administration. There is a large fleet of Ministerial motor cars. I am quite sure that the country could be just as well served if we dispensed w i th the Government' motor garage, with its chauffeurs and motor cars, and engaged cars from the ordinary commercial garages when Ministers really require such conveyances. Some seven years ago I called attention to ' the commencement of this state of a f f a i r s I might, indeed, refer to it as a scandaland when, of course, the position was not so serious as it is at the present time. When we have reports of these cars being I am prepared to admit that discovered in circumstances that undoubtedly indicate that they are not being used on the work of the country, it is about time the Government took the matter into serious consideration. The appointment of publicity officers I is another innovation for which there is no justification whatever. When I asked a question concerning the nature of their work, I was given to understand that they were engaged in the' preparation of matter for publication in the press. But we know well enough that newspaper men, if glad enough to publish all matters of public interest, and w ill lick any statement into shape for the public just cause of all the trouble. as well as any publicity officer can do it .

The next statement isThe Prime Minister is also giving his attention, to the prospect of selling further quantities of Australian wheat abroad, and to the possibilities of lifting the wheat that has been purchased by the Imperial authorities, and is at present awaiting shipment from Australia.

It to be regarded as a difficulty between a is undoubtedly a disadvantage, not only to the country, but also to those men who are anxious to give a fair day's work for their wages. It puts them in a false position. In Jhe interests of these honest workers, and in the interests of Australia, the Government should see that supervision generally is ' tightened up all through the Service, and that 20s. .worth of work is given for 20s. in wages. Civil servants in the outlying States do not enjoy the opportunities for promotion that are enjoyed at headquarters. It is a notorious fact that men have been appointed to responsible positions in the Commonwealth Service because they have been able to pull the coat tails of Ministers. This is a most undesirable state of affairs. Men closely associated with Ministers have a much better chance of appointment than have abler men at a distance from headquarters It is a misfortune to men in outlying States that promotion does not come their way, while others less deserving secure it because they happen to be associated with Ministers, or are employed at head-quarters. A ll positions, without exception, in the Public Service should be under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. No Minister should have the right to appoint a man who may have ingratiated himself into his good opinion, but may not 'be by any means the right person for a position to be filled. The failure of industrial legislation has become painfully apparent to the most indifferent.

Not only should we put our house in order, but we should indicate to the State Parliaments that it is about time they carried out the implied obligation that was entered into when . Federation* was When the Australian States federated it was understood that the State Parliaments would reduce their membership, their cost, and, perhaps, their activities precisely in proportion to the work taken over by the Commonwealth. Speaking generally, no such cutting down of expenditure has been made by them. They ""have carried on practically with all their paraphernalia of sovereignty, with as many members as prior to Federation, with two Chambers, and with the same staffs of officials.

As to the demand for economy, I hope that the Government will not be led astray by the newspapers. The Age newspaper, more especially, has laid itself out to ruin wages of first class tradesmen came down Australia. That may not be its intention, but if its advice be followed with respect of public expenditure, ruin will undoubtedly take place. careful we shall have the biggest unemployed problem that we have ever had to solve. Age is largely read, and-is well conducted by capable literary men who know how to run a newspaper in their own interests. They care not what is the result of any policy adopted by them as long as it tends to the success of their own publication. They are prepared to take up any political party whose policy they are permitted to mould, and to attack any party that is not ready to allow them to do that. They charge the present Government with waste and extravagance. I'am not going to say that the Government have not made some very foolish mistakes. money is of no use to any country; but I think that the Age should he fair, and that iu dealing with the great increase that has taken place in public expenditure they should show that the war has been largely responsible for it. As it is, the Age is trying to stop expenditure even on Teproductive works. If it succeeds, the result will be chaos. I invite Victorians to recall what happened in the eaTly 90's, when the Patterson Government were in power. That was a .Government of economy. Public servants were dismissed in a wholesale fashion, and the expenditure of the State was enormously reduced. The Tesult was that we had a city of empty houses and grass-grown streets. In New .South Wales, the effect of the land boom would have been felt to the same extent as in Victoria but for the action of the State Government. In the first place, the Government of New South Wales came to the assistance of the 'banks, and took steps to prevent them from-closing down. I have no -particular interest in the capitalistic section of the community. My support does not come fromthat quarter, nor is it likely to do, but I know that in the early 90's thousands of men were thrown out of work in this State, and the to about 5s. per day, merely because the Government followed an unusual .policy of public economy in public expenditure. In New South Wales, the old gentlemen we are not very of the Legislative Council actually stayed up all night to pass a Bill to prevent the banks from closing their doors, and the State Government borrowed money for reproductive purposes. Under that policy the crisis which followed the boom there was hardly felt, whereas in Victoria there was so much distress that fully 100,000 people had to seek employment elsewhere. South .Wales the wild land speculation that took place here. member is mistaken. At North Shore to-day is to be seen a great cantilever bridge stretching over an. arm of the harbour, and absolutely unused. That bridge was built during the old boom days by a Waste of land syndicate, of which the Duke of Manchester was a member, and which had the idea of creating a new Sydney in that part of the metropolis. That land company alone expended nearly £1,500,000. This illustrates my contention that land speculation was indulged in just as largely by the people of New South Wales as it was in this State. so quietly disposed of in OUT absence a little while ago that I'desire to call attention to the fact that there is not a quorum present. (Quorum formed.) I , with thousands of other Victorians, had to seek a livelihood in another State.

722,Mr Mathews,"In Sydney, between the years) 1893 and 1896, I workedwith a German named Hermann. Hermann. well. This man left Germany because he detested the German laws and military system, and the boy, when he arrived, was only four months old. There were two other brothers, both of whom enlisted; but one 'was afterwards rejected for some reason of which I am not aware. The elder brother is now in business in Sydney, and four weeks ago, after the war was over, somebody discovered that he had never been naturalized. His brothers, oF course, having been born here, are Australians; but, he, despite the early age at which he arrived here, was arrested and interned as a German. In time of war, of course, the Government might be able to show some justification for internArgus and Age of the 16th of this month. ing such men, but we all know that some have been detained unnecessarily. I admit the possibility that amongst the men interned are those who were desirous of working detriment to the Allies and the Empire; at any rate, I know several suspicious cases. However that may be, by no-stretch of the imagination could any suspicion be attached to this man. He has a wife and family, and a business in Sydney, and by his detention his family will suffer, and his business will ""go to the dogs."" I pleaded on his behalf with the Department, but I was informed that, although he was only four months old when he arrived, he is .regarded as an enemy alien, and must remain interned. I do not know where this sort of thing is going to end, but if it is continued it will show that we are not acting up to that standard of civilization at which we aim. It is useless, of course, to expect that the Government will alter their determination, in these matters, but I cannot help regarding the internment of this man as a positive crime. He is ruined financially, and impaired in health; and I suppose I must leave the matter as it stands. I have had an opportunity of visiting the internment camp at Canberra, and I believe the internees are looked after very well. Of course, they do notlive in up-to-date villas, and the Mr Mathews. privacy they enjoy is not what it might be, but still the accommodation is very He has a son, Paul fair. Several had nothing to say against I knew Hermann, senior, the Government, but enerely wished that He was born in Pomerania. the war was over in order that they might be free. They recognised that they were being treated, perhaps, better than might have been expected under the circumstances, but they felt the loss of their liberty. To keep these men longer than is necessary is not showing that good feeling that might be looked for under the. nircumstances. It is useless for the Government to try to evade their responsibility in regard to the censorship. The other day I endeavoured to get an answer from the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) in regard to 1 a certain article which had been reprinted from an English paper in. the We, on this side, from evidence in our possession, are of opinion that the war could have been over, earlier, and that Britain was one of the principal causes of the delay of peace. We ought to have been allowed to express that opinion, but were prevented. Now, however, in the article to which I refer, it is .said that when the Allies were winning they would not hear of peace, and that when Germany, apparently, was on the victorious side, Ludendorf would not hear of peace. Why is the Labour and Socialistic press not allowed to print similar articles? The circulation of the Age and Argus far exceeds that of any Labour journal; and why this censorship of the Labour press is continued in this unfair way I cannot imagine. Some few weeks ago the Acting Prime Minister received a deputation introduced by myself, the proceedings of which had an unfortunate ending. The deputation showed the disadvantages under which the Lahour and Socialistic press labours in this connection, and pointed out that many works dealing with economic and industrial matters had been suppressed. Again, I cannot understand why the Government should withhold this literature, which is desired by many people in Australia. We are assured by the Acting Prime .Minister that the Government does not desire to reap any political advantage from the War Precautions Act, but still, as weknow, this censoring is going on. It is foolish enough to prevent Labour newspapers .from publishing original articles, but it is still more foolish to prevent reprinting articles that have already appeared in the British and other press. Age not British newspapers? there is such a thing as British fair-play, and that is what one does not get from, either of these papers, if one happens to disagree with them, politically or otherwise. I know we cannot expect the Acting Prime Minister to be here at this hour of the morning, in view of the strenuous time he has had, and, in any case, I know that anything I say would have very little effect. I should like, however, one of the Ministers to look into this matter of the suppression of literature, and have these books examined by some common-sense person. have been given for a number of these books-to be released. I fancy a letter was signed to that effect the other day. have been released; and I can' assure the honourable gentleman that many of them are such as could be read and agreed with by honourable members on both sides of the House, and could not possibly be of any detriment to the Empire.. A question of some importance is the delay in handing the: returned soldiers their deferred pay.. In this regard I have received the following communication: Referring to the matter of the deferred pay as mentioned by you in tha House, per extract herewith, I beg to submit to your consideration the advisability of removing in the future one of the principal causes of delay in these and other settlements with returned soldiers, namely, "" their pay-books, have not arrived."" This has been the statement very very often, and I suggest they should look ahead a bit, and insist that the books accompany the troops as they leave England, otherwise when the men begin to return in larger numbers, the confusion and delay promises to be much, greater, and may-amongs t a lot of men discontented and disappointed at their inability to obtain what is due to them in a reasonable time-lea d to serious discomfort and. trouble.. It is a matter that would present no difficulty whatever to any ordinary business, firm. Trusting to your good offices to ventilate the matter etill further. That letter is quite correct, for any business firm, if it did not send the money with the men, would forward it as quickly as possible. When the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) lef t Australia for England he said he would make a special effort in this connection, and I Argus and believe that something has been done. That gentleman is just as interested as I do not know; we are in the matter, and w ill, doubtless, do what he can. No doubt the Government have been "" t a k e n d o w n "" in the matter of pay, but it would be better for the Government to be deceived, even to a greater extent, than that men entitled to money should' have to go without it for solong. I do not say that there is any ill-feeling oh the part of the Department, theofficials of -which are, perhaps, as conscious as I am that £ 5 or £ 1 0 to a wage-earner is very handy at any time. I quite agree with my correspondent that when the men are returning in large numbers there may be trouble if they do not get a fair deal. The next matter I wish to. deal with is one connected with the Navy. The Acting Minister( Mr Poynton) knows, I believe that some that many of us have received telegrams from reservist members of the crew of the Una, which is to go to Raboul, contending that they ought to be allowed to return to their civil occupations. They' have been in the service for some time, andnow that the war is over, they feel, that they ought to be permitted to return to their families. MyseH and others, however, . have been assured by the Acting Minister that it is necessary that the Una should proceed to Rabaul,, and it cannot do so without a crew. straight back. difficulty is that the Una does not present the only cases. Men have been called up at Port Melbourne and W i l liamstown, both at the -training school and depot, and they also desire to return to their ordinary civil businesses. They are. at present earning only small money, and they could earn a great deal more in civil life, but, of course, being reservists, they had to obey the call. able to lay off some of these boats shortly.",144,Brisbane Russian Consulate

It is costing Australia money to keep our vessels there. The money might just as well be spent in Australia. Here is -a line of economy which the Government could follow. In peace time, the complement of a warship is nothing in comparison with what it is in time of war. I feel sure that we could discharge quite one-third of the complement of our fleet.

Many of them are returned soldiers, others are men who endeavoured to enlist, but were over age or physically unfit for service abroad. These men were allowed three weeks each year on f u l l pay. Their annual leave was due about NovemberI n my opinion the last,and some of . them were away on their ieave when the armistice was signed. Others were due to have their leave about that time. But the whole of the homeservice men have now been demobilized. The Government have treated them fairly ' by giving them a fortnight's leave on f u l l I quite believe pay, but those who had not taken their three weeks' annual leave were deprived of that advantage. They feel that they ought to be given what was due to them. I asked a question in the Housei n reference to the matter, but the answer given was not a reply to the question I submitted. The men who had taken their three weeks' leave also drew their fortsome of them had juit,. completed their leave period on the day that demobilization took place. The others seek to be placed in the same position. I do not think it is right for the Government to deprive them of their right to claim three weeks' pay in lieu of the leave they did nob receive. If the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) is sent to Great Britain for any purpose other than to give him a holiday, if he is sent there to carry out the duties of demobilization,it ynll be a crime. 1 may be said to be biased against him, but I consider that he would be the worse man. on earth to send Home to do anything which the officials of the Defence Department, in conjunction with the High Commissioner and his staff, cannot undertake. Undoubtedly the military I s there a possiofficials in Great Britain would run the show. That has been our experience in Australia in connection with Senator Pearce's administration. But apart from the fact' that the Minister for Defence would be unfit for the duties, it is quite unnecessary to. send any Minister Home. The press would do good work if they would select matters of this sort in order to show where unnecessary expenditure could be curtailed'. The honourable member, for Perth( Mr Fowler) has read out a list of great undertakings carried out by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), as reported by his publicity officer, but there is not one item in that list which the H i g h Commissioner, Mr Fisher, could not have carried out. cannot possibly attend to half of them.",146,Brisbane Russian Consulate

There will be no need for a Minister to go Home to attend to that matter. Extra men may be required in connection with demobilization and embarkation, and in connection with tbe matter of fixing up accounts and allowing our troops an opportunity to pay visits to friends in Great Britain, but the High Commissioner's office ought to be able to deal with all those matters effectively. Otherwise the office would be useless. Mr Fisher is as capable of dealing with this particular class of work aa most men could be, and there is nothing to prevent him supervising any matter on the list of undertakings the publicity officer has prepared in regard to the Prime Minister's activities. He ought to know the different markets by this time, and to be able to obtain all the ' information which the publicity officer says the Prime Minister is endeavouring to secure. The Minister for the Navy promised when he left Australia that he would endeavour to make a special effort to tate the return of our men, and the payment of their money as quickly as possible. If he has not been able to achieve success in that direction I am confident that Senator Pearce will be unable to do so. would be a mistake for us to economize at the present time by reducing salaries or wages to an extent that would prevent the public servants from being able to live in anything like reasonable circumstances. A great deal has been said during the progress of the discussion on the Estimates about the economies which have been brought about in the Postmaster-General's Department. I have a number of statements made by postmistresses as to the conditions which have recently been imposed upon them in respect to post-offices in small country towns, where the Department has economized by removing the telegraph in[354] struments and installing telephones in their stead. In this way the necessity for employing trained telegraph officers has been avoided, and postmistresses have been employed at small salaries, whom it is only necessary to train in the use of the telephone, and in regard to the various charges for postal services. These women are called upon to sign an agreement to accept any increase or decrease which the Department may decree, and the result is that their payments are consistently reduced. I have before me the case of a country town in which a permanent officer was receiving £4 per week, with an allowance if 15s. per week for quarters, free fuel, and an allowance of 8s. per week for cleaning the office. The total value of the position per week was over £5. of the office? mit that, in all these cases, the revenue is very small. This officer was replaced by a woman who undertook to carry out the duties of postmistress for £57 per annum. She received no salary while she was being trained to fill the position. I understand from her that, out of the £57, she was to pay her own rent. At the faciliend of 3 months her allowance was reduced to £43 per annum. Since then it has been reduced to £33 5s. per annum. During the fifteen months she has held the position of postmistress in that small town her allowance has been reduced by £25 The women holding these positions, I am informed, are not permitted to carry on any other business. They are not permitted to take in lodgers in order to supplement their earnings, and although they are required to remain on duty eight hours per day, the Department assesses their services as being worth only £32 5s. per annum. they to attend to ? mail per day, and, in some cases, only one per week has to be dealt with.

In cases to which I have been referring these women have taken over departmental premises previously occupied by permanent officials,, and the Department will not permit them to devote those premises to any other business purpose. I have in mind the case of a woman who for this work is receiving .£32 5s. per annum.

She was rather nervous about remaining in these quarters alone, and when friends went into the district, with the object of commencing business there, she was glad to allow them to lodge w i th her. was pleased to have their company, and they were glad of the rooms, for which she charged them 4s. per week. The fact that she did this was apparently reported to the Department, which called upon her in the first place to hand over the 4s. per week that she gained by sub-letting part of her premises, in respect of which 10 per cent, was actually deducted from her allowance. She agreed to hand over the money, but the Department then discovered that it would not be right to accept it , and she -was informed that she would have to get -rid of these' lodgers. They were accordingly turned out, and the rooms were left In vacant. The Department will not permit these people to supplement their scanty earnings by letting rooms in the permanent premises occupied by them. When complaint is made the official reply is that local business people are quite willing to take over the work. If this is how the Department is able to show a profit, I can only say that the system is one of which we ought to be ashamed, and that it is time that the Department was again showing a deficit rather than a surplus. These women are practically .the slaves of the Department, and are dependent upon it for a mere existence. We have to-day war widows-wome n who are in receipt of a certain income by way of pension-and from what has been told me by men in a position to know I fear that the Department intends to put some of these warwidows into these positions and to set-off their pensions against the allowances paid. stand that. these women to be treated as they are being treated to-day w ill stand anything. There is only one other matter relating to the Postmaster-General's Department to which I desire to refer. On some branch railway lines in Western Australia there is not a post-office. There are many townships on some of our country lines that have not a post-office. They have only one mail per week. A mail bag is carried on the train, and the Department is now forcing settlers to pay a late letter fee in respect of all letters She so posted in these mail bags. This is the only"" service which the people of these districts have, and yet they are called upon to pay a late letter fee when they avail themselves^of it . This is an unfair discrimination on the part of the Department as between town and country dwellers. These settlers are not receiving anything like the consideration that is extended to city residents. If economies of this kind are helping to build up the glorious postal credit balance of which we have all heard, I can only say that the sooner we have a postal deficit once more, ' the better it w ill be for Australia.",148,Brisbane Russian Consulate

749,Mr Corboy,"A country that allowsa.m.] -The honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler), who has indulged in a calm and well considered criticism of the financial position of the Commonwealth, naturally paid some attention to the construction of our Naval Bases. I understood him to say that previous Governments had displayed an anxiety to carry on Naval works that were not so essential to the defence of Australia as were others that should be proceeded with more expeditiously. Henderson. in his report speaks of Naval Bases at Sydney and Fremantle; all others are referred to as sub-bases. I presume that the honourable member, when he made this complaint, had specially in mind the works being carried out at the Flinders Naval Base. There has 'been there some departure from the scheme laid down by the eminent Admiral, and I believe it has been due to a desire to carry out more economically that portion of our Naval defence system. Admiral Henderson laid it down that certain training should take place at the iSydney and Fremantle Naval Bases, and that only, a limited amount of training should be carried out at Flinders. however, that Flinders should be the training centre for the seamen for the Australian Fleet, and that decision has naturally led to the Flinders Naval Base becoming a more important section of our Naval defence system. school, a gunnery school, as well as a wireplace on which a Base is practicable. A t less and other schools, which were origin-ally intended to be spread over the other Bases The idea is, I think, that Jervis Bay shall be the training place for officers, the latter two being on the west and east sides and Westernport the training place for the seamen of the Australian Fleet. In these circumstances, more buildings have been erected at Flinders than would have been necessary under the original schema Taking it as a whole, there is no better harbour than that of Westernport. it is satisfactory. The honourable member is not referring to Hann's Inlet? [354]2 member will but peruse Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice's report he will not be so drastic in his criticism of Hann's Inlet as he has been. Vessels of the deepest draught can be accommodated in Westernport. .Some critics have urged that Admiral Henderson, when he visited Australia, had grown so old in the service of the British Navy that he had become somewhat antiquated in his ideas. I know nothing as to his qualifications, but the general impression I have formed from a study of his report is that he was well qualified to express an opinion upon the subject with which he was called upon to* deal. Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice in a report, dated 11th December, 1913, dealswith the Flinders Naval Base, and saysAs the Base is specially required for destroyers and submarines, it is necessary that still water should be obtained, especially for the latter class of ship. surd in view of the fact that submarines, during the war have been working in stormy ocean waters? Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice's opinion as set out in this report, which goes on to state that I t is clear that any point chosen for a Base south of Sandy Point would It was subsequently determined, require heavy and costly protective works. The site, therefore, must be north off this point. A site on French Island or Phillip Island must be ruled out on account of the impossibility of railway communication. Any site on the east coast of Port Western is impossible on account of the amount of dredging which would be required, and the difficulty of We are to have there a torpedo railway communication The north arm of Port Western therefore remains as the only Hann's Inlet or some distance up Hastings Inlet a Base would be possible without protctive works. Near the entrance to Hasting's Inlet, at Watson's Inlet or Rutherford Creek, respectively of Quail Island, some protective works would be required. At any other'point on the north arm protective works of rather costly nature would be necessary to form a workable Base for destroyers or submarines. Owing to the large extent of foreshore at all points in the north arm, it is necessary todredge a turning basin at whatever, site may be chosen for the Base. An examination of the chart will make this apparent at once. A t Hann's Inlet the dredging of the turning basin will cost over 40 per cent, of the total amount",149,Brisbane Russian Consulate

756,Mr Fenton,"I am merely quotingof dredging. If the cost of the turning basin is eliminated as being common to all sites, the question arises which of all the sites mentioned above is the cheapest for works other than the turning basin, bearing in mind the fact that, in some cases, the works would be dredging only, and in other cases dredging combined with protective works. I have, after roughly estimating the works at each place, come to the conclusion that Hann's Inlet has been wisely chosen as the cheapest site for a Naval Base in Port Western, assuming that it is used for destroyers and submarines only. Quite apart from the question of the work at the Base is the question of railway communication, and in this matter Hann's Inlet gives better facilities than any other site. I have gone into the question of the position of the Base at possibly some greater length than necessary, and I feel sure that the same points as I have mention have been carefully considered by others, but I felt it necessary to the workers of this country.

Honourable members on both sides of the House are perfectly justified in making serious complaint of the manner in which they have been treated in this so-called financial session. The only time when the finances of the Commonwealth can be really analyzed is after the Treasurer has made his Budget speech, and the Estimates have been presented to the House. The Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) w ill admit that in days gone by, when he availed himself of opportunities to criticise past Governments, he regarded the Budget speech, and the figures associated country's financial position.

Practically the whole of this immense sum must be provided for by renewal flotations. Moreover, additional sums will be required for war, for repatriation, and for State public works. It will be seen that a Herculean financial task if ahead. There, in one pregnant sentence, we are given a f a i r idea of what this country has to face in the very near future.

On most of the loans to be redeemed, the interest is only 3 per cent, or 3£ per cent., and we shall be singularly fortunate, even with the best of methods, if on new loans we do not pay more than an average of 5 per cent. That surely makes one wonder whether, even in a country like this, which shows such a marvellous power of recovery, we shall be able to . keep pace with the expenditure.

On the question of demobilization I in tend to read one or two quotations. It appears to me, from the slow manner in which we are setting about our demobilization scheme, as though the Government were not prepared to receive men in large numbers early next year. Is there any design on the part of the Government in their being slow with their demobilization scheme, as compared with what is being done on the other side of the world ? Here is a newspaper cable: The demobilization of the British Forces returned from the war began in London on Monday. It is expected that by the end of the week several thousands of men will be arriving every day. The principal centre for the disbanding of the' men returning from France is Wimbledon. It will be seen that the British authorities are demobilizing the troops as fast as possible, always, of course, reserving a certain number for eventualities. from the battle front . son why we should be more vigorous in our preliminary effort. We have to bring a distance of 12,000 miles men who have been from home over four years; and the sooner provision is made for them the better they will be satisfied. During the war, the British, French, and German soldiers have always been able to visit their families for a week or two.

We have a perfect right to complain if we think that demobilization is not proceeding as rapidly as it ought to. I propose to quote from some remarks of Captain Carmichael, M.L.A. , who went to the Front, and returned only to take others back-with him. He is a man not likely to make any rash remarks, and one who, I think, has every desire to be fair;, and, therefore, the following newspaper extract may be of interest:Captain A. C.

' dip has a standard quality, but Sir John Higgins made investigations in regard to the matter-and satisfied himself, from the analysis made, that the Australian made dip should be used and should get preference over the imported dips. As a result of the assurance given by the Prime Minister, one firm of Australian manufacturers spent an additional .£20,00(5 in equipping their factory with the object of supplying Australia's requirements in the matter of sheep dips. T do not intend to go through the whole history of the matter, but the correspondence dealing with it shows conclusively that a serious injustice has been inflicted upon the Australian manufacturers of sheep dip, which, in some cases, has been proved even superior to Cooper's dip. lish such industries there are by-products which affect other industries. One of the chief ingredients of sheep dip is arsenic, obtained from arsenical ores. Thus the mining industry is affected. One firm manufacturing Australian sheep dip has employed its hands on three continuous shifts, but since the importation of dips has been permitted, it has only been able to keep one shift going, and in all probability that will be reduced now that the season is over. member aware that Sir John Higgins and the Central Wool Committee have done everything in their power to encourage the use of Australian dips ? member's word in regard to the action of the Central Wool Committee.

Prime Minister speaks of the big influences at work in London. means, underground or otherwise, the exportation of Australian leather to Great Britain has been prohibited, possibly because the tanners of the Old Country have been powerful enough to secure Australian hides, and turn them into leather.' American production preponderates in the copper world, and so much American influence has been at work in GreatB r i tain in regard to copper that our representatives on the other side of the world have not been able to make those adjustments which should have been made on behalf of Australia. I am not only pleading on behalf of the manufacturers of sheep dips; I am also pleading on behalf of the men who have been thrown out of employment, and on behalf of our chemists, who having succeeded in turning out an Australian product which, with the exception of sulphur, is made entirely from Australian raw material, are now baulked in their efforts. My protectionist faith I lay the blame on the Government, who ought to do something to establish new industries, and revive languishing industries. They could have prohibited the importation of these sheep dips.

It mqy happen that, owing to the matter having been ventilated here, some action will be taken detrimental to the industry. If so, it will again be ventilated in the House. Theso people were practically invited by the Ministry of Munitions to undertake the manufacture of sheep dips, and the manner in which they have been treated will not be an encouragement to other persons who are desirous of establishing Australian industries which we require to provide that variety of employment which By some will be so essential for our soldiers when they return. These negotiations have been going on practically for twelve months, but so f a r as the manufacturers are concerned, they seem to. have reached a dead end. The following is a statement as to the position of the local manufacturers:At the beginning of this year the Director of Munitions inquired as to whether, in the event of the imported sheep dips not being available here, as the raw materials were wanted in the United Kingdom, and also the shipping space they occupied was wanted for urgent necessities, manufacturers would undertake to see that sufficient sheep dip would be produced in Australia to supply the whole of the needs of the Australian pastoralists. After giving the matter very careful consideration, the manufacturers undertook that this would be done by(o) Increasing very largely their own sheep dip-making plant, and reserving the necessary raw materials.",155,Foster Muc H Would Sented I N One Paragraph I N The Budget

This decision was only arrived' at after several conferences with the Directors of Munitions, also the Chairman of the Central Wool Committee, Sir John Higgins, and in the full belief that the imported brands would not be available here. Indeed, the manufacturers were told, during the above negotiations with the representatives of the Commonwealth Government, that they would be expected to enter into a bond by which they would have to make a cash forfeit in the event of their failing to carry out the undertaking, and at the time they signified their willingness to execute such a bond. Later on, however, they were told that their assurance would be taken without the bond. In keeping with this undertaking, the manufacturers have in good faith spent some thousands of pounds, and also committed themselves to the expenditure of many thousands mere, and are now absolutely in a position to carry out the undertaking, which .was considered a solemn obligation to the Commonwealth Government, and had they not been assured of the demand they certainly would not have spent so much money in providing the supply. The manufacturers are now advised that several shipments of sheep dip have been made to Australia, and that one shipment of considerable size has just been landed in Sydney. This shipment consists of 1,000 cases ex Austral-Mede, and 750 cases by another boat, the Calulu; also that there is a further shipment duo in the Malta, which is due next month, besides others to follow. They are assured that these shipments have been made in direct opposition to the views expressed to the Imperial Government by the Commonwealth Munitions Department, as to their necessity, and evidently the parties interested have used improper or unfair influences to secure space for this superfluous article at the expense of other commodities which are most urgently needed here. If that is so, their interests deserve little consideration. In any case, to allow these shipments to Australia in the face of the above facts is a serious breach of faith, as well as a severe blow to the expansion of an important Australian industry. This is a very important industry, and there are others branching off from it . Since we have practically all the raw materials-suc h as arsenic and alkaliused in the manufacture of sheep dip, the only ingredient used in its manufacture that we have to import being sulphur, there' is no reason why we should not give the industry every encouragement. We have Australian raw materials ready to be turned into a finished product that Australians are ready to buy, and yet the market is flooded with . the imported Mr fenton. article. Having endeavoured quietly b u t straightforwardly to secure justice for an industry richly deserving of assistance, I feel that I am performing my duty as a public man in bringing this grievance before the Committee.

There are other incidental items of expenditure. I wish it to be understood that I am not reflecting on Mr Fisher personally. ""While he was a member of this House, although I was politically opposed to him, I always regarded him as a thoroughly conscientious and reliable man, and when he was appointed High Commissioner the House was almost unanimous in believing that he would render good service to the Commonwealth. But it is a serious thing if we are paying £5,000 per annum for an officer whose duties have been delegated to other branches. For instance, it is stated that the military authorities have practically taken possession of Australia House, and one returned soldier has informed me that before he could gain access to the High Commissioner he had to run the gauntlet of a military guard. I ask the Minister in charge of the Estimates to state what is the status of the High Commissioner to-day,and whether he is carrying out the duties for^which he was appointed. If not, is there any reason why we should continue to employ him merely as a figure-head, and that Ministers should be sent to London to perform his duties.

I said, "" H a v e you seen it ? "" and he replied, "" Yes, he came down on a Saturday, picked up Mr went off to tlie .races."" That sort of thing is degrading to parliamentary life, and I am surprised that Ministers descend to such practices. If we are to economize, Ministers should set an example; and, in view of the fact that the business of the country, has been carried on for many years without these luxurious methods of conveyance, and also that certain M in isters, to their honour, decline to use these vernors. The Commonwealth Electoral motor cars, the Government ought to make a clean sweep of the lot. That would be a f a i r example of economy to set before the country. Everybody knows that it is simply because the motor car is a luxurious means of travelling that this scandal is taking place all over Australia in connection w i th both the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments. The time is not f a r distant when this sort of thing and those responsible for it will be swept aside by an indignant community. agree with many of the remarks made by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler). I have been looking w i th alarm at some of the items in the H i g h Commissioner's office. I find that the appropriation for 1917-18 was £38,000, and the actual expenditure £49,174, whilst the estimate for the current year is £46,700. The economy which is necessary in these times should start in the London office. The upkeep of Aust tralia House is £9,500 per annum, which I think is considerably in excess of the upkeep of this Parliament House. I noticed also that £600 was expended last year in the purchase of a motor car for the High Commissioner's office. I have always advocated the co-ordination of* the services of the States and the I know of a Ministerial car Commonwealth. There are in London six Agents-General, representing the various States, and the expenses connected with them amount to about £40,307, whilst; in addition, there is an expenditure of over £46,000 in the H i g h Commissioner's office. If these services were coordinated a saving of from £25,000 to £30,000 could be effected, and both the States and the Commonwealth would , and benefit. We should not forget that the Federal Government and the State Governments are the instruments of the one sot of taxpayers. It would be a wise step to bake a referendum of the people regarding the co-ordination of various State and Federal Departments, such as the Electoral, Statistical, Immigration, and Taxation Departments, and the London agencies, and bhe abolition of State GoDepartment costs the taxpayers £53,700, and the State Electoral Departments, £86,275. The Commonwealth Statistician's office costs £15,013, whilst the Statisticians' offices of the States cost £ 3 2 , 1 1 7 ; on immigration the States spend £38,602 ; the High Commissioner's office costs' £48,841 ; and the States Agents-General, £40,307 ; The Governor General's establishment costs £26,875, and the State Governors, £42,489; the Commonwealth Taxation Department costs £273.067, and the State Taxation Departments, £178,705. The total expenditure under these heads for the Commonwealth is £417,496, and for the State, £368,495, or a total of £785,991. I venture to say that if these activities were co-ordinated, we could effect a saving of something like £250,000. In my opinion, there could not be a more popular cry to put before the people than economy in this direction ; and if the question were referred to the country by way of referendum, I feel quite sure that it would be supported by both Parliament and people.",159,Chairman Hon J H

This year it is proposed to vote £15,000 more than was voted last year. Did the excess expenditure come out of some reserve fund or the Treasurer's balance?

In the present Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department there are twelve heads of expenditure, and last year there were only seven heads. There is this further complication, that £35,344 is debited to the Department under five heads, and £34,844 credited under four heads, leaving as the remaining item £500 for the Council of Defence.

I do not' blame any particular Government for this arrangement, but it certainly should be simplified. Such simplification would bring about a reduction of the clerical staff, would save the money of the taxpayers, and would put members of Parliament in a better position for understanding the true state of affairs. The country is crying out for a reduction of expenditure, though there has not been a murmur against the spending of money in the conduct of the war. Yet, despite the protestations of Ministers that the pruning knife has been applied to the Estimates, there is still need for vigorous curtailment of them.

In America when any change of parties takes place it means that throughout the length and breadth of the country one set of officers is replaced by another. We have passed Public Service Actsi n the States and in the Commonwealth for the purpose of removing any possibility of political influence being exercised in regard to appointments in the Public Service. We have realized that it is an exceedingly bad principle to admit any possibility of political patronage being exercised in this way. I want to know from the Government what duties these publicity officers have to perform, whether their positions are permanent, whether a man who has been appointed by one Minister to the Professional Division may be displaced by that Minister's successor in office, or whether a Minister is to be obliged to have a man working under him in whom he may not be able to repose any trust? Of course, I must admit that my experience has shown me that our public servants give just as loyal service to one set of Ministers as they do to another set, no matter what party may be in power. chief duty is to prepare matter for his Minister. from the newspapers relating to the Department and prepare short reports for the Minister? with those duties.

In such circumstances his position would appear in the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Office, but his actual salary would be paid by the Repatriation Department. Another item requiring explanation is, "" Administration Expenses, Port PirieW h a r f , "" for which £2,000 was voted last year, but upon which there was an actual expenditure of £13,829 during the year.

Another service covered by the Estimates of the Prime Minister's Department is that of the Public Service Commissioner's Office, in respect of which there is an increase of £4,000 as compared with the expenditure of last year. The grading and classification of offices, and the fixing of the pay of officers of the Public Service seems now to be done largely by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and it is, therefore, difficult to understand why this increase should be necessary. There is also an item of £46,000 in reintend to reduce the number of comspect of the High Commissioner's Office in London. Por years we have been told that a stupendous effort is to be made to bring the High Commissioner's Office into line with the offices of the State Agents General in order that the cost of the representation of Australia in London might be reduced, as the people during the Federal referendum were led to believe it would be. Has any great effort been made by the Government to bring about the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State offices in London? another Minister is going home. standing that we have a High Commissioner and two Ministers already in London. Time will not permit of my dealing with every item in these Estimates, but the unnecessarily heavy expenditure provided for in 'the Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department warrants the Committee in demanding that they shall be reviewed, and that the expenditure of the Commonwealth should be reduced to at least last year's level. The Ship-building Departments are also under the control of the Prime Minister's Department. I do not know why the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton), who is in charge of tjhese Estimates. I believe the Assistant Minister has done good work in connection with shipbuilding, but I wish to know why this almost unlimited expenditure is not placed under the Navy Department and the control of the same Minister. Or does the honourable member for Grey( Mr Poynton), as an Assistant Minister, control the expenditure, even though it is in the Prime Minister's Department? It is due to the Committee, and to the people, and it is necessary to the discharge of our trusteeship as custodians of the public purse, that the Committee should take charge of the public expenditure, some of which I think is too high. The Acting Prime Minister has given a definite undertaking that some of the items of expenditure will be reduced. He referred particularly to recruiting, and certain other war activities. But I believe that, owing to the altered, circumstances and the fact that the Government mercial activities in which they are engaged there is room for a further curtailment of the ordinary departmental and administrative costs. operate these ships as a Commonwealth enterprise? big expenditure on ships, incurred without any authority from this House.

I wish to remind the Committee of the extraordinary growth of the Prime Minister's Department. In 1902 there was no such Department. The work of the Prime Minister was done in connection with the Ministry of External Affairs. Not till 1911 was the Prime Minister's Department created, and I find that the estimates for 1910-11 included provision for a secretary to the Prime Minister at a salary of £420. The number of officers in the Prime Minister's office was six, and the total vote for the Department, including the A.udit Office, was £21,059. In 1911-12 the total vote was £24,457, and the officers in the Prime Minister's office numbered eight and in the whole Department eighty-five. Tn the office of the Prime Minister was a secretary at £520, a senior clerk, four clerks, a senior messenger, and a typist. For the current year the total expenditure of the Department is estimated at £181,177, of which £32.834 is in the Prime Minister's office, and the secretary's salary has been increased from £600 to £750, without any reference to Parliament. The office staff which, in 1911, numbered, six, is now increased to forty-eight. The Acting Prime Minister will agree with me that that is not the proper method of procedure in regard to Commonwealth expenditure, and if he is in office long enough I believe sends the most one-sided cables to London he will alter this state of affairs. If he knew the practices of the secretary of the Prime Minister's Department he would ask the approval of Parliament before giving that gentleman an increase of £150 per annum. worked officers in the Service. in the Service!

Mr Shepherd's services in that regard are the reason for his salary being increased to £750. We find that the Prime Minister's office now includes a secretary, an intelligence officer, a private secretary, or twenty-six officers in the clerical division, and nineteen in the general division, making a total of forty-eight. member's argument in that regard? was right when he said, "" Create a Department and place a man in charge, and he will soon surround himself with a staff."" The Prime Minister's Department has even a paying officer, but I believe the Treasurer intends to make some re-arrangement in that regard. As to the publicity officer, I know that the manager of one of the leading newspapers in this country considers that the practice that has grown up in political life of appointing newspaper men to various positions in the Government Service amounts to a subornation of the press. This officer at the expense of the Commonwealth. honourable gentleman supplied me with a sample of the cables that are sent. The members of the Win-the-War party are supposed to represent private enterprise, and surely the newspapers will find it to their own interest to send news to the Old Country for publication.

I know that this gentleman ( Mr Cook) lost no opportunity of giving the Prime Minister the most exaggerated flattery, and of misrepresenting the views and arms of the members of the Opposition in the Melbourne Herald, on which he was employed. I ask that the Economy Board shall inquire into the appointment of publicity officers. There are sufficient newspapers in the Commonwealth to supply the general public with views regarding the proceedings in this Parliament. If the Prime Minister requires somebody to boom him and declare that he is received with loud applause, and that the audience rises en masse to give him an ovation, let him pay for such services out of his own pocket. A t one time, so partial was the public press, so unfair as a rule to the Labour Party, that I was in favour of establishing a Government newspaper. I thought we could surely issue a Government sheet in which officers of the Crown would publish fair accounts of what was taking place in political life, holding the balance equally between the parties, and I actually had the idea of appointing somebody to brighten the Government Gazette. But , after my experience of Government sheets, I would not vote one penny for such a project, because the Government in power either uses an official publication in its own interests or the officers consider it their duty to boom the Prime Minister and the Government, and hold up the Opposition to ridicule and public contempt. The Prime Minister's Department, and its secretary, to whom the Government have chosen to give another £150 per annum, call for further consideration and criticism. In the second progress report of the Commission appointed to inquire into Navy and Defence administration, I have discovered some very important comments regarding the position of the Auditor General. We know that millions of pounds have been wasted and that gigantic frauds have been perpetrated during the war, and the Royal Commission, in referring to the matter, drew attention to the disabilities of the Auditor-General and the defects of the A u d it Act. That Statute was passed by Parliament with the idea of making the Auditor-General absolutely independent of any Minister or Government, and responsible only to Parliament. H is position was to have been equal to that of a High Court Judge, so that he could not be removed from office except by resolution of the House. But what are the facts? If the Auditor General requires additional staff, he must go, cap in hand, to MrM . L . Shepherd, the Prime Minister's secretary. If the statement of the Royal Commission were not before our eyes in Iblack and white, could we believe that such a thing could be possible? The Auditor-General, in order to cope with arrears of work, which the Commission admitted, had to apply to Mr Shepherd for more officers. In paragraph 61 of the report, the Royal Commission, referring to the scope of the Auditor-General's operations, saidWheni t is remembered that the scope of the Auditor-General's operations covers the examination of the accounts of the Commonwealth Treasury, Defence and Navy Departments (including the Woollen Mills, Clothing Factory, Dockyards, Small Arms Factory, Cordite Factory, Harness and Equipment Factory), Commonwealth Bank, General Post Office, Customs Department, Land Tax, Entertainments Tax, Passports, Public Trust, Australian Wheat Board, Soldiers' Repatriation, Commonwealth Line of Steamers, Prime Minister's Department, Department of Home and Territories, Department of Works and Railways, &c, &c, the impossibility of coping with such a task with a staff of 131 permanent officers and 81 temporary employees will be realized, and it is not surprising that the work in connection with numbers of the immense operations indicated above are in some cases years in arrear. It is the opinion of three business men that, owing to the extent of his duties, the Auditor-General's work is years in arrears. That officer applied to the Prime Minister's Department for an increased staff, and I invite honourable members to read what Mr Shepherd had to sayThe Prime Minister has asked me for a report on the observations in par. 27 of the Royal Commission second Progress Report under the heading ""Auditor-General and his functions."" I desire to point out that the only occasion on which any serious disagreement with the Auditor-General on staff matters took place, was in connection with the methods by which he proposed to cope with increased work or bring up arrears of work. Are we on a stage and merely acting a part in a comedy? This officer had the presumption to dictate to the Auditorand the absence of sufficient officers. The General how he shall conduct his work.

The last occasion on which this was done was when he submitted, for the Government thought fit to give him an special sanction of the Prime Minister, a readditional £150, was receiving a salary quest of the Director cf Naval and Military of £600 a year. Audit for the appointment of 108 temporary Prime Minister goes on to sayclerks at 10s. a day, at an increased cost of £17,000 per annum, to the existing staff of 72, making ISO in all, "" to overtake arrears ot work within twelve months."" The Auditor General stated that "" the present application covers so large a number of additional officers that I do not care to follow the usual course of indicating my personal preliminary approval, but submit the matter for your special sanction."" The usual custom is for the Auditor-General to engage temporary assistance, and submit each. case for formal approval. When submitting this to the Prime Minister, I drew attention to the difficulty of securing good temporary clerks, and suggested that it would be better to appoint a number of qualified auditors. The Prime Minister concurred in this view, and submitted the matter to Cabinet. The Auditor-General wide experience, and, with all his faults, is a very able man. AndI desire to make an apology, and explain that when I said the Auditor-General was too old for his position I did not know that he was being treated in this fashion by the Prime Minister and his Secretary. I did not know that the Auditor-General had. actually to comefcothe Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department and ask his permission to appoint officers, and that it was in the power of the Secretary to object, and tell tbe Auditor-General that, instead of asking for temporary men, he ought to seek competent auditors. this Secretary know about auditing ? Is he an experienced accountant ? Has he the qualifications of the Auditor-General? We find the Prime Minister submitting the matter to his .Secretary, and asking him to .make a report on the Auditor General's representations. The Royal Commission pointed out that the work of the Auditor-General was years in arrear, because of the scope of his financial audit Mr Higgs. the Federal Parliament, sought to place The Secretary to the As a result, it was referred to the Treasurer to ascertain his views, and he forwarded a report, furnished by the Secretary to the Treasury, who pointed out that(1) The proposal aims at overtaking arrears in twelve months. (2) The request for such a large number makes one wonder whether the weakness is purely numerical. (3) The proposed increase is of the poorest material. (4) The application suggests the undertaking of an immense amount of detail work, the wisdom of which is not apparent, and may well be doubted. (5) The new temporary officers would form GO per cent, of the staff to audit large and important transactions. At the same time, the Secretary to the Treasurer expressed his realization of the seriousness of the position of refusing staff which the is a man of very Auditor-General considered necessary. . He made other proposals for overcoming the difficulty. agrees with the Secretary to the Prime Minister. some extent with the (Secretary to the Prime Minister, but, at the same time, the Secretary to the Treasury saw the seriousness of the position created by refusing a staff. In view of the fact that the Treasury accounts, like accounts of every other Department, come under the supervision of the Auditor-General, What does surely, to most people, it must appear wrong for the Auditor-General to have to submit his case to the Secretary of any Department, whose woTk and whose officers' work have to be supervised and examined by the Auditor-General and his officers ? The Prime Minister made a decision, with the following memorandum : With regard to the recommendations, Nos. 11, 12, 13, in the second progress report dealing with the position of the Auditor-General, I propose to see how effect can best be given",169,Chairman Hon J H

The recoiiKmendations are not free from difficulty, as they involved the questions cers arrange examinations, and questions of the appointment, jjromotion, transfer, and general control of the Audit stall, the approi n certain subjects are set to the students priation of money for that purpose, and the ""responsiibility to Parliament. I earnestly hope that the press will let the public know exactly how the Auditor General is being treated. for the amendment in the hope that before very will put the Auditor-Generali n his proper position. If the Auditor-General requires 400' officers to supervise the expenditure of hundreds of millions of money, let us see that he gets them, and if any honourable member feels that the Auditor-General is asking for too many, let h i m say so in his place here, and allow the Auditor-General, if he so wishes, to defend his position at the bar of the House. A t any rate, an end ought to be put to a humiliating position. A high public officer, representing the public of Australia on the one hand, and the members-of this Parliament on the other, who stands between them and the officers who handle the expenditure of vast' sums, ought not to be subject to a subordinate officer. It is said that ""finance is government."" No question that has come before this House could be more v it a l to the public welfare. There are one or two other matters to Public Service Commissioner only a few which I desire to call attention, though, weeks ago. to my mind, they are not of such great importance as that to which I have just referred. The Public Service Commissioner comes under the Prime Minister's Department. 'Something is wanting in connection with this branch of fright , and do not do their best. the Service.

This report has not yet been placed before the Cabinet, but I have obtained permission to make its contents public. It is as follows:Williamstown I enclose herewith for the information of the Cabinet, copy of progress report of the work done at tlie Williamstown Dockyard during the month of November, 1018. The work of fitting shell deck, tunnel, and other plating in position in the first ship is proceeding as material comes to hand. During the month the framework of the forecastle, bridge, and poop have been erected and rivetted. The counter of the vessel, including the plating,has also been put in position. The framework of the vessel is completely finished. The whole of the double bottom tank of the second vessel is completely erected and rivetted. One or two strakes of the bottom plating are in position, and a l l the available ordered from America continue to come along tank top plating is in position. The whole of the transverse and longitudinal frames and beams are finished, and are being rivetted ready for erection. The erection w ill Coolcha., which are en route, have on board 350 commence at an early date. The work of rivetting"" the transverse frames is being pushed forward with a l l despatch. One hundred and forty-one tons of steel plates and six tons of bars from the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company's works have been delivered into the yard during the month. Cockatoo IslandA copy of the report from the General Manager, Cockatoo Island Dockyard, attached hereto, shows the position there at 26th November, 1918. As indicated therein, the prepared material amounts to 437 tons, and of this, 365 tons is erected on the slipway. Walsh IslandA copy of the progress report submitted on 29tn November, 1918,. by the Director of Shipbuilding, Walsh Island, which is attached, indicates the position at the yards on the date mentioned. which accompanied the Director's report are also enclosed, and indicate the stage the shipbuilding work has reached. The plating of the shell of the first vessel is proceeding as material becomes available, and stock material is being utilized to the greatest possible extent. The stern plating is in hand, and part of the upper deck plating has been fitted. On the second vessel the ballast tank is com£30 per ton they are at present charging for pletely framed; the tank margin fitted, and part of the tank top and shell plating is in place. A start has been made with the erection of the transverse and longitudinal framing. The bulkheads are in course of construction. The stern post is to hand, and preparations are being made for erection. The work on the third vessel has so far advanced as to permit of a start being made with the framing. Walkers Limited -Advic e has been received that at 27 th November, 1918, the fourth stern frame and rudder stops had been shipped, while the f if t h had been completed, and a sixth frame is cast and machined with the exception of the drilling. Wooden Ships -Work is now proceeding at the yards of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh on the actual shipbuilding, and progress is being made. More timber continues to be received in the yard, and work is advancing on the preparation thereof. A t Messrs. Hughes, Martin, and Washington's yard two keels are laid, and a commencement has been made with the main timbers. Further supplies of timber have been received in the yard, and some additional men put on the work of preparing material for other vessels. The Wallace Power Boat Company have received into the yard large quantities of timber, eighteen frames are erected, aud others are almost ready to be put up. Work generally in the yard is proceeding satisfactorily. Shipment of Plates -Shipments of plates slowly. The s.s. Ghallamba, which left San Francisco on 22nd October, has arrived in Sydney with 630 tons. The s.s. Bellata and s.s. and 1,000 tons respectively, and there are also on the water 208 tons in the s.s. Karori, 265 tons on the s.s. Coolgardie, and 480 tons on the s.s. Middlesbury. W it h these deliveries there w ill remain a balance of about 1,000 tons, and it is.expected that this quantity w ill be shipped by the end of the year. The delivery of this material w ill make possible continuous progress, and it may be anticipated that at least two ships w ill be launched early in the new year. Serious delay has been experienced in the discharging and transhipment of material after arrival in Sydney. I am given to understand, that w i th the present discharging arrangement and regulations at Sydney, both for timber and case oil, w i th which the vesselB carrying the plates are partly loaded, this deplorable delay is unavoidable. The seriousness Photographs -if the position may be judged by the fact that it took six weeks from the date of arrival of this material in Sydney to reach Melbourne. This is a matter which calls for immediate attention. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited have offered to reduce the price of sectional material for a further contract for eight ships from £23 to £17 per ton, but are not prepared to make any reduction on the steel plates, and further express a desire that plates be obtained from England or America. Walsh Island -Progress of machinery is generally satisfactory, but there is still some difficulty in the manufacture of large forgings. Steps, however, are being taken to overcome this. Erection in the shops has been commenced on engines for No. 3 ship. Thompson and Company, Castlemaine -Pro gress on machinery is generally satisfactory. Erection in shop is continuing on engines for No. 1 ship. There is still some difficulty in the manufacture of large forgings. Steps, however, are being taken to overcome this. Clyde Engineering Company -Designs for principal parts of the main engines have been approved, and work is commencing in the pattern shop. Number of Men Employed -The number of men employed in the shipyards is, approximately, as follows:On Hull Construction and Preparations. Williamstown Walsh Island .. ..338 Cockatoo Island. .

The honourable member for Franklin crease of the payments to ship-owners allowed by the Shipping Board. The ships were all taken over at the Board of Trade Blue-Book rates, the price originally paid being: For passenger ships, from 20s. 6d. to 16s. 6d. per ton, per month, none of the profits going to the owners; and for colliers and cargo .. .. .. 196 vessels, from 14s. to 16s. 6d.

960,( Mr Mcwilliams) Complained Of The In,"to erect the plant and the wharf, to be taken over afterwards by South Australia at a valuation. The Barrier wharf at Port Pirie has now ibeen acquired by the Commonwealth Government, under the Lands Acquisition Aot, at a cost of £82,500. The wharf is a very valuable one. A mechanical coal-handling plant has been erected on the wharf at a total cost to date of £74,759 8s. 6d. The working expenses of the wharf to date total £24,233 6s. 5d., and the earnings have amounted to £37,852 0s. 7d. The working expenses for the month of October were £2,092 13s. 6d.; and the earnings for the same period, £3,230 Is. 5d. On that basis the earnings for a year would be £38,760. In a comparative statement it would be necessary to show against this the working expenses, plus interest on outlay, and depreciation. The total outlay on the wharf and, plant to date amounts to £157,500. The approximate earnings for twelve months are £3S,760; the approximate working expenses for twelve months are £25,200; interest at 5 per cent, on the outlay of £157,500, £7,875; depreciation, at 15 per cent., on £75,000 of plant, £11,250; depreciation, at 5 per cent., on £20,000 for the wharf, £1,000. These figures show an approximate annual loss of £6,540. The hand-labour cost of dealing with the coal was 2s. 3d. a ton, and the cost-of dealing with it with machinery is Is. 4d. a ton. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m. (Wednesday). was one of a party that went to the Antarctic regions, installed the plant at Port Pirie, and managed it for some time. He then made application for permission to go to the war and recommended that Mr Harry Jackson should be appointed to control the plant. ,1 would not agree to the recommendation until Mr Jackson had shown some ability to hold the position. He was employed for about three or four weeks with Captain Davis, and in that time showed that he was capable of doing the work for which he had been recommended. At the end of that period Admiral Clarkson submitted a minute recommending that Captain Davis be relieved, and that Mr Jackson be appointed in his place. I concurred in the recommendation. ister has dealt with a very interesting statement in regard to the working of the coal discharging appliances at Port Pirie, and during the adjournment I have taken the trouble to secure some reports which were in my desk dealing with the plant. I did not expect the matter to come before Parliament, but I was interested in it because the shipping officials of the Commonwealth Government had endeavoured to force the hands of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, of which I am a Commissioner, to follow the policy adopted in South Australia and install grabs for the handling of coal. As a Trust we were successf ul in withstanding that pressure, not only from persons interested, but also from the Commonwealth Government. I do not hesitate to say that the machinery on the Port Pirie wharf has quite failed to achieve the purpose for which it was erected.. It was put up without tenders having been called, by a firm which was certainly competent enough to erect machinery of that kind, but an understanding was arrived at that the four gantries, one opposite each hatch on a vessel, would average 60 tons per hour. That is to say, a vessel would be guaranteed a discharge of 240 tons per hour from the hold. The best results that have 'been obtained so far were secured during the months of June and July of this year, when 106 tons per hour per ship were discharged, as against the promised 240 tons per hour per ship. Each grab averaged 26i tons per hour, instead of the promised 60 tons per hour. The reports which I have in my possession were prepared by the engineer of the Melbourne Harbor Trust, and the engineer of the South Australian Harbor Board foT the guidance of their respective bodies in the matter of the expenditure of money. Before the Melbourne Harbor Trust would contemplate launching out on an expenditure of £250,000 with the responsibility for its financial success it felt that it must be perfectly satisfied that it would secure a proper up-to-date plant that would yield",175,Machinery
961,Mr Poynton,"Captain Davis, who",176,Machinery
962,Mr Boyd (Henty) [2.31],"The Mincertain results. The statement has been made by the Shipping Board that the Port Pirie appliances have discharged coal at a cost of Is. 3d. per hour. This is. a report submitted to the South Australian Harbor Board:Admiral Clarkson reported that coal is now being discharged by the Port Pirie appliances at Is. 3d. per ton, whereas it is costing 2s. 3d. the very best result obtained was on the to do the some by hand. This is, in the opinion of the Board (Supply and Tender Board), a misrepresentation of the facts. If coal is costing 2s. 3d. per ton gross, including interest, maintenance of plant, provision of steam winches, &c, it .is quite exceptional, and not the ruling rate, where tlie work is carried on under proper conditions, and it cannot be credited that the gantries do the work at Is. 3d. per ton gross. The cost of labour has been checked by reliable means and found to be from lOd. to Is. for shore labour, and to this must be added labour and use of ship's winches for dragging grabs into the sides and ends of holds. Tlie serious error, however, is the non-inclusion of the cost of maintenance and renewals of plant, and the much heavier items of interest and depreciation. These gears (constructed at Port Pirie) are considered by engineers to be on the light side, frequent breakdowns occur, and a careful estimate by a prominent engineer who made a. close study of the work, is that repairs represent a charge of 4 per cent, on the estimated cost of £80,000, and interest and depreciation another 10 per cent.; the latter will probably exceed 12} per cent. The coal consumed was estimated at 4.10d. per ton of coal discharged. There have been only 133,000 tons of coal worked at the gantries since the erection of the plant up to the end of July, 1918, which is equal to 177,000 tons per year, or 3,400 per week. The cost may be summarized thus:Labour, say Coal Repairs, at 4 per cent. . . 4.34d. per ton Interest .and depreciation, 12J per cent. Total Overtime, which is a big factor, is a further charge against the ship, and has not been included, but engineering supervision and proportion of administration expenses must of necessity be added. Comparison of the actual cost of Port Adelaide of putting some 60,000 tons into trucks or heaps during the year has been afforded the Board. This was found to be an average of Is. Sd. per ton, including winches, interest on and upkeep of gear, &c. The rate of discharge at Port Pirie averaged, throughout June and July, 106 tons per ship hour (which averages 26i tons per grab), while two colliers, under the old methods at Port Adelaide, averaged 125 tons per ship hour, which, in the opinion of the Board, goes to show that, with proper Mr Boyd. supervision and the willingness of the men to work, the older method is still in advance of the best the Port Pirie gantries have done. That is a very serious statement, made by a Board responsible for the effective working of these machines. The assertion was made that these gantries would discharge 60 tons of coal per hour, but s.s. Aeon on the 14th March, 1918, where the output, of coal was 35.73 tons per hour. ber is quoting from a report hy Mr Arthur Searcy. He is prejudiced against this plant.

This is his reportAttention is drawn to the results attained in working s.s.

Speaking from my knowledge of shipping, I say that these grabs, if they are to be worked successfully, must be used on vessels specially built for them. The Commonwealth are now sending to Port Pirie only ships that have no 'tween decks. worked successfully without 'tween decks. The collier which is being built at Cockatoo Island is to be specially fitted for this trade. vessels must be built to suit these grabs. The vessel which was being discharged at Port Pirie while the Harbor Trust Commissioners were there had no 'tween decks. Our engineer saysThe vessel which was being discharged at the time of the Commissioners' visit had no 'tween decks, and I understand, as far as posmethod of shipbuilding and ship repairsible, only that class of vessel is now sent to ing. A little while ago L requested the Port Pirie. The cost of discharging coal in Melbourne with the winch and basket system is about Is. lOd. per ton. The argument put up to the Melbourne Harbor Trust by the Shipping Controller, in urging us to rush into this matter, was: "" It is an urgent matter to get the ships away. The Commonwealth Government will find the money. All that you have to do is put up the plant."" As business men, I think we said, ""Very well. We presume that the Commonwealth Government will find the money, and we will put up the plant. If our engineer makes an estimate of what this would have cost in normal'times before the war, and shows that it costs so much at the present time, say, for the sake of argument, an extra £100,000, on what would have cost £100,000 previously, you will debit us with the £100,000 only, and not with the extra cost."" But that was a different proposition altogether. They wanted us to erect the machinery, and, subsequently, be prepared to find the. whole of the capital. They tried to bring pressure to bear on the Harbor Trust; but tbey happened to strike a Board of men who were not ready to submit to pressure. We were told that the easiest way of overcoming the difficulty was to put a price of 2s. 6d. per ton on our charges for discharging coal. Although the public are well aware of the present cost, we were told not to mind what the cost would be by the installation of these grabs, because the public would have to pay. That was certainly one way of getting out of the difficulty. It might suit the man operating the machinery, but it only be was a totally different matter to the people who had to pay. When these things are investigated at first hand, and when one knows the methods of spending money adopted under the War Precautions Act, in order to achieve certain objects, it makes one hesitate, and say that closer investigation should be made into many of these propositions before they are rushed on to the public, and before money is squandered. There ought to be a more economical Government to send a vessel owned by the State of Victoria to search among the islands for the missing boat's crew of the barque John Murray, which had been wrecked. The Assistant Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton) facilitated the matter in every way in his power, and when we placed it before the Treasurer, he consented to pay the cost, but asked me to submit an estimate of what expenditure waslikely to be incurred by the expedition. I made inquiries from shipbuilders and other people as to what their charges would be, and I arrived at an estimate, which I submitted to the Acting Prime Minister. He said, "" Very well, I will give you authority to spend £500 a month for three months."" By-and-by, the bills came in, and at a later date I shall have to face the Treasurer and explain why the expenditure has been greater than I said it would be. Irastead of receiving from the Government Dockyard, as I anticipated, a bill for £250 for fitting up the vessel, I got a bill for £467, or £217 above the estimate. It is all very well to deal in that way with Government work, but if the dockyard is to secure the private work which is necessary to its success, it will not do for it to practically double its estimates.",177,Machinery

970,Mr Boyd,"It is quite evident thatThe policy of shipbuilding in Australia, as laid down by the Government, is an excellent one if vessels can be built here as economically as they can be constructed abroad. I have no fault to find with the policy, but 1 would urge upon the Government that it is useless to build our own ships unless we intend also to train our own men and officers to staff them. ""Why should our vessels be manned by Dagoes, Turks, and other foreigners, as many ships are to-day? We have had British ships coming into this port without a solitary British sailor on board; latterly we have had British ships coming in with foreigners in charge of them. I do not anticipate that the fleet ofvessels purfull sail. We adopted that course, with chased by the Government will ever be disbanded, and if additions are to be made to that fleet the Government should see that it is manned by Australian officers and men. sideration the question of training' an Australian mercantile marine. The suggestion is that some officers should be trained at Jervis Bay. able friend takes a very keen interest in this matter, and so far as I know he is doing very well in his Department. He is certainly always ready to meet in a friendly spirit any suggestions' made to bim. The Government have already done something towards tbe training of their own officers. They had about sixteen apprentices on the Shandon and the John Murray, but upon the loss of the latter vessel some of the apprentices had to be transferred to steam-ships. I would remind honourable -members that it is impossible to train a sailor on a steam-ship. A sailor can only ihe trained on a "" windjammer."" When I was at sea, those who had had only -steam-ship experience used to be spoken of as "" Western Ocean paintscrubbers."" give in support of my assertion that it is impossible to train a sailor on a steamship is the fact that when the Titanic had her aide ripped out by coming into contact with an iceberg in the Western Ocean it was found that there was not a sailor on board who could pull an oar or steer a boat. It is of the utmost importance that we should train not only our own officers, .but our own men. ' -Without egotism, I think I can ""claim to speak with authority as to whether or . not the average Australian youth has a love of the sea. In connection with the training-Tship John Murray, I had to deal with a number of Australian youths "" full of spirit."" Not one out of every twenty of the hundreds that passed through the hands of those controlling that vessel had the slightest notion of going to sea. I knew that the best way to implant in these boys a love of the sea was to give them a cruise or two on a ship under the Tesult that 70 per cent, of these lads went to sea, although when they joined the vessel they had no intention of doing so. Of those who, on leaving the John Murray, went ashore, many are constantly asking me to get them a ship. A love of the sea is implanted in the hearts of the youth of every country, and particularly in the hearts of British youths. We have to find an outlet for those whom we train, and since we are building ships of our own, we ought to train our own youths. able member train them? trained on a sailing vessel. If the Shandon, which is owned by the Commonwealth, were fitted up in the 'tween decks on the same principle as the Belgian training ship L'Avenir, which recently visited these shores, and which had sixty cadets on board, we should be able to carry in the lower hold of the vessel sufficient cargo to liquidate the greater part of the cost of using her as a training ship. ing would be required ? The beet illustration I can could be trained for all practical purposes in two years. An officer, however, under the Marine Act, must have had four years' actual experience at sea.

It w ill be an advantage to other ports to know whether the grab system of handling coal is the most economical, and an independent inquiry will settle the point. I understand that the mechanical contrivance enables the service of the guyman-h e is the man who works the guy rope as the baskets come from the holdto be dispensed with . standing that economy, the grab is costing more than the hand labour, according to the figures which ha^e been quoted. Honourable members mav say that it is South Australia's money that has been -spent, and that the people of that State will be required to nay the £70,000 involved. I am afraid that the Commonwealth will be called upon to pay the money. I did not know that this system was in operation unti l I went to Port Pirie in March last. I believe that the grab has been installed within the last eighteen months or two years. W it h Estimates covering 300 or 400 pages of printed matter to be dealt with in a few days, it is quite possible for little items like this one to pass unnoticed. at the item on the Estimates, honourable members might think that it related to the shipment of lead from Port Pirie for munition purposes. But not one ingot of lead has been handled by this contrivance. If this grab is to be paid for by the Commonwealth we ought to have a f u l l inquiry into the transaction; if , on the other .hand, the State of South Australia is to pay for it , as was agreed, it is no concern of ours. I am glad that I raised this matter this morning, because most of us possess a little more information on the subject than we had before. have an inquiry into the purchase of this contrivance ? vernment for an inquiry, and if honourable members on the Ministerial side support that request I have no doubt that it -will be granted. I regard the training of seamen as all important. A very small proportion of Australian men have adopted a seafaring A f t e r the statement made by career. that there are more sailors from Tasmania on the Australia^, coast than from all the other States. Tasmania is an island, and has a fairly large seafaring population. But Australians as a whole have gone to sea less than other nationalities have done. Perhaps the reason is that the rates of pay and the'industrial conditions at sea were not such as would attract men to a seafaring life. There is also the disadB u t , notwithvantage that a married man who goes to sea is away from his wife and family for weeks and months at a stretch. Some sea captains on the coast see their families only for a day or a night about every month. Provision was made in the Navigation Act to make the lif e of the sailor more attractive, but, owing to the war, and a request from the British Government, that Statute has never been put into operation. The sooner we can have our vessels manned by Australians or Britishers instead of by the polyglot l crowd now found in the forecastles the better for the service generally. Probably not more than fiftv Australians hold a master's certificate. I hope that Looking in the future steos will be taken to increase the number of people of our own nationality engaged in .seafaring. The Committee is entitled to have from the Acting Prime Minister an explanation of the relations existing between his office and that of the Auditor-General.

1004,Mr Finlayson,"I shall refer toGovernment generally; but I do take strong exception to the increasing expenditure on a publicity policy that is onesided. The objections of honourable members on this side to the partial character of the censorship is aggravated by the publicity work of the Prime Minister's Department, because, so far as I have been able to follow such activities, they are nothing else but a eulogy of the Prime Minister and the Government. Whatever our opinion in politics may be, we all recognise that there are two sides to every question, and that in order to arrive at the truth , and get a correct view of matters one has to put before the public and one's mind, a fairly impartial view of both sides. The trouble is that the work of this officer has been of an entirely partial or party character. dice ! fact. against me and my party, and when it is written with the idea of giving a fair interpretation of the work going on. The publicity agent, or intelligence officer, has become an instrument of journalistic warfare. haps not from choice on his part, but acting under directions, into the writerup of the doings of the Government; in short, he has become a journalistic "" barracker ' ' of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) and the Government. Probably the Acting Prime Minister may not be altogether to blame, because he has evidently taken his cue from a higher authority. tion was sent out to the Commonwealth Government to send home a press delegation of twelve journalists, who were expected to be able to give us first-hand and impartial information about what was doing on the other side of the world. The selection of those gentlemen was of a very disagreeable character, in that eleven of them were of one view in politics. one man who could, in any sense, represent the Opposition view of politics was already in England, and advantage was taken of his presence there to add him to the delegation. the delegation has accomplished nothing. I am not aware of their inquiries or observations being put on record. yet. not in the habit of waiting u n t i l they return home before writin g up their impressions. of their shaking hands with the K in g. teresting. I do not know whether the Commonwealth is paying the expenses of this delegation, for I can find no item in the Estimates to cover them. The fact remains that those gentlemen were selected to give the people of Australia first-hand information in regard to the war and operations in Great Britain, and I have been able to get a certain amount of information regarding them from the London newspapers. Lord Beaverbrook, who issued the invitation to the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the I m perial Government, was approached, and It is borne out by it waa pointed out to him that the twelve I know when an article is biased gentlemen selected by the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) could represent only one view of politics, and, therefore, oould not be accepted as at all representative of the journalism of Australia. The following is a letter written on behalf of He has simply developed, perLord Beaverbrook, apparently by his secretary, to the editor of the Daily Herald, Adelaide: Ministry of Information, Norfolk-street, Strand, London, W.C. 2nd September, 1918. Dear Sir, I am desired by the Minister for Information (Lord Beaverbrook) to acknowledge your extremely interesting letter of 25th June, and to This year an invitasay that he must appreciate your courtesy in drawing his attention to the informative article which appeared in the 22nd and 24th June issues of the Daily Herald. He desires me to point out, however, that the selection of the press delegates from Australia was left entirely to that Government. You will naturally appreciate the fact that here, in London, it is not possible for us to be closely in touch with local affairs, and, consequently, in the face of,each delegation of journalists from The the Dominions, the selection of the delegates is left entirely. to the Dominion Governments. The intention of His Majesty's Government in extending the invitation was that the delegation should represent' all sections of the press of Australia, and on that subject they regard So far as we have seen the judgment of the Commonwealth Government as the only authority which it is possible for them to accept.

The press 'delegation is certainly a one-sided affair. Another editor of a London paper saysI certainly think the delegation most unfairly chosen. I do not desire to place on record too many of these extracts, but I shall refer to a statement made by Mr Pringle, a member of the House of Commons, in referring to the Ministry of Information at Home. Another member of the House of Commons( Mr Pringle) said that the main point was that a large part of the operations of the Ministry of Information was not propaganda for the country, but propaganda for the Government. Articles appeared in the Dominion press which were simply glorifications of the present Government, and many of them cast reflections of a somewhat discreditable character upon men who, at other times, were responsible for the affairs of the country. Further, he said that this Department employed men to spy upon the Labour movements in this country. He had personal knowledge of cases where important leaders connected 'with the trade union movement had been bought by the Department in order that they might spy upon their fellows, and he believed that it would be safe to say that some of the agents employed had gone to the length of deliberately inciting to strikes and to outrage. Then the British Australasian, a paper published in London, had a word to sayThe Australian Labour press is up in arms against what it describes as the gross favouritism shown by Mr Watt of papers favouring his own policy, and his scandalous unfairness to the Labour press in allotting the invitations from the British Government to take part in the Australian press mission to England. Lord Beaverbrook asked for a thoroughly representative delegation, and trusted Mr Watt to provide it. The closing part of the article isRecognising this, Mr Watt evidently threw away any troublesome idea of attempting to. be fair, and went at the job as a veTy ordinary politician, using his privilege, first to down his opponent, the Labour party, by allotting them a share in the mission outrageously below that due to their numbers and influence, and next to please those sections of his own press whose favour might be of most value to the Government. The press mission cannot fail to be useful in giving Australia, through its mission, a first hand knowledge of men and matters here, but The Westit would have been much more useful, and would not have aroused justifiable bitterness among the readers of important Labour journals, if the latter had been treated with some semblance of justice. Those are all the extracts I propose to read, w it h a desire to show that, even i u Great Britan to-day, it is recognised that the press delegation was unfairly and unreasonably chosen, and that only one point of view was put by it before the people of Great Britain and Europe. The same thing will probably occur when the Mr Pringle is thus reporteddelegation returns to Australia and presents a report or makes a public statement. the Estimates dealing with the subject, which, is foreign to the whole discussion.

This leads me to refer to another illustration of how, in regard to the press of this country, there has been unfair discrimination. Already reference has been made in the House to the outrageous charges made for advertisements by the anti-Labour press in connection with the war loan. The Sydney Morning Herald charged 18s. and 25s. per inch; Daily Telegraph, 15s., 20s. 10d., and 25s.; Evening News, 12s.; Sun, 6s., 8s., and 12s. 6d.; Truth, 22s. 6d.; and the Sydney Worker, 6s.

The Government decided(a) To accept the offer of co-operation by system suggested by h i m which has the Rockefeller Foundation in the work of exterminating the disease. (6) To provide a sum of £35,000, conditional on the Queensland Government providing a similar sum. The Rockefeller Foundation has agreed to find £30,000, making a total of £100,000, the expenditure to extend over a period of five years.

Immediately on the Government decision, I brought the matter before the Honourable J. Huxham, Minister of Health, of Queensland, who undertook to submit it to his colleagues, and apprise me of their decision 4. As will be seen, the Government have already given the matter most favorable consideration, and are now only waiting for the concurrence of the Queensland Government in order to commence active operations. I received information to-day that the Queensland Government had agreed to adopt the recommendation to come to the arrangement suggested by the M in ister when replying to those questions. The Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government, and the Rockefeller Foundation have agreed upon active measures for preventing the further spread of this disease and its eradication from Queensland. Some honourable members attended a lecture delivered in Melbourne recently by D r . Waite. much to my regret that I could not heari t , because I have been in regular communication with the doctor since he arrived from America, and am interested in his work. conversation he gave me some startling facts concerning the disease and the danger which menaces Australia, b u t he said that it could be easily combated, and already a number of Queensland municipalities have adopted a sanitary greatly improved' matters. Quite a number of diseases to which the human race is liable are so> widespread that scarcely a nation can escape them. The existence of these diseases will challenge our loyalty and patriotism more than many recent occurrences. The rapid spread of Spanish influenza must have persons, and it is a matter for satisfaction that the energetic measures of the Quarantine Department have so f a r kept it out of Australia. There are other diseases that demand closer attention It is a cheering thing that the State Governments have commenced to combat venereal disease, which is so prevalent in the community to-day. The hook worm disease is of little account compared with venedisease is not a little matter. cated compared with the other' diseases I have mentioned. tion. been told of sure and certain cures for consumption, b u t none of them has yet proved entirely satisfactory, whereas the measures taken to combat the hook worm disease have given satisfactory results. The community has not begun to think federally in regard to health. It has not grasped the idea that whether the State authorities are active or indifferent, it is the duty of the Federal Parliament to consider the national health of Australia. ""Unfortunately we have power It was only to prevent the introduction of diseases.

Ever since I have been in this Parliament, I have been directing attention to the signs of deterioration in the manhood of Australia, a deterioration not so great, or even proportionately so great, as that in other countries, but still very serious. The medical examinations made during the war proved that a startling number of men who should have been in their prime were unfit for military service. country there is so much opportunity for physical development, and the conditions are so conducive to healthy living, that it should not have happened that 25 per cent., speaking generally, of the men who wished to enlist for active service were rejected as inefficient. siderable time.

Unfortunately, Australia has done practically nothing towards eradicating these dangers, though the health of the community should be the chief concern of every Government. We cannot have a strong nation from weak citizens, and physical, mental, and moral efficiency require the presence of sound minds in sound bodies.

Therefore, I ask for leave to withdraw it. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from page 9594) : is with the greatest pleasure that I find the Acting Prime Minister is allowing us to discuss this item at greater length. The Prime Minister's Department has swollen enormously. now reaches £1S7,177. £222,701. of the Department was very small, and it by no means follows that the estimate for the current year w ill not be exceeded. I wish to revert to the position of the Auditor-General's office. On page 24 of the Royal Commission's report on NavyA d ministration appears this paragraphThe same difficulties with which we were oonfronted when dealing 'with the relations of the Auditor-General with the Defence Department are met with when considering the position in regard to the Navy Department. The inadequacy of the Auditor-General's stafl is accountable, to a large extent, for the delays which occurred in auditing accounts of the stores and numerous activities under naval control. May I remind honourable members of the remarks of the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Palmer), prompted by the honoVable member for Wide Bay( Mr. CorseJ; who said there was nothing in structive whatever in the remarks we were makirJg on these Estimates. If the honourable member for Wide Bay had listened to my remarks about the Auditor General he would recognise that they are very vital to the Commonwealth; but he tried to prompt the honourable member I pointed that out after for Echuca to say something disagreeable, improper, and unjust. The report of the Royal Commission says: If the time occupied by Until this is remedied, there is,little prospect of any marked improvement. Whilst there is a certain measure of internal check in the accounts section, it is not of such a systematic character as would warrant the Auditor-General in accepting it as part of his statutory audit. The installation of a proper checking staff would lessen materially the clerical work, and effect a considerable saving in salaries. As to tlie stores the report says: In regard to the audit of the stores, we have found in some cases that the stock-taking is two years in arrears. Whilst the direct blame for this cannot be laid upon the Auditor General, we consider that more pressure might be exerted by his officers to insure promptitude in dealing with this important matter. It There have been many frauds in connection with the Defence Department, and without a doubt' many more frauds would have been disclosed if the Auditor General had sufficient officers to enable I ts estimated expenditure him to keep up with his audit. How is it possible, w it h an audit two years in arrear, to keep proper control over the vast expenditure that is taking place at the present time in the various Departments ? I , therefore, again urge honourable members, at the very earliest date, to place the Auditor-General and his Department on a proper footing. Unhappily, the Acting Prime Minister( Mr. Watt) was sitting up late last night, and is too fatigued to stay and hear my references to the Auditor-General. _ T am not sure whether the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Wise), whose Department is under criticism, thinks sufficiently of the measure to note what I am saying; but I should like him to say whether he considers the Auditor-General is in a proper position.

The reply is very effectively done, and stamps him, I venture to say, as an honest man who has a reputation to maintain a man who has no personal reason or motive for trying to damage or ridicule either the PrimeM i nister ( Mr Hughes) or the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook). He did his duty to his paper and to Australia in stating the facts. Those two Ministers were never in consultation as they ought to have been. They went from here to represent this country, and we were told in the Ministerial statement that they were staying in Londoni n order to attend to our shipping and the sale of our products. Y e t they were not meeting at all. I have referred to the dignity and the manner of the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), and I am quite satisfied that these would have greatly helped the Prime Ministeri n discussing business problems with the British authorities. It is true that the Minister for the Navy, even when he is leading the House on the Ministerial side, is not always able to forget his Opposition manners. acteristic of many of us? some extent of the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), though one does expect more urbanity from him. We all know that a Ministeri n office can afford to be amiable, because he has a majority behind h i m, and has no need to get angry. However, the Minister for the Navy very often did so. I do not mind a man getting angry and fighting tooth and nail in Opposition, because it is his duty. These two Ministers went from Australia, and were presumed to be doing their best in the interests of Australian producers; but they got at loggerheads simple reason that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) cannot bear any one to get any of the reflected glory that attaches to his position.

I entered the Ministry on 27th October, 1915, and l e f t it on the 27th October, 1916, and out of that time the Prime Minister was in London six or seven months, so that we were associated for really only about five months. In any case, there would have been a burst up. As I have often said, the Prime Minister is a very excellent lieutenant, but is a bad leader. He led his own party to destruction and he is leading the party opposite to destruction. W h y the party opposite cannot get a candidate to carry their colours to-dav. They asked Mr Donald Mackinnon much gain in holding office. As Mr. Justice Duffy said when appointed to the H i g h Court, the promotion is only an opportunity for labouring at the oar; itI t is characteristic to gives one an opportunity to do more work. It is true that one gets a little prestige, but, after all, there are compensations in being out of office. There is the irresponsibility, and the plenitude of time to indulge a capacity for talk. Those two Ministers were at loggerheads, and it is due to the Age that the reply of the correspondent should appear in Hansard. His statement continuesThese facts are known to a score of people. Sir Joseph Cook himself confided his grievance as to the treatment he had received from Mr Hughes to so many personB that he could for the scarcely have expected that it would remain a secret; but he did not desire publication of it -no t at least before he returned to Australia and consulted his party. And so on, in the same strain. It all One associates h i m goes to show that the representative of the Agei n London is telling the truth .

Sooner or later this matter will have to be dealt with by one or other of the political parties. The public servants must have been so named by an unconscious humorist, because, instead of being the servants of the public, they are rapidy making the public their servants. Members of Parliament from time to time receive circulars mentioning the grievances of the Service, but I never heard any statement by public servants of what is due by them to the public. Several officials were unfavorably commented on by the Commissioner, who investigated the administration of the Federal Territory, but they still remain in the Public Service, although one or two of them may have had their positions changed. The famous Defence report referred scathingly to the officers of the Auditor-General's Department. ister ( Mr Watt) said that he did not agree with the Commissioner in regard to the administration of Canberra, and therefore took no action on his report. he was better informed than the Commissioner, who made an exhaustive inquiry.

The Estimates should be debated in detail, and the Minister in charge of the respective Departments should be able to satisfy the House regarding any item.

His position seems merely ornamental, his powers being so restricted. this way ? understood that while the PrimeM in ister ( Mr Hughes) has been ' in Great Britain, the powers of the H i g h Commissioner have been curtailed. He cannot do anything without cabling to Australia. Australia House has cost this country a lot of money. It occupies as good a site as there is in London, and is a splendid building, and a credit to Australia; but we should carefully watch the expenditure there. During the war it was a meetingplace for Australians, and was used largely for war purposes. The pensions paid there are considerable. These pensions go to the next-of-kin of lads who fell, living I do not know that m the United Kingdom, or to wounded men who have settled there. It was not intended, I think, that the pensions work, and other work, should be done by persons who have never been to Australia. Too many men in Australia House know nothing of this country, and the M i nistry should make a change in that matter. The chief clerk is an Englishman. I do not say that he is any the worse for that, No business house would pass but such men do not understand Australian conditions. The officer who has to assess pensions, and determine. the amounts payable, has not been to Australia, and probably does not know the spirit that animated this Parliament when it passed the War Pensions Act.

The Government should see that the Pensions Office is not controlled by the military. officer who may be working there should dress in civilian clothes, and be addressed by a civilian title. There is a man named Smart in charge of the PubliciW Pranch. He runs the ANZAC newspaper. He is a young Australian, eligible for military service, but he did not enlist.

Another item provides for muniSome of our cipal taxation, and still another for a caretaker. I do not know how this £9,500 is to be spent.

No man has faced greater difficulties than has Mr Campion, the manager of that branch.

Australia has not been niggardly in the provision made for the High Commissioner. I certainly think that there should be no difficulty in getting the State Governments of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania to induce their Agents-General to remove their offices to Australia House. The people of Australia do not know what is happening in London, or they would not permit the various Agents General to maintain separate buildings. Australia House occupies a magnificent site. An y part of London can be reached from it in a few minutes. The Victorian Government has wisely decided to continue in occupation of a portion of the building, and the other States should to a certain extent become partners in it also. A man from New South Wales who visits London will easily ascertain where Australia House is situated, and naturally he will expect to come into contact with his Agent-General there. He will not expect to, find that he has to go 2 miles further on to find him. There is no need for the maintenance of separate State establishments when the Commonwealth has a palatial and splendid building in such a central oosition. to the other States to join in w it h the t Commonwealth, but they have not acceded to our request. feeling among the lads who have been in London, which will find expression when they return, that the various State Governments should join in with the Commonwealh Government in the occupancy of Australia House. They cannot understand why there should be any display of jealousy in regard to such a matter. Australia House will play a very important part in the near future in connection with immigration, which can only be carried out in co-operation with the States. The work will be facilitated if the Agents-General of the States are all to be found in the one building. If thp. States would only come in as partners in Australia House, I do not think the building would be r u n at a loss. I do We are paying good not think we shall live to regret the money we have spent upon it . Fortunately, the work of construction was completed in time to permit of the Ccmmonwealh Bank and the Pensions Office being established in portion of the building, enabling it to fulfil during the war an admirable purpose, for which we required it . extravagance in connection with the design of the building? MrM c GRATH I do not think so. It must be compared with the surrounding buildings. We did not want Australia House to be an insignificant structure. It is a building which is equal, if not superior, to the surrounding structures. Australians take a pride in it . ' We watched the progress of its construction with keen interest. I was at the opening, and I did not meet an Australian there who was not proud of the fact that Australia had its offices in such a central position, and in such a splendid building. member hear any one remark that money had been wasted in building such a nice place ? waste of money in connection with the building itself; but there is danger that money may be wasted through not watching what is happening in it to-day. I am always afraid when the military get their fingers on anything, because they spend millions without caring a rap. That is why I claim that they should have no further control over Australia House. Mr Fisher is a conscientious, just, and honourable man, but he is not a business man. He cannot be harsh to any one. He cannot say "" No . "" Therefore, he is a little inclined to allow the military people to have their own way. Perhapsi t is better that he should have these characteristics than that he should be too harsh; but when we find the Estimates growing in connection with Australia House, it is our duty to put a check upon some of the expenditure.

By some means or other, these men have been able to get into Australia House. When I was there, I do not think there was one Australian who was above the rank of private in any of the various departments in Australia House. These positions should be filled by lads from Australia. Fully 25 per cent, of those who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at the outbreak of the war were men whose next of kin were resident in the Old Country. We know that the First and Second Divisions suffered very heavily at Gallipoli. The pensions are being administered from Australia House by a man who, I am told, is a London Jew. He has never visited Australia, and knows nothing of Australian conditions. I had one-or two brushes with him that were not altogether satisfactory to me, in connection with the administration of our pensions system there, and I certainly think that we could send over from Australia men who understand our War Pensions Act, and the desires of the people of Australia, better than he does. Although the relatives of the men with whom he has to deal reside in England, iScotland, or Ireland, we wish them to be treated as justly as if they were living here.

I do not say that Mr Andrew Fisher is unapproachable, but we all know his manner and his regard for dignity. nified style? been fortunate, so faT, in the choice of our High Commissioners. The trouble, so far as Mr Fisher is concerned, is that he has been working too hard for many yeaTS. As Leader of the Labour party, he had to undergo a very severe strain, and his followers, while he was in office, were not always as obedient as they might have been. We did not make his path too easy, and, as High Commissioner, he has since had a very busy time, particularly in connection with the war. I should like him to have an extended holiday. His health is not of the best, and he has certainly earned a holiday. adopt my suggestion that he should come out here while the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was in the Old Country. wise suggestion.

1171,Reduced By £ 1 ( Mr Sampson's Amend,"NAVY AND DEFENCE leave)I think every member of the House will realize the painfulness of my position to-night. I have been expelled from the Government after they had declared to' the people that they endorsed the findings of the Royal Commission which exonerated me of any wrongdoing. On the 28th October last I asked to be relieved of my Ministerial duties because of the statement sent by the chairman of the Royal Commission to the Attorney-General's Department, and then on to the Acting Prime Minister( MrA few minutes after I received the reWatt), to the effect that I had received a bribe. That allegation was conveyed to me by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr that he would very much like to see me, Watt), and I said to him, ""Very well, Mr Acting Prime Minister, relieve -me of my Ministerial duties until this statement He shook me by the hand, and said, "" Let has been inquired into and reported upon."" The Commission investigated the charge, and the Government agreed with the Commission's findings that there was no truth whatever in the statement that I had received any bribe for my administrative work while I was Minister for the Navy. The Government publicly announced their concurrence in that finding; yet in the next breath they informed the House and the people that they intended to apply to His Excellency the Governor General to cancel my commission. What for? Because the Commission said in its summary of facts-"" MrI had been cleared by the Commission Jensen failed to do this, the Minister failed to do the other, the Minister did not do something else in Cabinet that he should have done."" That is all that can be held up against me. Por not another thing have I been blamed. Tbe Commission's report was received by the Acting Prime Minister last Friday night week, and at midday on Saturday he sent me a copy, with an accompanying letter, in which he invited me to peruse the report and make any comments thereon that I thought necessary. He also stated that a Cabinet meeting would be held on the following Monday at 11 a.m. I assumed that the comments which the Acting Prime Minister invited me to make were to be submitted in writing, and I was not directly asked to attend the Cabinet meeting, as I had been on every other occasion. However, I wish to say at this stage that no matter how I have been treated, no matter how keenly I feel upon this question, I do not intend, for my own defence, to divulge anything that has taken place in the Cabinet or at Executive meetings. But I do claim, and will exercise the right, to use any statement concerning this report made by any Minister who approached me privately outside the Cabinet. port on the 7th December, I received a telephone message from Senator Pearce and he made an appointment for 5 o'clock that afternoon. I went to his house. me congratulate you on being exonerated. Sit down. Let's look at the Teport."" He had a copy of the report, to which he referred. Then he"" said, "" I think, Gus, although you are exonerated, you ought to resign."" I said, "" Not on your life."" I went before that Commission on a specific charge, which practically amounted to corruption. The Commission had been at work for eight or nine months getting what evidence was available from anybody that came before it, and behind my back the statement had been made that I had received a bribe. of the charge upon which I went' before it. Who, then, was Senator Pearce that he should demand my resignation? I think I am at liberty to state why he desired me to Tesign. He said, "" Y o u know, Gus, the facts which the Commission has stated in this report will make it very awkward for the Government to pull through during the next two weeks."" That is all that concerned Senator Pearce; he was afraid that the Government would not be able to pull through because the Commission had made statements that I , as Minister, had failed to do this and had failed to do",206,Chairman As The Official Opening Of Australia House And
1172,Mr Jensen (Bass) [8.2],"(Bythe other thing. I said to him, "" When do you intend to table the report?"" He replied, "" On Tuesday when the House meets."" I said, "" Do not table the report on Tuesday, but allow me to meet the Ministerial party. I am prepared to go before tha party on this report, and explain my position in connection with the whole matter, and if the majority think that I ought to retire, in the interests of the party, from the Government, I will do so, but I will be damned if I will do it for y o u .

I have disclosed nothing that has taken place in Cabinet, nor shall I do so; I have merely related what took place in Senator Pearce's home, and I have mentioned that conversation so that honourable members may understand the position in which I have been placed. pleaded that the report might be withheld from Parliament for twenty-foui or forty-eight hours until I could appear before the party with which I am associated. all the consideration I received from the gentleman who, in the absence of Mr HugheSj is the Leader of the National Labour party in this Parliament. orable members may talk about Mr Hughes being an autocrat.

On one occasion I went so far as to protest against this treatment. unfair to treat a colleague in that way, especially when I was prepared to leave myself in the hands of honourable members sitting on the Government side. I did not wish to place the Government in an awkward position. I told every Minister so. But I demanded a hearing before they took the final step which they proposed. I was asked, and asked, and asked again to resign, but I refused to do so. I wavered on one occasion, and even started to write out my resignation. ThenI resolved, 'I shall not resign. I shall not, by such an action, make myself appear to the people to be a guilty man. I shall face this charge in every way, no matter where I go."" I have been very pained by the treatment I have received. I was not invited to the Cabinet meeting at which the Government decided that my commission should be taken from me. I was not preI sent at the meeting which drafted the reasons which were to be advanced for the cancellation ot my commission by the Governor General. WasI not entitled to that; at least?

I had not been gazetted out, and the Cabinet, which had never held a meeting withHonout me, was sitting in judgment on me when I was not present. I had no chance of self defence-it was done anyhow. They gazetted me out; and I do not know that I am sorry for that -now. I have nothing to be ashamed of in being gazetted out. I know it is a very drastic I said, action for a Government, to take or to tender His Excellency the Governor General such adviceI quite admit that. But when I was prepared to do certain things-tw o things-in speaking privately to members of the Government, I wa3 refused.

That is the only findings of the Commission, as stated in evidence that was taken in relation to that paragraph 54 of the report are unfair, first finding of the Commission as a summisleading, and not supported by evimary of the facts. dence I am going through every one of these so-called facts, and I will explain isby the evidence each one of them. Paragraph 54 readsFor convenience we summarized the salient facts of the transaction as we have ascertained them, as follows :(o) Father Shaw was confident before the offer was made that the sale would be effected. There was no such evidence given on oath before the Commission, but I shall tell Cruel! That was you what evidence was given. Mr. Cotes was acting in conjunction with Whiting and Aitken, who gave Father Shaw an option over the works. for £25,000 for a month; and, by the way, there is a l o t to be said about that £25,000 and that option. I ask honourable members to look at the report of the evidence on page 5. The only ground the I never did it . Commission had was that Father Shaw be sold. What does Mr Cotes say ? I never did it,. This gentleman, Mr Cotes, was a director We l l , it was there. in the firm that held the mortgage over Are you clear of that date?-Yes.

Of course, he might have, had the sale would be effected."" Mr Cotes says that Father Shaw"" told us that he The second finding of the Commission (6) -Senator Long drafted the offer.

What did I know about that, when it was typewritten and signed ""Archibald Shaw""? But it is there for one express purpose, and that express purpose is to show to the people who were not present at the inquiry, and had not read the evidence carefully, that I must have known something about it. . Now we come to the next finding(c) The Minister disregarded the advice of Engineer-Rear-Admiral Clarkson, the Third Naval Member, who was the engineering expert on the Naval Board, and acted on the advice of an inexperienced subordinate officer. the wireless system, especially in view of That is the finding of the Commission. My reply to that is that Admiral Clarkson's objection to the purchase was on the grounds of policy. I had disregarded his minute on the application for the purchase of those' works. His minute was practically a minute condemning the policy which the then Government was living under, and had been returned on by the people of Australia. Engineer Bear-Admiral Clarkson said straight out that he was against Government-owned industries and institutions. I explained to the Cabinet that Admiral Clarkson was opposed to the purchase. I showed the Cabinet his report, and the Cabinet disagreed with his objection. That was the Cabinet, not I . I certainly disregarded his advice in the first instance, but the Cabinet, when I took the report to them, said that Admiral Clarkson had no right to dictate a policy to the Government. We had been returned to do certain specific things. I am now talking of the 1916 Government, The Commissioners say that I disregarded the advice of EearAdmiral Clarkson, the Third Naval Member. Supposing I did? AndI did, too; and the whole of the Government did it with me at the time. Is that anything for this Government to turn me out over? Could they not stand up to me? Could not the Government stand up to an action of mine like that when I was in a Labour Government with a certain policy? The present Government took no hand in it, and could not be charged with it, and ought not to be charged with it now. I did that when I was in another Government. Why should I have to suffer for it in this Government? Yet they would not give me a chance to explain those things. The Commissioners, as I say, find that I disregarded the advice of EearAdmiral Clarkson-and acted on the advice of an inexperienced subordinate officer. The engineer in charge of the radiotelegraphy of Australia is the ""subordinate officer "" ! He is the man in charge of the whole wireless system of the Commonwealth of Australia. Yet the Commission called him a "" subordinate officer."" Is he a subordinate officer in respect of what he says Eear-Admiral Clarkson told him, namely, that the Board implicitly trusted him to take over the wireless system of Australia, to organize and run it ; that the Board had no time, as a Board, to do those things? This subordinate officer has made that statement on oath. If honourable members turn to page 84 of the Commission's evidence, they will see there the evidence of Erank Gillespie Cresswell. He was examined by Mr Starke, who was the counsel appointed by the Government to see that every fact was brought out. Mr Starke saysI understand you wish to make a statement? -Yes. I wish to point out to the Commission that on the occasion of the interview with Admiral Clarkson in connection with the taking over of the Commonwealth wireless organization, Not Father Shaw's works, but the wireless organization of AustraliaAdmiral Clarkson explained to me that the Board were more or less dependent upon me to do my best to organize it and run it. Admiral Clarkson was a very busy man at that time. He had the organization of over eighty transports, which entailed the responsibility of transporting 300,000 troops and thousands of tons of cargo to the seat of war. I know this, there was a very big strain on him, and I do not think that Admiral Clarkson, with the responsibility he had, could afford to give the time and consideration Is it, Mr Speaker? No. which the proposition of taking over these works would merit in time of peace. That was the answer of this "".subordinate officer"" to the Chairman of the Commission. He said that Eear-Admiral Clarkson entirely relied on him. Yet the Commission attempted to crucify me by the finding that they gave, although evidence could be brought to bear, and is being brought to bear, to rebut their finding. continuesBy the Chairman -You felt that?-Yes; and he entirely relied on me. Let me further analyze the statement thatThe Minister disregarded the advice of Rear-Admiral Clarkson, the Third Naval Member, who was the engineering expert on the Naval Board, and acted on the advice of an inexperienced subordinate officer. Commander Cresswell went on to sayI just wished to point out Admiral Clarkson's position. In regard to policy, as to whether it was desirable to establish wireless workshops, I know that there was no division or differences of opinion between the First and Third Naval Members on that point. It was considered at that time, and appreciated at that time, that workshops were essential. I wish to show how little this officer was inexperienced. from h i m a statement of his qualifications. This is to be found on page 15 of the evidence taken by the Commissioni the Naval Department?-Radi o Commander, and Acting Director of the Radio service. Would you be good enough to give me your experience both before you entered the service and since?I cannot remember the full details of it. I started my career in 1896 with the firm of John Danks, machinery merchants, brassfittcrs and engineers, Melbourne, and from there I went to the A. TJ. Aloock Electric Light Company. I was there for nearly three years. From there I went to the Post Office, in the Electrical Engineer's Department. there for about twelve years. In 1897, I joined the Commonwealth Naval Militia, at that time as an engineer sub-lieutenant for electrical duties; and when the destroyers came out here in 1910, I was asked if I would be willing to accept a permanent position in the service, which I did. I was appointed as an engineer sub-lieutenant for electrical duties in 1911, and from there I went to sea in destroyers and H.M. ships. I was appointed Fleet Wireless Telegraph Officer, in, I think, 1912. I may take it from that that you are not a graduate of any University in engineering at all?-No. I passed the professional examination for the Public Service. You have not had any service with the Imperial Navy as a wireless officer other than on H.M. ships?-No. the Imperial officers when they came out here. Mr Jensen. But you have not had Imperial service?NoI worked under a German instrument maker for eight years, and he was a skilful man in the manufacture of electrical equipment. Commander Cresswell's evidence I take it that your experience in Australia has been a practical experience, and you yourself are personally interested in the subject, and have studied it at great length?-That is so. The Commission call a man possessing an experience like that a "" subordinate officer,"" and practically ""tell him that he is not fit to be in charge of the engineering wireless service of Australia. They say that I took the advice of this man, who not only was in charge of the whole wireless system of the Commonwealth, but had made a huge success of it . The Commission condemned me for taking his advice, and that notwithstanding that they had been told by this man that RearAdmiral Clarkson handed over every mortal thing in the way of wireless to him to bake charge of, and asked him to organize a service. SaveI had a fair deal ? Mr Starke obtained On every point, evidence can be brought in rebuttal of the Commission's findings. I asked ""the Government to hear me before dealing with me as they proposed. This is another finding of the Commission. It is paragraph d in their summary, on page x i i i . of their reportThe Minister failed to ascertain why the Postal Department had previously declined to consider the purchase of the works. My answer to that is that the requirements of the Postal Department were entirely different from those of the N a v y , but the experts of the Postal Department I was agreed that the plant was valuable and up to date. As a Cabinet Minister, there was no need for me to make an inquiry, because I knew why the offer of this plant had been turned down by the Postal Department. It was when the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Spence) was Postmaster-General. The Committee that investigated Father Shaw's works with a view to seeing if they could be taken over by the Postal Department said that the machinery was most modern and up to date, and there was nothing in ' Australia to beat it . I say that myself. The Commission found me to be at I had a lot to do with fault because I did not look into the Postal Department Committee's report on",209,Administration Royal Commission S Report
1177,By Mr Starke,"What is your position in the proposal that the works should be purtherefore, could its report help me in rechased by that Department. The reason gard to the value of the plant? It simply that I did not do so was that I knew all declared absolutely that the machinery about the matter. T was in the Cabinet was of the best. YetI was condemned when, on the recommendation of the Minby the Commission's report. ""We find in ister concerned, the offer was turned another portion of the report furnished down. It was not turned down because to the Department of the Postmasterthe plant or the machinery were not good, Generalbut because they were not altogether suit able for the purposes of the Postal Dement to acquire the whole or any por: ion of partment. The needs of that Department the plant, providing the price is Tenf-'wabte, are quite different from the needs of a will depend upon the policy to be adopted by wireless workshop. BecauseI failed to manufacture look at this report, should I have been on, and also upon the cost of installations to put out of the Ministry? No. Let me meet the Department's present and future read from that Teport. This is a pasneeds. If the policy of the Government is sage that occurs on page 2 of itThere are certain classes of items of the Postmaster-General's Department's requirements which, so far as can he seen, cannot at present, and probably cannot for some time, be commercially manufactured in Australia. For example, opal glassware, incandescent lamps, hard rubber. . . . But, generally speaking, the equipment at the shops can be used in the manufacture of metallic parts required for telegraphic, telephonic, or wireless purposes. The individual items comprising the plant are thoroughly up to date. The plant is laid out on the lines required for economical management, and it is irf a good state of repair, the major portions of the machines being practically new. That is from the report of the Committee that inquired ifthese works would suit the Postal Department. sion said that I did not make myself acquainted with this report before I purchased the works. I knew all about that report at the timeThe Committee is of the opinion that none of the machines for manufacture at present us'ed by the company could be omitted if the Department were to undertake the manufacture of any complete line of telegraphy or of telegraph or telephone equipment. Every machine there could have been used even for that purpose. On page 3 of the Committee's report it is statedThe Committee has not made any .valuation of the plant or property. Such is not required by the terms ofreference, and, further, would occupy the Committee not less than a fortnight. But there is appended to this report a list of assets furnished by Father Shaw to the Committee, showing in fair detail the cost to the company of the undertaking. The Postal Committee did not value the plant or have a valuation of it made. How, [356] 1 As to whether it is advisable for the Ciovernthe Government as to the extent in which in these works will be carried to manufacture all possible articles it requires, then the plant in these works would form an excellent nucleus and could be kept fully occupied. I think that honourable members must be amazed at this report. I hand it to the Acting Prime Minister so that he may see that it is genuine. I am condemned because I did not look into these matters, but the report of this Committee absolutely supported my purchase of this machinery. HaveI not ibeen treated cruelly ? Another finding of the Royal Commission against me is(e)The instructions given to the valuer were insufficient from a business point of view, The Commisand the valuation was "" accepted without inquiry as to the method and basis of valuation. That finding was absolutely opposed to the evidence, because my instructions were very definite, namely, to get bedrock value for the Department. My instructions to Commander Cresswell were to proceed to Sydney, act in conjunction with the engineer and valuator, who had been appointed at a fee of fifty guineas, and do his duty both to Father Shaw and to the Department. I said to him, "" I want a fair bedrock valuation."" I have sworn that in evidence. Commander Cresswell has borne me out in that regard. In the report of Commander Cresswell's evidence before the Commission the following paragraph will be seen on page 22:I see in the file, document 15 that there # is an instruction from the Naval Board of the 5th July, 1916. Mr Jensen tells me that he told you to value the plant at Randwick, favouring neither Father Shaw nor the Department. Do you remember that?-Yes, I do. Could any better instruction be given to a valuator? Could a fairer request be made by any honourable member of this House to deal genuinely with any transaction ? HaveI anything to be ashamed of in instructing the engineer of radio telegraphy to proceed to Randwick and act in conjunction with the other man in valuing everything at these works at bedrock price? ""What better or more complete instructions could have been given? What does valuing at bedrock mean? Simply that the valuers were not entitled to give any value to machinery which was obsolete and useless. Could any other interpretation be placed upon my instructions? Here, again, the finding of the Royal Commission falls to the ground. Another finding against me is(/) The valuation merely represented the cost of replacing the works on that date with certain deductions for depreciation and obsolescence, but without consideration of the utility of the plant to the Department or the nature of the lay-out of the works. This finding is not founded on fact. The valuation was made as for works which -were capable of being used at once for the purposes for which they were to be number of expensive patterns and dies and acquired. That is to say, they were to be be treated as a going concern. I wanted immediate possession if I could get the My reply is that Commander Cresswell works at a decent price.

Another finding of the Commission ceived that instruction, he said to the against me is(g) The only check on the valuation was whether he was valuing a piano or a the presence of Commander Cresswell, an officer who had no training or experience in such ginger-pop machine or anything else that matters. What information did Mr Starke elicit Of course, he said this by way-of a joke; from Commander Cresswell in examining but the Royal Commissioners were paltry him? The information that he had had enough to magnify it to the greatest detwenty-five years' experience, that he had gree possible in order to belittle me. He Mr Jensen. been associated with machinery all his life, that he had started with John Danks and Company, and that he had been associated with nothing else for twenty-five years. The Commission's finding is a disgraceful one, in view of the information extracted from Commander Cresswell by its own lawyer, Mr Starke. Not only is it a disgraceful finding; it is unfair to me. My reply is that Commander Cresswell was the only capable officer in the Navy Department available to me. Where could I get another man? He was the responsible officer in charge of the wireless system in Australia, and I suppose that if I had not sent him to value these works I would have been blamed by the Commission for not having done so. The extracts which I have quoted from page 15 and page 84, showing that Admiral Clarkson entirely relied on Commander Cresswell, apply to the finding also, and rebut the statement of the Commission "" that the only check on the valuation was the presence of Commander Cresswell, an officer who had no training or experience in .such matters."" He was the only man whom I could really obtain in Australia for the task I intrusted to-him. Another finding of the Commission against me is(h) Commander Cresswell reported that a electrical apparatus was obsolete, and should, taken only at the value of raw material. that included everything except the land and the buildings. But because he re.Commission that it did not matter to him happened to be on the works at the time. only mentioned it by way of illustration, but they have endeavoured to make it appear that I had sent him to the works thinking that he did not know his duty, and that it did not matter to him what was there. I quote the following from page 26 of the Evidence taken by the Royal Commission :W ill you tell me what time you spent on the valuation, and exactly what you did?I was three days inspecting the machines and equipment of the factory, and the stock. those three days, each machine was examined in detail. A note was made-mentally , or, in many cases, in writing-of the condition of the machines, their utilit y and class, type, and their settings; and, after doing soI might say the schedule of the equipment was handed to me by the Shaw Wireless people at my request, as the Navy Department did not furnish me with the lists as arrangedI took the schedule, together with my own notes, and went through the workshop. The schedule provided by the Shaw Wireless people was incomplete. There are a great many items omitted from that ; and, of course, I made those items good in my own notes. Then, having inspected the plant, its character and condition, I devoted about five days, including a good deal of night work, in pricing those items from the material I had available. I inquired also from merchants in the business as to values. tenders and prices accepted for equipment for Government purposes of about that date, and as regards the items in stock, consisting of a large collection of miscellaneous manufactured stock, nuts, small screws, bolts, and insulations. prices at that time, in order to check the values of this stock. As regards the stock, a sheet was given to me of the stock, of the number of items in each section, which I referred to in my statement to the Government; and I took a note of what stock was mentioned as being in the bin. That is to'say, I selected here and there at random entirely, without any suggestion, from different bins, and examined the contents of those bins, and in a few cases I counted the contents, although I did not intend to take stock in that sense-bu t I examined the quality and condition of the stock; and then, taking the sheet, which had prices opposite the various items, I checked those items by inquiry in the mercantile world in Sydney; and' therefore, in a sense, I did make a valuation of the stock, subject to the quantities being correct. That only applies to stock. In his evidence Mr Ross shows that he examined every machine in detail, and took everything into consideration. Let me read onCan you express it in percentages at all as to what was the appreciation all round on pre-war prices?-It would be impossible to do it , but I [356]2 had it in much closer detail than that. I took every individual machine, and I referred to the English, American, or local prices where available, and I took the ruling conditions. May I ask you how you got the appreciated price. For instance, a lot of material could not be obtained in Australia at the time. What prices did you take for that?-Wher e it could not be obtained in Australia, what I did was this: I took my English list of John Birch, and taking the average of that class of machine, I assumed that the same appreciation would apply to these particular machines. During That, I considered, was a very sound position to take. Did you apply that same principle to the stock value?-Yes. Most of the stock values I checked by quotations. The same principle was applied. And you went into the question of any depreciation that you saw?-Yes. That is w it h each particular machine?-Yes, it was gone into in detail. Did not that strike you as a very high valuation?-Certainly not. To take each particular machine and not look at it as a whole?-Absolutely , no. You were taking it substantially at its replacement value, less depreciation?-Yes, most decidedly. That was the market value of the plant. As a matter of fact, those machines could have been sold since at a price exceeding my valuation. I consulted the He says 'that the machines purchased hy the Navy Department could have been sold subsequently at an increased price. And yet the Commission say that I did I inspected those, and inquired the not obtain value for the money expended by the Navy Department. The cross examination continuedYou told me that, quite apart from the u t i l it y of the machines at all to the works, whether ginger-beer machine or a pop-gun, you took it at its market value, less any depreciation. What application has the principle of obsolescence to such a valuation as that?-In a few cases, and in this particular instance, in a very close association with Commander Cresswell, I wrote down almost entirely certain things that were obsolete. . . . In other words, things that were absolutely obsolete were not charged up against the Department; they were written down entirely. The witness continuedI wrote down almost entirely certain things that were obsolete, and from the nature of which could never be anything else but obsolete, because they had an express purpose and that purpose was past; and if they were no good to the Shaw Wireless, they were no good to any one-suc h as certain generators. Wherever that principle could be applied, it was applied. This is a direct rebuttal of the statement in the Commission's summary of the salient facts which was designed to damn me in the estimation of the people and the Government. The Commission have certainly been successful in damning me in the estimation of this Government. A t the foot of page 27, we have tbe report of further evidence given by this do not know that he a friend of mineas follows: Then you made this report, and, in your opinion, it was a fair and just valuation ?--Absolutely. In paragraph h of the Commission's summary we have the statement thatCommander Cresswell reported that a number of expensive patterns and dies and electrical apparatus was obsolete, and should be taken only at the value of raw material. I would point out that, according to Mr Ross' sworn evidence, that was done. The opinion I formed was that the Commission considered, while Mr Ross was giving evidence, that he was a trustworthy witness; but, after deliberating for three weeks upon the evidence, this is what they put up against me. In paragraph i of the summary we have the statement thatThe manager estimated that obsolete and useless machinery, and stock valued at £13,000, were included in the valuation, and paid for by the Department.

1179,By Mr Cussen,"In this report it is said on Cresswell distinctly says that I did nothe took away his report, amended it , and sent it back to me. I had not instructed him what valuation to place upon the works, or what price we should offer for them. In fact, he was not asked to make an offer. I consider, and I think the Acting Prime Minister w ill endorse my view, that when an officer is asked to make a valuation in regard to a purchase, he should carry out the duty he is asked to do. It remains for the Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues in Cabinet, to consider what offer shall be made. That was the course I adopted. But the Commission says, in pragraph j : After an interview with the Minister, Commander Cresswell withdrew his recommendation to offer £40,000, and substituted an opinion that dation, the Commission condemned me. Father Shaw's offer of £57,000 was reasonable. Commander Cresswell had endorsed Mr Ross's valuation of £46,496, and the Home Affairs valuation of the land and buildings at £14,240, making a total of £60,736. That was more than the amount at which Father Shaw had offered the works, viz., £57,000; yet, when I took the proposal to Cabinet, although Commander Cresswell had said that £57,000 was a reasonable price, I recommended the purchase at £55,000. that all he means by the reference to £40,000 was that bargaining should start at that figure. Government should not pay more than £40,000. For two days he could not remember that I had said to h i m that his report was inconsistent w i th his recommendation,. but later, at his own request, he was recalled, and he stated on oath that I had pointed out to h i m that his recommendation that we should offer to purchase the works at £40,000 was inconsistent with, his endorsement of the valuation at £60,700. The Commission admits that that took place. WhatI am about to quote now is very important. The Commission, when it held a secret inquiry, six months ago, took the same view as I did regarding the inconsistency of Commander Cresswell's report and recommendation. Honourable members w ill find this on page 24 of the evidenceBy the Chairman--Do you remember when the Commission questioned you on the point at the first interview, you were asked how you Mr Jensen. could reconcile your report in the concluding paragraph with the first portion of the report in which you concurred with Mr Ross's valuation of £60,000 for the land and buildings, and then you went on by stating that you thought an offer ought to be made of £40,000. The Commission pointed out to you was what was apparent then, it was inconsistent to say in one portion of the report practically that the works were worth £60,000, and in another part only £40,000 should be offered for them. Do you remember your reply?I do not remember the reply; but I meant that £40,000 as the basis for negotiations. Yet, in face of that statement by the Chairman as to what the Commission had said at a secret inquiry when I was not present about the inconsistency of Commander Cresswell's report and recommenIs this Britishf a i r play? I demand from this House justice. Honourable members are men of hearts. CanI sit down quietly under these allegations ? The Commission puts the same construction upon Commander Cresswell's report as I put upon it ; and yet, by inference, it charges me with having influenced h i m to withdraw his report and substitute a recommendation of a higher purchase price. Are we living in a British country, that I am Commander Cresswell admits treated in this fashion? Commander Cresswell admitted that he meant the £40,000 to be the basis for negotiation. He did not say that the That is an admission that the plant was worth more than £40,000. The Chairman said to h i m That was not the reply you gave the Commission on that occasion?-That is the only reason I had. The statement you made then was that the Minister said it was his own business, and not yours. I swore an oath that I never made such a statement. I never spoke to Commander Cresswell in that way. I have always treated every officer w i th respect. In proof of my integrity and honesty, I remind the House that I have been in Ministerial office for f o u r years and three months, and I challenge any honourable member to rise in his place and say that I have ever suggested any wrong action in connection w i th my administrative work. The statement that after an interview w i th me Commander Cresswell withdrew his recommendation and substituted a. higher one is a suggestion that I forced him to do something. Commander Cresswell said that I did not. His chief clerk reminded him in Court:"" Yes, Commander Cresswell, the Minister did mention to you the inconsistency of your report and recommendation. You came out of his office and reported the conversation to me, when I assisted you to amend your report."" thereupon said, ""Now that you mention the matter, I remember it well."" And at his own request he went back into the witness-box and said that he had done me an injustice, and that I had pointed out 'the inconsistency. So much for that portion of the Commission's summary. Paragraph k of the summary readsThe alteration of Commander Cresswell's report was not disclosed to Cabinet when the purchase was being considered. I say that it was unnecessary to disclose the alteration, in view of the inconsistency of the first report. That is my answer to the Commission's statement.

I gave that had happened in Cabinet, and becertain evidence before the Commission cause I did not admit to the Commissioners which, in my opinion, justified me in that I had not mentioned this alteration going into the matter and recommending in Cabinet, look at the construction that is this purchase. I did not make the purplaced upon my action! What difference chase, the Cabinet did, and the Cabinet would it have made to the purchase if I was equally responsible with me in every had mentioned the alteration of Comaspect, especially in view of the fact that mander Cresswell's report ?

But I placed the whole file on the Cabinet one can read into paragraph k a suggestable, and explained the reports that were tion that I went into Cabinet with the inagainst as well as those that were intention of deceiving Ministers and pushing favour. Therefore, the whole Cabinet this deal through. That is all the Comwas responsible-if I did wrong, they did mission set out to do. We now come to a very important matter(I) Commander Cresswell in successive reports(1) Estimated at £4,000 the cost of additional accommodation and machinery at Williamstown for the manufacture and repair of all wireless telegraphy apparatus required for the different Departments of the CommonCommander Cresswell wealth Service until the establishment of Flinders Naval Base. That estimate was in March, 1915, a few months after the war broke out. In August, 1916, when it was being considered, we were in the midst of the war, and everything looked very black for the Empire(2) Stated that an offer of £40,000 would be a fair offer for the Shaw Wireless Works for use as general Government electrical workshops, and then stated that Father Shaw's offer of £57,000 was reasonable; and (3) Stated that the Government could not erect the buildings and put down the machinery and plant under £80,000. wrong. At that time, in 1916, no machinery of any sort was coming into Australia. I do not know whether I am going to let out any secrets by stating what I am going to state, but the war is now over, and I am freer to speak than I would have been in 1916. The very machinery that was ordered by the then Government in power from America and elsewhere for the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, Cockatoo Island, and other places was-accordin g to a request which, to my knowledge, was made to the ""War Cabinet-urgentl y required by the Imperial Government. I know that, because of the cables that came; and it was imperative that that machinery should go to England rather than come to Australia. Knowing what I did when that request was made by the Imperial authorities, did I do wrong in purchasing the only machinery in Australia for a wireless system ? There was no idea that the war would have been ended by this time. The war ceased without very much warning; it collapsed, thank God; but there was no knowing then that it might not have gone on for years. Our ships were being submarined, and every bit of steel and equipment was needed in England. The Imperial authorities, as I say, made that request to the Commonwealth Government, and I bought the machinery at a fair price. I care for nobody; I did it I recommended the purchase to the Cabinet. There is the truth; and that is why I say that the value placed by Commander Cresswell on this machinery was a fair and genuine estimation, in my opinion, of its value. Then, to whom else could I refer these questions ? I got certain queries from the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), because of a certain writer in Sydney, who was a director of the Sun newspaper. writer was also a director of the Australian Wireless Company, in Sydney, a small company which was running the German Telefunken system. That man went into the witness-bos, and, next to Cornwell, he is one of the biggest liars in Australia. and say what has taken place since he Mr Jensen. made that statement on oath. That is the man who, months ago, was giving evidence behind my back in Sydney for days. It was all these suggestions of impropriety on my part-of wrong-doing -that led the Commission to think that my character should be inquired into to see if I had received a bribe. Scandalous! The Commission have attempted to pull Commander Cresswell to pieces on account of the estimate he gave; but what does the Commission know about the value of machinery? Have they had an expert to value it for their own information? No. They have not had an expert to see if the valuation of Mr Ross' and Commander Cresswell was incorrect; but they take it on themselves to say too much was given for the machinery. Who are the members of the Commission? A vendor of silk-no t rabbits; another man who has something to do with shipping in Adelaide; and a third man, of whose business in SydneyI know nothing. These are the people who have taken upon themselves to say that too much was given for this machinery, and they have said it without getting any evidence to justify their statement. Can any honourable member see in the report any evidence on which the valuation of Mr Ross and Commander Cresswell ought to be challenged by the Commission? The next finding is as follows:(m) No inquiry was made as to the details of the option held by Father Shaw. No inquiry! What has Father Shaw's option to do with me? What has it to do with the Commission? YetI am blamed. This was quite irrelevant, as it only affected the right to give a title. Besides, a very considerable part of the property was outside of that over which the comThat pany had any right.

You were appointed a director to protect the interests of Sir Eupert Clarke?-Yes. What was Sir Eupert Clarke's position in connection with the business?-He had a shareholding interest. What was his shareholding interest?-Sub stantially, I think, he had about 10,800 shares out of 35,000 shares, and Mr Harry Whiting had about the same; and, in addition, Sir Rupert Clarke had guaranteed the account of Shaw Wireless Company with the London Bank, and in or about August, 1915, he had paid to the London Bank the amount owing to the bank, and obtained an assignment from them of their security. How much had he paid?-He paid to the London Bank just over £27,034. The London Bank of Australia in Sydney made an advance to the Shaw Wireless Limited of £27,000 or more on the security of a portion, not of the whole, of their works.

We were not prepared to allow Shaw Wireless Limited to incur any more obligations, and we made an arrangement with him under which he was to be able to have a lease of the works for the purpose of manufacturing munitions, he was working on a co-operative basis, as we understood, with his men. We were told that a good deal of money would have to be laid out in the first few months for the purpose of putting the works into proper order for the manufacture of munitions and so on, and so we agreed that the rent for the first six months was to be £15,000, This firm of solicitors asked £15,000 for the rent of the works for six months onlybut that we would not press him for payment at that time, so long as he was getting on all right. This reminds me of something said during the inquiry, by a witness who was untruthful. It was suggested that I had been in negotiation for the sale of these works with Father Shaw from October, 1915;",216,Administration Royal Commission S Report

Another finding of the Royal Commission against me isThe Cabinet's approval of the purchase was upon condition that the Minister was satisfied would keep the plant fully occupied. My answer to this finding is Commander Cresswell's report, which was a complete justification of my action, but was suppressed, and not placed before the Commission until my counsel insisted upon its production. This inquiry had been in progress for twelve months, until it took a definite turn a few weeks ago. I asked for a report from Commander Cresswell because of a wire which I had received from the Treasurer. I forwarded to Commander Cresswell the exact question that the Treasurer had submitted to me, and the answer that I forwarded to the Treasurer was the answer submitted to me by the departmental officer, with the exception of a slight variation of the wording, which did not alter the meaning. The answer forwarded to the Treasurer was a complete reply to his request. I submitted to the Engineer of Radio-Telegraphy the question contained in the Commission's finding, viz., that the Cabinet's approval of the purchase was upon condition that I have not approached any the Minister was satisfied that the NavyI have Department's requirements would keep the plant f u l l y occupied; and his repori, which is in the Navy Office, not only corresponds exactly with the reply which I forwarded to the Treasurer, but also' -bears me out in another statement-that I had f u l l y discussed this matter from every aspect in Cabinet. I told Cabinet that, according to the reports I had received, the works could be made use of by other Departments. I even told the then Acting Prime Minister (Senator Pearce) privately on two occasions, when we were proceeding to his home in St. Ejlda, that even if some doubt might exist in regard to keeping the works fully occupied by wireless requirements, the report furnished to the Postal Department said that there were plenty of machines which could be utilized for the requirements of the Postal Department. Also, at that time. I was aware that the Defence Department were having work done at the .Shaw Wireless Works for the Lithgow Small Anns Factory. Certain portions of machinery were being turned out for the Lithgow Factory by these works at the very time. I was communicating with regard to their purchase. Work was being done for the Defence Department, the plant could have been used for the requirements of the Postal Department; and, as I shall show from the annual report furnished by Commander Cresswell upon the work turned out by these works during the first twelve months, there is no doubt in my mind that they have materially assisted the Commonwealth in the manufacture of certain articles necessary for the carrying on of Government institutions in the interests of Australia. How could the Royal Commission say that the Cabinet's approval of the purchase was upon condition that the Minister was satisfied that the Navy Department's requirements would keep the plant fully occupied ? Mr Cussen was the barrister who represented me at the inquiry by the Royal Commission. I read the following from page 34 of the evidence taken by the Commission :The ChairmanI do not think you need pursue that point, Mr Cussen, we quite follow it. Mr CussenI desire to put before the Commission in connection with Mr Jensen's evidence, Commander Cresswell's report on the first year of the wireless business. This is the original report. that is your annual report for the first year of the wireless?-Yes. Although this Commission had been in existence for twelve months, the most material evidence that it could have had before it-Commander Cresswell's report on the first twelve months' operations Mr Jensen. of these wireless works-ha d not been submitted to it. A copy of this report was posted to me confidentially by Commander Cresswell-it must have been a year ago-probabl y because of the interest that I had taken in the organization of the wireless system in Australia, after the control of wireless telegraphy had been transferred from the Department of the Postmaster-General to the Navy Department. I was struckby the mature of the report, especially when I had heard certain evidence given by this man Denison, director of the Sydney Sun, who is also a director of the Amalgamated Wireless, in Sydney, which is running a German system of wireless telegraphy, as I have already informed honourable members. Let me .quote from Commander Cresswell's report dealing with the fitting up of ships with wireless since the taking over of these workshops. This report saysThe number of ships' inspections carried out during the past twelve months is as follows:Melbourne .. .. .. 563 Sydney (portion of a year only) . . 345 Perth. . .. .. 20 928 During the last twelve months the following wireless telegraphy installations have been manufactured in the wireless telegraphy workshops and fitted to the ships mentioned:Alacrity, Governor Musgrave, Sleuth, Carina, Oonargo, Calulu, Victoria Lienta, Sir William Matthews, Booral, Kanna. A little later I shall quote the evidence of this man Denison, who swore that his company had entered into contracts with every shipping company in Australia for the supply of wireless"" apparatus to its ships, and that there was not a ship left on which the Commonwealth Government could place wireless. The report continuesThe following ships have been refitted with more efficient wireless gear:-Bulla, Seang Bee, Seang Choon, Vestalia, Surada. (To witness) -That is so; Long-wave receivers have been fitted in the following ships:-Bymettus, Karroo, Port Melbourne, Hororata, Benalla, Armadale, Bakara, Nashobra, Beltana, Itria, Karoola, Ballarat, 'Orontes, Shropshire, Saldanha, Afric, Suffolk, Anglo-Egyptian, Berrima, Seang Bee, Bulla, Surada, Palermo, Orsova, Commonwealth, Calulu, Carina, Conargo. Central switches have been fitted in the following ships:-Clan Maeoorquodale, AngloEgyptian, Barambah, Seang Choon, Anchises, Dongarra, Bulla. Saldanha. Boonah, VestaUa, Itria, Nestor, Seang Bee, Aeneas, Galulu, Carina, ments co-operated heartily by placing as many Conargo. These works have manufactured and placed on all these ships a complete wireless system, despite what has 'been said by this man Denison, who caused the then Treasurer, Mr Higgs, to put certain questions to me. The Treasurer wanted to know from me whether the Amalgamated Wireless Company held a contract for the supply of wireless apparatus to all the ships trading in Australia. I replied that this was not the case; that they had certainly fitted some ships with wireless, but that, at the time, there were over sixty coastal vessels which still remained to be fitted with wireless. The Commission failed to get Commander Cresswell's report, which was absolutely in favour of the taking over of these works, and justified their purchase; but I happened to remember it, and showed it to my barrister. Thereupon he asked the Commission if they had had it before them. They said "" No."" It was only because I happened to have a copy of the report that the Commission knew of its existence. I think that Mr Denison should be proceeded against for perjury. The then Treasurer said that he nearly held up the payment of the money to Father Shaw because of his statements. At page 21 of the Radio Engineer's report, which was made twelve months after the purchase of these works, we have the further statementDuring the first twelve months from the time of transfer of this service to the Navy Department, the Wireless Telegraph Branch was greatly handicapped by the lack of suitable wireless telegraphy workshops. Representations were made, and a proposal for establishing suitable workshops in Melbourne was being considered when it was decided to take over the works of the Shaw Wireless Company, in Sydney. It was pointed out that these works were too extensive to justify their purchase purely for the requirements of the wireless telegraphy service; if, however, the Commonwealth purchased these works and utilized them, not only for wireless telegraphy purposes, but for the manufacture of electrical and small mechanical apparatus and machinery required by the different Commonwealth Departments, their purchase would be justified, provided, of course, that the various Departof their orders as possible with the works. The Shaw Wireless Works were subsequently taken over, and it has only been by the acquisition of these works that this Department has been able to meet almost the' whole of the demand for wireless telegraphy apparatus, &c, arising out of the war. Only because of the acquisition of these works has the Department been able to meet the demands made upon it for wireless telegraphy apparatus and for repairs for land stations. In this report the taking over of these works was absolutely justified. The Commission, however, never asked for it, and but for it the lying statements made by Denison would have gone unchallenged. So much for the way in which the Commission dealt with the business intrusted to them. They allowed this man, that man, and the other man to make damaging statements against the Department for the Navy, the Minister and the Government generally in regard to the taking over of these works. They called a few persons who wrote "" damnation,"" so to speak, across the taking over of these works, and it was only in my defence that the production of the report was demanded. Even"" then it was not commented upon by the Commission. In paragraph o of the Commission's summary we have the statement thatThe Minister was aware from the official reports that the Navy Department's requirements would not keep the plant fully employed, but he states that the Cabinet thoroughly understood that the Department's requirements would not keep the plant fully employed, and that work from all other Departments would be necessary to keep it fully employed, but he took no steps to obtain any correction of the Cabinet minute. Who are these Commissioners that they should say that I should have taken steps to secure a correction of the Cabinet minute? What have they to do with me or with the Cabinet? As long as I was satisfied that the matter had been discussed in Cabinet, and that it was understood that the works could not be kept fully employed in dealing only with wireless apparatus-that there was machinery in the works that co""ld be utilized to meet the requirements of other Government Departments-wha t more was necessary? I was in the inner secrets of the CabinetI was a member of it. Was it necessary that I should send this minute back to Senator Pearce to have it amended in one minor respect, when I knew what the exact understanding was? Ministers of the Crown were called to give evidence. Senator Gardiner, Senator Russell, and Senator Pearce were called before the Commission, and admitted when the question was put to them that when the proposal was being discussed it was understood that the works were to be taken over for wireless purposes, but could be used also for the purof the public, and this paragraph in its poses of other Departments. That was thoroughly understood. As Minister for the NavyI should have been only too pleased to allow the works to attend to the requirements of other Departments. As I have pointed out to the Cabinet, the workshops are being used at the present time by the Defence Department. True, the Defence Department is not the Navy Department, but it is a sister branch of the Service, and at the very time that the ex-Treasurer wrote to me the Shaw Wireless Works were carrying out certain work for the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. I believe it has manufactured also for other Government Departments. I had the minute of the Cabinet to the effect that I could buy these works for £55,000 provided I was satisfied that the Navy Department would keep them going. And the Navy Department will keep them going. The Defence Department is the Navy Department, and so is the Postal Department, in the sense that these evidence of any witness except Denison are Government works controlled by* the Navy Department, and having the machinery and the men capable of doing work required by the Defence Department and. the Postal Department. Commission urges, however, that I should have had the Cabinet minute corrected. There, again, the inference is that I did something without obtaining the consent of Cabinet. mary on the part of the Commission has in it the same sting. The whole summary is saturated with ill-feeling towards He is the managing director of the me. My answer to paragraph o in the Mr Jensen. Commission's summary is that I explained the whole position to the Cabinet, and that the file of papers was available for any member to see. The Treasurer's request was not limited to the plant being kept occupied by naval requirements, as is shown in paragraph 29, and Commander Cresswell's report fully answered the Treasurer's queries. As long as the Cabinet was satisfied with my action and knew what I was doing, what reason had the Commission to complain that no steps were taken to obtain any correction of the minute? The Commission was simply trying to damn me in the eyes summary is also unfair. I come now to paragraph pThe Minister's reply to the Commonwealth Treasurer's inquiry as to whether the works were necessary for tlie purposes of the Commonwealth failed to disclose the whole of the facts within the Minister's knowledge. That is a diabolical lie on the part of the Commission. My answer to it is that the Commission did not venture to state what facts were within my own knowledge that I did not communicate to the Treasurer. They cannot point to any fact within my knowledge that I failed to communicate. In making this statement they were only going upon certain evidence given by the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Higgs), who, when the other side was put to him by my counsel, considerably modified that part of his evidence. He said that if he had known of it before he would not have answered the question as he had done. 'There was no that the works were not worth the money. Denison was a biased witness who was running a rival concern, and he lied. He swore that the whole of the shipping The around the Australian coast was under contract with his company, whereas I have shown that after taking over these works we manufactured wireless apparatus for and fitted up a great number Every line in this sumof ships.

That action was taken on my own initiative. Let the Government inquire into it. Was there any corruption -or wrong-doing in that regard? .1 will relate to the House something else I did. The newspapers have had a lot to say about me in relation to the contract with Cone and Company for the fitting up of transports. That firm had a contract with the Navy Department for carrying out alterations to vessels and for the supply of the raw material and labour required in connection with the work, on a commission basis of 10 per cent. No matter what Cone and Company paid for labour or material, they received a commission of 10 per ceut. That was the f u l l text of the brief agreement that existed between them and the Government; there were no other conditions or considerations. When I was appointed Minister for the NavyI investigated the contract, and found that the Department was being absolutely robbed-robbed , I repeat. At my instance the company's books were ^ ral. That examination disclosed circumstances that were not too nice from the point of view of the Department. I immediately, said to Cone that I did not like the system on which he was working for the Department, and that he was not going to have these conditions a day longer. I forced Cone to another agreement, which made the conditions absolutely better, for the Government in every way. terial, he was to get only 5 per cent., and the discounts he had been allowed had to go into the Navy Department for the first time. There were many other restrictive conditions put into the agreement; and he worked under it for some little time. I placed a certain man on board the ships, giving hint a letter signed by me, and conferring on him the absolute right to come and go when he liked, irrespective of the Admiral or any other officer in the Navy Department. This man watched the interests of the Department, and reported to me almost daily the happenings in the course of the alterations of the ships. I state publicly that the man's name was Myers, so that if the Government* desire to inquire into some more of my actions they are at liberty to do so. The man reported to me that things were not right with Cone and Company, who were sub-letting the work to other firms. The result was that these firms were absolutely robbing the Navy Department. They were presenting Cone with certain accounts, and these were added to Cone's accounts again. What did I do ? I kicked those men off the ships. Yet the newspapers have dared to say certain things against me, including the statement that I paid certain moneys to Cone and Company to which they were not entitled. I challenge the Government to look into this matter, and say that I have not saved the country £25,000 by the new agreement, which was made retrospective from the first day they started. A ll their accounts were gone into, and big deductions were made under the agreement, with the result of great savings. I am charged with not taking the advice of the Rear-Admiral, hut the RearAdmiral sent a minute, and wanted me to seized and audited by the Auditor-Genepay Cone a certain amount, but I would not do so; and because of my action in regard to this company many thousands of pounds were deducted from their accounts. I may also inform the Melbourne newspapers that I held up one of Cone's accounts, and said that I thought that, on account of it, he ought to be charged with a criminal offence; and I sent a minute to the Crown Law Office. I prosecuted Peacock and Smith, but Instead of 10 per cent, for maon a technical point they got out of the trouble; yet the newspapers are blaming me over the Cone business. Whatever wrong was going on, I as Minister, immediately stopped it. What did I do without consulting the Board or the Cabinet? I handed over the whole of the work on those ships to the Trades Hall-anothe r cut at the Navy Board, those dignified gentlemen in gold braid. As I say, I handed over the whole of the work to the Trades Hall; and until I left the Navy Office the unions carried out the woTk in a very creditable manner, and never were accused of wrong-doing in regard to accounts, anyway. SupposeI did buy tbe Emeraldf o r £4,500 £7,500? The Togo is one of the fastest boats in Australia, and is only ,a few years old, w i th the best reciprocating engines in the Commonwealth. It was admitted hy the chairman of the Commission to be worth £7,500, as the, repOTt of the evidence shows. I am accused of buying these vessels as if I had no right to exercise my executive powers in this way. But bigger things have been done hy Cabinet Ministers without consulting the Cabinet. Hughes) paid £2,000,000 for ships without consulting the Cabinet, and his powers of executive are no more than mine. The Prime Minister bought those ships without having a valuation, or even the opinion, of the Naval Board of Australia; but he is not condemned or taken before a Commission. I bought the Togo because I wanted a boat like her-becaus e we had not at the time available a littl e tug-boat in Australia. and the state shipyards, but there was no material-n o plates for ships or boilers-and I was unable to get what I required. sary to tide me over the duration, of the War; and I had to "" d o t h in g s "" in the Navy. I never l e f t everything to the Naval Board; if I had, the Department would have gone wanting on many occasions. of the Commission admitted that the Togo was worth £7,500. is an extract from my evidence on the point: Bg the ChairmanI do not think we need waste time on it. I think the Commission is quite satisfied that the value of £7,500 for proper tug, she would suit our circumthe boat was all right. This shows that the Chairman the boat was worth £7,500, and yet I am condemned for buying her. one of the best built boats of her kind in Australia; copper fastenings, with the finest engines that could be provided in Australia, and a speed of 14 knots, though by a misprint that appears as 11 knots in the report-. She was inspected by one of the Naval Mr Jensen. engineers who was sent over to Launceston ; and he not only inspected the boat, but gave her a trial ru n and got 14 knots and another-the Togo-for out of her. His report was to the effect that he had examined the whole of the machinery of the ship, and had found it in excellent order. What more could I do? I had a report from the same officer that, in his opinion, she was worth £7,500. Admiral Creswell knew that this' officer had gone to Launceston to make this inspection, and he had no objection to it . But Sir William was ill for about three weeks, and, before I bought, the Togo, I rang up his office and The Prime Minister( Mr asked his chief clerk to communicate with him, and see if he had any objection to the purchase. The reply -from Admiral Creswell was "" No , "" and on that I purchased her. All the same, I am blamed for doing so, while, as I say, the Chairman of the Commission himself was satisfied as to the value. What did the Commission do? They made a rotten, silly statement concerning my action, or intended to apply to my action, in purchasing the boat. They say that the boat is not suitable for what she was I tried Cockatoo Island purchased for, and that tenders have been called for her, with the result that one for £1,000 and another for £350 were sent in . In my opinion, these tenders Two little boats were necesalmost give rise to a suspicion of "" f a k e ' ' in order to belittle me. The Emerald was offered to me for £6,000, but I refused to buy her at that price. The agent for. the owner interviewed me again, and wished me to rent As I have said, the Chairman her, but I said that the Commonwealth was financial enough to buy any boats The following she wanted, and that I did not want to rent her. A f t e r he had visited me on two or three occasions I told him that I wanted a boat to tide me over the war, and that while I knew she was not a stances, and I would give £4,500.

She had come down from Brisbane, and, beautifully seasoned wood, therefore, was seaworthy. Herh u l l, machinery, and boiler were in good order, and she was of fairly good dimensions127 feet long, with a good beam and f a ir draught. On the whole, I could see five years' work in her at the very least. In -view of the fact that dredges were about to start at the Westernport basin, we .required a small tug, and I could not get .one b u i l t ; and I said that, even if we did not spend much on her, the Emerald would suit us for the time being. rang up Mr Treacy, and, in his presence, offered Croker £4,500, giving him 4en minutes to think over it . He accepted the offer, and I instructed Mr Treacy to make all provisions for the completion of the sale. took the risk of buying this boat, although I had never had a trial of her; but I had a report, and knew she would do for me in the smooth water. Admiral Creswell was one who took umbrage at my buying the boat without consulting him. Admiral Creswell's evidence: By the Chairman -D o the Commission understand that the Emerald has been doing useful Government work?-Yes, she is doing good work. Although not suitable for the purpose of a tug-boat, yet she has done or is doing other work?-Yes. Would they require a boat of some kind to do the work she is doing?-Yes. We were in want of a boat for that special purpose, to take coal and water round to the dredges, instead of the dredges having to come into coal, &c. It will be seen that Admiral Creswell, under cross-examination, said that the Emerald was doing good useful work, although she cost only £4,500. What sort of boat can be purchased in these days for that amount? pect a destroyer or an ironclad ?So far as the Board knows about this vessel?-Sh e is doing good work. the engines of the .Emerald originally, who was the proper officer that the Board should have referred such an examination to.

Who was the technical officer?I should Gonsider the Third Naval Member the technical officer. you think is the value of that vessel as she now is?I could not give you an idea. I could only tell you she has been doing work for us and contributing to the service. I bought the Togo and the Emerald"" off my own bat,"" and never attempted to I make out that I had done otherwise. I have never endeavoured to make any other person responsible for my own action. I have done something else without consulting the Board or the Cabinet. I admit to the House that I What did I do? D i d the Commission give me credit for this? No. A certain transport was about to leave Australia. At-the time, I was a Ministeri n a Labour Government. When she arrived in Melbourne, all the firemen walked off her. On my own initiative, I put certain Naval The-following is an extract from Beservists on board, and sent her to Sydney and Newcastle, where she got sufficient coal to enable her to proceed to Europe. The Naval Eeservists, acting as firemen, brought her back to Melbourne; and at 10 o'clock in the morning of the day on which she was to sail, the whole of the seamen on board walked off in sympathy with the firemen. The transport was due to leave at noon w i th 1,200 soldiers, who were on board. I got on the 'phone, and pointed out to the secret a r y and the officials of the Firemen and Seamen's Union the serious effect of this action in war time, and pleaded for men to enable the boat to get away in time. "" Mr Minister,"" they said, "" w e cannot do it . The unionists are defying Would any one exthe executive."" I replied, "" I must have the men."" They said, "" The y w ill not go aboard."" Without taking the matter to the Naval Board, and without consulting Cabinet, I rang up the Williamstown Naval Depot, where there were some 200 or 300 Naval Eeservists. I told the Capgive them their knapsacks, to put them on the Williamstown train, and to send them round to Port Melbourne forthwith. It was then a quarter-past 10, and I said that they must be at Port Melbourne at a quarter to 12. I took it on myself to do this in the interests of the war, feeling that I was doing the right thing at the right time. I put the boat under naval discipline, and let the lines go, defying the unions of Australia. I did not take",226,Wireless Telegraphy And Electrical Wohkshops Randwick

1186,Cross,"examined by Mr Cussen -What dothat matter to Cabinet or to the Naval Board; I did it on my own. I knew that I was running the risk of causing a big strike; but, although a Labour Minister, I felt that in time of war no transport should be stuck up. The powers intrusted to me enabled me to do what I did. Let that action be put against the buying of these two little vessels, and against the attempt of the Commission to belittle me by their findings. I have referred to these matters to show that, on occasions other than those mentioned by the Commission, I have done things without consulting the Naval Board. ""What was the Naval Board? I was its boss, its president. I had the power to veto anything it might determine. WasI to do things only in a red-tape fashion? A Minister who is not game to do things for himself in the exercise of his ex'ecutive powers is not worth his salt. What have I to be ashamed of? I am accused of having spent a paltry £12,000 on the purchase of two vessels without making the proper investigation to ascertain whether they were worth the money. I told the Commission, in regard to the Togo, "" You say that only £1,000 was offered for her, and that there was another offer of £350; but I take it on myself to get £6,000 for her now, although she has been chopped about and altered this way and that."" Not a word was said in reply to me. The Commission found that I did certain things without conferring with the Navy Board or wifh the Cabinet. Let me tell you, sir, that in that same Navy Department, until I stopped it, officers, clerks, and storemen were purchasing tens of thousands of pounds worth of goods without a tender, and without a quote. I issued a minute stopping it. Did the Commission look into that? Have the Commission condemned those officers and others for doing things that were irregular and unknown to the Minister? Not tens of thousands of pounds worth only, but hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stuff were purchased in the Navy Department by servants who were getting only £5 per week. Some big firms in Melbourne received £40,000 and £50,000 for goods without a quotation or a tender. I stopped that. Mr Jensen. evidence. But departmental officers are not to be accused for doing these things. Their transactions are not to be looked into. It is the Minister who is condemned. I thank you, Mr Speaker, and honourable members, for your hearing. I . feel my position very much. No man can say that in my speech I have been spiteful to anybody. I have not been spiteful to the Government. I have said certain things, but I have kept within the limits to be expected of an ex-Cabinet. Minister. A t least, I shall never do what one Minister did here: I shall never tell the House what took place in an Executive meeting. The trials and suffering that I have undergone during the past, few days have been great; and if ever a man was tempted to say something, I have been so tempted. The day perhaps will come when many of those who have listened to me will overlook what has happened during the past ten days, so far as I am concerned. I have made my statement; I have produced facts. There are many other matters into which I could go, but time will not permit. The House has treated me well. I have now been here for three, hours and ten minutes, and have enough material in the way of notes for another three hours; but what I could say more would not, perhaps, convince honourable members beyond their present convictions. I am sorry for what the Government did to me. HadI had a chance to go before the party, they might perhaps have viewed matters in another light. However, I must take things as they are. I can walk down Collins-street holding my head up, because I have done no wrong. The Ministry have not charged me with doing anything wrong. Not one thing. Is not that so, Mr Acting Prime Minister? which the report is worded, the Ministry have not said another thing to me about my administration. Have you, sir? Speaker, and I thank every honourable member. I shall now consider where I My minutes are in shall take my seat in this chamber.
