14,Mr Speaker (Right Hon. W. A.,"as fully as I sliould desire, so that honorto the cost of a complete home was thus able menibers might understand everything in connection with it. I shall, therefore, be as concise as possible. There are two outstanding facts. what I hold to be the peculiarly unfair treatment by the War Service Homes Commission of the Co-operative Estates Company, of Hobart, and the other is the peculiar disinclination of past and present officers of the War Service Homes Commission to consider the use of concrete, instead of brick, in the erection of war service homes. The Co-operative Estates Company inaugurated a housing scheme in Hobart, for homes for purchasers of blocks on its subdivided estates. Mr J. W. Earle, who was, at the time, Deputy Commissioner of War Service Homes for Tasmania, after personal investigation, in company with the Commissioner, Colonel Walker, was so satisfied of the superior nature of homes built under the Wilson patent concrete system that he arranged with the Cooperative Estates Company to build about twenty homes for soldiers in Hobart. I have a number of photographs here which show the character of the homes built by the company under the Wilson concrete system in Hobart and elsewhere, and these were the first homes that were inspected by Mr better than the estimate by the engineer of Earle. These special contracts showed a saving of £40 per home, and Deputy Commissioner -Earle recognized that such a saving would amount to about £1,000,000 spread over the entire soldiers' homes building scheme at that time contemplated. Mr Earle was later on promoted to a superior position in Sydney, and he induced the Co-operative Estates Company of Hobart, by placing £3,000 at its disposal, for the purchase of plant, to go to Sydney and demonstrate under official supervision the actual saving that could be effected by the use of concrete shells-that is to say, walls and chimneys of concrete-instea d of brick. The first proposal was to build fifteen ' concrete shells, but this was later altered to"" fifteen complete homes. Owing to delays by tlie commission in supplying materials, the financial result of the experiments with those fifteen complete homes was not satisfactory, and a loss was sustained by the company owing to further delays in the work of the finishing trades. A proper test as prevented, but the result of the concrete shell construction was so satisfactory that the company was asked by letter from the One is commission to build 620 shells per annum. As the company were not ordinary contractors, they would not undertake such a big, contract, but agreed to build a group of 64 shells to furnish proof of coston a straight-out test, as was originally intended. A further sum of £2,000 was advanced, making a total advance of £5,000 by the commission to the company for the purchase of plant. The 64 shells were built to the same design as were the brick shells constructed by the commission in the same locality. The figures showing in detail the relative costs supplied to the company by the Deputy Commissioner, and officially certified to by the quantity surveyor, snowed a saving of £51 on a special test shell, after allowing £10 for royalty and £10 for depreciation. This result, was 25 per cent, better than that shown by the Hobart figures, on which a saving of £1,000,000 had been estimated by Mr Earle on the entire home building scheme that was then contemplated. If only £5 were allowed for royalty and £5 for depreciation-and this Would have been fair and reasonable -the actual result was 50 per cent, the commission, Mr Earle. The superior quality of the homes built in Sydney was acknowledged by so eminent an authority as Sir John Sulman, as may be seen in the Public Works Committee's recent report relating to the Laverton aircraft depot. The manager of the Cooperative Estates Limited, when before that committee, gave sworn evidence concerning Sir John Sulman's opinion of the concrete building scheme. That disposes of the argument that not sufficient expert opinion was obtained to decide whether concrete homes were not at least as satisfactory as brick homes. Sir John Sulman is acknowledged to be an eminent concrete building authority. The company made one very serious mistake at this stage. It signed an agreement to purchase plant to carry out a demonstration, relying in good faith on the footnote which the commissioner had made on the oflicial minute of Mr Earle. This minute forms a very important part of the case against the War Service Homes Commission by the company. The following minute, dated Sydney, 1Mb. November, 1919, wasforwarded to' the Commissioner, War Service Homes Commission, Melbourne:' SubjecWBuilding operations in New South Wales -Reinforce d concrete. I have been in communication with the Cooperative Estates Limited, of Hobart, who are building under contract for us a group of houses at Hoonah, the construction of which the' Commissioner saw in course of erection: on his last, visit to Tasmania. In order to expedite the work of building, homes iu this state, I have invited the firm to confer with me here, and their managing director has: arrived in Sydney; and they are prepared to meet me with this object. They are,, as you know, possessors of the Wilson's patent steel moulding plant for hollow wall construction, detailed plans of which I have already forwarded to central from Hobart. , I have proved the reliability and efficiency of this construction by various tests and' inspection of properties constructed by them, the period of erection being from nine years to newly completed', homes. I am satisfied as to the hygienic, sanitary., and sound efficiency of. the construction,, and the firm have proved the advantage as regards its cheapness to me hy signing the existing contracts with the commission for a group which showed a saving of approximately £40 per house on type 2A and 22.

JJor the purpose of demonstrating the possibility of considerable saving being effected on actual' cost of constructinghomes in this state, which saving I estimate as being certain-, vide my contractsin Tasmania, I desire, authority to enter into an agreement with the company based on the following lines :-1 1.

Immediately the test was the completion of the fifteen homes ] further homes with the plant or by tlio company,, the company will forthwith pay the total moneys advanced on the plant, being the balance due with interest as above, namely, 5-J. per cent, on all outstanding balances. 3.

In view of the contents of that minute,, there can be very little doubt as to why a representativeof the company went, to Sydney. The. company failed to protect itself against a repudiation of the* outstanding proposal in the . foregoing minute, namely, that the money for plants should be furnished for the purpose of demonstrating a. certain saving preparatory to a big scheme being put in hand by the Commission. The Commission protected itself by inserting a clause in the agreement by which the company would have to pay cash for the plants if no more homes were to be built by the company's concrete system, and as that was clearly understood to be operative only if the oompany failed to show a saving, no exception was taken to it by the company. Yet the company has been held responsible to pay inspite of the result of the demonstration having been 50 per cent, better than had been made the company asked permission by contract it is decided not to build any letter to make arrangements to give effect to the proposal for the big scheme outlined in the minute;, but the future policy of the Commission was then being considered, and the matter was held over. A t that stage General Sir James McCay was appointed business adviser to the. commission. It should -be noted that the commission did not then repudiate the original minute by Mr Earle, but simply evaded the issue. Sir James McCay called upon the company to pay in cash the balance then outstanding on the plants. The company protested forcibly in writing, but was threatened with an action, which it was not in a position to defend, and which would have meant r u in to it . The company was forced to accept an agreement by which the money was to be paid in instalments over a period of three years. I admit, and the company admits, that it should have -fought that proposal then, but MrD . J. Hutchings, who had Been Deputy Commissioner, in New South Wales, and has a splendid record, was so impressed with the possibilities of the system that he formed a company to build concrete homes by 'Contractf o r the commission. He agreed with the company to take over the entire responsibility for the plants, but though he made repeated offers to build by contract the hostility to him and to concrete construction was so great that he had to abandon the proposal. His company was forced into liquidation, and the plants again reverted to the Co-operative Estates Company. Mr Murchison, the manager „of that oompany, again placed the position before the Assistant Ministeri n charge of War Servioe Homes, and pointed out, for the third time, that his oompany was being ruined by being compelled to pay for plants which had been purchased for demonstration purposes, whilst the proposal outlined in the minute I have read was ignored. The matter was l e f t in the hands of the officers of the commission, who were so hostile that a w r it was issued against the company, but it was withdrawn when an instalment was paid. But for financial stringency, the Company would have arranged to continue payment by instalments rather than face litigation, because"" litigation would have had a disastrous effect on its assets, which were in the form of estates purchased for subdivision. The whole position was then placed before the present Ministerf o r Works and Railways( Mr Stewart), who refused to entertain the company's plea on the ground that the commission had changed its policy, and also because Sir James McCay had reported that he was satisfied that the company had gone to Sydney as ordinary building contractors. That decision was conveyed to Senator Ogden. The company next pleaded for a twelve months' extension to enable it to sell some portion of its £50,000 worth of land, and undertook to pay interest regularly during that time. It furnished financial statements showing that its income would provide interest, but that if the capital payment for t h w it h were insisted upon the bank would take possession, 'the Government and other creditors would lose their money, shareholders would suffer a considerable loss, and chaos would -result. A large number of people in Hobart are interested in the company's affairs, and that is my reason for taking action to-day. The company was willin g to pay to the extreme l i m it of its capacity, and conclusive proof was submitted that it had .substantial assets if it was allowed to carry on. The only reply to that appeal was a w r it issued in an arbitrary manner without even 24 hours' notice. As proof that Sir James McCay had made a blunder when he decided that the company had gone to Sydney as ordinary building contractors, fourteen sworn declarations, including minutes of the .meetings of directors and shareholders, were submitted. The managing director, Mr Murchison, has been in Melbourne for three months, and has at all times been ready to ""furnish any further proof that might be required; but except two brief interviews w it h ' the Prime Minister, he has not been heard personally in defence, notwithstanding that his written .statements have not been questioned. The only concession which the Prime Minister granted was a six months' extension of the time allowed for payment, but that is practically valueless because the bank is in possession of the company's assets, and its credit is destroyed. Disastrous results w ill accrue to a large number of people if the company is forced into liquir datio-n by the remarkable action of -the Commonwealth Government in issuing a writ instead of granting further time.. All the purchasers of residential blocks on time-payment, to the value of about £60,000, have made some payments, and they w ill be at the mercy of the original vendors of the land. Many of them are returned soldiers. The shareholders, who have invested £23,000 in the company, will also suffer heavily if the company is forced into liquidation. I am aware that the Attorney-General was asked to report on the equity of this case, and the fact that he has reported against the company is conclusive proof that the position was not placed before him in all its bearings. This is not a party question. All the Tasmanian representatives in this Parliament have tried to induce the Government to show a reasonable spirit instead of taking drastic action. In a letter to the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page), the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Seabrook) referred to the Government's action as "" a grave public scandal,"" and all the Tasmanian members wonder why the Government has insisted upon following that course. Strong terms have been used regarding the unjust treatment meted out by the War Service Homes Commission. I appeal to the Government, even now, to alter its decision, withdraw the writ, and allow the matter to be referred to the Public Works Committee for consideration and report. The company is prepared to abide loyally by the decision of the committee, or, as an alternative, it is agreeable that the matter should be submitted to three arbitrators-one to represent the Government, one to watch the interests of the company, and the third to be chosen by the other two. Surely nothing could be fairer than that! persists in proceeding on this writ, and in taking drastic action, heavy'losses will be incurred by a number of innocent people, while the Government will probably obtain not one penny of the balance outstanding. case with numerous other companies, is carrying on by means of a bank overdraft. the bank, being the first creditor, will 9tep in, and the estates will revert to the original vendors, who will have the people who have bought blocks entirely at their mercy. volved, which is a paltry sum when compared with other big sums which have been involved in the War Service Homes scheme. struction of liomes in concrete, instead of in brick, is not viewed with favour by some of the officers of the department. That probably is the reason for the persistent hostility towards this company shown by them from the beginning. Erom the moment that the representatives of this company went to Sydney, and demonstrated that an actual saving of £40 per building, could be effected by Mr O'Keefe. the construction of buildings in concrete, that hostility has been continued. It should be remembered that the company's representatives went to Sydney at the request of Mr Earle, after he and Colonel Walker had examined buildings in Hobart, and had satisfied themselves that a saving could be effected by the erection of similar buildings in Sydney. Why was this company selected for this kind of treatment? I do not blame the present Minister, except that he has followed the same course as his predecessor. In that action he has probably been guided largely by the same officers, or at least by one of them. I hiave no interest in the company, except that I represent a number of people who are financially interested in it, but it seems incomprehensible to those who know the facts that the Government should insist on issuing this writ, and on taking the first step towards its ruin. I appeal to the House, on behalf of the company, which I maintain has not received the treatment which one might have expected from a jaig government concern such as the ""War Service Homes Commission. It is like using a steam-hammer to crush If the Government an egg-shell to apply the whole force of the Commonwealth Government to the ruin of this company. I appeal to the Minister, even at this late hour, to allow this question to be investigated and reported upon by the Public Works The company, as is the Committee. If it is forced into liquidation, for Works and Railways) [3.6] I regret that the time at my disposal will not permit me to review the history of this case, which goes back some years before I took charge of the. department. I can only After all, only £6,000 is inbase my conclusions on the papers on fche file, which, in view of the confusion which existed in the early days .of the War Service Home3 Commission, are not It would appear that the convery clear in some cases. Mr Earle, the supervising engineer of the commission, had business relations with this company in Hobart. He was subsequently transferred to Sydney. On the 31st October, 1919, he wired to the company in the following terms: If you are ready to take contract here, say, 500 or less groups of 100 plus 5, come Sydney, bring your figures, quantities or tenders Tasmania.

In response to the telegram of the 31st October, 1919, already referred to, Mr Murchison, the manager of the company, proceeded to Sydney, and as a result of his visit, Mr Earle submitted a memorandum to the commissioner. In this memorandum Mr Earle stated that he had a big scheme to build 10,000 houses yearly, at a saving of £40 per house, and that the scheme would save the Commonwealth up to £1,000,000. He statedPor the purpose of demonstrating the pany hereunder, unless and until satisfactory possibility of considerable saving being effected tenders for the erection of the said cottages on actual cost of constructing homes in this in accordance with .the conditions of tendering State, which saving ' I estimate is certain, of the War Service Homes Commission have vide my contracts in Tasmania, I desire' been accepted by the Commissioner, and conauthority to enter into an agreement with the tracts for these tenders have been formally company based oh the following lines :1.

Clause 15 of the agreement providedI t is agreed by and between the parties hereto that this agreement is entered into upon the express stipulation that no moneys shall he advanced by the Commissioner to the comexecuted by the company. In other words, the company had to tenscribed as one defining the position of the Walker The contract really contained preliminary conditions, subject to the company sucfor these fifteen homes.

On the 1st March, 1920, Mr D. J. Hutchings was appointed Deputy Commissioner in Sydney, and as the company was not satisfied with the agreement, a fresh contract, providing for payment on a percentage basis, was drawn up. But after consultation with Colonel Walker the company agreed to carry on under the existing agreement. On the 17th March, 1920; Mr Hutchings telegraphed that a satisfactory contract for the fifteen houses had been made, and asked if payment of the advance on the plant could be made. transaction I have just referred to. It was ascertained that £702 had been advanced by the Sydney office of the commission without authority, prior to a contract being actually entered into, and the Commissioner, therefore, gave his approval on definite' evidence being produced of the liability of the commission. The arrangement between the parties provided that the company should tender for the homes, but this stipulation was waived by the Commissioner, as shown by the following minute of the 3rd February, 1920, to the Deputy Commissioner:You are advised that the calling df puhlic tender's in respect of fifteen properties desired erection of fifteen buildings in New South to be constructed hy the Co-operative Estates Limited may be dispensed with. This must not be accepted as a precedent. The contract was not completed until the 3rd June, 1921, the contract time being exceeded by seven months, but, as the delay was partly due to the cement shortage, no penalty was -enforced. Apparently the company lost £2,000 on the contract, the total amount of which was £S,413 Ss. 2d. The loss was attributed by the Deputy Commissioner to the steadily-rising market, lack of proper supervision, want of knowledge of the finishing trades by the company's foreman, and delay by the commission in furnishing material at various stages. In consideration of the delay caused by the commission thb company was allowed a sum of £150. The honourable member for Denison blamed the commission for the delay in completing the work, and for the loss to the company. As I have shown, Mr Stewart. the delay was due to other causes, as well as those for which the commission was responsible. The statement has been made that the company was induced, and almost lured to Sydney, to demonstrate the system. On the 25th February, 1920, the company wrote to Colonel Walker, after having received Mr Earle's letter, expressing appreciation of his request that the company should establish branches in Melbourne and Sydney,, thanking him for copies of memoranda of the 11th and 14th November, 1919, and endeavouring to get a contract'.for "" shells "" instead of houses. The Commissioner replied rather abruptly, as follows:I desire to state in answer to your letter:This was the questionable I did not request you to .establish branches in Sydney and .Melbourne with the object of .your taking in hand the construction of 1,000 homes in each place. My discussion with you arose out of my inspection of concrete houses iri Tasmania, and your very strong representations that, with your system, you could .build concrete houses considerably cheaper than similar houses in brick. On your figures, paragraph 2 of your letter, you apparently estimate flOO per house can be saved, and in paragraph 9 you state, "" We can positively and conclusively prove that a saving of £50 per house can -he effected if brick is taken against concrete."" Agreements were completed with you for an advance of 00 per cent, on cost of plants, subject to contracts being entered into for the"" Wales and 80 in Tasmania. Wihcn you submit satisfactory tenders in accordance with clause 15 of the agreements entered into between your company and myself on the 31st January, 1920, I will immediately deal with same. Time will not permit me to do more than summarize the position as I found, it when I took ministerial oflice. The company had then agreed to repay to the commission certain sums of money, and. in order that undue hardship should not be inflicted upon the company, it was allowed to make the payments in instalments of £250, plus interest and other charges, per quarter. The previous Assistant Minister had allowed one payment to lapse at the request of the company. The first payment, after I became Minister, was made on its due date, but the second was not made,' and a writ was accordingly issued. Subsequently, hoAvever, the company paid thc amount. I agreed to withdraw the writ, and 'to allow another payment to be deferred on the distinct understanding that thenceforth such arrangements as would guarantee the The company again defaulted, however, and another writ was issued. The position that faced me when I took charge -of the War Service Homes Department was that the company had agreed to repay certain sums of money, and for me to have entirely disregarded their signed -agreement and to have told them that they need not pay the money, would have been, not only very questionable administration, but very close to corruption. This matter has been thoroughly investigated. first appeal when Mr Rodgers was the Assistant Minister for Repatriation, and in consequence of its strong representations General McCay investigated the whole position. -company was not suffering any injustice, and that there was neither legal nor moral obligation on the Government to allow the payments the company had agreed to make to lapse. Lamond became Assistant Minister for Repatriation, and the oompany fought the battle over again with him, and was once more unsuccessful. It made a third attempt to alter the mind of the Government after I assumed office. I was sympathetic with it , and so was the Government. The Government has no desire whatever to crush or harm any indi.vidual or body, b u t . it has a duty to the taxpayers. Honourable members know very well that in these troubles over the War Service Homes administration, whenever there ""was any laxity on the part of the commission the private companies which were doing business with ifc took all . possible steps to obtain every penny of damage they could from' it . They put the legal knife into the commission right up to the hilt, and when they found that they had no legal claim, they immediately talked loudly about a moral obligation. A f t e r I refused to agree to the company's requests, it made representations to the Prime Minister, aud he, in company with myself, received a deputation on the matter. A thorough investigation was made then and the claim was again rejected. In conclusion, I remind honourable members thafc, although the company has steadfastly persisted in its statement thafc ifc could build War Service Homes at £10 0 less each than brick houses would cosfc, it has repeatedly refused to tender for the the company would make work. In all the circumstances, I cannot agree to submit the matter .to the fulfilment of the contract. Public Works Committee. case for the company has been well put by the honourable member for Denison( Mr O'Keefe), and the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart) has admirably stated the Government's point of view. It seems regrettable fchat in the last few years there has been such a rapid succession of Ministers in charge of the War Service Homes Department. Had tliere been, continuity of control by the one Ministerj we should The company made its not have been facing this situation. The agreement referred to by the Minister shows clearly, and the honourable member for Denison admitted, that the company is in fche wrong. Ifc acted foolishly i ri He reported that the signing the agreement. When I was in Sydneyi n 1920, I discussed the whole situation wifch Captain Payne, one of fche company's officers, who is now living in Hobart, and I am convinced fchafc the Subsequently Mr company went to Sydney to demonstrate only. Notwithstanding that the Minister seems to have said the last word for fche Government, I still hope that the Public Works Committee may be permitted to report on the matter. There is no doubt fchafc the constructional methods of the company are good. In a report on the matter which was made by Sir John Sulman on the 26th September, 1921, the following paragraph appears : Tlie Wilson patent system is, to my mind, the most practical, sound, and economical system of concrete house construction which has come under my notice, and if the saving of £50 per five-roomed cottage stated to have heen effected is correct (and I sec no reason why such saving should not easily be possible), then it will become an important factor in solving the present housing problem. The Minister has said that the company has failed to demonstrate, as it ought to have done: but for the last two years it has nob been in a position fco do so. It has refused to accept building contracts, for it is not a contracting company. If it had desired to undertake constructional work it could have accepted the offer made to it to build 620 homes per year. I think the Government should have tnken up that work.

I think, however, that it is a very reasonable request to ask that the facts in the case should be submitted to investigation by the Public Works Committee. That request is so reasonable that I am surprised that the Minister should refuse it. I readily grant that the honourable gentleman made a very clear statement in the very limited time at his disposal. It carried with it a considerable amount of conviction, but if I felt so sure of the strength of my case as the Minister does I should be eager to submit the matter to the Public Works Committee to have my contention substantiated. The case presented by the honourable member for Denison and supported by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) is one for investigation. this investigation. It is not a question of appointing a new commission at considerable expense, but of referring this matter to the Public Works Oommittee, which is representative of all parties in this House and in which we have had no occasion to lose our confidence. Honourable members will agree that there is scarcely a matter connected with the administration of the War Service Homes Commission that has not been associated with bungling, and very often with something in the nature of a scandal. Though we shall possibly never get to the end of the questions raised by the administration of the commission, we may be able piecemeal to investigate one case after another, and it is our duty to do so. The Minister asked what he was to do-. When he went into the Department he found that this oompany was owing money to the Government which it had agreed to pay, and he asked whether it was not his duty to demand payment. I agree that that was his duty. It is the duty of a Minister of the Crown to collect moneys due to the Crown. I only wish that the Government was a little more insistent about the collection of some land tax that is outstanding. If the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) were as insistent upon the collection of moneys due to the^ Crown as the Minister for Works and Railways has been, I should have less criticism of the Government to offer. So far as he has gone in this matter in the administration of his department, I do not think that any one can quarrel with I certainly do not. Still, in this case, in which there is reasonable doubt as to the facts, when a proposal is made that they should be investigated by an impartial body on which the Government has a majority of representatives, I fail to see why the proposal should be turned down. The Minister will say that there ia no case to go to the Public Works Committee. I think there is reason for doubt as to whether the company was rightly treated. I do not desire to traverse the facts presented by the honourable member for Denison. I confess that I have not gone into the matter as closely as he has done. But representatives of the company placed some of the data before me from the company's point of view, and I told them frankly that I was not prepared to accept an ex partis stateNothing can be lost by ment from anybody on this matter. I said, "" I shall consider the facts as presented by you, I shall listen to the Minister's reply, and if I believe that a case has been made out for investigation I shall support a proposal to have it investigated."" I think such a case has been made out. I direct attention to some of the facts in this matter. First of all, the company built homes in Hobart. I have heard no question of its statement that it built those homes at £40 per house less than they would have cost if brick had been used in their construction. That statement has been substantiated by Mr Earle and also by the War Service Homes Commissioner of the day (Colonel Walker). Because of that demonstration of saving in Hobart, Mr Earle. who had in the meantime been transferred to Sydney, requested the company to come to Sydney and build fifteen houses there, but not as a contractor. The Minister emphasized the fact that the company was there as a demonstrator. The demonstration waa not as satisfactory as some would have liked, but why? The company gives the answer to the question. It says, ""We are not builders. We know nothing about the",20,Limited Hobart Formal Motion Of Adjoubnhmnt
24,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [3.38],"I-finishing of houses. Our patent is for building the concrete shells of houses."" I have read the report of the architect, Sir John Sulman, who, I believe, stands very high amongst the architects of this country. I have read no more flattering reports of any patent building system in connection with any branch of the building trade. strated in Hobart that it could make a saving of £ 4 0 per house, it was taken to Sydney. an ordinary business firm. the request of Supervising Engineer Earle, who was a representative of the government of the day. went to Sydney to demonstrate there that it could save £ 4 0 a house. It claims that at that demonstration, so f a r as the construction cf the shells of the houses was concerned, it saved' more than £ 4 0 a house, as against the cost involved"" in the use of brick. I am not saying that this claim is correct, but it has not yet been discredited. This is a matter for practical investigation by the Public Works Committee. First of all, did the company save £ 4 0 per house in Hobart? D i d it save more than £ 4 0 per house in Sydneyi n the erection of the shells? If it did, the demonstration succeeded, and the company was entitled to believe that its system would he taken over by the War Service Homes Commission large number of homes. If that had been done, its plant would have been taken over; it would have had no liability to the Government, and the Government would not have been forced to put in a w r it against it . If these facts cannot be esber for Fremantle nor myself, is prepared tablished the Government is entitled to press its claim against the company,, although probably it will get nothing by doing so. There is one thing which, on the facts, induces me to lean somewhat to the company. If it failed in its demonstration in Sydney, as alleged, why was it subsequently offered the opportunity to construct 620 homes ? The Minister cannot answer that question. I do not expect him to answer everything in connection with the War Service Homes Department, in view of the short time he has been in charge of it . He might be there for twenty years without being able to unravel the whole of the tangle. A f t e r the company had built fifteen homes in Sydneyi t was offered a contract to build under its system 620 homes. for them. tem was considered a good one. company was invited to tender, and reA f t e r the company had demonfused to do so, also 'proves its statement that it did not carry on work as a builder. It is not a company of builders, but one possessing patent rights in a building sysI t went to Sydney as tem which it wanted others to take over and pay a royalty upon. The company It went to Sydney at demonstrated in Sydney fchafc by the use of its system money could be saved in fche erection of war service homes. Mr. The company Earle said fchat he believed if the company could do what it had done ""in Hobart, it might save fche department. £1,000,000. Tho company claimsthat it did better in Sydney than it did in. Hobart. That is a claim which sbould beinvestigated. If , by honest investigation, the claim is substantiated, the question will arise why the War' Service Homes Commission refused to adopt a system of construction that would have saved the country £1,000,000. If , on investigation it. is shown thafc by the use t of the system no saving could be made, the company will be out of court altogether. The electorate of Denison is affected by this matter. MrO ' KEEFE It is very largely for the construction of a affected by it . nary justice to these people I think that a strong case has been, made out for investigation. Neither the' honourable member for Denison, the honourable memto accept partisan statements on the matter; but I think that"" the facts which have been p u t . before the House, and even the statement of the Minister, which was a f a i r statement of the position of the Government, establish a case for investigation. As ifc would not involve any great cost, and would satisfy honourable members and the public generally, that the Government is prepared to see justice done, I believe the Minister would be wise to reconsider the position he has taken up, and permit an investigation to be made. have risen more particularly to ask the Minister one question ' concerning this",21,Limited Hobart Formal Motion Of Adjoubnhmnt

It is worth ascertaining whether the claims of this company have been considered from an unprejudiced point of view, whether the investigation that was made in Sydney concerning its building patent was satisfactory, whether had not the shortage of finance' prevented the Commonwealth Government from continuing its programme of construction of war service homes, it would have continued its relations with this company, or whether the use of this building patent was discontinued through circumstances for which the company was not responsible. vemment was not to build any more houses, either by contract or otherwise, and that might have been a factor in the situation. I am not prepared to say so definitely, because I was not a member of the Government then in power. company was asked to go ahead and tender, but it refused to do so. the patent in operation in Hobart gave satisfaction to the deputy commissioner, and that it was desired to use it in ""a wider sphere in and around Sydney. Itseems to. have operated there, but just at that junctureI am speaking from my own knowledge as I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee that in quired into this matter-the whole programme of works was closed down for want of funds. This may be one of those unfortunate cases to which the Minister has referred, and in whichcontracts were made for the construction of war service homes. Most companies were careful enough to enter into sufficiently binding agreements, and so soon as the cessation of the works programme came about, they obtained from the Government all the compensation they possibly could. It is manifest that this company did not want to make a hard and fast agreement, and if there is a point of justice or moral right in dispute, an investigation should be made. been made, one by Sir James McCay, the business adviser to the War Service Homes Commission, and the other by the Attorney-General's Department. are conclusive that the company bad neither legal nor moral claim. my question. into consideration by the Government in coming' to its decision. very reasonable in this matter, but there h the question of good f a it h to be considered. This company in good faith proved the efficiency of its plant, its work being to the satisfaction of the deputy commissioner. When the company's funds were exhausted, it was l e f t high and dry. If that is not disputed, the Minister oi Parliament should give the company some consideration. -There is behind the work of this company a very strong recommendation by one of the members of the Federal Territory Advisory Committee, Sir John Sul; man, who is reputed to be one of the foremost town planners of Australia. The This request, for an investigation is exceptionally reasonable. If the honourable member for Denison( Mr O'Keefe) is not able to persuade the Minister to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee for investigation, there is a way out of the difficulty, as' the Public Accounts Committee can, on its own initiative, investigate the expenditure of any public moneys. That committee has in vestigated quite a number of cases very similar to this. Without picking out any particular public officer for condemnation, I say that when inquiries were made by that committee concerning the construction of war service homes, and other matters, what absolutely appalled its members was the loosely-drawn contracts entered into for the construction of homes, and the provision of various supplies It is well known to honourable members that some persons, contractors and others, having dealings with the War Service Homes Commission have been subjected to what was nothing more nor less than persecution. Investigations respecting the construction of war service homes and the conduct of the .commission are by no means at an end.

The Minister stated that already two inquiries had beeu made into this case, one by the Attorney-General's Department, and the other by Sir James McCay. This gentleman appeared as a witness before the Publio Accounts Committee. chairman of a certain committee, and many things that that committee did were the subject of very serious criticism. This case is essentially one for investigation, and the Minister should .refer it either to the Public Works Committee, or to the Publio Accounts Committee. If this is done, in a. comparatively short space of time the requisite evidence and documents will be obtained, and the report of the committee made available to honourable members. I would inform the Minister that it is competent for the Publio Accounts Committe** to investigate the expenditure of any sum. of public money.

There appeared to me to be no justification for the claim, either on legal or moral grounds, and I was unable 5 to suggest that any assistance should be given to the company.

In view of the fact that the yearly expenditure in Queensland on invalid and old age pensions amounts to approximately three-quarters of a million pounds, together with roughly £100,000 for maternity allowances, does the Government consider(a) that any further delay in appointing a Deputy Commissioner is advisable; and (b) that this expenditure should be controlled by other than an officer exopportunity of looking into this correperienced in old-age pensions administration ? the honorahle member's questions are as follow:1.

Trade and Customs, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that there is an instance on record that an increase has been made in an import duty when dutiable goods have been in transit between two ports on the Australian coast, and that such goods have been charged the higher duty at the port beyond that at which the higher duty has been imposed, or, if imposed between two ports, thus permitting importers at the nearer ports to undersell importers at the more distant ports? 2. If this practice is in operation, will be have it discontinued for the future ? honourable member's questions are as follow :: 1. All increases in duty must date from the same specific time all over Australia. Duty is chargeable by the law at the rate in force when the goods are actually "" entered "" at the Customs. there must therefore be cases where a vessel may land goods at one port (say, Fremantle), and by the time the vessel arrives at another port (say, Port Adelaide), the duty may have been altered. Where the duty is reduced, the importer, at the latter port gets the advantage. 2. Thq position is unavoidable. Whenever a duty is altered, goods entered at the old rate are in competition with goods imported at the new rate, whether the duty goes up or down.

Whilst Lady Stradbroke and others are reported to have stated that Ausmigrants,, the chief complaint brought under notice of my colleague, Senator Wilson, when in Great Britain, was that Australia was too particular and was demanding too much before accepting migrants. The machinery at Australia House is functioning quite satisfactorily. 2.

I assume that the Accounts Committee for £500,000 referred to in the bill will not and have supplied a wealth be applied to any one of the services, but I was struck by the to ali of them. Some honourable members, notably the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey), in opposing the b ill , clearly stated that the Labour party was in favour of providing for the defence of We do not want memthis country. Subsequent Opposition speakers, particulalry the honourable member for Wannon( MrM c N e ill ) , Some of those unipointed to the necessity for a defence force, but unfortunately they have given regiment. I regret the no indication of their view of the requirements. The honourable member for It made a terWannon said that it was not his duty to make any suggestions, because he was a member of the Opposition. But the defenoe of Australia is a non-party matter, and it is ridiculous for honourable members to adopt any such attitude. Every for clothing and equipment honourable member recognizes how much obtainable in Great Australia owes to the Labour party for There is need for the cultivawhat it has done for our defence. The Why Right lionorable Andrew Fisher and his have a uniform colleagues really laid the foundations of the success of the Australian Imperial from Force when they passed the Defence Act. I regret, therefore, that honourable members opposite should say that they are When the under no obligation to make suggestions. party I do not think a single member of this Parliament would advocate that we should scrap all our defence equipment",31,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading
96,Uses Sir Neville Howse (Calare),"and do nothing to protect the country from aggression. We should therefore try to find the most economical and best means for resisting attack. A good deal has been said about whether a cruiser should be constructed in Australia or not, but that matter is not dealt with by the bill. The naval aspect of the measure can be dismissed in a few moments. To-day Australia has three or four cruisers which are so nearly obsolete that not a single naval authority would agree to them being sent on active service. will, without exception I think, agree with me when I say it would be a criminal act for any government to let our present cruisers leave the protection of a port to face an approaching enemy whose force included modern cruisers. To do so would be callous murder. The only purpose that our obsolete cruisers can serve before they are scrapped-and I hope that that will take place at an early date-is to train men for service in properly equipped vessels. Whether one regards the speed or the armaments of our cruisers it must be admitted that it is ridiculous to suggest that we should rely upon them for our defence. other aspect of naval defence with which I shall deal is the defence of our ports. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) pointed out clearly last night the necessity of protecting our principal ports. tion to-day. member think one cruiser will protect ' them ? able member for Ballarat will have an opportunity later on to tell the House whether or not he made the extraordinary statement in regard to Australian defence that he is alleged to have made some little time ago at Ballarat. I do not for one moment think that any honourable member in his right mind would express such views. We are justified in questioning the mental condition of any one who suggests that there is no ' need to make provision for the defence of Australia. should provide long-range guns and the equipment for laying naval mines, but at present we are absolutely without anything of the kind, and our ports are practically undefended. If an attack upon Australia became imminent the majority of our leading defence authorities would advise hoisting the white 'flag, otherwise Sydney or Newcastle or any other port that was threatened could be totally destroyed. Surrender would be the only possible means of preventing the destruction of our seaboard cities. I shall now discuss the military aspect of the bill. The honourable member for' Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) said last night that Australia was not only without defence Our naval officers equipment, but also without trained troops. That is true. If the last war demonstrated one thing more clearly than another it was the necessity for sending only trained soldiers into the field. An examination of field hospital records proved that the battalions which suffered most-leavin g out of consideration, of course, the cases of men woutnded iai battle-were those which received the least amount of training. We recognize that training is necessary in civil life. If honourable members of this Parliament were suddenly obliged to do hard physical work there would be many more casualThe only ties among them than there would be among the same number of men accustomed to that class of work. Honourable members are not trained for manual labour, and would naturally suffer if they were suddenly compelled to adopt that They have no protecmeans of earning a livelihood. The Defence Act makes provision for training our military forces. Section 125 sets out the conditions applicable to the training of different branches of the service. I do not claim to be an authority on military affairs, but I claim to know something about the requirements of' the army medical corps. Indeed, having had charge of 400,000 or 500,000 of Australia's soldiers for four or five years, I feel that it is my duty to acquaint this Parliament of my views on this aspect of the subject. The Defence Act provides that members of the army medical corps shall be trained. Universal recognition is given now to the fact that medical services are of immense value in war time. It may be only It is important that we a sentimental value in the case of a short war, but in the case of a long war the service becomes absolutely essential. A Avar could not be maintained for very long without a medical corps. The Defence Act provides that members of the army",32,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading

98,Sir Neville Howse,"The honormedical corps shall undergo 119 days camp training, spread over a period o£ seven years, hut to-day provision is made foronly twelve days of such training, spread over only two years. The light horge and infantr y forces are required, under the Act, to spend 56 days in camp in seven years, but to-day provision is made for onlytwelve days' training in two years. In 1914 over 100,0.00 men were in training,but to-day the totalis only 40,000. I say unhesitatingly that our present training arrangements are a travesty. If the Government does not in tend to administer the Defence Act properly, it should repeal the -measure i m mediately. The training that our men receive in these days is of very little 'benefit to them, and certainly does not warrant the huge expenditure that it involves. Honourable members must recognize that it is impossible for us to defend our shores without other help. It would be childish to say that we ever have been, can now, or ever w ill , be able to defend ourselves against an enemy unless we a r c prepared to incur an enormous expenditure. If , for instance, we were to adopt anything like the policy which Japan has adopted we should require to spend hundreds of millions of pounds. I take the case of Japan simply by way of illustration, and not because we have any ill w i ll towards her. Thero is, of course, the racial dislike which members of the white race instinctively feel towards any coloured race, but that is not the result of enmity. It is a natural instinct which is necessary for the preservation of. the p u r it y of our race. war organization for defence, there are MrA . GBEEN -r-And it is reciprocated by J apan. It is a sacred duty of the men of any nation to make provision for the defence of their women and children, but it has been estimated that the absolutely minimum expenditure that would give Australia auy hope of protecting herself from aggression would be £50,000,000 a year for ten years. Even then she would have to look to England to train many of her men and build her ships. The expenditure of £500,000,000 would be the absolute minimum necessary to place Australia in a position comparable in war strength with, say, that of Japan. To revert to the subject of our medical service, the records show that in 1914 its total Citizen Force strengthwas 210 officers and 1,439 other ranks; to-day it is 193 officers and 859 other ranks. Honourable members may say that there are plenty of qualified medical practitioners in Australia who would be available for aofcive service, but I must point outto them that effective medical service on the field of battle is dependent upon a reasonable knowledge of military organization. A medical practitioner may be thoroughly qualified to practise in civilian life, and yet be quite incompetent on the field. I say, without hesitation, that a medical man who has had a year of active military service is worth two, or even three, who have had no such experience. his knowledge of the necessary medical organization. To give a simple illustration. Previous to 1911 it was estimated that on active service for each casualty admitted to hospital 25 would be admitted for -disease-, and that for one death from wounds there would be five f r cm disease. In the Australian I m perial Force, however, the position was' utterly reversed, there being approximately ten deaths . in action or from wounds to every one from any other cause. There was an enormous amount to be learned in connection with medical organization. Anotheri n teresting feature of defenoe is man power. The Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey) referred to this matter yesterday. If we take the present five infantr y divisions and two cavalry divisions. Our armed troops, roughly, would number 200,000, and in reserve we should require to have another 200,000. That is 400,000 men for our army alone. We do not possess in Australia to-day 400,000 able-bodied physically and mentally-fit men between the ages of 19 and 35. The returns show that in Australia to-day there are 761,000 men between these ages, which are the ages fixed for active service all over the world. F if t y per cent, of Australians between tho3e ages to-day are unfit for active-service. This is a matter of the gravest importance to Australia. I may bs asked what data there are to support this statement. The only data are thosesupplied by a partial",33,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading

The only other data we have for estimating the. health of the nation is obtained in connection with enrolment in the Citizen Porces. Of all the boys born in this country in 1903, 21,000 have been called up for training, and of that number 13.6 per cent, have been found to be unfit for transfer to the Citizen Forces, although it was recognized, and an order was issued by the chief of the medical service, that all boys were to be passed into the Citizen Forces whom ib was considered that physical training would benefit. figures disclose an appalling state of affairs. attention should be paid to matters of public health. that the attention of every member of this House should be directed to what is really one of the most important questions facing us to-day.

Nothing has been done. We have been perfectly satisfied to complain that the medical examination was too strict, or that the conditions under which men would be accepted were too strict. Honourable members must be aware that at a certain stage of the war there was very great laxity in the acceptance of men for active service who were not physically fit If tliat were not so, fro m 16,000 to 20,000 men could not have got to the other side of the water, and when they came under my care be found, after medical examination, unfi t for service in France. accepted at that time.

A defence policy should be laid down, after consultation between both sides, and it should be one to be followed for a period of ten years, no matter which party might -have the privilege or suffer the drawback of having to sit on this side during that time. I shall not accept from the Prime Minister on this occasion the excuse always given,, that money is not available, becausewhatever may be necessary for the purpose should be spent to uphold our ideals. I ask honourable members on both sides, whether the main ideal of Australia, and that for which we have fought, is not the purity of our race. I ask, f u r ther, whether we could maintain it for one second if it were not for the protection of the British navy. Were we not under the aegis of the British navy, Japan could say to us to-morrow, "" We are going to send a certain number of our people to Australia. We shall not flood you with 100,000 in the first year, but we shall send so many' each year u n t i l we are satisfied that they are well settled, and then we shall continue to send more and more.""

In view of our system of housing, clothing, and climate, this ought to be, though unfortunately it. is not, the healthiest country in the world.

The Labour party has never been backward in declaring its policy on any big public question. It has been in existence for only 25 years, and though its policy on every big question that has arisen has been sneered at and treated with contempt, time has in connection with every one of those great questions vindicated the attitude adopted by the Labour party.

Owing to the advent to power of Mr Ramsay MacDonald and the Labour party in Great Britain a complete change has taken place throughout Europe. The refusal by us to build the proposed cruisers would create, in the Pacific, just as good an impression as was created in Europe when Mr Ramsay MacDonald refused to build aeroplanes and submarines. M t . JACKSON -The British Government is building aeroplanes and submarines-. only replacing two or three cruisers under very peculiar circumstances. Bay MacDonald came into power under circumstances' somewhat similar to those under which the Labour party gained office in Tasmania. Liberals and Conservatives admitted that they could not govern Tasmania, and they called in the aid of the Labour party, saying, "" For God's sake get us out of our muddle."" The same thing happened in Great Britain. mongers of that country had got its affairs into a serious position, and could not find a way out of their difficulty, so Mr Ramsay MacDonald was asked to form a Ministry. time, the militarist class was in power, and would have continued in office had Mr Ramsay MacDonald proceeded on the lines adopted by his predecessors. the British Prime Minister appealed to the peasantry of France, and to the in dustrialists and the workers!-:and the almost inconceivable happened. believed that the militarist government of France ran the slightest risk of defeat. It traded on the feeling for revenge and the -humbling of the Germans, demanding its pound of flesh, and it seemed as if the French people were supporting that policy right up to the hilt. Mr Ramsay MacDonald put forward a new proposition to bring about the peace of Europe, and his appeal went over the heads of the politicians and sank into the hearts of the men and women of France. the elections were held,, the militarist class was defeated, and conditions are now much better in Europe than ever before. those European countries are building battleships or increasing armaments, but because a new atmosphere has been created almost throughout the world. General Sir Granville Ryrie said: "" You cannot change human nature."" That is the old Tory idea. Human nature changes according to the conditions under which people live. Our conditions are changed to-day. War is inevitable while the capitalist class controls the country. If we were seeking to exploit the mineral resources of, say China, we should certainly need to build many battleships to assist in enforcing our demands. But Great Britain, led by Ramsay MacDonald, refuses to assist the big financial institutions in their desire to rob China or any other unprotected country of its mineral resources. The party in its support of the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey""). This party's atThe Nationalists, titude on defence has been known for some considerable time. Our Leader( Mr. Charlton) has again and again declared that we w ill not participate in any war outside Australian shores. That was The warknown before the recent elections took place in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. Labour Governments have since been formed in three of those states, and even in this ToryI n France, at that State of Victoria, it is possible that tonight a Labour Premier w ill be in power. The people are tired of war and of continual defence expenditure. We should But push forward w i th social work-the cure of cancer, the relief of the unemployed, aud the building of roads to make it possible for more people No one to settle in this country. These things cannot be done while millions are being spent on battleships and the establishment of a huge military machine. It is of no use to hurl the charge at the Labour party that it is not prepared to defend Australia. We love Australia just as much as do honourable members opposite. We want to make Australia self-contained, and to build up a virile population. But while millions are being squandered on useless battleshipis that When w ill be sunk a few years after their construction, money w ill not be available to open up our vast resources and to populate Australia. In Victoria, thousands They are better, not because of returned soldiers have been placed upon the land, but no roads have been made to enable them to take their produce to",36,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading
109,Mr Mcgrath,That Government is,37,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading
110,Mr Ram,"people of Australia are with the Labourmarket. Settlers in Gippsland, during winter time, find it almost impossible to .gain access to the small towns in the district. Erom a defence point of view, it would be a much saner policy to spend millions on the construction of good roads, in order to encourage men to settle on the land. From 1915 to 1924 approximately 34,000 additional settlers were placed on the land in Victoria, yet to-day only 1,100 of those remain there. This is due, not only to land monopoly, but also to the difficult conditions under which the settlers live. The Labour party has always said that if a vigorous policy of land settlement were carried out, and railways and good roads constructed to enable produce to be taken to market, the right class of settler would ;be -attracted from abroad. Only by such means shall we build up a virile and energetic population, and have a country worth fighting for. Yeti n the twentieth century we talk about building battleships, while to-night thousands of men will not have sufficient to eat. In Ballarat there ai'e from 300 to 500 married men out of work. I ask honourable members opposite to tell me where work can be obtained. I aim in hearty accord with the amendment proposed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. I believe that there can be evolved a system of defence that will be beneficial 'to this country, but it will never emanate from this Government. Only a year or two ago the present Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), and every member of the Oountry party, was crying out for. retrenchment in the Defence Department. Every one of them voted to compel the then Prime Minister( Mr Hughes): to retrench to the extent of £1,000,000 per annum. I have no faith in any Government that talks about the defence of Australia, when it has already parted with the main essentials for defence. It was said by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr siderable time. Most of us know someWest) that it was hard to distinguish Australian privates from oflicers; because of the good material with which they were clothed. good deal of truth in that statement. For that benefit we had to thank the Geelong mills when controlled by the Commonwealth. for the defence of Australia is the provision of suitable uniforms for troops. What' hypocrisy it is to talk about defending Australia when one of the most important factors in our defence has been destroyed. Our troops at the late war were clothed better than were any other troops, our uniforms being infinitely superior to those supplied by Great Britain or any of the other dominions. A l though we were justly proud of that fact, it did not prevent the Government from disposing of the woollen mills to their friends. The Commonwealth owned a harness factory. In war time it is essential to have service and ammunition waggons drawn by horses; for which harness must be provided. Yet the means of making harness have been deliberately curtailed. Honourable members opposite advocate the construction of cruisers, not to help in Australia's defence, but to participate in any future imperialistic aggression. The Labour party is fortified by the fact that there is in England to-day a great movement to prevent imperialistic aggression. When Lloyd George almost brought about war with both Soviet Russia and Turkey, the representatives of the trade unionists assembled and told him that if the Government declared war not one man, ship, or gun would leave Great Britain's shores. That spirit is abroad in the world to-day. It is not confined to Britain, but is to be found in the hearts of many of the Japanese. There is a very strong pacifist movement in Japan. That country has not the slightest desire to embarrass Australia. It proved its loyalty to the British Empire during the five years of war, when it had every opportunity, if not to capture Australia, at least to cause us considerable trouble. Japan honorably carried out to the letter and spirit her alliance with Great Britain. To-day the Japanese have sufficient trouble in their own country to keep them occupied for a conthing of the sufferings caused by war. We should be preaching the gospel of peace, and inculcating it in the minds There is a of our children, instead of talking about spending millions of pounds upon the construction of battleships. The honourable member for Calare, in a notable One of the first essentials speech in this chamber some time ago, said that approximately one person in every eight who reached the age of 55",37,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading

Sir NEVILLEHOWSE MrM c GRATH the honourable member did not urge the spending of money upon improving the health and social conditions of our people, but £50,000,000 per annum upon instruments of destruction He described eloquently the ravages of the cancer scourge, and said that medical science has not yet been able to discover its cause, but he has not pointed a gun at the Ministry and commanded them to spend £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 in an effort to discover thc cause of cancer and its cure. twentieth century we might well spend money upon research work of that kind. Tf we love our country, and desire to make it self-contained, if we are anxious to have a healthy, vigorous population, let us spend money upon developing Australia rather than upon the construction of battleships. instruments of war to defend the country against aggression, let us manufacture them in Australia, and give an opportunity to our own people to build aeroplanes, which could be used in the commerce of the country, in carrying medical assistance to people living outback, and in giving postal services to remote areas, and 3'efc would be readily convertible into instruments of defence should the country be threatened. W h a t we could do with 'aeroplanes we could do with submarines and other instruments of warfare. But to-day, when the world is talking peace, when, thanks to the efforts of Ramsay MacDonald, the war-dogs of Europe are on the chain, we are pursuing a militarist policy and inciting other nations to become hostile towards Australia. If we let it be known that Australia does not desire to interfere i u any other nation's affairs, that we do not wish to steal land from anybody, and ask only to be allowed to develop pur country peacefully, I am satisfied that the great influence exerted by Ramsay MacDonald and the Labour party i u Europe will extend over Japan and otlier countries that some members regard as -our potential enemies. As a party, we on this side of the House are not troubled by writers like Gullett, who, in this afternoon's Herald, takes our Acting Leader( Mr Anstey) to task for the speech he delivered last night. Gullett was one of the flunkies attending Mr. Hughes when he went to FranceN o t a penny. during the war, and Paris was the No t a penny. Yet nearest they got to the war zone. Of course, those men can always see war looming, but not for themselves. Gullett did not participate as .a combatant during advocated the expenditure of the last war, although he was then a young, athletic man. He was a correspondent, and, the war being over, he is now attempting to intimidate members of the Labour party by attacking their pacifist attitude. In the late war Gullett sheltered behind William Morris Hughes when ho was in France, and then, upon his return to Australia, became one of In this his deadliest enemies. To-day Gullett is the critic of our party, but I tell him,, as I have told journalists before, that the platform can beat the press every time. We have had victories in the past, in spite of the opposition of the press. To-day our colours are nailed to the mast. We w ill not take part in any Imperialistic If we must have war; we believe that these cruisers are to be constructed only to further the cause of Imperialism. No other country over which the TJnion Jack flies is to-day 1 considering, the squandering of money upon defence. Let Australia f a l l into line with the other British Dominions. British Government's expenditure on the air defence of London? MrM c GRATH The British Government has reduced the expenditure upon military preparations. The honourable member knows something about fighting, but he knows nothing of British politics. Until the advent of Ramsay MacDonald, B ritish statesmen were concentrating upon preparations for war. There was constant discussion as to how many submarines should be built. Once again the mad race of armaments was commencing, but when Ramsay MacDonald's Government came into power, a halt was callpd. In spite of their example, the Commonwealth Government asks the House to enter Australia in another race of armaments. . If we carry out the policy enunciated by. the honourable member.for Calare( Sir Neville Howse). this country w ill be spending £50,000,000 per annum upon naval and military defence. The honourable member suggested also that instead of our lads being in camp for",38,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading

That is proved by the fate that overtook Germany, France, and the other countries of Europe that armed themselves, ostensibly for defence.

I am satisfied that, at the moment, no nation desires to attack Australia. But ours is a beautiful country, and, as we have not effectively occupied it , there is a danger that the sense of justice of some of the peoples who are being crowded out of their own countries may lead them to think that we are not entitled to hold it . I hope this Parliament will supply this country with the means of defence that international relations indicate we should have.

[ 6 . 1 ] tunity-to identify myself with the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey). several reasons. The first reason is that there is a world-wide movement in favour of the holding of another disarmament conference. The President of the United States has agreed to call such a conference, the Prime Minister of Great. Britain will co-operate with h i m, and the Japanese. Government has acceded to a request fco be represented. Australia is sending a delegation of four representatives to the Geneva Conference. The purpose of the League of Nations is to bring about international peace .and harmony, but, before our delegation has left these shores, Parliament is asked to sanction the building of two large cruisers at a cost of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000. Parliament would be acting wisely to refrain from building them unti l the result of the forthcoming conference is known. What ington Conference? of fche third class were scrapped. There was a strong difference of opinion at the conference, and there is a difference of opinion to-day among naval experts, regarding the utilit y of large battleships. It is . claimed by some fchat the day of the battleship is gone, but the next largest thing that has been built is the 10,000-ton cruiser. result of experience and the decisions of the forthcoming conference, the size -of cruisers will be reduced, in which event, we should only be wasting our money in building that type of vessel at the present time. I and the party on this side of the House stand for the defence of Australia. I shall explain to the honourable member. There is no doubt thafc members of this House stand for the defence of this country. We should nofc be worthy representatives of the people 6f Australia if we were not prepared to take steps to defend this country. There was once a belief that larger battleships meant more security, but during the great war, large battleships could not go out of port unless they were surrounded by afleet of destroyers, and accompanied by aeroplanes. If a submarine got within range, a battleship worth, £3,000,000 or (South Sydney) £4,000,000, and "" thousands of lives, I am pleased to have an oppormight, be lost. The battleship has become a very difficult and dangerous thing to handle. I do not take much notice of I do so for what naval experts say. We have brought admirals to this country to report on naval bases. They commended the F l in ders naval base and the Henderson naval base sites, and when some of us had the temerity to criticize their proposals, the Government said, "" We are acting on experts' reports."" We have found out to our sorrow, and to our cost, that both the recommendations were wrong: Millions of pounds have been wasted, because the experts -recommended something that could not be done. The advice; one gets regarding the building of a house depends on where the advice is sought. If I consult a carpenter regarding the best type of house, he w ill tell me that a wooden house is healthy, suitable, and cheap. If I speak to a bricklayer, he will tell me that I cannot get better than a brick house, happened after the Washbecause it w ill not need painting, Large battleships and wSU be more durable than wood. A bootmaker is always ready to declare that "" there is nothing like leather."" just as the naval expert says there is nothing like a strong navy, w i th plenty of big! battleships. The kind of advice received depends upon the point of view of the man who gives it . The Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) said last night It is quitefeasible that as a that the Government had secured the best expert advice. He did not say who the experts were, but he said a conference of them was held twelve months ago. Great",42,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading

In case of an outbreak of war those vessels would not remain in Australian waters but would join the British navy wherever it might be operating.

The building of these two cruisers should be delayed u n t i l after the Geneva Conference, so that advantage may be taken of any decision that may there be arrived at.

During the first two years of the war, when the Labour party was in power, we showed' beyond doubt that we were prepared to defend Australia by every possible means. It is said that the Labour party has gone slow on the question of defence; b u t it is time to go slow in view of our heavy taxation and our great national debt. Every country has gone slow in the construction of armaments. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath) stated this afternoon that since the war wherever an election has taken place the militarist class has been defeated. France maintained a large army and navy, and her people groaned under the burden. A t the last French elections the people returned a Socialist Government, whose doctrine is peace. The same thing has happened in Germany. The [88] militarist class of that country is out of office, and those who were once prominent militarists are to-day sneered at in .the streets! and treated by the populace with contempt. The people of Great Britain, when the opportunity arose, turned Lloyd George, with all his pomp, pride, and show, out of office so that the Labour party might control the destinies of that country. The Labour movement has extended throughout Australia. To-day Labour governments are in power in South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, and, lastly, Victoria. It is a world-wide movement, with high aud lofty ideals. Peace on earth and good I do not say so. I will towards men is the spirit permeating the nations of the world. Japan has in dicated to the President of the United States of America that it is willing to participate in a conference to consider the question of further disarmament. spending £30,000,000 dn defence.

Camerpn) speak during this debate. He, with the honourable member for Calare( Sir Neville Howse), represented Australia at the last conference of the League of Nations. I confidently expected that both of those honourable members would be opposed to any further increase in our armaments, but I learn with regret that it is their intention to support the Government.

Honourable members opposite have invited Government supporters to give a lead to this House on the question of the defence of Australia. In my own modest way, I shall attempt to meet that request. I listened, with a great deal of interest and at times amazement, to the speeches from both sides concerning the various phases of defence. The amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, and supported by the Labour party, says in effect that the time is not do for the development of our country ripe to provide Australia with an ' adequate system of defence. That is an old cry frequently used by the members of the Opposition. "" They refuse to assist in replacing our obsolete cruisers by modern vessels, and prefer to rely on the decisions of the assembly of the League of Nations, which is only in its infancy. They ask the Government to anticipate a . recommendation that the naval armaments of all the nations shall be still further reduced. With one exception, honourable members opposite refrained from making a definite statement outlining the Labour party's defence policy. The honourable member although I expected something better from him, merely asked the Government to delay its proposals until the Labour party obtained office, and then they would put before Parliament a defence policy which would have the support of the people. Probably that will not occur for very many years. In the meantime nothing is to be done. The We have an up-to-date Labour party intends to ask the people of Australia at the next elections to put it in office on the strength of an indefinite policy of defence. The only member of the Opposition who made a definite statement was the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr McGrath).

His speech really confirmed the press report of his remarks at Ballarat some time ago. not hear the honourable member for Ballarat make such a statement. of what he actually said.

167,"Relations Of America And Of Reputation, Mr Mcgoverna Man","maiwEuvres, for scouting purposes, simply because we bail nothing else. When destroyers are used for scouting purposes they are overworked. They have to run long distances, often at high speed. They cannot send back word because their wireless apparatus is not powerful enough, and if thoy run into a lieavy sea, their speed is cut down. They use up their fuel, and tliey exhaust the crew, and the consequence is that when they gain touch with the enemy the destroyers are not fit to do anytliing against him. They should be conserved to the last moment, when they are called upon to strike. Thcy should not bo occupied in chasing all over the ocean, looking for something with a view of getting together later, and then making a combined torpedo attack. Nothing can be called a scout which has a speed below 25 knots, and a real scout of to-day should have 30 knots. If we accept that opinion as correct, we are forced to admit that, so far as Australia is concerned, we have uot one scout vessel at present. I am glad, however, fchat the nucleus vessel which the Government intends to obtain will be one capable of doing effective scouting work. So far, the Government has announced its intention of obtaining one cruiser. A second has been foreshadowed, but no definite announcement has been made, other than that the Government is looking into the matter from every angle. Personally, I hope that it w ill be possible for the second cruiser to be constructed in Australia. member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) said regarding Cockatoo Island, I am of the opinion that for a big shipbuilding programme Cockatoo Island dockyard is totally unsuitable. It is incapable of expansion' because ifc is an island, and for the same reason it cannot have r a i l communication. A t other places along the coast of New South Wales-Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay, or Port Stephens-shipbuild ing work could be undertaken, while Cockatoo Island coxild be used as a dry dock, as at present, for vessels of certain sizes, but more particularly for repair work. Should we decide to construct our own vessels, we should, as mentioned by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr. Watkins), make provision for the defenoe of the shipbuilding yards against attack, both from the land and from the sea. The defence from attack by water should be suflicient to cope with above-water ancl under-water vessels. Submarines in the Pacific Ocean are in quite a different position from submarines in the late war on the other side of the world, where the water was more shallow-so shallow, in deed, that submarines were able to lie on the bottom of the ocean for some consider able time. D u r in g that time their engines were not used. In the continuous warfare between the submarines and the vessels which were endeavouring to destroy them, the odds, even in shallow water, were against the submarines. In the Pacific, where, on account of the enormous depth of water, submarines cannot lie on the bottom-and , therefore, have to keep their engines running while submerged the device known as the hydrophone, which detects the presence of submarines by sound, would be very effectual. B y means of the hydrophone, a submerged vessel cau be detected, and its course followed, so fchat when it rises to the surface after being submerged for about 100 miles, it can be effectively dealt with. Japan has realized fche impracticability of submarines resting on the ocean bed in the deep waters of the Pacific, and her under-water vessels are constructed to meet the altered conditions. Although we do not know very much about the in tricacies of their construction, it is known that tjhey are strutted and strengthened very much more than our own vessels. Probably the unfortunate occurrence in Despite what the honourable connection withone of our submarines at the beginning of the war was due to in sufficient provision being made for the depth of water' in which it moved. A proper naval defence policy would not be complete without some units of a submarine fleet. Attention was drawn to the subject of land defence by the honourable member for Newcastle. Let us suppose that we mount highaugle 16-inch or 14-inch guns w i th a range up to about 45,000 yards. That range would be at least 10,000 yards longer than the range of any guns mounted on shipboard. Further, guns mounted on shore are on a firm, uusinkable platform, and can be protected with concrete and armour casing, 'so as to make them almost indestructible. They also have means for accurate range-finding. On the other hand, vessels at sea are unstable, cannot be so protected, and cannofc attain the same accuracy in range-finding and firing. In a battle between the two, the odds are always on the guns on shore. I was very sorry to hear this afternoon that the extra guns made for the Australia, but not used on the vessel, -were sunk with her. very carefully, and saw nothing in it stipulating that spare guns that had not been mouuted should be scrapped with the vessel. She had her own guns on board, and it was not necessary to sink ihe extra guns. They could have been used for land defence. quite useless for that purpose. made this afternoon that they had to be scrapped in accordance with the terms of the Washington Treaty. That was not so. It is, perhaps, too late to enter a protest when the guns are at the bottom of the ocean. raised in this House, the honourable member supported the Government. the matter before. Another means of defence that I have not yet touched upon is aircraft. Aircraft and the navy are complementary. It is necessary that we should take steps to keep hostile aircraft carriers at a considerable distance from our shores, so as to prevent aeroplanes making bombing raids and doing serious damage whereverthey choose to do it. Newcastle, portions of the city of Melbourne, and many big industrial centres, could be bombed by aeroplanes from aircraft carriers that had been brought close to our shores. Modern aircraft carriers are over 40,000 tons. The Washington Treaty limits their armament to 8-inch guns, which are also allowed on 10,000-ton cruisers. We need vessels to compete with aircraftcarriers on at least equal terms. A smaller vessel with the same armament is considered to have a somewhat better chance against a larger vessel on account of the smaller target it offers. Eor that reason alone, the 10,000-ton cruisers will be of material value in assisting the naval air force. Marvellous results have been obtained with aeroplanes in other countries. United States navy carried out a trial of a fleet of six flying-boats. Honourable MrA m e r y : members will notice, from the following figures, how valuable that test was:Total number of nights, all machines, 495. Average length of each flight, 2 hours 25 minutes. Flights in passage, 8,210 nautical miles. I read the Washington Treaty Other flights incidental to fleet operations, scouting, and observing for gunfire, 4,521 nautical miles. Total distance flown by the squadron as a whole, 12,731 nautical miles. Total mileage of all machines, 71,545 nautical miles. Total hours flown, 1,102 hours 25 minutes. Fatalities or serious injuries, during Hying operations, none. The result of the test shows what we could do if we made similar provision. . 1 am sorry that the Government has not taken any active steps to encourage civil aviation, as distinct from service aviation. In 1918, civilian aviation in Japan was almost unknown, but two years afterwards there were in that country, apart from the army and navy services, three large flying associations with a membership of over 14,000. Japan has realized the necessity for this arm of defence, and many people in Australia have also realized it. I hope that when the Government briug3 down its defence proposals it will make adequate provision, not only for land machines, but also for machines of the type used in the epochmaking flight round Australia by Wing-Commander Goble and FlightLieutenant Mclntyre. I should like to see provision made for every vessel built for the Australian N.avy to carry aeroplanes. An American warship recently came into Sydney Harbour, and although it was very small, it carried an efficient flying boat, which it could use at any time. A flying boat would be a distinct advantage to such a vessel when scouting for hostile vessels. Members of the Opposition cheered recently when they learned that the proposal to build a base at Singapore had been abandoned. They considered that it had nothing to do with Australia, but concerned only the I m perial Government. With that view I entirely disagree. It was stated that the decision not to proceed with the Singapore naval base proposal was a "" gesture "" by the British Government to foreign nations. In that connection I In November, 1919, the draw attention to the following statement made in the House of Commons by The turning down of Singapore Base means that we say to the Dominions : "" In the hour of danger we are no longer prepared to help you; we deny ourselves access to your aid.

The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Eiley) applauded the action of the Bamsay MacDonald Government as something to be proud of. It was an action of sickly internationalism. The British Government made a gesture te foreign nations while saying to us, who are part of the Empire, "" You can go hang. A gesture is not required for you."" If the British Government wanted to make a gesture, it could better have made one that would recognize the vital importance of Singapore to us. opponents of the Australian Navy to consider what it has done for Australia. It did great things in the recent war. It helped to convoy our troops; it took part in actions on this and the other side of the world, and acquitted itself honorably in everything it did. Some people may be liable to forget what the Sydney did. I ask them, ""Are you going to let that famous vessel sink into oblivion, or will you make an effort to have her replaced by a modern and efficient vessel? Will you send our men, if they again have to go to sea to fight, to be murdered in a vessel that will give them no -chance, whatever bravery they may show 1"" If honourable members opposite -stand for the murder of our naval crews they should say so, and we should then know exactly where they stand. Up to the present they have talked with many voices. Each speaker has added something to the debate, but if the Hansard reports of their speeches were winnowed the only outstanding feature would be the statement of the honourable member we will have no defence whatever."" That is what it amounted to. Did the Sydney build up a great tradition for the Australian Navy simply for it to be destroyed? must realize how much tradition means in morale and esprit de corps. The Labour party has not acquitted itself at all well in this debate. I listened most carefully to the speech of the Acting Leader of the Opposition, and all that I can say is that every circus needs two funny men, -one a clown and the other a dummy. Noi o dy would accuse the Acting Leader of 4;he Opposition of possessing, qualifications for the latter position. I am glad that the Government has signified its intention of doing something concrete for the defence of Australia, and I trust that when the general defence estimates are placed before the House they will provide for a properly thought-out and adequate scheme, as opposed to the nebulous proposals which have been made by honourable members who occupy the benches opposite. had a few ideas on this subject when the honourable member for Richmond began I ask to speak, but they have now almost entirely disappeared. The honourable member unkindly accused my party, and myself inferentially, of approaching this matter with an iron band around our heads. Let me assure him at once that I have employed no such uncomfortable device. I feel, indeed, that such a thing would be more becoming to those who, like the honourable gentleman, evidently suffer from swelled head. Two things emerge from the honourable member's all too erudite speech. One is that he has not read the bill, and the other . is that he has not read the amendment. It is also evident-and this is a matter of some importance-that , though he may have heard, he did not understand, the speech of the honourable do not know for certain whether the honourable member has ever heard of the President of the United States of America, though I must presume that he is aware of the existence of the States themselves, but he gave some indication, in the concluding part of his address, of having heard of the Washington conference. I acquit him, however, of having any more knowledge of what that conference meant or of what it did than I have of what he meant during the greater part of his Honourable members speech. I do not intend to approach this subject as he did, with the cocksureness of an honorary admiral and a brigadiergeneral out of work. I approach it as an ordinary citizen who would feel his position with exceeding keenness if he found himself confronted with the point of a bayonet.

Before patriot and I develop my general argument upon the memdefence of Australia, I ask honourable invited members opposite, if Australia cannot make provision for her own defence, what they propose to do in the case of certain eventualities arising. The honourable member for Calare said this afternoon that one of the greatest questions that could engage the attention of any people was the preservation of the purity of the race. When that contention is applied to Australia, it means the upholding of a doctrine dear to the heart of all Australians-the White Australia doctrine. able gentleman ( Mr Hughes) who preceded the present Prime Ministeri n office declare-and I think I may safely use these words-that Australia would be prepared to shed her last drop of blood in defence of the principle of a White Australia. I share his regard for that p r in ciple, but not his methods. If the maintenance of a White Australia ever brought about a position involving bloodshed, to whom would honourable gentlemen opposite look for help in defending the prin ciple? I challenge the most optimistic of them to say that the British Government, or any British political party, would bs prepared to attempt to enlist a naval or military force in Great Britain to fight for Australia on the issue of a White Australia. If we have to fight for the principle-and God forbid that it should ever be so-w e shall have to fight on our own, and the more quickly we realize it the better. British Government, for which I have a superabundant respect, under leadership for which it would be impossible to have greater regard than I have for it , would not take up arms in defence of a White Liberal Governmeut of Great Britain. There may possibly be a few tories in Great Britain who would advocate war for such a purpose, or any purpose, but they are to-day in a hopeless minority. Honourable members may take it as settled beyond the possibility of argument that if we should ever have to defend by force of arms this principle which we consider vital, it must be done by Australia alono in the best way she can do it . I venture to think there is no member on the other side of the House who is so little informed of the facts as to argue against the truth of that proposition. Houorable members may have noticed that on much smaller issues, when the interests of GreatB r i tain have been seemingly opposed to those of Australia, GreatB r it a in has had a pleasant habit of going her own way I do not blame her at all for that. The construction of the Singapore base, the Prime Minister represented as being vital to Australia-though , of course, it was not vital to this country at a l l . In respect to it the right honourable gentleman misrepresented the Australian people, but he did. successfully convey to the people of Great Britain the opinion that the I have heard the right honorpeople of Australia were heart and soul in favour of the establishment of the Singapore base. It was nofc true, but that is the impression the honourable gentleman created in the mind of the British public. In spite of that, when fche matter came up for consideration in the Britisli House of Commons, the statesmen there declared that their first consideration was what was best in the interests of Britain, best in.the interests of peace and best generally, and not what was best from the view-point of Australia. They took that stand, and very properly so, and they decided against what they thought was the overwhelming Australian public opinion in regard to the establishment of the Singapore base. _ It happens that they did something which I entirely applaud, and which I believe two-thirds 'of the people of Australia, also applaud, but thafc was accidental, because, so far as they knew, they were Unquestionably, the present running counter to the strongly-expressed desires, of the Australian people. Wheni t was only a question of preference for our dried currants and figs, the British Parliament took its own course. It came to a decision which it was Australia, nor would any thought was in the best interests of the people of Britain. It recognized that we in Australia have the right""to frame our own tariff, that we enjoy autonomy, and are entitled to make our own laws, firstly in the: interests cf our own people. In a word, the Labour party and the Liberal party of Great Britain set us an example in this regard which we might well follow. They have made a public declaration that as members of the British Parliament their first duty is to their own country. They recognize as paramount the needs of the people entrusted to them, for whom they make laws, and for whom they are responsible. I recommend that spirit to honourable members opposite. I recommend these non-combatant m i l i tarists ' to drop their pusillanimous policy and recognize that they are Australians. They should make up their minds once and for all, if they are imperialists-and I do not object to them being so-that they are trustees in the first place for this country. The job that beings, and propose to spend £4,000,000 has beeu given to them is to legislate for shortly, and, I understand, £2,000,000 this country and its people, and they should cease their craven policy of toadycalled "" replacement."" We are to have ing to people on the other side of the world. Who are the gentlemen who say that we cannot defend ourselves? They are not members of the Labour party. They are not pacifists like the honourable myself. that we cannot do> these things are men of the clanging sword and the clicking spurs, men whose patriotism exudes from them in the naval and military clubs of this country as though it were sweat exuding from their bodies. They are the swanking militarists who trade on the game, but who, when it comes to the defence of their homes and hearths, spread it abroad to the world that, though we are a nation, and a proud nation, we cannot defend ourselves. I would advise them., and I would advise the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green), the honorary admiral brigadier-general out of work, to refresh their knowledge of the world's history. Let them go back, if necessary, a cycle of centuries, to the time when Leonidas took his stand against the Persian hosts with his 300. He did not say, "" We cannot defend ourselves."" them of the Spartan mother who sent her son to war with the injunction, "" Return, my son, with this shield, or upon it."" I advise them to put lime into their spines, and make up their mind's that we shall defend Australia in our own time and when danger arises; which is not yet. The Government, which lacks many things that it ought to have, lacks, among other things, the saving gift of humour. It is only a few weeks ago that we were celebrating in the most picturesque way the sinking of our great historic battleship AustraUa. gone. It was a great event. not sink the Australia secretly. We did not do it in tears, such as we might have shed for the loss of so good a friend, but we did it as part of a militarist and naval display. we are told, to comply with the Jfr. Brennan. requirements of the Washington conference. Having gloried in that deed, today we meet in Parliament as responsible immediately, on what is euphemistically two new' cruisers. The Australia goes down, the cruisers bob up. Next year the cruisers may go down, and something else will bob up. In this way the nation progresses, and we patriots defend Australia ! I am wrong. We do not defend No; the gentlemen who say Australia-because , according to honourable gentlemen opposite, that is the one thing we cannot do. The Prime Minister said-wit h exquisite humour for once-it is beginning to be generally recognized that the advantages of tha Washington conference have"" been "" a little exaggerated."" What did these gentlemen opposite do to make the Washington conference a success? Were they favorable to countries such as Russia and Germany being represented at thab conference? Not at all. The time, to use the words of the honourable member for Richmond, ""was not ripe."" It was too soon for peace. It was too soon for complete disarmament. It was and the retired time only for a pleasing interchange of views between those whose interests were 1 similar, and who came to a compact to keep a sharp eye on each other. If one sank a ship, the other should also sink a ship, until they reached a certain stage, when they would be equally competent to Let me remind fight the other, although the armaments of each had been satisfactorily reduced, in the interests of peace! In order to bring about peace, men must approach the subject with the intention to create peace. There must be an atmosphere of peace. My fight is confined to honourable gentlemen opposite. I am in favour of peace, and I consider it would be a real peace gesture if we could get rid of honourable gentlemen opposite. It has been said by them, in the press and elsewhere, that we must do something practical for defenoe. When one speaks of conShe has ciliation, they say he is an idealist and a We did dreamer, who is entertaining the sickly sentiment of internationalism. But, as I have just shown, when it comes to the defence of Australia, conciliation is our strongest arm. Yet the last thing that We sank her, so honourable members opposite will do is to adopt the despised policy of conciliation.",55,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading
175,Member For Ballarat ( Mr Mcgrath) And,"Human nature, says the Prime Minister, has not changed. He accepts that as an axiom, as a basic principle about which there can he no argument. Upon that he supports his demand for naval defence upon the lines of which he approves. Some things in human nature have not changed, but other things are the subject of constant change. Our animal nature does not change. We feed, we breed, and we fulfil animal functions much as other animals do. Buti f , as the honourable last night, that is the end of man's existence, then indeed man was born in vain. I say that there is something higher and better. There are ideals in this world that are worth serving. Prime Minister assumes that human nature"" is a static quantity which does not move or change, he gives away the whole case for the reformation, and regeneration of the world. duty as a leader of men to strive after better things than we have at present or have existed in the past. Had the great reformers of the world sat down,, as he sits at this table, and weakly declared that human nature cannot change, what would have been the result? Where would have been the great reforms that have taken place if that had been, their view of humanity? What would have been the value of the inspiration of the greatest artists of the world? What would have' been the worth of the great litterateurs who have done so much to inform human nature and inspire the world with the hope and ambition for better things? It is false reasoning to say that human nature does not change. It is begging the question, because if the honourable gentleman owes any responsibility to this country, wherein he occupies the highest position in the gift of the Deople, it is his bounden duty, so far from declaring that human nature does not change, to strive constantly to mould and change human nature so as to bring about better conditions than we have in our time, or have existed in the centuries that have passed. Human nature does constantly change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. There are those who serve ideals, and there are the materialists who serve the flesh. There are those who serve ihe god Mammon, and those who serve the god Moloch. There are those who serve at once Mammon and Moloch. The worse of these are the militarists, who have been responsible for the bloody pages of history that record wars and all that war means. In time of peace these war-makers are pacifists, too. I have heard them oft times say, ""We hate war as honourable members opposite hate war; we want peace as you want peace; we do not believe in war."" ""But,"" they say-ther e is always a "" but "" in the case"" let us grind the axe, and make a gesture of war in the interests of peace."" That is the policy of honourable members opposite. Let somebody only beat the war drum anywhere, and for any cause or no cause, When the whether we are concerned or not, and these protagonists of peace are ready to follow 'the call at a moment's notice with scarcely a preliminary inquiry whether He abandons his the cause is just or unjust, whether it is worth fighting for or not, whether it serves Australian interests or is totally and absolutely against them. The history of the last decade has proved that declaration to be absolutely correct. Let me suggest a single test. The world had scarcely emerged from the shambles of four and a half years of dreadful war when the then Prime Miuister( Mr Hughes) rose in this House to declare that he had exchanged with the Prime Minister of Great Britain( Mr Lloyd George) messages committing Australia to a new war. Where were these pacifists then? Did one of them rise in protest? Was any one heard to declare, "" No."" We must examine the position. Does the cause justify Australia in again unsheathing the sword ? It certainly did not. She had too recently buried her 60,000 dead, and welcomed back her 400,000 soldiers, many of them maimed and wounded. Australia had seen too many desolated hearths and homes. Yet not one member opposite rose in his place to utter a single word against a repetition of the work of slaughter. Are they to be taken at their word, therefore, when, they say that they stand with us for peace, that they believe in peace as much as we do, ancl hate war as we do? "" B y their fruits ye shall know them""; by their works we shall justly judge them. History has recorded their work. It takes shape beneath the soil in the bones",58,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading
176,Member For Wannon ( Mr Mcneill) Said,"of Australia's precious dead; upon the ground, in those who have been maimed and wounded; and in the desolate homes of fhe widows and fatherless. An honorablo member who from his place in this House, or on the platform or elsewhere, lightly advocates a new war without first gaining any information or assuming any responsibility as to its merits or demerits, and simply because some warmaker on the other side of the world has rattled the sabre again, is as recreant to his trust as though he were actually to place a bomb uuder Parliament House, or any otlier public building, to blow it up and destroy the occupants. I make no distinction between the two classes of incendiarism. The man who would blow up a public building in Melbourne would have less responsibility for his action than an incendiarist of the kind who would set nation against nation without exercising the braiu which God has given him, and the sense of responsibility that is his to learn whether such a dreadful course could not be avoided or prevented. On this question there is an illustration of the wide chasm separating honourable members opposite from those on this side of the House on the question of peace and war. Where each man stands is shown, not by words, but by deeds; by vvhat we do when the critical moment arrives. youths, under the odious name of conscription, and force them out of the country into a war on the other side of the world, are not with us but against us, are not with Australia but against her. Do not talk to> me of the traitors on this side of the House; of the men who lack patriotism and loyalty! Loyalty is worth nothing unless it is loyalty to principle, andbacked by courage, and moral courage is greater than physical courage. rests on principle and can rightly be attributed to the man who does not heed the flaniboyancy of the press, public, or profiteer, but anatyses the issue to the best of his ability, in scorn of consequences. That is my idea of loyalty and patriotism. I may be asked-and justly -wha t is my policy. Such things have been asked of public men on the platform . the honourable member's Mr Brennan. of the Minister-raisins , dried plums, and office. I am not required at thisstage, especially during the discussion of the nebulous and spectacular proposal before the House-indeed , I am not authorized by my own party-to enunciate a policy of defence for Australia, and I do not intend to do so. But I propose, in a few words, to clear the ground for the foundations of defence. We propose to abolish what is known as compulsory military training. Curiously enough, that is tlie basis of our policy of defence. To make men value the g if t of freedom, they must enjoy freedom; to train youths to value the inestimable boon of liberty, they must enjoy liberty. To make men feel that a country is worth defending, they must have beeu treated fairly and honestly within their own boundaries. We are satisfied that to breed such men in Australia the shackles of compulsory training must be taken from our youthsThe odious policy of conscription, which the manhood of Australia rejected, must not bo fastened upon the helpless youth of this country. Therefore, the very basis of a policy for Australia's defence,, as far as the Labour party is concerned, is the freeing of the youth of Australia so thafc they may know the value of liberty, and at the last resort be willing Those who seize Australia's to fight for it . That would be my first move. My second move in clearing the ground for a policy of defence for Australia would be the establishment of a penal code, a kind of criminal law, applying to those who make provocative speeches and writings inflaming other nations against ourselves. AlthoughI am a great believer in the freedom of the press and of the individual, I recognize that there are some limits necessary to human freedom. The youth of Australia Moral courage -must not be corrupted by pernicious literature or exposed to fche variety of daugers that beset young meu in every civilized community. A great many repressive measures have to be taken in any civilized society within the limits of liberty in order to protect that society from itself and from its disorderly members. In that spirit I should be prepared to condemn to six months in gaolI am nofc particular about the term-thos e persons who, in this House or out of it , make think we all know speeches calculated to provoke our sister policy. nation, Japan, against us.

The honourable member for Macquarie (Mt. Manning), some week or two ago, made a most provocative speech, calculated, if it had any influence at all, to -drive Japan into active belligerency against us. Indeed, I am almost ashamed to be associated with a fellow-Australian, or with any member of this House, who says that he almost rejoices in the fact that he has not been blessed, as a father, to aid in multiplying the Australian people, because of the fear in his bosom t h a t at some future time the Japanese geisha girl and others of that Oriental race will predominate in a country in which our children and grandchildren may be born. I know of no more recreant sentiment to utter than that a man in his own -country rejoices i u the fact that he is not a father of part of the Australian race."" A great deal of that speech was designed to provoke Japan against us. A great deal of what the honourable, member for Richmond said this afternoon was couched in similar terms, and I have heard the same sentiments employed by many honourable members on that side of the House. I would make their expression a penal offence. Japan is well disposed towards us. of conciliation and understanding, and by an exchange of visits by representative men, we could do a great deal to create an ever-increasing good feeling between the two nations. For my best of good feeling sister nation I loyalty to the executed so concerned. ever, notwithstanding what may have been uttered by individuals in the way of criticism, to entertain feelings other than that of the warmest friendship towards the Japanese people. It w i ll be time enough to entertain other feelings when they have been provoked by some hostile act, which I for one do not anticipate. That would be the second arm of my defence, and for the third and I should take this not least important arm I would adopt the policy enunciated by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey), who In my opinion spoke in this chamber yesterday in a most admirable manner of what could be done within. Australia on lines at once industrial and defensive. As the honourable pointed out, instead of closing down the Commonwealth's useful clothing and harness factories, which could be used alike in times of peace and war, they should have been continued and developed in the interests of Australia and defence. We may, it is true, have to establish armouries .and manufactories of warlike weapons. If we do, such factories can be employed also for pacific purposes and for the promotion of industry. It has been well pointed out that aircraft has pacific as well as warlike uses. I would be prepared to support those who would develop Australian defence on those sound lines, always keeping in mind that we must not be embroiled in wars on the other side of the world, concerning the causes and objects of which we have no knowledge; that we must shear down the injurious spirit of Imperialism and create, instead, a sane sense Of Australianism. We must realize that our first duty is to .look after our own country, and not to involve our people in troubles across the seas. We must create a sane Australian sentiment-no t the flamboyant I believe that by a policy sentiment of "" Australia right or wrong,"" but a truly patriotic sentiment of "" Australia for the Australians, and good-will towards the world."" Our defence must bp not a mere matter of naval and military armaments, but organization for depart I have nothing but the fensive and not aggressive purposes, and, towards this above all, a systematic peace propaganda. acknowledge her I should be very glad to co-operate with bond which she experts who would work out defence upon far as Australia is those lines.

I should not like to go to the fruit-growers in my district in time of war and tell them that they should store their fruit until the war was over. AndI certainly should not expect to find them agreeable to such a course of action. Moreover, it would be humiliating to me as an Australian to taie up the standI speak for myselfthat, so far as Australia is concerned, each of her war vessels, as it becomes obsolete, should pass out and not be replaced.

I have stated iu my own way my own views regarding this matter. During my last election campaign I attacked milituism even more strongly than I have done in this House to-night. On a number of occasions I was asked by interjectors, "" If you are against militarism, do you believe in the defence of Australia ?"" I said, "" Yes,"" as I have said to-night. are you going to do?"" and I answered, ""Provide warships and aeroplanes."" made those promises, believing that I ' could do so within the platform I had signed.

My choice is between voting against a party decision and breaking my promises made on the hustings. The latter I am not prepared to do. Throughout my parliamentary career, I have endeavoured to honour my promises to the electors, and I intend to honour them in the future. If the time should arrive when I cannot honour them, I shall go back to the private life from which I came. In this bill we have the first definite proposal which has been brought before this Parliament for naval defence. It provides for the building of a cruiser <to replace one of two now becoming obsolete. When the vote on the second reading is taken, my vote will be cast in its favour. the amendment moved by your leader? presently.

200,Mr Gabb,"I remind the honorablemeeting of the League of Nations, I not go so f a r as the honorahle member for Warringah ( Sir Granville E y r i e) and say that human nature has never changed, but I am afrai d any change is coming very slowly. I do not believe that the people of Europe have changed very much since 1914. Therefore, I am forced to the-conclusion that nothing is to be gained hy deferring the construction of the cruisers. I remember that the money was made available for this work twelve months ago, but in view of the approaching Imperial Conference it was thought advisable to hold our hand. The Imperial Conference has since met, and as the money has been appropriated for the purpose of building the cruiser, I am faced w i th the position that, for the reasons given, I must vote against the amendment and for the bill, which provides for the building of a cruiser to replace vessels that are becoming obsolete. MrE . GREEN orable member's pluck. to vote against my party. A man in my position is liable to be misunderstood, but I am confident that in the stand I am taking I am w it h in my rights as a member of the Labour party. MrE . GBEEN -The honourable member has proved that he is not a marionette, at all events. party has never yet definitely laid it down that there is to be no naval defence of Australia, and if I understand and interpret the feeling of the Labour movement as a whole, I do not thinkI may be wrong-that in its interpretation of a defence policy of Australia it w ill eliminate naval vessels in every shape or form In the past, I have always boasted that outside the platform which I have signed I am a free man. I know that some honourable members opposite think differently; but I have always made it my boast, on every occasion when this subject has been brought up, that outside the platform which I have signed I am free to vote and decide for myself in Parliament. I propose to do so on the present occasion. honourable members opposite like to be free? [89] am somewhat pessimistic. I do ber for Hume would like to be as game as the: honourable member for Angas. recordthrough H is crucifixion! point is that Christ went through His crucifixion for a very good cause. His crucifixion because He was against the established church and the established civil power of His time.

In its financial and. taxation proposals I find the following: Naval and military expenditure to be I appreciate the honallotted, from the proceeds of direct taxation. It is distasteful to me That brings me to the question of how the money will be provided for building this cruiser. It w ill come out of the Consolidated Revenue, which has been obtained from taxation. No one can decide, however, whether this money from the Consolidated Revenue represents direct or indirect taxation; it may represent either. But, if I interpret the plank in the platform correctly, I repeat that the Labouri t means that provision for defenco shall not be made out of loan money. If the Government had come down with a proposal to build the cruisers out of loan money, there is no doubt what my attitude would be. Such a proposal would be contrary to the platform I have signed, and I would vote against it . NowI pass to a consideration of the defence proposals of the Labour party. family matter ? ber does not see eye to eye ' with his party, there is always a danger that the remarks of the honourable member are in order. proposals relating to the defence of Australia, and I am placing on record the defence proposals of the party to which",64,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading

They are as f o l l o w :Amendment of Defence Act to secure(a) Deletion of all clauses relating to compulsory traming and service. (6) Abolition of trial -i>y court martial where civil courts are available; any sentence imposed by court martial to be subject to review by a civil court.

Punishment of Ministers and other persons responsible for breach of this provision. (fc) Citizens, on completion of training, to retain arms delivered to them during training.

The honourable any future overseas war, except hy a decision of the people. I signed that platform, and I do not wish to withdraw or retract one of the proposals in it . My contention is that there is nothing in any of them that distinctly says, or even implies, that I shall be acting contrary to the spirit of them when I vote for a bill to make provision for the building of cruisers to replace vessels that have become obsolete. I am prepared to submit that question to the decision of any unbiased tribunal. that any judge would take the view that there is nothing either in the letter or the spirit of the platform of the Labour party, as laid down up to the present moment, that in any way convicts me of breaking my pledge to my party when i vote for building a cruiser cut of money taken from revenue. The pledge that I have signed reads I hereby pledge myself not to oppose the course being followed. candidates elected by the recognized political said, and what I labour organization, and, if elected Mr Gabb. ber is not in order. I am not concerned with the defenoe proposals of the Labour party. It is the defence proposals in this bill that are before the House. The honourable member has had very great l a t i tude. Speaker, for the latitude you have given, me, and I do .not intend to f a l l out witht you. You are in the saddle, and I am. not, so it would not be wise of me to contest the point with you. I content m y self with saying that my voting for the bill cannot be construed as a breaking of the pledge that I signed before I stood for election. I have always contended, and still contend, t h a t I 'am a. free man, outside the platform I have signed, to vote in this Parliament as I think right, aaid, believing that, I am. taking my stand in support of the bill.. During this debate, some honourable members have said that the Labour party does not desire the Australian Navy to cooperate with the British fleet. I do not know where those honourable members obtained their information, for I am confident that no conference of the Labour party has at any time said that -the Australian Labour partyintends to dissociate itself from the policy of co-operation with the British fleet for the defence of Australia.. I do not think that the Labour party w ill member for Batman( Mr Brennan)' took honourable members opposite to task because some of them had stressed the fact that to a laTge extent we are dependent upon the British navy. T h a t cannot be denied. I am, however, satisfied that the British navy would be employed for the protection of Australia even if we were foolish enough to adopt such an attitude, because in Australiasufficient British capital is invested 1 I am certain to make it absolutely certain that the naval power of Great Britainwould be used to prevent securities, passing into other hands. If it should happen that for the defence of Australia it was necessary for Australian cruisers to co-operate w i th theBritish navy, and to go outside territorial waters, I believe the Labour party would not object to such a What we have now wish to-",65,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading

Another member of the commission will be chosen from six names which the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League will submit to the Government as its nominee on the commission. [10.59] -Fo r many weeks I have been endeavouring to ' arrange for an inquiry to be held on behalf of a number of nurses. The Government evidently thought that an inquiry was necessary. The facts are that a number of nurses in the Darwin Hospital, who have long war service to their credit, have heen accused of immorality and addiction to drugs. A board was constituted to investigate the charges, but owing to some informality in its appointment it was unable to, do so. The Minister for Home and Territories then requested Judge Herbert to report upon the matter, but he was on holidays, and evidently did not -wish to associate himself with it. It is highly important, however, that these .girls should be given an opportunity to vindicate their character, for unless they can do so they may find themselves unable to obtain an engagement anywhere in Australia, and their future will be anything but bright. I had been promised that the Government would reach a decision on the matter by to-day, and I have been informed from Darwin that its decision is to terminate the services of both the accused and the accuser. I submit that that is not a fair decision. The girls are entitled to more consideration than that, and their services should not be terminated in this unjust and peremptory manner. Unless they cai> prove that the allegations made against them are unfounded their future in their profession is blasted. In these circumstances I trust that the Minister will withdraw the instruction for the termination of their engagement and grant an inquirv. dent of the Executive Council) [11.4].
