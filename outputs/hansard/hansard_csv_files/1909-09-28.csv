As the honourable member said, our powers in this regard are so limited as to be almost non-existent. There is the authority of public opinion. Should an opportunity arise in which our assistance can be given, it will be most cheerfully and willingly tendered. Government supervision over aboriginal stations? If not, will the honourable gentleman appeal to the State Governments to stop such' practices as the whipping of women by .men, whether the victims be coloured people or others? the fact's referred to has already assisted to form public opinion on the subject. This may prove little less potent than a law, operating without a formal communication from the Government, which might be misinterpreted. the Attorney-Generali f he has seen a report published in the newspapers to the effect that the Newcastle Coal Vend refused a cargo of coal to a vessel called the ""Laura, on the ground that the ship was not on the list of vessels authorized to be loaded by collieries connected with the vend, and because the vessel, is new to the trade? Is he aware also that the owner of the Laura is reported to have stated that he was informed by the manager of the Hilton Colliery that the supplying of the Laura with a cargo could be arranged if permission could be obtained from the Union Steam-ship Company, but not otherwise? Will he have inquiries made to ascertain whether the Newcastle Coal Vend is a combination engaged in restraint of trade, in contravention of the provisions of Part II . of the Australian Industries Preservation Act? If the provisions of the Act do not cover tha Laura incident, will he take an early opportunity to amend the Act to cover all attempts by private individuals or corporations to interfere with the free trading rights of the community? was good enough to send to me a copy I am sure that any of the newspaper paragraph to which he refers, which! I have read. The Department is at present engaged in making inquiries under the Australian Industries Preservation Acts 1906-7, with a view to putting a stop to interference with external or Inter-State trade by the action of monopolies detrimental to the public. I assure the honourable member that the Government will endeavour, by insisting on compliance with the provisions* of the law, to put an end to alleged acts such as that to which he has drawn attention.

WhatI especially desire to know is whether the Government will see that the fullest possible protection is extended to the native birds of Papua? intention of the new ordinance is to give the fullest possible protection to the birds.

41,Sir John Forrest (Swan,"Treaamendments upon, the Commonwealth B ill as framed by the Convention, and in particular suggested a limitation of the operation of the Braddon clause to ten years, though under the Commonwealth Bill as it left the Conventions, its operation was to have been permanent. able member for East Sydney and myself are the only two members of this House who were members both of the Federal Convention that framed the Constitution, and the Premiers' Conference of February, 1899. who were members of that Conference, Sir George Turner, then Premier of Victoria, has, unfortunately, retired from political life, and the other three Premiers, Sir James Dickson, Premier of Queensland, Sir Edward Braddon, Premier of Tasmania, and the Right Honourable C. C. Kingston, Premier of South Australia, have all, I regret to say, gone to the undiscovered country. portant question than that now under consideration has had the attention of this House at any time since the establishment of Federation. I think it is right, on an occasion like this, that the views on this question of those who framed the Constitution should briefly be placed before honourable members. It was thoroughly understood, when Federation was established, that the States were permanently to have a share of the Customs and Excise revenue. Those who framed the Constitution had for their object the improvement of the financial position of the States, and had not the slightest desire or intention to imat times-that there is only one people poverish them. orable member think that they intended the functions of the States to be reduced? Sir JOHN FORREST able members not to interject, because I do not intend to answer interjections. I have quite enough to do, and, as honourable members can see, I am not too well to-day. The Convention fixed the return to the States at three-quarters of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and fixed it permanently, subject), of course, to the Constitution!. No expressions such as "" for all time,"" or even "" permanently "" were used, but the effect of the proposals of the time for a permanent return to the States Convention was that this division of the revenue-three-quarter s to the States and one-quarter to the Commonwealth-wa s to be of a permanent character. Every one knows, of course, that the Premiers' Conference, without interfering with the prodon portion as between the States and the Commonwealth, limited the term of that provision to ten years, specifying that thereafter the distribution should be ""as Parliament might provide."" I think those words are important. ' They did not say that the The right honorarrangement should terminate at the end of ten years, but left it discretionary with the Federal Parliament to say whether it should continue under the same conditions or on some modified basis. We have at present almost arrived at the"" first Of the remaining four Premiers epoch-the end of the ten-year period, and I should like to show what the framers of the Constitution thought of this question. What was the bargain made by the parties -becaus e it was a bargain? Six autonomous, almost sovereign, States, of their own free will, in time of peace, without any pressure, in their own interests, came together, and formed this Union, and it is therefore most important to know what No more imwas in the minds of the framers when they made that arrangement for Federation. It is not right that we should look at the matter from the stand-point of what is in our minds at this time; but we ought to give great consideration to what was in the minds of those who made the bargain. Are we to act so as to recognise the honourable understanding then arrived a.t, or are we to take our, stand solely on the legal bond? I need not repeat the truism that this Parliament and the Parliaments of the States are agents for the same people. That is a significant fact that every one of us is inclined to overlook in Australia, and that we represent them in regard to certain matters, while the State Legislatures represent them in regard to all other matters. The people have two agencies, but both Commonwealth and State Parliaments are elected by the same I ask honorpeople. If in our arrangements the Commonwealth in carrying out its functions obtains some advantage that is detrimental to the States, or vice versa, then the same people will either have the advantage, or suffer. The late Mr Kingston, on the 12th March, 1898, at the Melbourne Convention, said, in reference to the Braddon section, or as it was afterwards termed the "" Braddon blot "" I refer to section 87 of the Constitution, which provided at that of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenueI think we are indebted to Sir Edward Bradfor having successfully carried a provision of this sort.",19,Deakin
42,Mr Mathews,"Does not the right honThat is the Braddon clausesUnless you lay down this hard and fast line, I think you will find that there will be gradual invasions by the Commonwealth on the surplus which should be payable to the States. . . . Without this amendmentthat is, the permanent Braddon clause we leave the States at the mercy of the Federation. . . . the basis of a f e r cafita distribution to come into force immediately or at some future time. Sir Frederick Holder, our late lamented Speaker, who also represented South Australia at the Convention saidI f the Federal Treasurer has not the statutory obligation upon him to make a certain return to the States, he may not make it. Hs may establish large defence organizations, 01 spend it in other ways, and then it will be said, ""Where will the States be""? States are surrendering £6,000,000 of revenue it is not an unreasonable request to have some assurance as to what the return shall be. Sir Edmund Barton, who was the leader of the Convention in 1897-8, said at the meeting in MelbourneWhileI have been against the principle of a guaranteethat was the Braddon clauseI now accept that principle as carried by the Convention. Sir William Lyne, now the honourable member for Hume in this House, who was .3 member of the Melbourne Convention, said on the 12th March, 1898, in supporting the Braddon clauseI have, on every occasion, advocated that there should be some definite return to the States provided for. I hailed with great pleasure Sir Edward .Braddon's amendment when he brought it in. It is simple and effective, arid will coina share of the Federal revenue. cide entirely with what I have advocated upon this question. ""What a falling-off was there.' 1 great political champion of the States then; the political opponent of the States now ! I myself said at the same time, on the same subjectI t is like beating the air to tell us that we (that is, the States) are to give up. our great revenue producer-the Customs-and that we are to have no guarantee whatever that any part of that money will be returned to us, although we shall each have to provide for the payment of our public debts. Sir Edmund Barton, in summing up the work of the Convention, said of the Braddon sectionI t is a fair corollary to the provision for dealing with the revenue for the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, ancl further reflection has led me to the conclusion that on the whole it will be a useful nnd beneficial provision. The present Prime Minister said of the Bill, with the Braddon clause in it as a permanent provisionA charter of liberty is enshrined in this Constitution, which is also a charter of peace, order, and good government for the whole of the peoples whom it will embrace and unite. This was the spirit of those who I am sorry we have not adopted framed the Constitution. They trusted the people of the future; they provided for a permanent return to the States which has averaged for the last three years £ 1 18s. 6d. -per capita. The amendment limiting the Braddon section to ten years gave no index that would suggest a substantial diminution of the amount to be returned. We now . propose to reduce it to jQi 5s. per capita), with a As the special provision for a number of years in the case of Western Australia. The average annual loss to the States, if the proposed agreement had been in force during the past four years, would have been £2,713,000. In. dealing with this question-the substance of which is the per capita amount of Customs and Excise revenue to be annually returned to the States, and the permanency or otherwise of that provision-it is well to consider the scheme which was formulated by an important political party at Brisbane in July, 1908. I shall, therefore, devote a little consideration to that scheme. My excuse for so doing is my anticipation that the chief opposition to the Government proposals will emanate from honourable members opposite. The basis of that scheme was(1) That the States should continue to receive (2) That such annual share be paid to the States in the form of a fixed sum per head of The the population. In regard to these two principles there is no difference between that scheme and the proposals of the Government. The Brisbane Labour Conference adopted these principles in July, 1908. On 30th March, 1909, when the Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister, he delivered an important policy speech at Gympie. Having attained to the important office of Prime Minister and Treasurer he appeared to view this question with different eyes from those with which he viewed it when he occupied a seat on the Ministerial cross benches. hope, be able to prove every statement that I make.

44,Sir John Forrest,"I shall, IGympie in March of the present year, the honourable member endeavoured to make it appear-and he still persists in doing »so that the scheme formulated by the Brisbane Labour Conference does not contemplate a per capita, distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue, but merely the permanent return to the States of a fixed sum annually. If that be so, what is the meaning of the words?That such annual share be paid to the States this House, on 25th August last, the honin the form of a fixed sum per head of the popuorable member saidlation. Do they not mean that a per capita distribution is to be made? sum is annually to be distributed per capita. I was present at the Conference, ancl I know what was decided upon. to show the honourable member what others think of the matter. Under the scheme framed by the Brisbane Labour Conference a fixed sum would annually be returned to the Statesa sum which in 1909 would have amounted to £[5,229,017-and an additional £250,000 per annum, decreasing by _ £ i ° » ; yearly to Western Australia. 000 Under that scheme, as it is interpreted by the Leader of the Opposition, the payment to the States in 1909 would have been .£5,479,000, whereas the amount payable under the Government scheme would, on the same population, have beai £5,549,000. tribution under the former scheme would have been only £[70,000 less than under the latter. But that is not all. The honourable member for Wide Bay, who was Prime Minister at the time, concluded this portion of his speech by holding out to the States the hope that they would receive even more than that amount. He saidIn leaving this subject, I desire clearly to state that the Commonwealth is riot bound to limit its contribution to the State funds to any amount that may be agreed upon -He was then catering for the favour of the States. naturally desired to be upon good terms with everybody. He went on to sayI t may be taken for granted that the Commonwealth Parliament will be f u l l y aware of the necessities of the States, and that it will not permit any extravagance in Commonwealth expenditure, and that it will endeavour in the future as in the past to hand over to the States not only so much as it is bound to do, but to supplement such amounts whenever it is possible. Nothing could have been fairer or more reasonable than that declaration. He addedI congratulate the Hobart Conference on having arrived at a decision that the bookkeeping period should be abolished and that the surplus should be divided on a' population basis with a special concession to Western Australia. How different is the honourable member's tune only five months later? Speaking in In my opinion, apart from the method, the amount proposed to be given to the States is excessive. Again, he saidI think that it is too much, and that it would be absolutely impossible for any Government to provide it in later years. Fifteen days later, namely, on 9th instant, having had a little more time to consider the matter, he saidI should be ready and willing to support any proposal to give even a larger sum than 25s. per head, provided that it was associated with the transfer to the Commonwealth of the State debts. On 25th August, the amount proposed to be returned was, in the honourable member's opinion, .too much; on the 9th September, the agreement was a reasonable and a fair arrangement, and he was willing to give even more if it were associated with the transfer of the State debts. I am glad to be able to take the honourable member at In other words, the conhis word in regard to the transfer of the State debts. We propose that they shall be taken over, not by force, but 'with the full approval of the Governments of the States. We propose something more than that. We intend to ask the people to \ote at a referendum, not on one Bill, but on two on the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill, and on the Constitution Alteration (State Debts) Bill. It has been asked, '' Why not deal with both subjects in one ""Bill? Why deal with them in two?"" The suggestion that we should deal with the two subjects in one measure Being Prime Minister, he is unreasonable. We have dealt with them separately in order to give the electors of Australia a wider latitude. Some may approve of the proposed distribution of Customs and Excise revenue, but may disapprove of the transfer of the whole, of the debts, or vice versd; and if the two subjects were dealt with in tbe one Bill, they would have to swallow or reject both our proposals. As it is, they",21,Deakin

46,Sir John Forrest,"I shall be ablewill be able, if they so desire, to accept the one ancl reject the other. I have referred to the opinions expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, and I propose now to direct the attention of the House to remarks make by his first lieutenant, the honourable member for West Sydney. On ioth September, the honourable member said, as reported in Hansard, page 3335To that arrangement there are two objections, both of which, I think, are fatal. One is that the payment is too high and the other is that the arrangement itself is to be permanent. Apparently, the honourable member forgot that, on 12th August, he had stated in this House, as reported in Hansard, page 2430Whatever may be the shortcomings of the Brisbane (Labour Conference) scheme it had at least the merit of practicability. It was not merely a temporary expedient for the next j-ear or two, but a settlement for all time. I will leave the honourable member to explain that jjolitical somersault, which took place within a month, and I am quite willing that he should try, if he can, to wriggle out of his statements. I wish now to quote the views expressed by Mr Bath, Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, and a representative of that State at the Premiers' and Treasurers' Conference, held in Melbourne, on 9th October, 1906. At that Conference, Mr Bath movedThat the Braddon clause be continued in perpetuity in conjunction with the bookkeeping system. He saidA l l we desire is a continuation of the Braddon section-the return of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States. That was a plain unequivocal statement. Later on, Mr Bath saidWhen moving the motion for the perpetuation of the Braddon clause my desire was to obtain the opinion of the people on one direct issue the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth placed before the people free from any otheT conflicting issue. That is exactly what the Government propose to do. At the Premiers' and Treasurers' Melbourne Conference of 1906, amongst the members of which w^ere the Leader of the Labour party of New the Leader of the Labour party in Victoria, Mr Prendergast, M.L.A., and the Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, to whom I have just referred!, it was unanimously resolved that tlie the Braddon section, with some slight but immaterial alterations, should be continued till 1920, and thereafter until the Constitution was amended, as provided by. section 128. We make the same proposal, so far as the question of permanency is concerned. That Conference decided that the Braddon section should be continued until 1920, and that no alteration in regard to the amount to be returned to the States should be made thereafter, save with the consent of the people. I have thus shown that the proposal to place this agreement in the Constitution is no new idea, but has been advocated and supported by most of tbe public men of Australia, including leaders of the Labour party. I have already stated that the honourable member for Wide Bay, and some of his colleagues, have tried to wriggle out of the Brisbane Labour Conference proposals; and I ask them whether they do not regard those proposals or decisions binding on themselves and the party ? bind the Labour party in thc next Parliament ? a subterfuge. If the proposals are not binding, I do not see that they are of much use. However, I gather from the honourable member for Gwydir that, while he does not regard these decisions as binding on him now, they will be binding on him in a few months, if he is returned again. lege of saying whether I agree with them. stand the decisions are binding on the next' Parliament? who agree with them. I want to see the question of member will agree to the proposals right enough ! Fortunately, we are not limited to the views of honourable members in this House as to the meaning of the financial proposals at the Brisbane Labour Conference.

But the spoken that they will have a f u l l opportuCommonwealth, if it finds it necesnity of discussing and criticising the measary to spend largely on defence and sure. in other directions within its ambit uncier the Constitution, should do so Mr Speaker. without depleting the revenues of the States, which are so much required for developmental and educational purposes, ancl thus retarding the progress of the country; the Commonwealth ought to put its hands into the pockets of the whole of the people of Australia in order to increase the revenue as may be required. I have no sympathy, and 1 hope I never shall have, with those who ignore the importance of the necessities of the States, as if these were of no account. It would be better to have unification at once rather than impoverish the States, and thus render them incapable of carrying out their important duties. Isi t not absolutely imperative, I ask honourable members, that education, railways, and means of transit, water conservation, development of the national estate, settling and making homes for the people, administering law and order, shall flourish? If we turn our eyes to our own functions, can any one say that they are more important to'the progress and development of Australia than the matters which are in the hands of the States? Therefore, I hold that we had better have unification than impoverish and make incapable the State authorities in carrying out their important duties. I ask honourable members, would they cripple the States? Who are the wealth producers of Australia ? Who are the working men of Australia in the Federal family? I think that the only answer is the States. The States are the working men who are opening up this country, making it habitable, productive, and fit to live in, carrying on the progress, advancement, and development of this large territory. All these things are intrusted to the States. Buti f some honourable members had their way they would deplete their revenue in such a way as to make it impossible for them to carry out their functions. Some honourable members, if they had their way, would k ill the "" goose which is laying the golden eggs."" They are always doing that. orable members to refrain from making ancl the Commonwealth will be able to these comments, some of which are not in hold these ideas are doing a great wrong to this country. Better far, I repeat, to have unification, which I am absolutely opposed to, than to practically strangle the wealthproducers of this country. Had the proposed agreement been in force since tlie establishment of Federation, the Commonwealth would have received ,£23,621,406 more than it has done. These figures give some idea of the enormous extra burden which will be placed upon the States by the agreement. On the other side, the immense expenditure by the Commonwealth on old-age pensions and defence will also be a very heavy burden. In the future both the Commonwealth ancl the States will have a much heavier burden to carry than hitherto. If this agreement should become law, then, in 1910-11, the States will receive £2,373,10 0 less than they would have received under the Braddon section if continued. New South Wales will lose .£1,321,043; Victoria, ,£488,237; Queensland, .£346,228 ; South Australia, .£148,338 ; Western Australia, . £ 6 5 J 4 4 3 ; and Tasmania, .£3,811, making a total of £2,373,100 . Against that, of course, honourable members are aware that New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland will be relieved of the payment of old-age pensions, which comes to nearly £-i,000,000 a year. In considering this whole question we must not forget that if this arrangement should become law this House will have complete control of the proceeds of Customs and Excise duties, ancl can retain, not only all that we have at present, after paying the amount agreed upon to the States, but the whole of that which we may from time to time raise. Honourable members are aware that if it were desired at the present time to raise through the Customs the £[1,200,000 that we require under ordinary circumstances for financing this year, we would have to raise four times that amount.

During this debate, Australia has been compared a good deal with other countries in regard to Customs taxation. that Australia is a unique country, excepting in some regards New Zealand. New Zealand raises, and for many years has raised, by Customs and Excise duties, over £ 3 a head; and, so far as one can see, there is no sign of diminution. has been said; but I do not think so. In 1903, New Zealand raised in Customs duties £ 3 3S5dper head; in 1904, £ 3 5s. 2d.; in 1905, £ 3 3s. 4d-; in 1906, £ 3 7s. 2d.; in 1907, £ 3 9S7di and in 1908, £ 3 4s. I said just now that during the debate Australia has been compared with other countries with habits, customs', and tastes dissimilar from ours, and with different Tariffs, different standards of living, and different spending power. In my opinion-and I have taken some trouble to look into them, and will refer to some directly--the comparisons are not of very much value. Even a comparison between parts of Australia, our own country, is very much weakened by the fact that for many years prior to Federation, New South Wales had a different Tariff from that existing in all the other States; ancl, therefore, the comparisons are not satisfactory. Comparisons, in order to have a value, must be based on simithat the result was that more and more free lar conditions; otherwise, they aTe most misleading. I do not see any good ground, for taking the experience of old, thicklypopulated countries, when we have our own experience of the results of Protectionist Tariffs. In Western Australia in 1901-2, £ 6 17s. i d . per head was raised through the Customs. * Probably there was never a more flourishing period in the history of Australia than that enjoyed by Western Australia at that time. The estimate for the present year is £ 3 6s. 2d. But, although the people of Western Australia are only taxed £ 3 6s. 2d. per head through the Customs now, I appeal to those honourable members who know Western Australia to say whether the people are better off now than they were in the years in which they paid a very much higher rate of Customs taxation per capita. In Queensland, in 1900, the Customs taxation per cafita was £ 3 3s. 8£d. ; it is estimated that in 1909-10 the yield will be £ 2 13s. In New Zealand, the Customs taxation, in 1903, was £ 3 3s. 5d. per head; it .was £ 3 4s. in 1908. On' Thursday night last, we listened to a very able and interesting speech from my honourable friend, I remind honourable members the member for Flinders. I think it is but right that when a man holding his position in the community and in this House makes an important and carefully prepared statement, if it contains anything adverse to the case submitted by the Government, there should be some reply to it. The honourable member supplied the House with some interesting tables, from which he quoted, and I am glad to see, that they have been embodied in Hansard. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for having directed that they should be inserted, because they have been of great service to me in considering the points raised in the honourable member's speech. The figures supplied by the honourable member to the House showed the total imports, duties, population, &c, in the German Empire, the United States of America, and the Dominion of Canada, for the last nineteen years. He dwelt at some length on the suggestiveness of the decrease of the percentage of duties on imports, of merchandise during this term of nineteen years. The column in which that information is contained shows how much £ 1 0 0 worth of imports yielded in Customs duties. The honourable member attempted to prove from these statistics that the gradual effect of a protective Tariff was to change the character of the imports, so goods, or goods bearing low duties, were imported in proportion to the whole. In Germany, the percentage is shown to have been, in 1889, 5.62 per cent., rising gradually to 8,74 per cent, in 1895, then rising suddenly to 10 per cent, in 1896; and afterwards fluctuating with a downward tendency till it reached 6.39 per cent, in 1907. In the United States, and in Canada, the percentage also dropped, and it would appear from the honourable member's argument and hisfiguresthat the effect of the Tariffs was to diminish the importation of heavily taxed articles. Buti f we look at the column in which we are really interested-that is, the total per capita collections from import duties-w e find that in every case the amount collected per capita has steadily increased. In the nineteen years, the amount received per capita increased in Germany to the amount of over 50 per cent.; in America, 13\ per cent. ; and, in Canada,. 76 per cent. Expressing the figuresin another way, in nineteen years the population of Germany increased",25,Deakin
76,Mr Webster,On a revenue Tariff.,26,Deakin
77,Sir John Forrest,"I know thatby 27 per cent., whilst the import duties increased by 92 per cent. In the United States, the population increased by 40 per cent., whilst the import duties increased by 50 per cent. In Canada, the population increased by 30 per cent., whilst the import duties increased by 123 per cent. This is the fact in which we are especially interested. the tables furnished by the Government Statistician to the honourable member for Flinders, and inserted in Hansard, that the effect of protective Tariffs in these three countries was largely to increase the amount of Customs collections per head, although, at the same time, the imports, as a whole, yielded a less rate of duty. I cannot follow the honourable member for Flinders when he stated that in all cases I quote his exact words in which a mild system of Protection has been adopted the invariable tendency is to show a perpetual falling in the amount of revenue per head which is yielded by the Tariff. Let me give some figures for the nineteen years covered by the honourable member's statistics. In Germany, from 1889 to 1907, the population increased by 27 per cent. ; fhe import duties increased by 92 pet cent.; and the import duties per capita increased from 6s. 5d. to 9s. 8d.

In New Zealand, for the same period, the population increased by 50 per cent.; the import duties increased by n o per cent.; and the import duties per capita increased from 48s. to 67s. able member takes the figures for a further period, he will find that they show a decrease. Sir JOHN FORREST into the future. I have taken the very years chosen by the honourable member for Flinders, and from his own figures I think I have proved that his argument was not borne out by his statistics. His statement, as I listened to it, was one that affected me very much. It was evidently made with great deliberation. The honourable member attempted to prove that in all cases in which a mild system of Protection has been adopted, the invariable tendency is to show' a perpetual falling in the amount of revenue per head which is yielded by the Tariff. tliat the honourable member for Flinders took the limited period with which the right It would appear, then, from bonorable gentleman has dealt. member took the exact period with which I have dealt. It seems to me, however, that instead of proving his case, his figures prove the opposite. His tables show, I think, that although the population in the countries mentioned by him has increased, the import duties and the import duties per capita have increased at a much greater rate. I wish, also, to refer to the speech made last week by the honourable membei for Parkes. I quote him the more readily because I know that he is a man of independent thought, who invariably expresses fearlessly the views at which he arrives. I am glad to tell the honourable member that. I am absolutely in accord with every word I propose to quote from his speech. He saidI am quite sure that nobody ever thought for a moment that in limiting the Braddon clause for ten years it was intended by the representatives of the States, or by the people of the States, who approved of the Bil l in its amended form, that that ten years' period was to be the limited time within which the States were to enjoy a large share of the Customs and Excise revenue. It was looked upon as a temporary expedient to enable the Parliament In Canada, during the same and the people to acquire experience with regard to the financial relations of the States and Commonwealth. It was always expected and expressed by all the leading thinkers upon Commonwealth questions that when the ten years' period came to an end, instead of the Braddon section being allowed to expire altogether, some steps would be taken to substitute another ar. rangement of, perhaps, a modified character.

This is not distrust of the Federal Parliament or of the Federal Government, but an absolute distrust and apprehension of that state of affairs which enables a central parliamentary body to spend, or places it in the position and in the temptation of being able to spend, large sums of money entirely free from the restrictions without which Parliamentary government, so far as finance is concerned, becomes a snare and a delusion. That is the view -vhich we hold, and we hold it in the strongest way. . . . My views in connection with it were entirely endorsed at the recent Premiers' Conference, and I believe that every State Treasurer present at this Conference feels ns strongly upon this point as I do. I have no doubt that the position has only to become known to the people of the Commonwealth to have it imperatively insisted upon that some such protection shall be assured in order to maintain the relations arising out of Federation. Could anything be stronger, or more greatest respect, the honourable member, clearly and forcibly expressed, than those with his knowledge, gained from experideliberate statements of the honourable ence in finance, in framing his scheme, member for Flinders when he was Premier found himself hampered by the terms of of Victoria?

I think that a limit of thirty has done in the matter, not only now, but years, which, of course, would be a fixed for period, and the proviso that afterwards the 1906 matter may be dealt with as Parliament ject to its provisions; but the honourable might determine, is much more inflexible member for Mernda has all along departed than the power of the people, in the manner from the terms of the Constitution.

Honourable members will see that under that section it is not compulsory that the Commonwealth should do so, but it is empowered to do so. who voted in favour of Federation were under the impression that the Commonwealth would take over those debts. were constantly charged with having failed in our duty by having neglected to take them over. member knows perfectly well that I have always been in favour of the Commonwealth taking over the £[202,000,000 worth of debts which we are authorized to take over by the Constitution. to take over some of the State debts? authorized to take over the debts which existed at the time Federation was established, which amounted to about £[200,000,000. But there is nothing in our Constitution which makes the Commonwealth .responsible to the Stai.es for their debts. When Federation was established it was clearly understood that each State was liable for its own debts-and that if the Commonwealth took over the management of them it was to be indemnified by the States against any loss or deficiency in respect of the debts taken over and interest payable upon them. assume that the Commonwealth paid off the State debts. In that case the States would have to indemnify the Commonwealth for every penny paid on their behalf, and, therefore, I can see no reason for discontinuing the payment of the proposed subsidy to the States on that account. I wish to make it clear to the honourable member for Mernda that it is not proposed to return to the States a per capita contribution of 25s. annually merely because the States have to pay interest upon their public debts, because, under section 105 of the Constitution, they have to indemnify the Ccmmonwealth in full on that account. We propose to return that sum to them annually as their fair share of the Customs and Excise revenue in lieu of the £[1 18S1. 6d. per head which represents the average payment to them during the past three years. The fact that the money thus returned is applied by the States to the payment of interest ""on their debts dees not diminish their liability to the CommonAvealth. In considering this question, the obligations of both States and Commonwealth must be fairly weighed. We are not a Unification, arranging to divide the Commonwealth into States, with full power to give or withhold just what revenue we may choose. We are a Federation, and have been intrusted by the people with the duty of acting fairly, and even generously, to the States. I hope that honourable members will not forget who brought the Commonwealth into existence, and who gave us our Constitution. It was the people of the States. They trusted us', and I hope we shall not be unmindful of the trust which they have reposed in us. I should like to .point out that the draft Constitution Bill under which the Braddon clause would have been permanent, was carried at the first referendum, cn 3rd June, 1898, by a majority in the four States in which that referendum was held. I wish to emphasize that circumstance with a view to showing that the people of Australia were willing to permanently return to the States three-fourthsof the Commonwealth Customs and Excise revenue. In New South Wales the majority in favour of the Bill was a small one. the result if the Braddon section of our Constitution had been, made permanent? the point which I am making. The referendum taken on 3rd June, 1898, on the draft Constitution Bill, under which the Let us Braddon provision was permanent, resulted in a majority for Federation, which amounted to only a few thousand in New South Wales. In Victoria, five electors to one voted in favour of that measure; in South Australia, there was a majority of two to one; whilst in Tasmania the majority was five to one. No referendum was taken at that time in Queensland or Western Australia. The fact that the operation of the Braddon section was after-",29,Deakin

If those who voted and fought for Federation are now to have their motives impugned, I have nothing to say. As everybody knows, the iFederal Convention in 1898 proposed that the Commonwealth should return to They merely the States three-fourths of its Customs and Excise revenue, whereas the proposed agreement contemplates the return to them of 25s. per head, which, for 1910-n, it is estimated would represent £2,373,10 0 less than the three-fourths. In ten years, the reduction in the payments to the States under the proposed agreement would be £ 2 , 6 4 2 , 2 13 less than the three-fourths. Yet this immense diminution in the amount returnable to the States, which has been agreed to by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States, is opposed by honourable members opposite. I do not satisfy them. I think, therefore, that No . it would be useless to try to please them. I am glad, however, that during the last My own opinion -is that week or two honourable members opposite seem to have evinced a better feeling in dealing with this question. They do not seem now to be so hostile to the States as they were last session, and even during the early part of the present session.

This matter should not be decided solely on the basis of the obligations of the Commonwealth. We should do what is fair to both, as intended by the Constitution.

But the burdens of the States are also enlarging every day. New avenues of expenditurenew railways, roads ancl bridges, waterworks and .harbors-hav e to be provided for by them, and, unless we approach this question with a sense of the obligations resting upon both the Commonwealth and the States, we are not likely to do right. Unlike some honourable members, I have no feaTS for the future. I am not in the habit of being afraid of what my judgment tells me I ought to do. I am not always looking backward and afraid to go forward. The past is useful only as a guide to the future, and if we are to be hampered by fears of our own imagining, we are not likely to succeed. onward ? are always afraid. If it should be found in the future that this agreement works out disadvantageous^ to the Commonwealth or to the States, the people will have to be appealed to, 'and their mandate obtained. I believe, however, with the honourable member for Mernda, that the day when such an appeal will have to be made is a long way off. We must'not forget.that the taxpayers of the Commonwealth ancl the States are the same, and that the revenue is expended in the interests of the same people. The States and the Commonwealth Governments are like two managers of one establishment, each carrying out different duties. The CommonweaJth has received as its share from Customs ancl Excise duties, during the past three years, an annual average of 12s. 2d. per head of population, and if this agreement had been in force, its share per head would have been more than doubled. If the proposed agreement had been in force since Federation, the Commonwealth would have received £[23,621,^06 more than tected and safeguarded. In conclusion, I it has received. This would have been an enormous sum for the States to relinquish. The agreement means' a reduction in the amount returned to the States during the year 1910-n of £[2,373,100. To those who say that we are proposing to give too large a sum to the States-and I certainly do not agree with that ideaI would reply that we shall be giving it to the people whose representatives we are. We are not proposing to sink it in the sea, or to give it to strangers. We are not going to use it to assist the people of other nations. We are simply proposing to give it to those whose agents we are, and whose interests we are here to safeguard. We are now approaching the second decade of the Commonwealth's existence, or what I may describe as the second epoch in our Federal destiny. If we can enter upon it, as I believe we shall-and as our proposals will insure-wit h separate and independent financial arrangements, amicably and unanimously agreed to; with power to take over the whole of the State debts; with our industrial legislation placed on a sound Federal basis; with the trans-Australian # railways connecting east and west and north ancl south agreed to; with military and naval defence placed on a firm basis, the Commonwealth acting in concert and in unity with the Mother Country; with the Federal Seat of Government decided upon; with old-age and invalid pensions firmly established; and last, but not least, in friendship and goodwill with the Governments and Parliaments of the States', and with our kinsmen in the Old Land, we shall indeed have cause to rejoice. If these attainments herald our entry into the second epoch of our Federal life, as I believe they will, we shall have cause to congratulate ourselves, and we shall know that our labours have not been in vain. Our Constitution was brought into existence by the people, and it cannot be altered except with the consent of the people. I hope that honourable members will take a broad view of this question, and that they will approve of the proposals of the Government. I personally feel a special responsibility in urging the acceptance of what I consider a fair and reasonable arrangement to all concerned. I cannot but rememmber that I was, to some extent, responsible for my own State entering the Federation, and that I have a strong moral obligation to see that its interests, and the interests of the Commonwealth and the States generally, are proreiterate that we have no fear of the result of our proposals, for we believe that we have justice on our side.

105,Sir John Forrest,"Some peopleThe Treasurer undertook to reply to speeches which have been delivered on the proposed agreement, speeches of the honourable member foi Mernda, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Parkes; but it will be admitted that anyone of these gentlemen is as well qualified as, or, perhaps, better qualified, than the gentleman who happens to be Treasurer of the Commonwealth for the time being, to form a correct opinion on this question. I must take exception to the contention of the Treasurer, reiterated time after time, that every honourable member who is courageous enough to differ from the proposals submitted by the Government is an enemy of the States. I worked as hard in my way as the Treasurer did in his, to bring about Federation; and I refuse to be classed as an enemy of the States. I recognise, what the honourable gentleman fails to recognise, that we can be a friend of the States in another way than by permitting them to continue squandering the revenues of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth; and no honourable member knows better than the Treasurer what has taken place in this connection. honourable gentleman what was in the mind of the people when Federation was accomplished. It was said that there was to be retrenchment in expenditure and reduced taxation by the States; but, instead, both expenditure and taxation have been increased.

CHANTER -Late r on, I shall show that it does apply to every State, and figures will prove that I am correct. How was this agreement born?' What brought it into life? trusted ? Were the representatives of the people trusted when the Premiers came to demand that a Conference should be held and the financial question considered? I cannot say that it was sought to have the question fairly considered, because, if the people were to be trusted, as they should be, what necessity was there for the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Minister of Defence to meet the Premiers in conference, from which the press and the public were excluded? What necessity was there for the doors of the Conference chamber to be guarded by police, and for even the blotting pads to be burnt, in case some of the secrets of trie proceedings particularly the should be disclosed? If ever the people had a right to be trusted, it was when these great financial questions were being considered. The people had a right, on the platform, and through the press, to set forth their ideas as to the future financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States; but from that time until now-in neither the speech of the Prime Minister nor of the Treasurer-ha s any explanation been given to this House of the arguments which were used in order to bring about the agreement. Surely we are entitled to know what took place at that Conference? While again denying that I am in any way antagonistic to the real welfare of the States, I have to say that I have no sympathy with this agreement, which means more than appears on its face-somethin g can be read into that agreement that is not printed thereon. It is not a financial agreement, strictly speaking, but a political agreement, by which this Government, who desire to drag their party at their heels, undertake to join hands and forces with the Premiers of the States at the next election, in order, if possible, to deprive No one knows better than the the Opposition of any opportunity of taking part in the government of the country.

115,Mr Chanter,"Yes; and the stateseen the organizers at work; and the statement is made, particularly by the country press,that the proposed agreement is in the interests of the Fusion Government and their followers. Io view of the fact that the Conference was held in absolute secrecy, and that these organizations are at work, what conclusion can the people of Australia come to other than that the agreement is intended to, at all hazards, keep the present Government and their supporters in power? peatedly Commonwealth would suffer no loss, but that the States were going to suffer a terrible loss. Uncier the agreement New South Wales would receive considerably more from Customs and Excise than it did prior to Federation. Whether it is so intended or not, the agreement must surely bave the effect of depriving the people of the Commonwealth of that protective policy which they so earnestly sought when they brought about Federation, and which they thought, and rightly thought, would do more' to develop our resources than would any other force that could possibly be introduced. It is useless in my opinion for the Treasurer to argue, as he did to-day, on tlie lines laid down by the honourable member for Flinders, or any other honourable member, that we can have an effective protective policy and also a large revenue from Customs and Excise. We can have a large revenue from Excise, but not from Customs. If we are to have a large revenue from import duties, we must have decreased protection. Only a very simple illustration is needed to prove that. What is the effect of a protective duty ? It is to induce some person to manufacture an article which is imported, and the local manufacture of an article means one article less on which Customs duty can. be collected. As the honourable member for Flinders very properly pointed out, the effect of protective duties is to change the character of the articles imported. Take the history of any nation which has a protective policy. I find that in such countries the revenue per capita has steadily decreased; and if the same principle applies to a protective tariff in Australia, in the not distant future it will not have sufficient revenue from, that source to pay 25s. per capita and meet its necessary expenditure. quote some figures, I desire to reply to a few statements made by the Treasurer regarding what was in the minds of the Mr Chanter. people when they were asked to accept the Constitution Bill. It is quite true, as interjected here to-day, that at that time not 5 per cent, of the people of the Colonies had studied the financial question. I went through the campaign. I occupied the same platform as the honourable member for Parkes on many occasions; but, so far as my recollection serves me, not once did he or any other gentleman deal with what was afterwards termed the Braddon Blot The Treasurer reand is now called the Braddon Blessing. tried to show that the The first appeal to the people to accept the Bill was made on other grounds altogether. But one point which was laid before them more than any other was the great advantage which would accrue to them from' a policy of Inter-State Free Trade with Protection against the world, and also from the transfer and consolidation of the State debts, which it was estimated would lead to the saving of a million a year. These were practically the only two considerations which engaged the minds of the people of New South"" Wales at that time. Of course I will not pretend to speak about the feeling in the other Colonies. The first statement which was heard about the Braddon provision was after another secret Conference of the Premiers. It is history, and not to the credit of New South Wales, that it broke the agreement solemnly made by the Premiers to submit the Constitution Bill to the people with a provision for a minimum affirmative vote of 50,000. That promise was deliberately broken by one Colony out of the six, the minimum affirmative vote being increased to 80,000. It is also a matter of history that at the first referendum, although the original minimum vote of 50,000 was reached, the increased vote was not reached, and the Bill had to remain in abeyance for the time being. Next came the second stage of the Bill, and then for the first time in the history of this great movement the people heard about the Braddon clause. They heard about it from a member of the Conference, who came back to Sydney and described it in very lurid language as a very great blot and one which he would not recommend the people of New South Wales to accept unless it was altered or modified. I think I am correct in saying that that gentleman I refer to the honourable member for East BeforeI Sydney-wa s the convener of the second Conference of Premiers at which this question was discussed. The people of Australia as a whole were so anxious to create a Commonwealth that their reprethough their electors may form a minority sentatives were prepared to meet him, and of the people, can hereafter refuse to perthen new demands were made.

At this stage I merely mention the fact that, although in connection with this matter the people were promised that Federation would result in decreased expenditure, fhe expenditure of the States has increased We have heard a good deal about what is due to the States and to the Commonwealth; but if the people were led to believe anything at the time Federation was established, it was that the Commonwealth Parliament would receive and retain one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise. That was the honest belief of the people right through, but a great many of the people are not yet sufficiently informed as to what did take place. Again we failed in our duty, because we did not keep the one-fourth that we were entitled to. Had we retained it from the initiation of Federation, it would not have been necessary for the Treasurer to ask the House, as he did a little while ago, to agree to the issue of short-dated Treasury-bills to finance the present year. It is only recently that we awakened to our true duty, and, by passing the Surplus Revenue Act, diverted a certain amount of money into the Old-age Pensions and Naval Defence Funds. Had that not been done, the Treasurer would have had to face a deficit to-day, not of £[1,200,000, but of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000. did the money go? It was handed back to the States to the extent of about £6,000,000 over and above their three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. Notwithstanding those facts, New South Wales, which was getting over £1,000,000 more tham it ever received before, increased its expenditure from about £[10,000,000 to £14,000,000 per annum, to govern practically the same number of people. Where does the charge of extravagance lie in the face of facts like those? ment handed back so much money because it was afraid of public opinion. be afraid of public opinion now. If it were not, it would at once adopt the financial scheme suggested by the honourable member for Mernda, or some other arrangemonwealth finance in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament, instead of giving it away to others, wbo are not, and never have been, Federalists. I am proud to believe that the great majority of the members of this House do regard their duties here as something more than parochial, and look upon themselves as the representatives, not only of the particular districts which return them, but of the people of Australia as a whole. When we are faced with the necessity of arriving at a decision on a big financial question, we must deal with it in a practical .way. I recently put to the Treasurer the following questions:1. What amount of revenue from Customs and Excise duties did the several States of the Commonwealth derive in the years 1899 and 1900, specifying each? 2. What amount f e r cafita was that, based upon the then existing population? The right honourable gentleman, in his reply, gave figures for all the States, of which those for New South Wales were as follow:1. Customs and Excise Revenue, 1S98-1S99, £1,608,859; 1S99-1900, £1,736,377. 2. Amountf e r cafita, 1898-1899, £ 1 4s. 3d.; 1899-1900, £ 1 ss"" i d . I have pondered very deeply over this matter, because it appears to me that unless we destroy the Protective policy, and come down to a policy such as we formerly had in New South Wales, those figures prove clearly that this Parliament would be absolutely bound and fettered, as the honourable member for Flinders said, because it would not have the money to Where pay. That is the position, which was given away a few days ago, when the honourable member for Flinders was speaking, by an interjection of the honourable member for Denison, who said: ""We can easily get £3.000,000 a year by revenue duties."" There, then, is the danger. We must have a revenue sufficient for Commonwealth requirements, and sufficient to pay 25s. per capita to the States; and that will drive this Parliament away from its Protective policy and into the necessity of imposing revenue duties upon every article",36,Forrest Yes And Think That Anything Proposed By Us Would

Of course, I recognise that the people of Sydney are opposed to any such step, because their policy has always been to compel our rural producers to send their produce to Sydney, instead of to their nearest market, which may be Adelaide or Melbourne. The same condition of affairs obtains in the other States. It particularly applies, however, to the northern portion of New South Wales, whose natural market is Brisbane. But the onlymarket open to producers there is that cf Sydney. "" Wales will not make the necessary railway connection. not allow another State to construct railways to exploit its territory. Take, as an illustration, the gap between Tocumwal and Finley. The distance between these two places is only 14 miles. Yet the Government of New South Wales will not connect them by railway. It thus compels the producers in that portion of its territory to send their produce a distance of 500 or -600 miles to Sydney. Time after time, it has been pressed to bridge the gap, but it has refused to do so on the ground that any such action would tend merely to facilitate trade with. Melbourne. Between. Jerilderie and Deniliquin, and between Hay and Deniliquin, similar gaps occur. When a member of the New South Wales Parliament, I repeatedly urged that these gaps should be bridged, but the reply always forthcoming was that, by acceding to any such demand, the State would lose its trade. I have also argued that the persons who are chiefly interested should themselves be permitted to construct railways to their nearest market; but the desired permission has always been refused. The question of competitive railway rates is one which this Parliament ought to consider in connection with any agreement which may be arrived at in regard to the adjustment of the future financial relations of tlie States and the Commonwealth. When Sir George Turner propounded his scheme for determining those relations, he proposed that the Commonwealth, in taking over the It , will not. In my State debts, should also .assume control over the. railways. sion could never overcome the difficulties which the honourable member has pointed out. do would be to prevent the charging of detrimental rates fpr the carriage of goods. The honourable member for Mernda has given such a close study to questions of finance, that his utterances on the subject deserve the serious consideration of honourable members. I followed his speech the other evening very closely. His position amounts to this : He is willing that a -per capita payment of 25s. should be made to the States for a term of years, contingent on the whole of their debts being transferred to the Commonwealth, and all future borrowing being under Commonwealth control and direction, the per capita payment not to exceed £9,000,000 a year, which is the present interest on the public debt. TsA n d because it will there any need, in dealing with these matters, to go to the people for a special declaration ? Does not the Constitution enact that the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States shall continue for ten years from the inauguration of Federation, or until afterwards altered by this Parliament? Was not that provision specifically accepted by the Commonwealth people, and endorsed by them, when, during the last elections, they were told that this Parliament would arrive at an agreement with the States regarding the finances ? We are now being asked, although competent to deal with it ourselves, to refer the matter to the people. There should not be an alteration of the Constitution which will deprive future Parliaments of the power to review the situation; and, if necessary, to make a fresh' arrangement.

If whatever arrangement is made is embodied in the Constitution, it will be most difficult later on to get an alteration carried, should that be found necessary. An alteration of the Constitution cannot be made without the consent, not only of the majority of the people, but also of a majority of the States, and the smaller States would object to any alteration by which their interests would in any way suffer. I am afraid that the Commonwealth will be able to pay 255. to the States per head of population only by destroying our Protective policy. Of course, that might be obviated by continuing the system of borrowing, of which the States have already done too much. of New South Wales, whose history I know best. In the pre-Federal days that State could manage with a revenue of between £9,000,000 and ,£10,000,000, notwithstanding that it had to pay for the upkeep of its Military and Naval Forces, and its posts, telegraphs, and telephones. By the transfer of the Departments of Defence ancl the Postmaster-General to thc Commonwealth, it has been relieved of a burden of £[3,000,000, and yet to-day its expenditure is £14,000,000 per annum. Under its Tariff the State obtained per capita just about what it is proposed that it should receive under the agreement for all time. If money is borrowed, provision -> should be made for its repayment. understand that one or two of the States have recently instituted small sinking funds;' but practically no provision has been made for the repayment of the £[250,000,000 borrowed by Australia as a whole. New South Wales would have done much better had she used the money obtained from the sale of public estates, which, in some years, amounted to £[2,000,000, though 'now it is much less, to reduce her debt, instead of treating it as ordinary revenue, and squandering it. Unless the Commonwealth controls future borrowing, we shall have a continuance of prodigal ancl wasteful expenditure. Wales is the only State which has been guiltv of that. the Legislative Assembly of that State,' I often deplored the wasteful expenditure of borrowed money. bursting of the boom, retrenched its expenditure, and for years paid for all public works out of revenue; but New South Wales has always charged such expenditure to loan funds. This wasteful finance will be continued unless the States agree to borrow in future only through the Commonwealth, ancl for strictly legitimate purposes. A good deal' has been said regarding the returns per capita of various countries, and a table has teen supplied by the honourable member for Flinders, which should assist us in determining whether the proposed per capita payment to the States should be for all time, or for only a short period. In this connection, let me refer first to a table prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician in .reply to a question put to the Treasurer by the honourable member for Yarra, showing the receipts from Customs and Excise revenue per head of the population in the United States of America, which is undoubtedly a Protectionist country. Its prosperity has been built up under Protection, and its per capita return of Customs and Excise at the present time is due to the adoption of that policy. The table is as followsI -UXITE D STATES OF AMERICA. Estimated Customs Customs and Excise Year. Mean and Excise Revenue. Population. Revenue. per Head of Population. £ £ s. d. 19034 .. 81,177,000 102,954,000 15 4 19045 .. 82,563,000 103,311,000 "" 1 6 0 19056 .. 83,769,000 114,459,000 17 4 I 19067 .. 85,150,000 86,618,000 125,306,000 112,047,000 1 9 1 5 6 10 19078 ..

Many years would elapse before we should obtain anything like the equivalent of the -revenue paid to the States in respect of every additional immigrant to Australia and every new-born babe. During the five years' period covered by the return, the population of the United States of America has increased by 5,441,000, and the Customs and Excise revenue by £9,093,000, but the per capita return of Customs and Excise revenue has Victoria, after the increased only from £[1 5s. 4d. to £ 1 5s. iod. .

168,Mr Chanter,"When a member ofber for Flinders that, although our Customs and Excise revenue may increase, that does not necessarily mean that there will be an increase in the f e r cafita return. come now to the position of Canada, which is somewhat different from that of the United States of America. In 1903-4 the estimated mean population of Canada was 5,568,000; its Customs and Excise revenue, £[11,179,000; and its f e r cafita return of Customs and Excise revenue, £[2 os. 2d. In 1907-8 its estimated mean population had increased to 6,196,000, and its Customs and Excise revenue, approximately, to £[15,458,000, the f e r cafita return being £ 2 9s. n d . These statements show that the arguments advanced by the Treasurer, and the figures presented by him for the guidance of honourable members, are of no value. The population of a country may increase, but its f e r cafita return of Customs and Excise revenue does' not necessarily advance. are not of much value. supplied to the Treasurer by the Commonwealth Statistician in reply to a question put to him by the honourable member for Yarra, so that reliance may be placed upon them. What is the position in regard to Germany? For the last thirty years Germany has been a most pronounced Protective country, and under the policy of Protection has made substantial progress. In 1903-4 she had a population of 58,789,000, and ber Customs and Excise revenue amounted to £40,966,000, or a f e r cafita return of 13s. n d . lation had increased to 62,208,000; her Customs and Excise revenue had advanced to £[54,166,000-a n increase of £13,200,000-and the f e r cafita return of Customs and Excise revenue was 17s. sd. In all Protectionist countries the f e r cafita return of Customs and Excise revenue shows a tendency to decrease rather than to increase. If that be so, this Parliament, by binding the Commonwealth for all time to a f e r cafita return to the States of 25s. per annum, must either absolutely destroy the Protective policy of the country or impose heavy additional burdens on the people by resorting to borrowing. I invite honourable members to study these figures, and, having done so, to ask themselves what is their first duty. Is it to the Ministry of the day or to the people of Australia?

I Sitting susfended. from 6.30 to 7.45 f . m . two quotations relating to the f e r cafita allowance, and, as I do not desire to overload Hansard, I shall, without quoting the whole, merely give the returns from various nations from the very latest data, and allow those returns to speak for themselves. I do not select one or two nations or States in order to suit my own argument, but practically take the whole; and from the figures honourable members will see that, if the payment of 25s. per head be made, it will be impossible to finance the Commonwealth and the States without resorting to loan funds or to a revenue Tariff. In Russia, in 1906, with a population of 147,200,000, the total revenue from Customs and Excise was £52,170,000, or 7s. i d . per head; in Germany, in 1906, with a population of 60,499,000, the revenue was £[45,880,000, or 15s'. 2d. per head; in Italy, in 1907, I am quoting returns with a population of 33,641,000, the revenue was £33,234,000, or 19s. 9d. per head; in Austria-Hungary, in 1906, with a population of 47,941,000, the revenue was £49,037,000, or 25s. per head; in Sweden, in 1907, with a population of 53,580,000, the revenue was £55,528,000, o r £ i . os. 8d. per head; in Denmark, in 1907, with a population of 2,609,000, the. revenue was £ 2 , 8 5 5 , 0 0 0, or £ 1 is. i o d . per head; in Norway, in 1907, with a population of 2,319,000, the revenue was £ 2 , 6 5 6 , 0 0 0, or £ 1 2s. 1 i d . per head; in the UnitedI n 1907-8 her popuStates, in 1907, with a population of 85,150,000, the revenue was £125,590,000 , or £[1 9s. 6d. per head; in the United Kingdom, in 1907, with a population of 4 3 > 7 7 , , the revenue was £[68,818,000, 0 000 or £ 1 n s . 5d. per head; in France, in 1907, with a population of 39,260,000, the revenue was ,£65,193,000, or £ 1 13s'. 2d. per head; in Canada, in 1906, with a population of 5,833,000, the revenue was £12,516,000, or £ 2 2s. n d . per head; ancl in Australia, in 1908, with a population of 4,275,000, the revenue was £10,843,000, or £ 2 ios. 8d. per head. It will be seen that, with the five exceptions of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada,and Australia, it would be impossible for any of the countries that I have mentioned to make a payment of 25s. per head, seeing that the Customs and Excise revenue does not amount to so much, and in the five exceptions, 25s. per head is",40,Foster Th E Increase Ment That Would Keep The Control Of Com

Will it not be absolutely necessary, I ask the honourable gentleman, for the Commonwealth, in the immediate future, to take over the Northern Territory and give facilities for defence generally by. constructing a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek? as matters which will have to be dealt with immediately. The other matters to which I have alluded show that the expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing, and must, in the interests of the people, continue to increase year by year. That does not apply to the States in anything like the same ratio as it does to the Commonwealth. States of a considerable number of burdens, amd, as time rolls by, we shall relieve them of more. The national-expenditure must, of necessity, be larger than the State expenditure. I propose to give a ' few illustrations in order to justify my assertion as to the necessity for maintaining a Protective policy, and that if it is not maintained the revenue must diminish. Take Germany, France, ancl the United States, with the highest known Tariffs in the world; Tariffs purposely made high, in order to foster internal manufactures, and to promote the welfare of their own people: I have already shown how the per capita allowance, in the case of Germany 20s., in the case of France 25s., and in the case of the United States 26s., has been reduced. That deals effectively, from the Protectionist point of view, with' three undoubtedly known Protective countries, as against those which are not so Protective, and which I enumerated a little earlier. That the increase of State expenditure will be relatively smaller than the Commonwealth's as population increases, should, I think, go without saying. The expenditure of a State will not increase with each additional head of population. The Commonwealth expenditure will increase by -25s., per head, but the mere fact of an infant being born, or an immigrant' arriving, will [138] not increase the State expenditure by 25s. per head, or by anything like that sum. on the debt is £ 2 per head. ing with that phase of the subject, but with the per capita allowance and the increase COOK -The honourable in expenditure which must of necessity accompany Commonwealth and State extension, and I say that it will not increase relatively in the States as it will do in the Commonwealth. For instance, though the States might have a population half as large again as they have at present, that would not necessitate much more expenditure upon civil administration. They would not require many more magistrates, Judges, fire brigades, and so forth. Such functionaries and bodies are in existence now, and could deal with a population 100 per cent, larger than that for which they are required at present. So that the idea that an increased population would increase relatively the expenditure of the States is not borne Out by facts. The machinery of civil administration is already in existence, and that machinery We have already relieved the need not be materially increased as population grows. Let me quote an example from my own State. Under the proposal of the Government to pay 25s. per capita, New South Wales would receive .£1,875,000 per annum. If her population increased to 15,000,000, the Commonwealth would have to pay to her ,£18,750,000. It would be absurd to think of the Commonwealth paying so much. The Customs and Excise revenue would not be sufficient. able member think would be sufficient? of Australia desire that provision should be made for great national services, which are requisite to protect the interest of every man and woman in the country. member does not wish to return anything to the States. But the first consideration in the interests of the people of this country should be our national requirements. The money derived from Customs and Excise should first be applied to such purposes,' and whatever surplus remained should annually be returned per capita to the States.

Some of them are paying it out. of the sale of the public estate. Are any of them contributing to a sinking fund with the object of wiping out their debts? In my opinion, the States should be in such a position that when a loan became due they would be able to go to the money-lender, and if he refused to renew at a lower rate of interest, they would be able to say, "" We will pay you off."" But, so f a r as my knowledge goes, there is not one State that is in that position. For the most part, the interest is paid from the earnings of railways, and by the squandering of the public estate to the detriment of the people's interests. paid. about that; but it is very much easier to pay off a loan of £ 5 than one of £ 5 0 . The honourable member for Wilmot seems concerned as to how the interest due by the States is to be paid. I agree with those who think that that interest could be much more effectively paid by the Commonwealth Parliament taking control of the debts of the States, consolidating them, converting them, and assuming the responsibility for them. We should take over the whole of the debts, amounting to ^250,000,000, and, at the same time, we should take over the control of the railways of Australia. ber apparently cannot see the difference bewas believed at the time that Federation tween socialization and centralization. ways from the State Governments?

I believe, however, that the people of Australia will yet see the necessity of makingit a reality. We can have no real Federation with six different railway gauges. Should Australia be attacked, we should have no time to alter our railway gauges. Will honourable members contend that, if we adopted a uniform gauge throughout Australia, our railway systems could not be worked more economically than they are at the present time? 1 say that if we adopted a uniform gauge, and our railway systems were controlled from one centre, with deputies in the different States, they might be worked for very considerably less than they are at present. such a proposal is very much exaggerated. was proposed, the people did not desire, any more than they do now, that there should be twelve Houses of Parliament inaddition to the Commonwealth Parliament, The honourable memconducting the affairs of the country.

They control the railways, not in the interests of Australia as a whole, but in such a way as, if possible, to enable one State to secure trade which ought to go to another. member is aware that that might be remedied by an Inter-State Commission. Inter-State Commission could prevent the charging of preferential rates; but the honourable member must be aware that the Inter-State Commission could not control the construction of a mile of -railway -in Australia. We shall not properly develop Australia merely by constructing railways into certain districts. . One of the objects of their construction should be to create traffic. Produce can be grown profitably only where there is railway communication to the nearest and best market, and, under the provincial control of our railway systems, this method of development is not and will not be followed. This is proved I bave travelled over every Statei n the Commonwealth, and have made myself conversant with these matters. What is required is that the Commonwealth Parliament should assume responsibility for the £[9,000,000 of interest on the £250,000,00 0 of debts owing by the States, and should at the same time take over the railways. The people would profit by the adoption of such a course. If a railway is now earning £[1, the money goes back to the people in the form of reduced fares, or in some other way; and if under Commonwealth management the railway earned 30s., the same people would secure the increased advantage. I have never heard a valid argument against the control of the railways by the Commonwealth authority. I am sure that the honourable member for Parkes would say that, in commercial matters, it is possible to secure a higher profit and better control from the operations of a big concern than from the operations of a small one. I agree with that, and the argument holds good as applied to the control of our railways by one authority. Unfortunately, there are some honourable members who, while they are prepared to admit that these proposals are good, will not agree to them because they Socialism. I do not care twopence what term is applied to them; what we have to look at is the benefit to be derived from [i38]-2 the adoption of proposals of. the kind. I can quote for the honourable member for Parkes, as advocates of the same thing, some persons to whose opinions he will probably attach more weight than he will to mine. Sir George Turner, who was at one time Treasurer of the Commonwealth, stands high, at one of the Premiers' Conferences, made it a sine qua non that if the I recognise that an debts of the States were taken over by the Commonwealth, we should at the same time take over assets of the States equivalent in value. able member does not think that it is practicable to embody in this B ill a proposal for the taking over of the railways? could not be embodied in this B ill , but there is another B ill before the House. member is aware that the B ill provides for an investigation into the question of the transfer of the State debts.

We have before us an agreement, and from past experience we know that we cannot alter a line of it without the concurrence of the State Governments. vides for an investigation.

All true Protectionists, however, feel that the acceptance of the agreement will destroy Protection, and materially injure Australia.

What is the plea of those high-priests of Democracy, the Leader of the Labour party, the honourable member for Kennedy, and the honourable member for Riverina? It is that the people will not understand the position when the question is submitted to them; that we, the selected of the people, are more likely to come to a just conclusion than are the people themselves. That argument has been used by Tories in all parts of the world, whenever a proposal has been made to trust the people, either by an extension of the franchise or by means of a direct referendum. The proposal made by the Government is Democracy itself. It is a piece of DeT o that of the mamocracy which some of my honourable friends, while posing as Democrats, are afraid to put into operation.

Tbe whole head and front of the offending of the Government in this matter is that they propose that the people shall have an opportunity to review a question which they have already determined. The history of the Braddon section has been given over and over again, but there are one or. two points which yet remain to be stated. It has not yet been mentioned during this debate that the people of Australia had an opportunity to say whether or not three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue should be returned to the States for all time, and that in every State in which a vote was taken, a majority decided that it should. The Braddon clause as finally passed at the Melbourne Convention and submitted to the people, provided that three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue should be returned for all time to the States. other part of the Constitution Bill? MrM c WILLIAMS of the first referendum on the Constitution Bill as a whole, of which the Braddon clause formed a part. part. part. MrM c WILLIAMS portant that it led to the gerrymandering practised in the New South Wales Parliament which prevented effect being given to it. At the vote taken in New South Wales on the Constitution Bill as it left the Convention, 71,595 voted in favour of it , and 66,228 against it, a majority of 5,367. able member state what was the voting on the Constitution Bill as amended at the Premiers' Conference? MrM c WILLIAMS total of 107,420 voted for the Bill and 82,700 against it . a statutory majority voted for the B ill . whereas only 66,228 voted against the original B ill, 82,741 voted against the Bill as amended, with the time limit placed upon the operation of the Braddon clause. of 30,000 votes in favour of the B ill as amended. MrM c WILLIAMS The voting on the original B ill as it left dislocate the finances to the Convention was : In Victoria, 100,220 for the B ill and 22,000 against; in South Australia, 35,800 for and 17,300 against; and in Tasmania, 11,-794 for and only 2,716 against it . We know that the first referendum in New South Wales failed, not because a majority of the people of the State did not favour the Bill as originally passed, but because the statutory majority was not obtained. Those who are supporting this agreement say that since a majority of the people in each of the States voted for the Braddon clause as originally passed by the Convention, as well as for the clause as amended at the Premiers' Conference, they should have an opportunity to say now whether or not this alteration should be made^ I think we make a great mistake in our definition and use of the words ""States""; I much prefer the word ' ' people.'' We might compare the electors of the Commonwealth to one body of shareholders with two bodies of directors. Calls are made on the same body of shareholders; and now W h a t about the for ten years there has been a certain allocation of the funds in accordance with the I am speaking wish of the electors. That period has expired; and it is proposed to go back to the same electors, and ask them how the money shall be allocated in the future. If the Adelaide and Melbourne Conventions, they will find that the speakers, almost unanimously, pointed out that the salvation It was so imof the States depended on their securing a certain proportion of the revenue for all time. It is strange to hear Protectionist members arguing that the proposed agreement is going to k ill Protection, when we remember that it was the Free Trade members of the Convention who inserted the time limit, on the ground that otherwise ration compelled to put on such enormous duties as would seriously hamper the industrial conditions of the people.

MrM c WILLIAMS As yet, we have spent practically nothing on quarantine; and the only expenditure really that we have taken over is that on defence. pensions. when honourable members talk about relieving the States of old-age pensions, We must remember that the States never asked I also think that, as regards us to take over that obligation. Honourable members opposite accept all the kudos for having passed a Federal Old-age Pensions Act, and, at the same time, they look to the States to continue to pay the pensions That does not seem to me to indicate a very high political standard. As a matter of fact, we are leaving practicallv the whole of the liabilities with the' States. There is the interest on the national debt, say and the expenditure on hospitals and charities ; the latter of which, up to quite recently, more than equalled the expenditure on old-age pensions. Then we leave to work of Australia, in the form of roads, -bridges, ancl so for t h ; and I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that the functions retained by the We have States are very much more important to the future welfare of the country than are those which have been intrusted to the Commonwealth. ' I have the whole of the figures here; but have no desire to insert any more in Hansard, merely recommending honourable members to observe the liabilities which are still left to the States. It may, however, be interesting to honorI venture to able members to know that, in 1907-8, the expenditure on police was greater than that on defence. The former amounted to £1,192,330, or 5s. 8d. fer cafita, while the latter amounted to .£1,084,505, or 5s. 2d. fer c a f it a ; so that the States were really paying more f e r cafita on police than The people would have absolutely the Commonwealth was paying on defence. The posts and telegraphs and the railways may, I think, be left out of the calculation, because the receipts practically equal the expenditure.

We are now told by some honourable members that, in order to meet our requirements, it is necessary for the Commonwealth to retain the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. But I hold that it will be practically impossible for the States to carry on in the same condition unless the Commonwealth returns to them, at the very least, 25s. a head out of the Customs and Excise revenue Some honourable members have quoted the revenue of the United States, as the honourable member for Flinders did the other evening. Every man who has written on the subject closely has agreed that it has been practically a curse to the United States that it has retained the whole of the Customs revenue, while the States have been without revenue. We have heard that the United States is not able to carry on with its present Customs revenue. Only twice during the last century has it needed to im£ 1 on the annual value, the codlin-moth pose revenue duties. Its difficulty has been rate, and other rates. If we go into those to get rid of an enormous revenue. It has purchased tons and tons of silver ore, and stored it in vaults at Washington, ostensibly with a view to relieving the silver market, but really because it wanted to utilize its surplus revenue in some way, so that it would not have to reduce its Customs taxation. We know that whilst the Union has had more money than it required, the States have been on the very verge of bankruptcy, and to-day they are compelled to resort to all kinds of absurd forms of taxation in order to pay their way. A poll tax is a common tax. Owing to the inability of the States to carry out their legitimate functions, they have had to grant what Americans call franchises, but what we call concessions. Huge monopolies, which are really sucking the lifeblood out of the people, have been created in order to get works done. During the greater portion of their existence, the majority of the States have been put to the most severe strain to find the necessary reState cannot afford this small contribuvenue to carry out their legitimate functions, while the Treasury of the Union has been overflowing, and only twice during a century has the Union had to resort to revenue duties. The majority of honourable members have dealt with the condition of The Commonwealth affairs in their own States under the Federation. Before quoting a few figures in On its total connection with Tasmania, I ask those whc the Commonwealth spent think that the Commonwealth is making some concession to the smaller States, to enable them to carry out their legitimate functions, to remember that, sin-e Federation, some of the smaller States have had an exceedingly difficult task to perform. Tasmania has by far the heaviest land tax and the heaviest income tax in Australia, and even with the proposed grant of 25s. per capita from the Commonwealth, the Treasurer of the State has been obliged to propose a surtax of 25 per cent, on the land tax and on the income tax. Let us see how the figures for Tasmania compare with the figures for other States. In land tax, New South Wales pays, per capita, 2s. 5d.; Victoria, is. 5d.; Queensland, nil ; South Australia, 4s. 6d.; Western Australia, i o d . ; and Tasmania, 6s. 3d., which is brought up to nearly 8s. by the surtax of is. 7d. municipal taxes? include the municipal tax of is. in the matters, the discrepancy will be found to be very much greater. I should like the honourable member for Swan to remember that, whilst under this agreement he asks Tasmania to make a special contribution to Western Australia, the latter is paying, per capita, in land tax, iod., while the former pays nearly 8s. In income tax, New South Wales, pays per capita, 2s. 8d.; Victoria, 4s. n d . ; Queensland, 9s. 9d.; South Australia, ios. 5d.; Western Australia, 8s. 6d.; and Tasmania, ios. n d . , or with the surtax, 13s. 7jd.

In land and income taxes, Tasmania pays four times as much as New South Wales, and three times as much as Victoria. Yet we are told by some of the New South Wales representatives that their tion to the smaller States, because it would involve taxation upon their people.

291,Mr Henrv Willis,Does that include,52,Willis Wil L The Honor Free Trade Would Be Killed And The Fede
292,Mr Mcwilliams,"No; it does not the beginning to Tasmania receiving any special contribution from the Commonwealth. We do not want it . I objected tu my State coming into the Federation as a pauper. I object to her remaining as a pauper. But I do make this claim. It has been admitted that there is a leakage, estimated by fhe late Treasurer of 'lasmania at £[40,000 a year, through imported goods coming to Tasmania through Victoria, and, to a smaller extent, through New South Wales. The ex-Treasurer of the Commonwealth-the honourable member for Hume-estimate d the leakage at £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . If any special contribution is to be considered at all, it should take the form of a recognition of our just claim under that head. When the draft Constitution was being prepared, it was never intended that the bookkeeping section should remain in operation for more than five years. There can be no true Federation so long as the bookkeeping system continues. It is because the proposed agreement is based upon an entire separation of the nnances of the Commonwealth and of the States tnat I think it deserves the highest commendation from this Parliament, and I am sure it will receive the highest commendation from the people. But there can be no permanent basis except by making allowances for a continually increasing population. Any system which would anchor the contribution of the Commonwealth to the States for all time at a fixed sum, whilst there were fluctuating conditions in the different States, could not be considered. The bogy has been raised that, as population increases, the contribution of the Commonwealth to the States will become intolerable. The whole argument of the honourable member for Flinders was based on that consideration. He contended that as population increases the demands upon the Commonwealth will become greater and greater. Buti f the honourable member will give the matter a little further consideration, he will find that entirely the reverse will result. If there were a large influx of immigrants into Australia to-morrow-so '.long as they were workers; and the great proportion of immigrants would be breadwinners-eac h of them would consume goods returning Customs and Excise revenue to the extent of from £[4 to £ 5 per annum. Under the proposed agreement, the States would get 25s. per capita. If an immigrant, paid ,£4 per annum to Customs and Excise, as he must do to live honestly in this country, the proportion of his contribution retained by the Commonwealth would be ample for Federal purposes. Customs and Excise is only £[2 ios. . MrM c WILLIAMS The honourable member is speaking of the average paid by men, women, and children. But that is not a fair basis of calculation. Not one-half of the entire population of Australia are breadwinners. Mr W. H . IRVINE -We shall not pay the 25s. per capita on account of the breadwinners only, but on account of the men, women, and children. MrM c WILLIAMS I admit that, but the argument of the honourable gentleman was this: Thati f a tide of immigration were to set in here, as has been the case in Canada anjd the United States, the drain on Commonwealth funds would be more than we could stand. Mr W. H . IRVINE I think the honourable member misunderstood me. My argument was that as long as we could maintain the incomdng of immigrants at a certain rate, we should maintain the Customs revenue. MrM c WILLIAMS I think that we are making a very great mistake indeed in introducing the fiscal question into this debate. Our revenue from Customs and Excise will be just what this Parliament decides that it shall be; and Parliament will decide what the Customs and Excise revenue shall be in accordance with the wishes of a majority of the electors. No agreement which we can make will affect to the extent of £[1 per annum the fiscal policy of Australia. If there be a majority of the electors in favour of high duties such as we have at present, those high, duties will be retained. If there be a majority of the electors-and I am inclined to think that there is, even at the present time-wh o think that our duties have reached the highest limit to which the people of this country are prepared to submit, our Tariff will be no higher. If the majority of the electors say that there are certain revenue duties which can be imposed upon certain goodswithout interfering with the Protective policy of the country one iota, those revenue duties will be imposed; and I can see avenues from which we can obtain considerably increased returns from Customs and Excise, without touching one item in the Protective duties of the Tariff schedule.",52,Willis Wil L The Honor Free Trade Would Be Killed And The Fede

Buti f there is to be true responsible government in the Commonwealth, if the Government are to carry out their functions, and if it is really their duty to govern, they must accept the rule of honest responsible government, and cease to exist when they cease to govern. That is the one rule under which we can carry on the government of the country with a system such as ours.

MrM c WILLIAMS it, although I think the Government have struck an exceedingly hard bargain with the State Premiers. Prime Minister and his colleagues who took part in the Conference represented the Commonwealth honestly and honorably. If there is a fault to be found with them it is that they held the Treasury bills over the heads of the Premiers to obtain from them the very best terms they could possibly get. I believe that the Prime Minister acted to the best of his ability as a representative of the Commonwealth, that he did not consider the State Premiers any more than he ought to have considered them, and that, in fact, the bargain he struck with them was an exceedingly hard one. But the bargain was a compromise on both sides. We know that the State Premiers asked for a good deal more than 25 s. per head. We know that they agreed to accept such a payment only on the condition, not that it should be embodied in the Constitution, as some honourable members are so fond of saying, but that the people should be allowed to say whether it should be embodied in the Constitution or not. they otherwise would get less. MrM c WILLIAMS The honourable member for Gwydir, like many other honourable members, is in favour of the referendum so long as the dice are loaded. When they think the numbers will be with them they are in favour of the referendum, but' when they find that it is possible the numbers will not be with them we have the Party and ultra Democracy saying that it is not safe to allow this to go to the people If the honourable by referendum', because they would not understand it . a real referendum.

MrM c WJLLI AMS -The abnormal amount is due to the abnormal conditions which surround all new gold-fields in new countries; but no State has ever yet recognised that fact in framing its calculations, or imposing its taxation.

323,Mr Henry Willis,"I s not that betterbeen very little improvement in the cost of living in Tasmania since Federation. -Previously, we imported large quantities of aiticles, such as boots. Whether they came from England, America, or Victoria, they all paid the same duty. We now obtain the same boots from Victoria, the English and American goods being shut out,' and we receive no Customs revenue from that source, although the price of boots in Tasmania remains practically the same. While the price of living has not decreased, direct taxation has doubled in Tasmania since Federation, whereas direct taxation in New South Wales has been considerably reduced. T do not blame the Government of New South Wales for having reduced the taxation levied upon its people the moment that it was in a position to do so. Nothing can justify a Government in collecting revenue which it does not need. But, in Tasmania, the position is entirely different. Whereas, under the Commonwealth Tariff, New South Wales doubled her revenue from Customs and Excise, the revenue of Tasmania from that source decreased by 50 per cent. In addition, the latter State has had to double its direct taxation, and to institute a rigorous system of retrenchment. The number of members of tbe Tasmanian Parliament has been considerably reduced, and, in view of the fact that they receive only £ 1 0 0 a year, whilst Ministers are paid only £600 or £[650 per annum, that State cannot be accused of extravagance. other, developmental work has been retarded for lack of funds, and the salaries of public servants have been considerably reduced, notwithstanding that they 'were previously lower than those paid in any other State.

It will be a good thing for the Commonwealth when it is called upon to foot the bill for its own expenditureHitherto, we have had an unlimited purse upon which to draw, and we have been accustomed to return the balance to the States. I maintain that any Bill proposing expenditure ought to be accompanied by a Bill relating to Ways and Means. When the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill was introduced, honourable members should have been shown how the cost of administering that Territory was to be financed. A similar remark is applicable to the establishment of a Federal Capital and the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. That would be the greatest guarantee that the people could have against extravagance It has been said that the Government ought not to make the proposed agreement a party question.

Franklin, however, whether instructed by the Government or not, has made it clear that we are expected to deal with it on party lines. I hope that on such imones, the wisdom of the House will allow proposals to be dealt with on their merits. While I have the honour of a seat here, I shall so deal with them. Therefore, I intend to vote for fhe motion. Ever since I have been in this Parliament, I have favoured a per capita distribution of Customs and Excise revenue. We have not had a true Federation .during the past nine years. It was understood that with Federation we should have one people, one destiny, one flag, and one purse. It was thought that Federation, by providing for the consolidation of the debts of the States, would bring about a large saving in interest. I do not propose to discuss the liabilities of the States, or their expenditure. Those are questions for their Governments and Parliaments and their electors. Neither shall I, in dealing with the question, as it concerns us, make use of a # great mass bf figures. Mr Knibbs' publications have been pretty thoroughly overhauled during the past few weeks. Dozens' The of tabular statements have been quoted, so that any one who attempts ""to read the figures which have been given in the speeches of honourable members must become thoroughly bewildered in time. Indeed, the Treasurer and the honourable Although always talking about member for Flinders arrived at different conclusions from the same set of figures. We have been sent here to do what we think best in the interest of the Commonwealth, and it is absurd to suggest that any one of us would seek to injure the States. Yet the Treasurer, this afternoon, charged the honourable member for Hume with wishing to do so. The' electors of the States would soon deal with any one who acted contrary to their well-being. The Prime Minister has asked us to trust the people, and I am willing to trust them, not only in this matter, but also in regard to unification. He will not put that question to them, although, if it is right to refer one matter to them, it is right to refer others of equal importance. I was opposed to the Draft Constitution Bill, because I favoured unification.

Buti f the Constitution is amended, to make the agreement perpetual, it will subsequently be difficult to effect any alteration, should that be deemed necessary, because such an amendment requires the consent of a majority of the people and of a majority of the States. I do not think that the Commonwealth can afford to pay more than 25s. per capita to the States. If 1 did, I would vote for a larger payment. But I do not agree with the honourable member for Franklin that the Commonwealth has been extravagant. When the right honourable member for East Sydney moved a motion of want of confidence in the last Deakin Administration, he charged it with neglecting to expend a sufficient sum. on postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services, and with saving up money to return to the States. that Government, knowing the necessities of the States, did right in assisting them as much as it could. The position of the Commonwealth and the States is very much like that of individuals. Every man, as a general rule, would like to spend more than he is able to do, but -he finds' that he must live according to his income, and consequently has to go without many things that he would like to have. And so with the Commonwealth. Wc could have expended with advantage much more than we have done on the extension of postal and telegraphic services, just as the States could expend a great deal of money on the construction of railway's, roads, and bridges, if they had more at their disposal. As it is, they have to go slowly, and take advantage of the opportunities offering. The Commonwealth, in my opinion, did right in returning to the States as much as possible. If I were a member of a State Government, I should certainly be prepared to trust the Commonwealth, but we know that, unfortunately, in sections of the press nnd elsewhere, charges of extravagance are made for party purposes, sometimes against the States, and occasionally against certain members of the Federal Legislature. It would be a mistake, however, to bind the Commonwealth for all time to a per capita payment, of 25s. per annum to the States. 1 sbould certainly be in favour of such payment being made for the next ten years, and rather than that the agreement should be lost to us altogether, I should vote for its continuance for twenty or thirty years. As the honourable member for. Parkes pointed out, we know more now concerning [!39] the finances of Australia than we did eight years ago, and our experience will be still broader ten years hence. If we agreed to make a per capita payment to the States of 25s. per annum lor ten years, we should be able, at the end of that term, to decide whether that. pa> ment should be continued, or whether it should be increased or reduced. We should then be able, if we found that the arrangement was endangering the Protectionist policy of Australia, to vary its terms. I should certainly be prepared to trust the people and their representatives to do what isright at'the end of the ten years' period. The States ought to be satisfied with such a proposal, remembering that the State and the Federal Legislatures are elected by the same people, and that if we do not treat the States fairly, the people will have the power t.o select men who will. In ray view, Members of Parliament might do wrong for' a year or two, but, as soon as their masters -the people-discovere d that they were doing so, they could promptly bring about a change. A few years ago in Tasmania the electors rejected the whole of the Ministry of the day, and returned only one or two of their supporters. It cannot be denied that this is one of the most important measures that has been brought before us, both from the stand-point of Federal expenditure and the relations of the Commonwealth to the States. The transfer of the State debts is associated with this question, to a certain extent, although . it is, dealt with in a separate measure, and it ii: certainly one of the highest importance. During the Federal campaign, the people were told that, as a result of Federation, the expenditure of tbe States would be reduced, and that by the transfer of the debts alone a saving of about £1,000,000 per annum would be effected. In the circumstances, therefore, one cannot help regret-: ting that the transfer has not been made before, and that the strife of party should have raged so long. Instead of dealing with the financial question, as business men do, and endeavouring to effect savings in the interests of the people, we have been fighting,, party against party. It may be asked,. "" Why should we not make this payment to the States for all time?"" in this connection, let me say that I hope before many years to see many changes in AustraUa. I hope to see the day when the railways of the States will be controlled, if not by the Commonwealth, at least unitedly for Australia. As the honourable member for Riverina said in reply to an interjection, if we had a uniform railway gauge all over Federal Parliament, ten years hence, seeks Australia it would be unnecessary, for into deal unfairly by the States, it will be stance, for passengers travelling by rail for the people to change its' personnel, and from Melbourne to Sydney to change on to return men who will do what is test for reaching the New South Wales border, and Australia as a whole. in one State, supplies could be speedily adjourned. obtained from another. About this time last year, on the occasion of the visit of the American Fleet, the railway carriages in Victoria were not sufficient to cope with the traffic. If we had had a uniform gauge, a supply could have been obtained from New South Wales, and in other ways savings could have been effected. If we had. a uniform system, great savings might be made in connection with haulage and in other directions. I hope, also, to see the day when Australia will be far more self-contained than, it is. If the Protectionist Tariff is to have the desired effect, instead of importing manufactured goods from other countries, we shall be largely making them for ourselves. Manufacturers from abroad will be establishing works here, and in lhat way Australia will become more self-contained, with the result that her Customs revenue will be reduced. In the circumstances, therefore, I think'it desirable that the proposed agreement should have only a ten years' currency. At the end of that period the people could be trusted to deal with the whole question in a business-like. way. I do not see why we should not be a self-ccntained -community. We are going to manufacture our own small-arms, and build our own warships. Why should we not manufacture here everything that we require ? We have, for instance, land that will produce cotton,' . and the power to manufacture it into piece goods. This fair 'land of ours possesses -great possibilities, and if the legislators of Australia would only deal with this question in a straightforward, business-like manner, the whole country would be benefited.
