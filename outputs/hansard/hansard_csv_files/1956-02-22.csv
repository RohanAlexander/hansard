Minister a question concerning the legislation known as the Ministers of State Bill 1956, which was recently considered by this House. Has the Government decided to alter that legislation and not to press on with the proposal to increase the salaries of four Ministers of State, which is to be one effect of the legislation ? that legislation is now before another place where, no doubt, it will be dealt with. IN JAPAN. a question that I now direct to the Minister for the Army, I point out that a few days ago an allegation was made by an Australian Army sergeant that there were 200 or 300 children in Japan whose fathers were Australians and whose mothers have been left without support. Will the Minister make an investigation to see whether this allegation, which was made at a court-martial, is correct and, if it is correct, will he advise the Parliament what practical help can be given to the children ? I ask that question because I believe that this country has some obligations in the matter-if not legal obligations, then certainly moral obligations. answer the question. The honorahle member's question is a rather strange one because, although such allegations have been made from time to time about Australian forces in theatres of war overseas, and elsewhere, it has never been assumed that they were correct. Indeed, to that extent, no action has ever been taken by an Australian government to conduct such an investigation as has been suggested by the honourable member. I will certainly have a look at the matter, and if I find that there is a necessity for an investigation to be carried out, I will see that it is carried out. Treasurer that it is now over a month since he announced the terms on which two private trading banks, one Australian and one foreign, could engage in the business of savings banking. Can the Treasurer say when he will reply to the request by the Premier of New South Wales for the State trading bank also to be allowed to engage in the business of savings banking? Can he explain why he was able to make an announcement after two months' consideration in the case of the private banks, but has not yet done so after three months in the case of the State bank? Is he withholding an announcement, as he did in the case of the trading banks, until the afternoon before the State bank opens for savings bank business ? alleged application from the Premier of New South Wales could only be made by means of a communication between the Premier and the Prime Minister. The matter has not come forward in that way. The New 'South Wales Government is a party to an agreement that has been entered into with the Commonwealth Government. If the terms of that agreement are to be varied or modified in any way, that must be done at the request of, and by way of negotiations entered into on a proper basis by the Premier of New Soutb Wales with this Government. Mr R. W. HOLT I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question with reference to the projected visit of Australian Victoria Cross winners to the United Kingdom. In view of the fact that the Victorian Government has agreed to contribute half of the cost of such visit for each Victoria Cross winner, will the Prime Minister say whether the Commonwealth Government will assist in this laudable honour, conferred by Her Majesty the Queen on these heroes, by making a contribution on a £ 1-for-£l basis",6,Setup

The actual mechanism of import licensing control is still, by arrangement between the Minister for Customs and Excise and myself, being continued by the Department of Customs and Excise until the 31st March next. However, in conjunction with the Government's general policies, I , with my colleagues, will be making a study of all the poliey implications of import licensing. Nevertheless, it is not to be overlooked that no matter how worthy or how desirable cases may be, the facts are that we are constrained in this matter by the sheer arithmetic of the overseas resources of foreign exchange that we have. There is no escape from that. Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the British Government is shortly to conduct atomic tests in Australia, and in view of the fact also that the true significance and nature of this new development should be known to as many people as possible, it would be practicable, consistent, of course, with security, for representative members of the Australian community to have the opportunity of viewing tliese te3ts and certainly for honourable members of this House, I think preferably drawn from both sides of the House, to have the opportunity of viewing them. by the honourable member commends itself to me in principle. There are, perhap3, mechanical problems that I would need to discuss. For example, one test might be incapable of observation except from the sea, and that would necessarily affect the possibility of having spectators. Other tests might be conducted on land, where the problems would be much simpler. However, the honourable member may take it that I shall discuss with my colleagues the possibility of having honourable members put in a position to witness these experiments, provided that the mechanical problems can be overcome and suitable conditions are observed. tion is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. The Minister will know that Queensland is quickly becoming a major exporter of wheat. Last year, owing to bumper crop3, there were considerable problems associated with the storage of export wheat. Will the Minister advise me whether his new department is watching the position and whether adequate storage will be provided in Queensland, and in other States, for this year's and next year's crops? ago, a paper was prepared, I think for the Australian Agricultural Council, dealing with the problem of the storage of both this year's and next year's wheat crops. I think the problem arose because of the fact that this year there will be an export surplus of about 110,000,000 bushels, so that the crop will be a big one for Australia. I think that in every State, with the possible exception of Western Australia, storage facilities will be just about adequate. In Western Austraiia, the position will be rather tight. I should not like to take the part of a prophet and try to forecast seasonal conditions or the acreage that might be planted next year, but I can assure the honourable member that this problem is receiving constant attention and will not be forgotten. I should like to mention to him also that only recently the Australian Government approved experiments in new methods of air-tight storage, both above and below ground, and an expert from Western Australia visited the Argentine to ascertain whether the latest methods used there could be employed in Australia. I am aware of the honourable member's interest in this problem. If he wants further information on it, he can ask me, and I shall give him a detailed reply. the Prime Minister.

That distinguishes their situation from that in which non-British potential immigrants are placed. Even if those persons are able to pay the full fare themselves, they must still obtain a sponsor and secure observations, the test would be when these the approval of the Department of Immigration before they can come to Australia. In addition to permitting British people to come here at any time if they are willing to pay their own fares, we have a scheme of assisted passages, on which no limitation of numbers has been placed, for those who can secure nominators in Australia. Further, we have introduced a scheme of government nomination for cei'tain British people who, though lacking sponsors, are still, in our opinion, of such value to a developing country that we have included them in a government sponsorship scheme and given them accommodation of a temporary nature in our hostels. It will be seen, therefore, that British immigrants continue to enjoy not only first priority from this Government, but the most favoured treatment of any nationals. formed the House earlier that my colleague, the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride), is, unfortunately, in hospital. He has undergone an operation and will be absent from his duty for some w eeks. In his absence, he will be represented by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison). External Affairs) -by leave-When I last spoke in the House about foreign affairs the meeting in Geneva of the heads of government of Great Britain, France, the TJnited States of America and the Soviet TJnion was not long over and the world was going through a state of at least temporary optimism. Thp Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and I had both felt it necessary in public statements to recommend caution in coming to too rosy conclusions at that time. I told tbe House that it would be premature to assume that all was well by reason of the Soviet smiles at Geneva. These reservations have unfortunately been justified by what has happened-and what has not happened-sinc e then. I said that, though the heads of government had been able to agree on certain general general statements had to be applied to particular issues such as German unity, European collective security, East-West contacts and disarmament. The first testing times have passeda session of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, the November meeting of Foreign Ministers, and the recent General Assembly of the United Nations. All these meetings have shown that, when it conies down to specific issues, the Communist attitude is fundamentally unchanged from what it was before the heads of government met at Geneva. It is now clear that the Russians meant to reduce surface tensions only, witliout giving way on any of the specific matters that created the tensions. Lot us look at tliose specific issues. Although many of these matters directly concern the European area, the results of them have direct relationship to our own situation. The Asian area is part of the whole world picture, and is influenced by events and tendencies occurring anywhere in the world. The minds of men in Asia are influenced by the apparent successes or the apparent failures of the democratic side or the Communist side in any part of the world. With instantaneous, world-wide communications, the minds of people in any particular area are influenced by events in any part of the world. The minds of uncommitted individuals in Asia are swayed by democratic successes or Communist gains in lountries half the world away. The battle for men's minds in South-East Asia is not a self-contained one. The free world is one, and is faced with an aggressive antagonist that never sleeps. On the question of the unification of Germany, the Russians have made it quite clear that they will not agree tn the unification of Germany through free, all-German elections. They are, in fact, more interested in keeping the eastern part of Germany nnder Communist.",19,British Immigrants

59,Mr Casey (La Trobe,"Minister fordomination titan in permitting German unity in freedom. And until there is agreement in Germany, there can hardly be any agreement on the second big outstanding question in Europe-collectiv e security. The next question before the Foreign Ministers in Geneva was disarmament. There, too, practically no progress has been made either in Geneva or elsewhere. I will speak about this great problem of disarmament again a little later. The Foreign Ministers had also been asked to consider the development of closer contacts between the Communist and non-Communist countries, in order to make some advance towards peaceful co-existence. No advance was made on this, in spite of strenuous efforts by the Foreign Ministers of the three democratic countries. The inescapable conclusion is that the Communist countries are afraid of free, uncensored contact between their peoples and ours. They fear that the rigid, controlled regimes that they have built up cannot stand the light of free intercourse and discussion. What we can say is that, since the death of Stalin, Communist tactics in international affairs have changed, but the basic philosophy and objectives remain. The aim is still world domination. In this new phase of East-West relations, Communist pressure on tbe free world is being vigorously exerted in new and more subtle forms, which are harder to detect and harder to counter. The crude assertion of Soviet power has given way to more subtle methods, by which communism seeks to present itself in the most attractive light to the non-Communist governments and to the ordinary people of all countries. Indeed, the Communists themselves scarcely bother to conceal that, whilst they have turned away from crude forms of expansion, their basic aim of world domination is unchanged. Mr border incidents or provocative action by Khrushchev himself has made this clear in a speech to the Supreme Soviet of the TJnion of Soviet Socialist Republics on the 29th December-onl y eight weeks ago. He saidIf certain politicians think that our conIsrael problem seems possible unless fidence in the victory of socialism, in the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, is a violation of the Geneva spirit, they obviously have an erroneous notion of that spirit. They ought to remember, once and for all, that we have never gone back and never will go back on our ideas, on our struggle for the victory of communism. They need never expect any ideological disarming on our part. This question of the ultimate aims of communism is a matter of the highest importance. If words mean what they say, then the Communists have never wavered from 1917 to the present day in their aim of communizing the world in due course. There are those who say that practically every faith has begun by airing its determination to become universal and by expressing intolerance and hostility towards other faiths, but that, in the course of time, this attitude has smoothed off into tolerance and more or less friendly co-existence with other faiths. Those who use this parallel say that we should not be too much concerned at the sinister Communist threats of world domination. Such a comfortable philosophy might be all very well at some time in the future when the beginnings of such tolerance were in sightbut this is not so to-day-and it would be suicidal folly for us to let down our guard in to-day's circumstances. In the meantime, the Communists are going all out to win a new place for themselves, particularly in Asia and in the Middle East. In these areas, they are using the Communist tactics, so frankly expounded by Lenin, which make use of nationalist movements, merely as a prelude to their destruction and the ultimate imposition of open Communist domination. Let me say a word about the tense and dangerous situation in the Middle East. Australia's interest in the stability of the Middle East is long established. Now, as a member of the Security Council, Australia is directly concerned in the efforts of the TJnited Nations to solve the ArabIsrael problem. At this stage, every effort must be made to avoid further either side. This was our objective in the Security Council discussion a month ago, when we joined in a resolution of censure upon Israel for its action against Syria in the Lake Tiberias region. But no permanent settlement of the Arabmutual fears can be reduced, and Israel's right to exist is recognized by her neighbours. On the other hand, Israel has an obligation in respect of the tragic situation of nearly 1,000,000 Arab refugees from what is now Israel. Each side must recognize that the other has interests, and that the reconciliation of interests is something negotiable either within or outside the United Nations. Fear is a dangerous thing and the present situation is explosive. It is being exploited by the Soviet Union, which has abandoned any pretence of impartiality and is endeavouring to mislead Arab people into the belief that the Soviet Union alone is their friend. Soviet Russia has also tried to promote discord in respect of the Kashmir question. The Russian leaders spoke recently as if the Kashmir question was already settled, thereby prejudging an issue which is before the United Nations Security Council and which cannot be brought nearer a solution by gratuitous and partisan intervention by outside countries. The Security Council has endorsed the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite under United Nations auspices to decide the disposition of Kashmir. Both parties have agreed in principle to accept this method, but have unfortunately not been able to agree on the way to put it into effect. Australia's concern is to see this outstanding issue between two Commonwealth countries settled by peaceful means which give full weight to the wishes of the people of the disputed territory. The United Nations resolutions point the way to such a settlement; the Soviet intervention, which shows a complete disregard for established processes of peaceful adjustment through the United Nations, cannot fail to make the search for a permanent settlement more difficult. Let us look at the record more generally. Throughout the world the Communists denounce "" colonialism "" and "" imperialism "". This is good international political talk and a. good deal of sympa thy can be gained by so doing. A century ago thc Russian author Turgenev wroteI f you wish to put your enemy in the wrong or to damage his reputation, blame him for the very vice which you feel in yourself. This is exactly what the Communists do when they denounce "" colonialism"". Yet it is the Soviet Union which can be regarded as the new imperialism. The simple fact is that the Soviet Union is the only country which emerged from the Second World War with increased territory-in Europe and in Asia. If colonialism means-as I believe it means-the subjecting of people of one nationality or religion to the rule of another, then there is no doubt that there is in the world to-day only one great colonial empire-that of Russia. All the bad features of nineteenth century colonialism-whic h for the West is a thing of the past-ar e to be found in Moscow's rule over the populations, both inside and outside the Soviet borders, whom it has reduced to what can only be called a colonial status. The results of this new imperialism may be seen in the systematic destruction of the national life of the Baltic republics, of the Eastern European countries, and in the exploitation of the Asian republics of the Soviet Union. Russia's Central Asian dominions, nearly 4,000,000 square miles of territory lying northwards of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, include five Soviet republics with a total population of nearly 17,000,000 people. The Soviet constitution guarantees to each of the republics which make up the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a long and superficially impressive list of rights, including the right to secede from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In practice, these rights do not exist. In all matters, great and small, they are rigidly controlled from Moscow. Their administrations and economic machinery are filled with Russians in key posts. Every care is taken to ensure that their economies remain dependent on that of Russia. Everywhere Russians and the Russian language enjoy a privileged position. Local national feeling and the Muslim religion are persecuted as "" reactionary "". This is the work of the real "" colonialism "" of our time. While the Soviet Union has been making its presence felt in southern Asia, the policy of the Chinese partner in the Communist coalition has been developing along similar lines. The Peking regime has made many declarations of peaceful intent, and, since the Bandung conference, which marked a turning point in Chinese Communist tactics, its official statements and propaganda have assumed an apparent air of moderation. Again, however, there has been little sign of a genuine willingness to compromise or negotiate contentious major issues. Although the Chinese Communists have made many declarations of peaceful intent since last year, they do not seem to have changed their policy on Formosa ancl the Pescadores, and on the off-shore islands which have been the centre of friction for some time. Indeed they have openly stated that they are prepared to "" liberate "" Formosa by force, if necessary, and that they are pressing ahead with preparatory work for this purpose. Until we know with more certainty that Peking has renounced the use of force and subversion in the Formosa area and towards the countries of South-East Asia, it is difficult to see how progress can be made. It is sometimes suggested that the "" realistic "" course would be to recognize the Peking regime as the Government of China and as the legitimate representative of China at the United Nations. At this stage, I shall merely say that it does not appear "" realistic"" to abandon to the mercy of the Communists the island of Formosa with the Eepublic of China Government and 8,000,000 anti-Communist inhabitants, which is in effect what the Communists continue to demand. Such is the attitude which the Communist bloc presents to the free world. In the light of the events of the last twelve months, I would believe that the probabilities of the immediate future are as follows:1. There is not much likelihood of a global nuclear war breaking out in the early future. However, this is only true so long as the democratic The vast expenditure on armed forces and nations can demonstrate that they aro both able and willing to resist aggression. Consequently, it is essential for the democratic nations to maintain their defences at an adequate level and to preserve and develop collective security arrangements for mutual defence. 2. The abandoned, for the present at least, the pursuit of their aims by military means, have now intensified their attempts to spread their influence by other means, not only through propaganda and subversion, but also through more conventional diplomatic techniques. 3. The main regions which the Communists are attempting to penetrate at present are South-East Asia and the Middle East. 4. The maintenance of world peace at present depends in large part on the fact that nuclear weapons cannot be used aggressively without the certainty of destructive retaliation. Communist propaganda will continue to hammer on the theme of "" ban the atomic bomb "". The Communists know that if nuclear weapons were abolished, they would, through their great armies and air force, have a superiority in conventional weapons and thus be in a better position to enforce their demands by orthodox military means. 5. In democratic countries the Communist tactics are now to use fair words and smiling faces to instil a comfortable and misleading sense of security. In Europe, as in Asia, the Communists call for popular fronts, co-operation among forwardlooking men of goodwill, and all the rest. One has only to read Australian Communist newspapers like the Tribune to see how the ""popular front "" line is being dutifully trumpeted by Communists and fellow travellers in Australia. It is all part of a world-wide pattern. It is clear that, in the face of the Communist offensive, an essential part, though by no means the only part, of the free world's strength must be armed strength. armaments throughout the world is one of the basic problems of our time. The world is oppressed with a burden of warlike preparation. In the hydrogen bomb, there has been developed for the first time a weapon capable of mutual obliteration. The division of the world between Communist and free countries, with the Communists, having hydrogen bomb in possession of each side, represents the limit in mutually destructive possibilities. This dreadful dilemma leads some people to believe that the solution lies in a simple banning of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The monopoly of nuclear weapons which the West enjoyed for some years was itself almost a guarantee of peace. No realist aggressor will move against an adversary that he knows to be greatly stronger than himself in retaliatory capacity. ""West European defensive strength was built under the protection of Western atomic power. But the Western monopoly of atomic-hydrogen weapons is no more. Bussia possesses the hydrogen bomb. It is clear that a saturation point will be reached in the near future, if indeed it has not already come, when each, in any all-out war, would inevitably destroy the other. It is thus more vital than ever before that war should be avoided. It is clear that Bussia, as well as the West, recognizes this. The Bussian leaders would not lightly risk their own destruction and that of their country. On the 3rd November, 1953, in the House of Commons, Sir Winston Churchill said. . . I have sometimes the odd tliought that the annihilating character of these agencies may bring an utterly unforeseeable security to mankind . . . . . . when the advance of destructive weapons enables every one to k ill everybody else nobody wiii want to k ill any one at all. To the Communists, the present situation is an opportunity for attempted expansion by all means short of the risk of a great war. This is a highly dangerous situation. A peace founded on a balance of terror is a fragile thing. It is at the mercy of mistakes and miscalculations, which have so often precipitated wars before. The border incident, the inevitable reprisal, the reaction to that-and things may have gone too far to draw back. Then the Bussian use of the veto in the Security Council, and the chain reaction of understandable human action and reaction-and a great war may have started from small beginnings. Surrounded by tinder, the Communist leaders persist in playing recklessly with fire, in all the troubled areas of the world. As their recent actions combine to show, they will constantly pursue their aim of expansion by all means short of raising the international temperature beyond the decisive flash point. If they avoid any fatal miscalculation, the problem that remains for the free world is still very great. It is essential for the democracies to retain the deterrent power of nuclear weapons as long as they remain in the hands of the Communists. But this is not enough. Mutual ability to deter all-out war may be regarded by the Communists as a kind of umbrella beneath which they can bite off pieces of the free world without the risk of provoking full-scale retaliation. Although the defence of the free world is far more than a military problem, it is essential that the military strength of the free world must be of something like the same order as that of the Communists. The strength of the democratic countries must be varied and flexible. To rely exclusively on atomic and hydrogen weapons would be folly. If a bee lands on your friend's neck you are poorly placed to help him if your only weapon is a sledge hammer. A shield of conventional forces is still necessary to meet the threat of piecemeal aggression, for which the Communists, with their great land armies, are so well equipped. We must avoid a situation in which the It may be that aggressor enjoys freedom to choose the time, the place and the scope of conflict resulting from aggression. He will be robbed of that freedom only if those that are menaced are prepared to retaliate at any time on the scale appropriate to the aggression. The ideal would be to be able to rely on the United Nations to deter, or to cope with, aggression. This is not possible, for reasons that we all know, so that we have had to create machinery consistent with the Charter, but outside the scope of the veto. A series of regional mutual defence arrangements has been established, based on the right of individual and collective self-defence, which is consistent with the United Nations Charter. Australia is taking a constructive part in developing such collective defence machinery. At the heart of the grand alliance of free nations are the United Kingdom and the United States, linked with others through Nato and with others again through Seato. The present absence of open conflict in the world has been possible only because of the constructive and generous way in which these two great partners have used their strength and resources to serve the free world as a whole. It is of vital interest to Australia and every other free country that Britain ancl America should maintain and strengthen their great partnership with each other and with other likeminded nations. I have spoken of the dangers of Communist armed strength ancl what must be done to counter it : But, you may say, rather than thinking in terms of counterthreats, should we not be devoting ourselves to an effort to remove the dreadful threat of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth? Since the hydrogen bomb carries within it the greatest possible danger to mankind, would it. not be logical and right to get rid of it? The answer to. this simple question is not so easy as the Communists want us to believe. First of all, it would be folly to enter into agreements to ban nuclear weapons without a water-tight and mutual system of inspection and detection of stocks of nuclear material. At present, it is the fact that, as the Soviet the existence of nuclear weapons, our Government has itself admitted, science has not yet discovered any sure way of detecting stocks of nuclear weapon material. An agreement to destroy or ban nuclear weapons would to-day be no more than an exchange of paper pledges between the democratic and Communist countries. It is obvious which side would be taking tbe greater risk. Pledges and undertakings are worthless if there are no means of ensuring that they are carried out, just as laws are worthless if there are no policemen. Secondly, even if nuclear weapons did not exist, the Communist bloc would have a vast preponderance of conventional strength. There can be no question of abandoning or limiting the use of nuclear weapons unless we have achieved a properly supervised and controlled reduction of conventional arms and forces to better balanced ancl much lower levels. An examination of last year's Russian disarmament plan does not encourage any one to believe that an early agreement for such a reduction is likely. So that nuclear disarmament is, for the time being, impossible. I emphasize "" for the time being"". Every effort is being made in the free world to find some means of detecting nuclear material that would be capable of being policed. Meanwhile, can nothing be done internationally to reduce the burden of armaments and the risk of war? The answer is that it certainly could, given goodwill on both sides. President Eisenhower's "" open skies"" plan sought to guard against massive surprise attacks and so reduce the danger of general war, thus creating an atmosphere of increased trust that might make further progress possible. The Russian leaders have shown no constructive interest in this remarkable offer. Indeed, it may well be that the Russians have concluded that the Soviet Union runs no risk of being attacked by surprise by the democracies. No democratic nation thinks in terms of aggressive war"" preventive "" or otherwise. I believe that the lifting of the iron curtain would advance the prospect of disarmament. Given that we cannot have foolproof scientific systems of detecting objective must be to find other bases for trust. We might create sufficient trust to proceed further with disarmament if we had ready access to each other's territory and free discussion and observation by people of all walks of life. But again it is the Communists-no t we-wh o have the power to unlock this door. Other hopeful plans have been put forward-bu t nothing from the Soviet side that will begin to stand up to examination. Australia is a member of the United Nations Disarmament Commission and is participating actively in the search for practicable and enforceable disarmament measures, but it would be suicidal for the West to reduce its own defences without being sure that the Communists were doing likewise. I have spoken about the United Nations, which in its first ten years has become a unique and indispensable factor in world affairs. We have just had the benefit of a visit by the distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Hammarskjoeld, which provided opportunities for many stimulating and useful discussions. The plus and the minus of the United Nations are well known. It cannot be sure to stop wars breaking out, or be at all sure of stopping them when they have started. Nor have the public deliberations of the United Nations always tended to reduce international tensions and frictions. The United Nations cannot counteract the corrosive effects of the cold war. United Nations machinery can be fully effective only if all those who operate it show goodwill, as its freeworld members do. Nonetheless, even with these limitations, it has a valuable role to play. Its authority and effectiveness may be expected to increase in future, and Australia will continue to support it. One important recent development was tbe admission of sixteen new members, which we warmly welcomed and for which we worked actively. Unfortunately, Japan was not admitted, but it is hoped that her entry will not be long delayed. The admission of the new members makes it logical to enlarge tbe Security Council ancl remedy the present situation in whicb no Asian country outside the Commonwealth is likely, in practice, to get on to the council. At the same time we do not favour any increase in the numbers of permanent members of the Security Council. Australia strongly objected to the use of the veto in questions relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and in the admission of new members. This use of the veto has in many instances prevented the Security Council from playing its full part in the maintenance of international peace and security, and has frequently frustrated the wishes of the majority of the United Nations. To extend permanent membership of the council so that the power of veto in its present tial changes in the size or character of form would be extended to other countries would be inconsistent with our principles. I have spoken about the international background of East-West relationships. Against this background, what is the present outlook for the area to which Australia geographically belongs, and of which we are trying to be a friendly and helpful member? Since the war, South East Asia has been going through a revolution as far reaching in its effects as the French revolution was in Europe. Colonial links, some of them centuries old, have been, and are being, abruptly severed. New Asian nations have appeared and their numbers are growing. Asian leaders have had to repair the effects of the last war which affected every country in the area; run-down economies have had to be restored; the tasks have had to be faced of building modern nation-states without many of the essential skills and the necessary money. And over the whole area, including Australia, lies the shadow of Communist expansionism. We must expect the present revolutionary phase, with its problems, to continue for many years ahead. Considerable progress has been made; rice shortages have been largely overcome; much of the devastation of war has been impaired; appreciable economic progress has been made. General elections have recently been held or will be held shortly in, I think I am right in saying, practically all the countries of South-East Asia. Malaya and Singapore, our near neighbours, are making striking constitutional advances. We warmly welcome this peaceful evolution of these two Commonwealth partners. As they advance towards a new status we are anxious to co-operate with them in solving the new problems that they will meet. At the Malayan constitutional talks which ended recently in London, agreement was reached on a programme providing for internal self-government now and independence within the Commonwealth by August, 1957. In the period before independence, the United Kingdom will retain control over external defence and external relations, consulting the Federation Government in advance about any substandefence forces. It has been agreed that after independence there will be a treaty of defence and mutual assistance which will cover the continued presence of United Kingdom forces and the Commonwealth Strategic Eeserve and the provision of necessary facilities for them. We shall do all we can to help Malaya in meeting the varied tasks which confront the country in this new constitutional phase and in its long-term social and economic development. Malaya's peaceful progress is complicated by the Communist minority which persists in its campaign of terrorism in spite of generous offers designed to end the bloodstability is very closely related to political shed. We are aiding the fight againsi, this ruthless foreign-supported minority. In Indonesia, an historic stage was reached towards the end of last year with the holding of the first national elections problem. Nevertheless, the problem of in that country of nearly 80,000,000 people. A new government with a popular mandate arising from these elections will shortly be formed, and we look forward to developing friendly ties and closer contact with it. In Indo-China, fighting was brought to an end in July, 1954, though not beforo the Communists had made considerablegains and inflicted much misery on the people. The Geneva Agreement provided the basis of a peaceful settlement and international commissions were set up in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao3 to supervise the armistices. Two Commonwealth countries, Canada and India, are contributing notably to this work. However, no final political settlements are yet in sight in Viet Nam and Laos. In North and South Viet Nam the two parties have been unable to reach agreement on the basis for free nation-wide elections, while dual and collective. in Laos the Communists are resisting the restoration of the Laotian Government's authority in certain parts of the country. En these circumstances, it is important to machinery to ensure that hostilities are not renewed. Tn South Viet Nam itself considerable progress has been made. The Government has established authority in its own territory and has resettled more than 750,000 refugees, who fled from communism in the north. Elections in Soutli Viet Nam for a National Assembly will be held shortly. In Cambodia and Laos there are elected governments determined to maintain their independence. These governments need understanding, help and co-operation from the free world to ensure their continued .integrity. These are some of the achievements and problems of South-East Asia to-day. To solve these problems we are striving to develop the strength of the area to which we belong-no t only its defensive strength but its economic strength and its strength to resist ideas which would destroy its independence and integrity. Economic stability. The task of helping to preserve the security and stability of South-East Asia is far from being a simple military physical defence is clearly of the first importance. That is why we have joined with others in the creation of Seato, under which important and promising mutual defence machinery has been set up. Of the eight countries which make up Seato, some are Asian, while the others, though outside the threatened area, have recognized the common defence interests which they share with the countries of the area, and have committed themselves accordingly. So far as Australia is concerned, co-operation of this kind is the only realistic way to help to defend the region to which we belong, and to protect our own shores. It is important that the forces of every member of the Seato organization should be developed to an adequate level of strength and effectiveness and used to the best advantage in the defence of the whole area. Self-defence must be both indiviI shall shortly be attending, on behalf of the Government, the second meeting of the Seato Council at Karachi. maintain effective international The meeting will review the general situation in the South-East Asian treaty area and the wovk done by Seato, which is a unique experiment in international co-operation as between countries of widely difTerent situations and stages of development. Much work has been done in tbe past year in building up effective Seato machinery and methods of consultation, and in studying the problems of the area. The Seato Council repvesentatives, including Australia, have held move than twenty meetings at Bangkok in the last year. In addition to the formal meetings of the Seato military advisers at Bangkok and Melbourne, there have been seventeen meetings of specialist representatives of the Seato countries, including Australia. These specialist meetings have included such subjects a military planning, military intelligence, training, anti-subversive measures, economic co-operation and information. These meetings have been held in Bangkok, Manila, Singapore, Karachi, Melbourne, Auckland and Pearl Harbour. The preliminary work at chiefs of staff level has now largely been done, and we are entering a new phase in the development of the Seato organization. Seato is already established as a deterrent to aggression. Its importance is not confined, however, to military security.' Its political purpose is the preservation of the integrity and independence of the people of the area. The treaty calls for co-operation among its members in solving the economic and the cold war problems of the area. The Australian Government means to play a positive role in this aspect of the Seato organization's work. The main danger in South-East Asia to-day is probably that of Communist subversion and infiltration. An important feature of the treaty is the provision which it makes for co-operative action to combat subversion, as well as open aggression. Much is in fact already being done in this sphere but much remains, and every member of Seato must be prepared to make an increasing contribution. The problem of defending the integrity of the free countries in the S'outh-East Asian area, is, as I have said, not merely a military problem. The countries of South and South-East Asia are not short of man-power-thei r populations are increasing by something like 10,000,000 each year-bu t they are short of tbe means to make man-power as productive and labour as rewarding as it can be. Tbey are short of capital and short of skills. Capital for development can be accumulated only by savings out of income, and the incomes of the Asian peoples are so low that there is little margin for saving. In many parts of Asia primitive methods make possible only a bare subsistence from hard and unremitting toil. That is why the economic development of Asia must be aided by non-Asian countries which have already raised their own production and living standards high enough to have resources available. We can understand these developmental problems, for they are our own, but they are on a much more formidable scale than our own. An immediate and urgent need for Asian countries is to increase their resources of technical skill and technical equipment at all levels of production. Increased technical "" know-how"" is essential not only to increased productivity from immediately usable resources, but also to make it possible to implement much needed large-scale developmental projects. The machinery through which Australia makes its main contribution towards the technical progress and economic development in free Asia is the Colombo plan, which is now in its fifth year, and which has proved itself as a means of helping the Asian Governments to help themselves. It is too soon to look for spectacular results in the shape of visibly increased living standards, for much of the effort has been channelled into large multi-purpose projects which have yet to come to maturity, but which will later provide the essential foundation on which the expanded economics will rest. We are also training large and increased numbers of young Asians in a wide .range of modern skills and professions. This helps create a reservoir of professionally and technically trained personnel which will make its impact on the social ancl economic advancement of the area for a generation and more ahead. Incidentally, a point of considerable importance has been confirmed by reason of the presence of some thousands of young Asian students in Australia over recent years, and that is that it is established that there is no racial feeling in the Australian population. A further source of valuable help to Asian countries in the economic sphere is the TJnited Nations technical assistance programme, to which Australia contributes substantially. Just over a third of TJnited Nations technical assistance funds are spent in southern Asia and the Far East. Whilst we realise the needs of other areas, Australia has constantly been concerned in the TJnited Nations to ensure that an adequate proportion of the available TJnited Nations technical assistance funds should be devoted to the Asian area, which contains more than 50 per cent, of the population of the areas covered by this programme, although it gets only 33 per cent, of the funds. It is also the fac: that the needs of the peoples of South uur time is the question of the attitude Asia are substantially greater than those of mind that is in course of being forcf other areas, by reason of their low mulated in the minds of the governments standard of living. It is obviously not and peoples of free Asia. It has been possible to allot technical aid simply on my constant endeavour, on behalf of the a population basis, but it would seem that Government, to try to achieve a proper some further increase in the proportion understanding of the aspirations of our devoted to Asia is logical, desirable and Asian neighbours ancl to bring friendly justified. In this regard we shall conand constructive interest to bear on their tinue to give our sympathetic attention problems. To this end I have made a to Asian needs. I have spoken at some length on our Australia, which will continue. I like efforts to help the countries of Soutli to think that I have served my apprenand South-East Asia to improve their ticeship in this regard, and that there standards of living. Whilst this is a matis progressively better mutual underter of principal concern to the free Asian standing between the countries of South countries themselves, it is not confined to ancl South-East Asia and Australia. On tliem. Lack of economic stability in Asia the other hand, I hope and believe that, would have harmful effects far beyond the free Asian countries will not be the Asian area. There is an obvious link misled by the sympathetic interest which between economic stability and political the Communist countries claim to feel stability. We must find means of speedfor them. The free Asian countries are ing up the rate of economic growth of a target area for Communist political and free Asia. I am not without hope that economic diplomacy and propaganda some other of the European countries which is part of the pattern of Communist whose economies are in good order, might power politics. join with the others of us in co-operation with free Asia, perhaps under the Colombo plan, and so create a new relathat the evolution of the political, social tionship between Asia and Europe in and economic pattern in the free Asian place of the old. Ancl in all this, let us countries should necessarily, or even not forget the simple human fact that probably, be on the same lines as our no one likes taking something from own. Each of these countries has its own someone else as a gift. The Asian Governlong-established tradition and culture. ments are composed of proud people.

60,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of thepassive attitude which the Minister displayed at all crucial points in his speech. not to be too tough with the Israeli people He said in effect, "" We cannot at present give up atomic weapons or hydrogen bombs by agreement, because they constitute a deterrent"". Then he added, "" Of course, we cannot give up conventional weapons either because in that field the Eussians are fairly admitted to be our superior"". This conclusion is that one can do nothing. Tn support of our view to the contrary, I can cite not only Labour's declarations of policy, but also the great change that has taken place in world opinion during the last year or two. It is extramined effort, ever since 1949, to get even ordinary that gradually, but none the less effectively, the responsibility for conciliatory moves in international affairs is being assumed by church leaders. They see the political leaders paralysed and unable to grasp the fact that at some time or other there must be agreement or the tragedy that threatens the world will eventuate. In association with this series of articles in The Times in January, there was a discussion in which church leaders took part. One sees contributions from the Bishop of Exeter and other leaders of the Church of England and of the various Protestant churches. Similarly the Pope, a month before, had made an even more definite and forthright statement. Why cannot the problem always be treated as open to solution ? If one looks at the whole tone of the Minister's speech, one concludes that it is defeatist. 1 looked through it in the lunch-hour ancl I have listened carefully to the Minister in this chamber. The speech was couched in question-begging phrases, and there was no cold analysis of what might be done. When Bulganin and Khrushchev went to India they had, according to our standards, no right to criticize colonialism. They were strongly attacked for doing so, and the Minister bas done exactly the same thing here. I am not complaining about his action in this instance, I consider it right to critiexists on the continent, Asia, in other cize people whom one thinks are wrong. Of course, the Minister does not apply that principle to all countries or all persons. I consider it the proper line to take, but one can check his speech by giving perhaps one illustration. He dismissed the Middle East in ten lines. He said, in effect, that the Arabs really ought and the Israeli people, on the other hand, must not be too tough with the Arabs. There it is. The Minister's view is, "" We wish them well. We are a member nation of the Security Council"". That is not tbe kind of advice that this House seeks. We want to know a little more. This Government supported the vote of censure against Israel in the Security Council but my opinion, after considering the events of the last four, five or six years, is that the Arabs are at least equally to blame because of their deterwith the people of Israel. the Security Council. great nations pouring arms into that area and say, "" Well, they are just trading "". Can Australia not give some lead in this matter? To us, the Middle East is a long way off compared with Asia, but I believe that a world war might easily commence there, so it is a very important point. I turn from that to the Minister's reference to China, because I believe that there is something that should be said dn that subject. The Minister saidTlie Peking rcprime has made many declarations of peaceful intent, and, since the Bandung Conference . . . it i official statements ancl propaganda have assumed an apparent air of moderation. The Minister's view about countries like China is that if they speak moderately we cannot trust them; but if they speak roughly we cannot trust them either, so it does not matter how they speak. It is quite correct for the Minister to say that we of the Labour party have advocated the admission of China to the United Nations. I am speaking of continental China-Communist Chinai f you like, at any rate the only China that words. It is the China of to-day. The Minister saidIt is sometimes suggested that the "" realistic"" course would be to recognize the Peking regime as the Government of China and as the legitimate representative of China at the United Nations.",30,Internationa L Affairs
61,Mr Casey,We mentioned that before,31,Internationa L Affairs
62,Dr. Evatt,"On e cannot look on atThen followed the Minister's condemnation of that country:At this stage I shall merely say that it does not appear "" realistic "" to abandon to the mercy of the Communists the island of Formosa with a Eepublic of China Government and 8,000,000 anti-Communist inhabitants, which is in effect what the Communists continue to demand. It is quite obvious that if China were admitted to the TJnited Nations, Formosa, under also the the safety and security of persons living there would be a responsibility of the TJnited Nations. That misinterpretation is fairly typical of the Minister's wrong approach to one of the great problems that must be tackled. The Minister then quoted from Sir Winston Churchill's famous speech of November, 1953 in which he saidI have sometimes the odd thought that the annihilating character of these agencies That is, the nuclear weaponsmay bring an utterly unforeseeable security to mankind. It may be that . . . when the advance of destructive weapons enables every one to kill everybody else nobody will want to kill any one at all. That merely revealed Sir Winston Churchill's fondness for antithesis. He was not putting as a serious proposition that one should pursue the manufacture of nuclear weapons without cessation because it is a deterrent. The Minister admits that we have reached the stage when mutual destruction will follow the use of these weapons by either side. Is the continued manufacture of nuclear weapons a deterrent to their manufacture by other people? Just the reverse is the position. It is the spur that drives manufacture to new heights. A new height is reached and then the particular nation says, "" We cannot stop now. We must go higher "". In this way an impasse is reached. It is not an easy problem to solve. No one seriously advocates the cessation of experimental explosions except by consent, and by international regulation. The Minister mentioned the safeguards. I do not accept his view that it is impossible to detect whether agreements are broken. I consider that great work can be done by such agreements. Honourable members on this side of the House sincerely desire to contribute to a solution of the problem mentioned by the Minister. The Minister stated, and this, of course, is not a new thought, that one way of advancing international friendship is to l if t the iron curtain. The iron curtain was a phrase originally coined by Goebbels, Hitler's propagandist, who used it for his own purposes, largely in the way the Minister has used it. The use of the phrase came back into prominence its present control, might after the movement began to set aside the be granted membership of agreements of Potsdam and Yalta, and TJnited Nations. Certainly it is a fair description of Eussia's decision to forbid communication with free countries outside the Eussian sphere. However, it is true that to-day communication between Eussia and the western democracies is on a better footing than it has been for generations. If honourable members read the English and Continental newspapers, they will discover that more visits by individuals on all official levels are being made from Britain, for example, to Eussia than has been the case for many years. A parliamentary delegation has visited Eussia. There have been exchanges of visits by military officers and naval units. Small fleets representing various countries of the west have visited Eussia, and vice versa. The interchange also extends to the realms of sport and science, and altogether, except with regard to Australia, a fairly free exchange of visits is developing between Eussia and the west. However, if we want to sell wheat to Eussia, according to this Government apparently nothing can be done about it That is in spite of the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand visited Eussia and arranged for the sale of certain New Zealand commodities, and the Canadian Minister for External Affairs has acted similarly. Of course, the iron curtain should be removed, but I suggest that Australia should take its part with the other countries in helping to remove it. Why does not the Minister for External Affairs do what the Government practically promised during the last Parliament that it would do and arrange for a delegation of members of the Parliament to visit the countries of Asia? I suggest that the delegation should visit all the countries of Asia and not merely the Seato countries or any particular group. Of course, the Minister will do a good job in connection witb Seato, but if a delegation of members were arranged to study Asian conditions tbey could form tlieir own judgment about Asian affairs. India is not included in Seato, but tbe Minister regards India as one of tbe greatest nations of Asia. I also believe it is, but Burma, and China, both continental China and Eormosa, and nations like Korea, both north and south, as well as Japan, should also be studied by this Parliament. A study of such countries by a delegation of members of this Parliament should certainly be attempted, so that some honourable members could learn at first hand something of the Asian situation, and all honourable members benefit through their studies. The Opposition, in short, seeks a new approach in Asian matters. It is not enough for the Minister for External Affairs to be fully acquainted with the leaders of the Asian countries. He knows that we have studied this problem for a long time. He is a man of goodwill, but I think that, like many other men of goodwill, very often he comes to the wrong conclusion. He is going to the Seato conference under an agreement made under United Nations auspices. After all, all such agreements come within the jurisdiction of the Security Council. Within the United Nations it is possible to have regional arrangements for mutual protection in a particular area. Seato is such an organization, but its validity as an agreement depends on the arrangement being in consonance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations; and the primary purpose of tbe United Nations is not organization even to put down aggression-althoug h it includes that-bu t the prevention of war, the prevention of fighting, by means of conciliation. It is the process of peaceful adjustment of disputes which is the No. 1 approach of the United Nations. When Seato was proposed in this House we pointed out that that approach had not been emphasized; and, indeed, nothing of the kind has taken place Eecently. demonstrations have been car rieci out in Thailand. Marches have been staged as a show of force. I do not know what deterrent effect such action will hav», on other countries. But, certainly, Seato should organize itself not merely on th« political, or military, level only, but should make an attempt to improve the relations of the Seato powers with the other Asian powers instead of remaining limited to a comparative few. That might be regarded as a somewhat negative policy, but it is the view that we put forward. If the Minister's speech is to be taken as a statement of Government policy, then the gap on foreign policy between the parties in this House is widening still further. Conciliation and peaceful intervention is of the very essence of the United Nations, and the validity of Seato depends on the Seato powers pursuing such a policy. The Minister has referred to Indo China. A truly appalling situation arose in that country, because five or six years ago it was decided, possibly by the great powers or possibly by France itself, not to refer the dispute in that country to tlie United Nations. Had that dispute been so referred, it would have been settled on terms that were in accordance with the greatness and dignity of France, ancl Indo-China would have been given self-government, which had been promised to it by the leaders of the United Nations during World War II . The chance to have that dispute settled peacefully was let slip. The Labour party took a similar view about the situation in Malaya. Malaya is now moving towards self government, and the view of the Labour party about the employment of Australian forces in Malaya now appears to have been accepted generally by the people of Australia. According to a public opinion poll, the result of which was published recently in the Melbourne Herald, there i is considerable opposition to the retention of Australian forces in Malaya. What is Malaya's attitude towards Australia? We are thinking of our attitude towards that country. It has always been one of friendliness. I believe that the sending of Australian troops to Malaya was a blunder, and that it would have been wiser and more correct to have adopted Labour's policy, not so much for the sake of Australia as for the principles of the United Nations in this part of the world. I now desire to refer again to the attitude of the Opposition about atomic weapons. Great scientists throughout the world, including Einstein who put forward the view almost at the moment of his death, stated that the fate of all peoples of the world was at stake. They were filled with a sense of desperation at the paralysis that had seized upon all political leaders when faced with the possible use of atomic weapons. When they said that, they were referring to Eussian leaders as well as the leaders of the west. The situation can be likened to that arising in an industrial dispute. Because a dispute cannot be settled in a day, we should not say that it will never be settled. We should ensure that three clays later, three weeks or even three months later, another effort i.« made to settle the dispute. A solution must be pursued all the time. We must never give up the attempt to solve the problem of how to avoid atomic war. Tbe continual attempt to solve the problem does not mean that we are appeasing anybody, because it is never wrong to meet other nations at the council table. It .is scandalous that fvom 1945, after the Potsdam agveement, until 1955, the gveat nations of the world did not meet at the highest level. Of course, we have all heard people who have come to this countvy, including those from Great Bvitain, and have said that an agreement was made but that it could not be relied upon. The Minister has taken credit fov saying at the time that it could not be relied upon; but anybody could have said that. The road to international friendship is long and difficult, but we must travel it to the end. Dr. Nansen, who encountered appalling difficulties in his pioneering exploration wovk in the Arctic, once said that a difficult thing is one that can be done immediately, but that the impossible takes a little longer. All he means by that is that you nevev give up the attempt, that you go on. ancl I think that this document, looked at as a whole, and fairly judged, is not a contribution that is really worthy of the Austvalian Government, this Pavliament, ov the people. No doubt theve will be further discussion of it. The subject-matter is contained in His Excellency's Speech, although in a slightly different way. I am obliged to the House for giving me the opportunity speak briefly on it, because I feel certain that if the Minister looks at it again he will revise a great deal of what he said in his statement this afternoon. Tliat the following paper be printed:International Affairs-Ministeria l Statement, 22nd February. 105C. Minister for Health) -by leave I feel suve that the House will be interested in a brief statement on the precautions which have being developed to ensure that the Salk poliomyelitis vaccine is completely safe. Nowhere in the world has greater progress towards the control of paralytic poliomyelitis, through vaccination, been made than in Canada. The Canadians have demonstrated to the wovld how the vaccination programme may be safely, effectively ancl quickly put into practice. In 1955, the Canadians manufactured nearly 2,000,000 cubic centimetres of a safe and effective poliomyelitis vaccine and promptly administered it to almost 1,000,000 Canadian children without mishap ov suspicion that the vaccine may have induced any case of paralytic or non-paralytic poliomyelitis. The major veason for the success of the Canadian vaccination programme is attributed to the insistence of high and thorough safety testing standards, which eliminate chance of mishaps. All lots of vaccine produced at tbe Connaught Medical Eesearch Laboratories in Toronto have been doublechecked for safety, both at Connaught and at the Health Department's Laboratory at Ottawa. In the United States of America, all vaccine used in the 1954 field trials was triple-checked by testing at three labovatovies and in those trials there weve no mishaps whatever. It was the 1955 vaccination programme which van into trouble and then it was only the product of one manufacturer out of five which was suspected. The vaccine used for the 1955 United States programme was not always independently tested and was safety tested, for the most part, only by the manufacturer producing the vaccine. Since the Cutter incident, the United States health authorities have instigated a system of independent laboratory inspection.",31,Internationa L Affairs

65,Dr. Donald Cameeon (Oxley,"In Australia, we have taken f u l l advanout there. No one could fail to be imtage of the Canadian and TJnited States experience. The Australian vaccine goes through all stages of production at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. At each stage of manufacture, tests for safety are carried out and, as soon as the manufacturing process is completed, full scale safety tests are begun. These tests consist of taking numerous samples of the completed vaccine, inoculating them into culture media and incubating them at the correct temperature to see if there is any life left in the vaccine. At the same time, samples of the vaccine are inoculated into a large group of monkeys and after four weeks' time the monkeys are killed and a full post-mortem is carried out. At the same time the brain and spinal cord are examined microscopically. If in either of these tests there is any indication whatMr Morgan, Mr Swartz and Mr Turnbull be ever of growth of the culture or disease in the monkey, the whole batch of the vaccine is destroyed. While these tests are being undertaken at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, a similar series of completely independent tests will be undertaken at the Fairfield Infectious Diseases Virus Laboratory under the charge of Dr. Ferris. I should point out to honourable members that this hospital is an institution with a staff of very great experience and reputation in the field of infectious diseases. The Commonwealth has provided the necessary equipment and will make available any moneys or materials required. When the Fairfield Hospital tests are negative, the vaccine can be regarded as perfectly safe and only then will it be released for use. The House may rest assured that no vaccine will be distributed from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories until the tests at thc serum laboratories and the Fairfield Hospital indicate complete safety. It is expected that supplies of the vacmembers of the Standing Orders Committee; cine will be available in quantity in about three months' time. Federal and State health departments will co-operate in its use, and administrative arrangements between the Commonwealth ancl the States are now being finalized. r Inoculations will be free and, of course, voluntary. I might say that I have recently visited Dr. Bazeley's laboratory and seen the work that is being carried mensely impressed by the very obviously high standard of care and efficiency that exists at those laboratories.

The Opposition violently opposes the motion. Why is there any need to move for the suspension of the Standing Orders to deal with this matter to-day?

If the action proposed is taken merely because the Minister is going abroad, the Government should not presume upon the loyalty of its supporters by attempting to have passed a motion of this sort, which really abrogates all the rights and privileges of Government supporters and other honourable members.

The Minister for External Affairs wants to suspend the Standing Orders without allowing honourable members first to see the terms of reference of the proposed committee, and then to put his proposal through immediately. I suggest that I am entitled to protest against such action, and also against the cavalier attitude towards the Parliament adopted for the second time in a week by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in advancing a proposal such as this. The Opposition will not agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders. If the Government presses the proposal, we on this side of the House shall vote against the motion. We now register another protest against the further deterioration in parliamentary standards for which the Vice-President of the Executive Council and his fellowtraveller, the Minister for External Affairs, are responsible. Question putThat so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for External Affairs from moving a motion in connection with the establishment of a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the consideration of such motion, and the subsequent appointment of members to serve on the committee.

That a message be sent to the Senate requesting its concurrence. This is a motion generally in the same terms as others that I had the privilege of moving in this House at the start of the last two Parliaments. The terms of the motion do not vary in any really important aspect from those of the resolution which was carried during the last Parliament and on which the Foreign Affairs Committee was based. However, there are two changes, one to increase the size of the committee from a total of nineteen honourable members and senators to twenty, by reason of the increase in numbers in this House of the two parties supporting the Government, and the other to clarify the position regarding invitations to persons to give evidence before the committee. I think that the great majority of honourable members know very well the purpose of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has been in existence now, I think, for nearly five years, and I believe that it has been a successful body. It has enabled a considerable number of honourable members and senatorsunfortunately, only from the Government side in the two Houses-to obtain an increasingly intimate knowledge and appreciation of international affairs. Countless meetings have been held, a great number of which I have attended myself, and the senior officers of tbe Department of External Affairs have attended whenever they have been asked to do so by members of the committee. I have placed no restraint whatsoever on the individuals who were invited to appear before the committee, nor have I placed any limitation on the information and papers provided to the committee, both at its request and on the initiative of the department. The servicing of this committee has entailed a great deal of additional work for departmental officers, but that has been a labour of love, and they and I are very glad indeed to continue it. I am quite sure that very soon we shall be invited to listen to an earthable gentleman who has the honour to indeed! that is appreciated. tinues. honourable gentleman will make is known almost by heart by many gentlemen on this side of the House. He will make some captious criticism of this Foreign Affairs Committee. He will call it-wha t is the phrase? the momenta failing memory ! He will call it a study circle. He will complain that it has no power, that it has not the power to frame foreign policy. He will not use precisely those terms, because that would not be right, but that will be the effect of what he will say. He will complain that this committee is not a body which makes policy. In that respect I should like perhaps to anticipate him and say in advance, as I have said in answer to his strong orations here in the past, that the committee is not supposed to form foreign policy. That is the privilege of the Government, and the Government, of course, must continue to exercise it. This committee is a body set up to enable, I would hope, members of all parties in both Houses of the Parliament to gain what I think I can rightly call an intimate appreciation ancl knowledge of international affairs, and, in particular, any aspect of international affairs that the committee itself elects to study. I do not, nor do the members of the Department of External Affairs, dictate to the members of the committee the subjects they shall study. The members themselves choose the subjects, and then either I or the senior officers of the department appear before them and give them a frank story of our relationships with the particular countries or areas that they have elected to discuss ancl study. In practice, there is almost no limit to the information that is provided for the members of the conimittee.",37,Eoreign Affairs Committee

But I invite the members of the Opposition to discuss the matter with honourable members who have served on the committee in any one or more of the last four or five yeai 3, and ask them whether this has been a valuable body. I am pretty sure what the answer would be. Up to now, unfortunately, the Opposition has elected not to be represented on the committee. like us to join it? tation in the most formal terms. I should be infinitely glad if the members of the Opposition in this House and the other place were to elect to be represented on this committee. They would discover for themselves, individually or collectively, how useful the Foreign Affairs Committee is. I believe that it is of very great use indeed. When I say that, I do not refer only to its ability to report. That is of some consequence, but I do not think it is really important. The usefulness of the committee lies in the fact that it provides appear before it. The wording has been a means by which honourable members who are not, for the time being, members of the Government can inform themselves about international affairs, just as well as, and indeed rather better than, any member of the Government, except, possibly, myself. The opportunities are provided. As I have said, there is, in practice, almost no restraint on the amount of information that the members of the committee can get. There are very few secrets that must be kept from people of goodwill and integrity. There are, of course, certain secrets that are not our secrets. They are the secrets of other countries. I do not pretend that the members of the committee are told about those matters. As they are not our secrets, it would not be right for us to make them known to any other body. But they are, in most cases, evanescent matters. They are here to-day but they bave disappeared within a few days. In the broad, there is, practically speaking, no limit to the opportunities available to members of the committee to inform themselves in the most intimate way about what is going on in the world in the most important sphere of international affairs. As I have said on countless occasions in the past, I hope very much that the members of the Opposition in this House and in the other place will take advantage of this opportunity to join the committee. There are three ways in which this motion differs from those of the past. I have already referred to the proposed increase by one of the membership of the committee. On behalf of the Government, I have sought to clarify the condithe Minister tions under which the committee will be able to call for people to appear before it as witnesses. Under the terms of previous motions, the committee had to seek the approval of the appropriate Minister -that is, myself-befor e it sent for, as the wording was, individuals to give evidence before it. On behalf of the Government, I have altered that. The proposal now is that, provided I am so informed, the committee may invite anybody it pleases to give evidence before it. In practice, I have found that I cannot conceive of any individual to whom I should object if the committee asked him to altered slightly. Instead of the words "" send for "", which suggest an element of compulsion, I have used the word "" invite "", which I think is more appropriate. After all, the committee cannot compel any one to appear before it if he does not want to appear. If the committee does manage to get some one to appear before it, it cannot compel that individual to speak. SoI think that it would be more appropriate to speak of the committee being able to "" invite"" people to appear before it. There are two other consequential amendments which follow from that amendment, but they make no alteration to the sense. In respect of the committee's ability to call for individuals to give evidence before it, I must make an exception in the case of the omcers of the Department of External Affairs. They will be able to appear before the committee only with my approval or consent. That, of course, is the case in respect of the omcers of any department. No public servant can be called to give evidence before any body, except with the consent of his Minister. However, I cannot conceive of any situation in which I should refuse",38,Eoreign Affairs Committee
82,Mr Calwell,Would,39,Eoreign Affairs Committee
83,Mr Casey,"I shall repeat the invithat consent, except on the score that there was, for the time being, more urgent work for which the particular omcer was needed. That is a matter of adjustment which, I am sure, will not cause any difficulty, but I must make that one small proviso. I shall not go into the statistics relating to the number of meetings that the Foreign Affairs Committee has held during each of the last two Parliaments, the number of documents that have been specially prepared for the committee by the department, or the numbers of people who have been invited to appear before the committee and have so appeared. Honourable gentlemen may be sure that the numbers are quite impressive. This has been an active body, and I have every confidence that it will continue to serve a most useful purpose during the life of this Parliament. I commend the motion to the House. The Opposition opposes the mot-ion. In order that the House may determine the suitability or otherwise of members of the Opposition serving on this proposed committee, I should like to remind honourable members of certain allegations which were made during the recent federal general election campaign by the Prime MinisterC Mr Menzies), the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) and one of the lesser lights in the Ministry, the Minister for Air( Mr Townley), which are typical of the false and unfair campaign of misrepresentation and distortion which Liberal party and Australian Country party Ministers and members waged against the Labour party and its candidates during that campaign. We are being asked to join the Foreign Affairs Committee after the Prime Minister, on the 23rd November of last year at Hobart, claimed that there was an extraordinary parallel between the policies of the Communist party and the Labour party. bers opposite agree that that is so, then the offer to us to join this committee is spurious and dishonest. How can the Minister honestly put forward a proposal to the Labour party to join the Foreign answer the Minister for Externa] Affairs. Affairs Committee if the Prime MinisterI am not concerned at the moment with ff. -[51 was right, as honourable members opposite claim he was, when he said there was a parallel between the policies of the Labour party and the Communist party ? you a security check. offensive. That is just the sort of remark one would expect from a former Governor of Bengal. The Minister asks us, not merely to join his committee, but also to share all his secrets. He says, "" There are not many secrets, but you can come in and share the lot"". As that is the Minister's attitude to-day, either what the Prime Minister said in November last was wrong or the Minister's offer to-day is next door to treason, because if we are sympathizers with communism and the Communist party outlook, obviously we are persons who ought not to be invited to share the Government's secrets-no t merely ordinary secrets, such as the secret of the appointment of the eight economists, but secrets about international affairs. The allegations that were made in the election campaign were completely scandalous. It was not just a slip of the tongue, as it were, or a flight of fancy on the part of the Prime Minister when he spoke as he did in Hobart on the 23rd November, because in a national broadcast from Perth, five days later, also during the election campaign, he again charged the Labour party with having adopted substantially the same programme as the Communist party. That was mild compared with what the Vice President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) said. All the statements were outrageously false. Yet we are asked to swallow every insult and now join their committee. We are told by implication that that was merely so much election propaganda which can now be heavily discounted. It appears that members of the Labour party are as loyal as anybody else and are only accused of being Communists when there is an election in progress.

88,Mr Calwell,"I am trying to the outpourings of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. On the same night, the 2Sth November, on which the Prime Minister spoke in Perth, the Minister for External Affairs, who has the temerity to put forward this proposal to-day, preached in Sydney the same hymn of hate as the Prime Minister preached. He made the shocking allegation that Australia's allies feared that if the honovable membev fov Bendigo( Mr Labour party was returned to office the new Labour Government would compromise with international communism and sell the fort. Would any Opposition with any self-respect at all do other than what we are doing? We cast his proposal back in his teeth and tell bim that we will not swallow his insults. If that is what he thought about us then he can have his precious committee, and we will have nothing to do with it. We will have nothing to do with any proposal of this nature. The smears of"" tbe Minister for External Affairs during the last election campaign coukl not have been equalled or improved on even by Senator McCarthy. The Minister for Air had something to say in Hobart on the night of the 24th November. Labour's views on foreign affairs were an insidious influence on Australia's security. Of course, the Minister for Externa] Affairs now says, in effect, "" Eorget all that. We have three years of a Pavliament befove us. Please come in and give us a hand on foreign affairs because we ave in just as gveat a mess there as we are in the economic sphere and in other ways"". Honourable members can see just how insidious, unbridled and concerted was the propaganda carried on against the leader of the Labour party and its members throughout the election campaign. If we are what the Government says we are, if we are what the so called Anti-Communist Labour partythe Government's breakaway allies and now their washed-away allies-ha d to say about us during the election campaign, it would be a treasonable act for this Government now to put members of our party on the proposed Foreign Affairs Committee. That is, of course, if we were prepared to join the body, which we are not prepared to do. They are right now or if they were right during the election campaign, they are wrong-eve n worse than wrong-for asking us to join this committee now. If they are right now, they were wrong then. That is all I wish to say to the professional anti-Communists who line the Government benches in this Parliament on that point. They call us Communists and Comniunist sympathizers, yet in 1954 they sent the Clarey), and in 1955 the honourable membev for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) as fully accredited members of the Australian delegation to the United Nations organization. Is it suggested that the honovable member for Bendigo ov the honourable membev fov Adelaide is a Communist or Communist sympathiser? selected them and the Ministev for External Affairs accepted tliem and was glad to get them. They did, at least, adorn each delegation and brought intellectual strength to the vevy weak team that had been selected from the Govevnment side in each instance. To rehearse this story of the commitHe said that tee once move, let me say that the present Minister was not the first to put forward a proposal for a foreign affairs committee in this Parliament. A. proposal put forward in March, 1950, by the then Ministev, Mr Spender, contained certain suggestions. In December, 1950, tbe same Ministev narrowed tliem greatly but even in their narrower form tbe Spender proposals weve much move liberal and therefore more acceptable to the Labouv pavty than ave this Minister's proposals. Dv. EVATT -That conimittee had the right to initiate mattevs. go through the clauses of that pvoposal, but as the Leader of the Opposition (Dv.

The clause readsSubject to the Minister for External Affairs a study circle but he goes on pretending being informed, the committee would have power to invite persons to give evidence before it. The Minister does not seem to know what is in his own proposal. He has altered it slightly on last year's terms. Instead of having to get his consent they now have to inform him of what they are doing; and he says that is an improvement on his previous proposal. The Labour party criticized the terms of the Spender proposal because we wanted something that would make the Foreign Affairs Committee a real foreign affairs committee. The present Minister is stubborn and unyielding in this matter. He will not change his mind on any vital particular in the proposal. We have discussed the matter with him in conference, but he has arrogantly rejected every proposal that would enable us to join the committee. party want? every proposal that would have enabled us to join the committee. We do not tliink the committee should sit in camera or that information obtained by the committee should be confidential to the committee only. We think they should have the right to advise members of their own party. If the committee is to be the important body that the Minister makes out it will be, a claim we greatly doubt, perhaps he might be entitled to say that everything is confidential. We bave admitted that certain information should be confidential. JSTow that the Minister bas reminded me of my description of his precious committee, let me quote his agi'eement with my description of it as recorded in Mansard of the 25th August, 1954. He saidBut lot us not burke the point; this is an educational committee, not an executive committee. continuesMelbourne ( Mr Calwell) chooses so to describe it, I shall not proclaim against that description. So the Minister agreed that it was merely that it is a body that is really concerned with formulating policy and advising the Government. He said that the Government must, in the final analysis determine foreign policy, and I think that is right; but the committee itself was appointed to advise the Government. If it was not appointed to advise the Government but merely to study certain questions and hear what this or that ambassador has to say, and waste its time at the public expense, with a few trips overseas being dangled before it as a bait, it has all along been a worthless body. party has always valued trips overseas. offered about two in the space of six years. Members of this party have gone overseas and have acquitted themselves with distinction. It would be better for Australia if more members of the Opposition and fewer from the Governmentside were sent overseas. The Minister pretends that the Parliament can get something out of this committee if the Opposition will only join it. At the back of his mind, he has the idea that Australia can develop a bi-partisan policy on foreign affairs. It never can do so. It never did, and it never will. There has never been a bi-partisan foreign policy, that is one that was accepted by the Government and the Opposition, in the history of federation in Australia. It may exist in other countries, but it has never existed here. of the present Opposition. of this Government.

105,Mr Calwell,"It is to the discreditwho denounced the Labour Government of that day for this decision, were the members of the Opposition of the time, those who now support the Government. Some of them later walked out of the ""War Cabinet and expelled Mr Spender, now Sir Percy Spender, and the late Mr House will regret. I hope the Labour W. M. Hughes from the Liberal party because they would not walk out with them. I have said that I do not believe there are some things regarding which we can can be a bi-partisan foreign policy, but in the past we have been prepared to consider serving on this committee if the Government would be reasonable in considering our objections. But the Government has made the position impossible now because of the scandalous slanderous attacks made upon the Labour party during the last general election campaign. We would not demean ourselves now to take seats on the committee after the charges that were made against us. Unless they are withdrawn, and unless the Minister for External Affairs and all other Ministers concerned apologize for what they said, we will not have anything to do with them. Let me indicate just where we differ, as an Opposition, from the Government in the matter of our foreign relations. We have always taken a distinctly Australian line. * We have been called isolationists because of it in the past. I sense, untrue. We did impugn the do not worry much about that; so long as the Labour party's line has been strongly pro-Australian I do not care what our opponents call us. Our opponents have always favoured an Imperialist line, and under the control of the present Minister for External Affairs our foreign policy has developed a most extraordinary character. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week, the Minister agrees with London. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, he agrees with Washington, and that is what he calls his foreign that sometimes, in his excess of party zeal policy. We prefer to consider Australia's interests first all the time. The gap that separates the Opposition and the. Government in this case is of the Government's own making. It is so wide that we could not join the Government's Foreign Affairs Committee. In fact, the gap is as wide as that of the Grand Canyon of Colorado. [5.19] I shall not detain the House long in discussing this matter. I believe that the speech we have just listened to from the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) is one which the party will regret it, and I am certain that the honourable member for Melbourne will regret it in retrospect when he comes to realize what he has said. Surely there be Australians. It may be that we can differ about what is a proper policy, but surely there are some things regarding which we should have all the goodwill of every Australian. A few moments ago, the honourable member for Melbourne stood at the table and said that the Opposition would oppose the Government on every point concerning this committee, whether the matter were right or wrong. He said that the Opposition's idea was to oppose. It would not consider matters on their merits. That is a shameful thing. I direct attention first to the matters raised by the honourable member for Melbourne in relation to the loyalty of the main political parties. He said that the loyalty of the Australian Labour party was impugned by supporters of the Government during the last general election campaign. That is both true and, in a loyalty of the policy officially espoused by the Labour party. We did-and I certainly still do-impug n the loyalty of certain individual members of the Labour party, but I do not impugn the policy of all members of the Labour party by any means. Let me say there is one person whose loyalty I would not impugn and his remarks, therefore, I regret all the more. I refer to the honourable member for Melbourne. I think he has let his tongue carry him away. T am sorry and because of the obligation, no doubt, he feels upon himself in his present circumstances, due to his unexpected election to the deputy leadership of the Labour party, he believes he has an obligation to his leader to support the proCommunist policies of that leader, even though he himself may disagree with them. I do not need to go back to the",42,Government Members Hear Hear
106,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar),"last general election to illustrate the points I shall make. Let me illustrate them by events which occurred in this House only an hour or two ago. Honourable members heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) rise and, in n statement on foreign policy, take very cleverly and very subtly the Soviet line. able member cannot discuss that statement. debate, Mr Speaker, and therefore I believe that I am entitled to discuss that statement. The right honourable gentleman showed himself then as a man who is prepared to go on assuring the country that the Trojan horse is, in point of fact, wood all through. That is his line. If you will not allow me to traverse it, Mr members of the party which, in the words Speaker, I shall not be able to go into details to establish what I am saying. I hope that I shall have an opportunity to do so at another time. It is of no use for Opposition members in this chamber to say that they are not running on the Communist line when they listen in silence to a cleverly angled speech such as that delivered by the right honourable inember for Barton in this House earlier this afternoon. I am sorry that I shall not be able to develop that point. Having obtained the adjournment of that debate, I hope that I shall have the opportunity to discuss at length the points to which I am now making a passing reference. It was obvious, was it not, that there was a contradiction between the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne? On the one hand, he said that there could be no bi-partisan policy in Australia. I regret that statement because I believe it to be untrue. On the other hand he said, in effect, "" Give this committee more power, make it an executive committee and then we will come into it "" . Is it not obvious to tbe veriest simpleton that those statements are completely contrary? If the honourable member for Melbourne believes in the possibility of a bi-partisan policy, there is perhaps more weight for making the committee more of an executive committee. But if he is right in his statement-and he must be right as to the present intentions of the Labour partythere is no reason why the committee should be made an executive committee on which both sides of the House would be represented. He has said-and I suppose that he speaks for his party-that the policy of the Labour party is to oppose at every point, whether it thinks the point at issue is right or wrong, or whether it concerns a matter of foreign or domestic policy. I believe that the committee performs a valuable, though limited, function. I hope that its functions will increase as it gains the stability of tradition and becomes a more established part of our institutions. It is immature. I think in many ways it could amplify its functions, but most certainly it cannot act in fhe way in which the honourable member for Melbourne wants it to act, as au executive body, if it includes of their own deputy leader in this House, is out to sprag the Government at every point, whether it be on matters of foreign or internal poliey. I believe that if this is to be only a study circle-and I hope it will be something more, even if it is nothing more at. the moment-the n the inclusion of members of the Opposition in it will do something towards changing their minds-no t necessarily changing their outlook on individual points, but changing their intentions so that they will act on matters of foreign policy in this House not as members of the Labour party but as Australians. I believe that, as Australians, we are in a difficult situation, and are living in a dangerous world. If we are divided in intention, we are unlikely to survive in that world. ""While I think the committee can still be developed, I believe that it is only, at the present moment, in its immature form. It is still a valuable committee, and insofar as it is an educational and not an executive committee there is no reason why the Opposition should not be represented upon it. It could be, of course, that the same frankness that we have had from the Minister in the past would not, or perhaps could not, be accorded to us in the future if the committee included members of the Opposition who happened, individually, to be people whom the Government did not think were loyal. But that is a matter of individuals. There are rotten apples, we think, in the barrel, but not all tbe apples are yet rotten.",43,Government Members Hear Hear

108,Mr Wentwoeth,"It was not inResults would depend, as far as tlie Government is concerned, on the frankness with which it would treat the committee, even if the Opposition were represented on it, and would depend very largely upon the individual nature of the members of the Opposition who were on that committee. Sir, 1 support the motion, and I regret very much the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne. I withdraw nothing that I have ever said in relation to the pro-Communist orientation of certain aspects of the Labour party's policy, and the pro-Communist inclinations of certain members of the Labour party; but I do not think by any means, ancl I have never thought, that every member of the Labour party is pro-Communist. I regret very much, indeed, that the Opposition is not taking the opportunity to come onto this committee, to show itself Australian, and to take advantage of the limited facilities which are, and should be, available to it under the motion. a curious double set of standards and special pleadings have been advanced by the two speakers from the Government side in seeking the inclusion of the Opposition on the Foreign Affairs Committee. If any of us on this side of the House need to have strengthened our resolution not to join any foreign affairs committee, it lift's br-pn rime for us by the immoderate speech of the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Melbourne, ( Mr He could almost have been MephisCalwell), set out with references that he had collected to prove from political statements during election time, which, of course, are sometimes exaggerated, and in most cases have been exaggerated, why the Opposition should refrain from even the slightest contact with the Foreign Affairs Committee. He proved up to the hilt that certain things were said by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Minister. He said, in effect, "" You have Casey) that ought to drive boms the resolution in our minds that we should not touch such a committee with a 40-ft. pole. The honourable member for Wentworth got up and, resorting to McCarthyism and smearing, directed the attention of the House to barrels of apples, not all of which were rotten; certain members of the Labour party-not all of whom were Communists; and poured out vituperative lies about tbe Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). If the Government wants the Opposition to join this committee, that is the worse way ever of attempting to get a reconciliation. As far as getting the Opposition on the committee was concerned, the honourable member's remarks were all wrong. Indeed, they were amusing, and must have been perplexing to the Australian people. Let us have a look at tbe two approaches. On the one side we have the Minister, who reminds me of a kind of international man about town. "" Will you come into my parlour ?"" says this spider to the Opposition. .We were spoken to in the softest key-the key of C-wliic h is the international key, I suppose. Then he went on to explain that the committee was, after all, practically no more than a study group in its present form, and that it could never become more than Casey's cozy conversazione unless we joined it. I could feel myself almost melting under his blandishments, and even began to think, that we might have been a little harsh with the Minister. Some of us of a more kindly temperament, aud particularly the new members, were feeling that, after all, we could not hold out forever. And then the picture changed! Up jumped the honourable member for Wentworth, ejecting sulphurous fumes; he was almost radio-active, and away he went! topheles in the flesh. He said, in effect, "" We want you to join us. Some of you should come over and help us get a policy, because it is apparent to the rest of the world that we have not got any, and are not likely to have any"". But there is a serious side to it, as well as the humorous side. The approach of the honourable member for Wentworth was a very different approach from that of the us in a dither, and we clo not know what to do about it."". What is behind the desire of the Government to get the Labour party on this committee? In the past, as the Eansard record shows, we put up six quite valid",44,Government Members Hear Hear

On that occasion I will stand corrected if I am wrongtliey were gagged before we could discuss them. ^ So where do we get on these things ? If the committee is to be merely a study group, what sort of studv will it undertake? character assassination, a study of policy, or a study of documents issued-by the Department of External Affairs, marked ""Top Secret"", and then placed on the table of the Libraiy for anyone to read? The honourable meniber for Mackellar asks us to be represented on the committee, but on the first day it sat he wanted it-no t to inquire how we could have peace in our time, not how we could improve our relations with the peoples of the world so that we could take our place in the United Nations to ensure universal peace-bu t to accuse a former member of the staff of the Minister for External Affairs of treason and to have him investigated. John Burton. Everybody knows that. Do honourable members opposite think that such conduct is likely to encourage the Labour party to join this committee? They seem to have got into an extraordinary state of flux. On the one hand, there is the desire that we mint, join the committee at any price, ancl on the other hand, the Government does not want us at any price. I think it is simple enough to conclude by saying that the original decision of the Labour party-whic h I have sometimes questioned in my own mind and in my innermost thoughts-is correct, and that there is no hope of any useful work being clone between us at this time, because the differences of policy ave so vast. Tbose differences ave widening and becoming move apparent because of the conservatism of the Government. Although the Ministev fov External Affairs spoke for 45 minutes during a previous debate which I know, Mr world. They vary in composition and in Speaker, you will not allow me to mention, except in passing like a flash, he said nothing new. I have heard of a necklace of cliches, but, I have never heard of a carpet woven in patterns of cliches, such as that which the Yil .'ter wove this afternoon. He told us nothing fresh. Tf the study group can provide the Government with nothing worthwhile saying, 1 am sorry. The whole point of the matter was brought to a climax by the honourable membev for Will it be a study of Melbourne, who showed the incompatibility of the approach to tins matter. That state of affairs really goes back to thc cavalier treatment of ouv first six pvoposed amendments. If the Government wants to put teeth into this committee, if it wants the committee to wovk ancl to be move than just a study circle, it will have to give us'thu vight to do cevtain things. As the Ministev has said, it would be absurd to think that we should get top-secret infonnation, but a committee working in close contnr-.t with the Ministev could clo useful wovk on both sides of the House. The conimittee will not do such work if it is purposely and religiously cut back to size, or if it becomes a forum fov earnest natterers on foreign affairs who dare not get a new thought, because if they did so it would explode in their minds. The whole situation has been made impossible of solution by the summary rejection, six years ago, of tbe six pvoposed amendments of the plan for setting up the committee. Those amendments, if adopted, would have given us some format to work upon. As it is, we still say that the committee is a study group and that there would be neither rhyme nor veason in our participation. Because of that, T suppovt the honovable member for Melbourne in his opposition to the motion that we join the Foreign Affairs Committee.

112,Mr Casey (La Trobe,"Minister forcommittee of any civilized country that I know of is on substantially different lines from those of the committee here in Australia, nor is any one of tliose committees such that it could frame policy and impose that policy on the government. That is not the purpose of any foreign affairs committee that I know of anywhere else in the world where the government is responsible to parliament. The second disappointment-and this is very much more than a personal disappointment-is the statements that have fallen from the mouth of my friendI think I can call him my friend-the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr country in which such a remark could Calwell), who said that a bi-partisan foreign policy in Australia was impossible. That means a great deal more than the words imply. It means that there is no Australianism in the Australian Labour party; that there is only party political striving for advantage. means that party political advantage is the line to which the Australian Labour party adheres, and that the interests of Australia as a whole could never be threshed out by the two sides of this House, nor could they come to agreement on what is in Australia's best interests. That is the simple inference to be drawn from that statement. It is a dreadful inference and one that, I think, will not be lost on the majority of the Australian public. My friend, the honourable member for Melbourne, raked up a number of things that were said-and meant-durin g the recent general election campaign. They were meant not in respect of the Labour party as a whole, as I think every one of us on this side of the House appreciates. Almost every one of us who spoke during the campaign said that, amongst certain members of the Opposition, there was this tinge of partiality towards the things that the Communists stand for. We all said that, and for my part I would repeat it. But nobody was foolish enough, or unfair enough, to try to brand the whole of the Australian Labour movement, and its supporters in this House and throughout Australia, as standing for that sort of thing. We know very well that they do not stand fov those things. But after all, the experience of the world from 1917 to 1955 must mean something. The experience of the world during that time has been that you cannot do business with the Communists. I say that those who talk of conciliation with people who are sworn to our destruction are not friends of democracy or of this country. The remark of the honourable member for Melbourne may have been thrown off without proper considerationI can only hope that it was so, in all charity. The remark that there can never be a bipartisan foreign policy in Australia is, in my opinion, one of the most dreadful remarks to be made during my political lifetime. I do not know of any other be made and got away with. It means that there is no Australian interest, as such, but only a series of party political interests. I do not say that we are the fountainhead and source of all political wisdom in all matters. Neither, of It course, and with still less force, could honourable gentlemen on the other side say so; but we have done our best, as good Australians, to frame an Australian foreign policy. man is mouthing, without any knowledge or information behind his statement. I think that this is one of our saddest days. If the honourable member for Melbourne, who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, means what he says and is supported by his party, it is a poor lookout. It means that we shall have to cease to take the views of the Australian Labour party into account in framing a policy based on what we believe are the real interests of Australia. If the honourable member for Melbourne is supported by his party, then the gauge is down. I should imagine, after what he said, that there is no chance of agreement and that it is of no use my using any blandishments of which I might be capable to try to get the Opposition into the Foreign Affairs Committee. I think that day has passed, and I am very sorry to have to say so. If that is so, then I must concert with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and my colleagues to decide whether or not we should not complete the membership of the Foreign Affairs Committee from",46,Government Members Hear Hear

Debate resumed from the 16th February (vide page 95), on motion by Mr have been discussed in the community is Thsit the following Address-in-Reply to the Speeeh of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to:We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. motion that the Address-in-Reply he agreed to was moved by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) and seconded by the honourable member for 'Hume( Mr Anderson), and this House had the pleasure of hearing two eloquent speeches delivered by those honourable gentlemen. It is a great pleasure to hear the maiden speeches of new members of this House, and 1 believe that the House will agree with me that both honourable members sbould be congratulated upon their speeches and that we should wish them well for their future careers in this House. The Governor General's Speech adverted to the economic problem which this community has been discussing for some time, and various points of view have been put forward by many people-som e very learned, and some, perhaps, not quite so learned. prosperity, and whatever course the Government may take to solve the problem, it is essential that nothing should be done which would in any way injure the prosperity of the period through which the community is now passing. The Government's policy has been designed to bring about that prosperity, and it has been brought abeut after a long period of troublous rule by the Labour party. Prosperity must be maintained at all costs, and I believe that it is the intention of the Government to take such steps, economically, as will ensure that prosperity shall continue. The problem has been posed in this fashion in the budget speech of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). He has said that there is a boom of consumer spending and private investment. It has been described in simpler language as too much money chasing too few goods. Among the measures to overcome our difficulties which tbe proposal that immigration and development should be gradually eased down. I do not believe that either immigration or national development should be eased down because both are essential to the future greatness of this country. Fnless we have continuous development we shall not have progress, and unless we have continued immigration we shall be unable to take the proper steps that should be taken for defence and development. I suggest that both immigration and development are essential for Australia. It should be-and as I read the Speech of the Governor General it is-the policy of the Government to maintain both immigration and development along the same lines as have been pursued by the Government in the past. It has been said that immigration is inflationary, but I suggest that perhaps it would he better to use the word "" expansionary "" rather than "" inflationary "", because there are various counter inflationary elements in an immigration programme. For example, the immigrants are usually very hard workers. They are usually very saving people, and they are able to contribute a great deal to the development of the economy of this country. Indeed, as has been pointed out, Canada which also has an immigration The problem is one of policy, does not have the inflation from which we have been suffering in Australia. The Government, very wisely, has always had our production needs, and the necessity to increase production, well before it. One of the great aims of the Government has been to ensure greater productivity, and there is no doubt that production bas increased over the years as a result of its efforts. It is very wisely aiming at still greater production, and with that end in view has recently appointed a Minister for Trade and a Minister for Primary Industry. It is the duty of those two Ministers to see that production increases at an even srreater rate in this country than it has done formerly. One of the problems confronting increased production, particularly the production of exports, is the fact that there",51,Paibs
138,Mr Joske (Balaclava) [8.26],"Th eare various agreements with countries outside Australia under which the export of our goods becomes difficult. Although these agreements have their advantages, tliey also have their disadvantages, and the disadvantages may appear rather to outweigh the advantages at a time when we are anxious to export more and more of our goods. Actually, this is not so. I believe that the trade agreements which the Government has entered into have been wise agreements although as a result of them we may not be able to sell as much as we would like to sell abroad immediately. In other words, this policy of greater production will have good results, but they may not be felt in the very near future. It is because of this that the Government has been driven to adopt, other measures such as the imposition of import restrictions. The imposition of import restrictions is an abhorrent policy to the members of this party, because it means government control of industry, whereas this party holds the view that we should refrain from government control of industry so far as is reasonably possible. In any event, the general effect of import restrictions in the long run has been to increase prices, and that, in turn, leads to further inflation, although import restrictions were imposed in the first instance in an effort to avoid inflation. It is necessary to trade with other counattention, is the question of savings. It tries. They will not buy our goods unless we trade with them and buy their goods. That is a further reason why a policy of import restrictions cannot be carried very far. Further, a great many of the imports are raw materials and goods for our manufacturing industries. I understand that about 60 per cent, of our imports is represented by raw materials and goods used for manufacturing here. That being so, if we place too great a restriction upon imports, we shall do damage to our local manufacturing industries. So a policy of import restrictions cannot be carried on for too long. It is a policy which should be eased gradually. The restrictions must be lifted as soon as conditions permit. In those circumstances, we must look to other methods of dealing v/ith inflation, and this brings me to a further point that has been debated in very high quarters. It is the question of heavier taxation. The Government has been urged by learned professors, among others, to embark upon a policy of heavy taxation. Let me say at the outset that I believe that it would be a great mistake to do so. As I said at the commencement of my remarks, this has been a prosperity government; it. has brought about prosperity, and a policy of heavy taxation could only do damage to the community. Heavy taxation removes incentive. It prevents the expansion of existing businesses and deters people from starting new businesses. It generally results in a degree of unemployment. Further, those who pay the heavy taxation pass it on to other members of the community. The manufacturer adds the tax to the price of his goods with the result that we have increases in prices. In other words, inflation is not stopped by such a policy. -Apart from all that, it simply means draining money from the pockets of the private individual and channelling it into the pockets of the Government. The Government then proceeds to spend that money, so heavy taxation does not cure inflation. For those reasons, I urge the Government not to accept the views of those learned professors and others who advocate that policy. Another matter that has been given some attention, but not a great deal of is generally agreed that a policy of savings is desirable, that the effect of savings is to drain off the extra amount that is now being utilized in excessive consumer spending. Far too little attention has been given to this problem of savings. I call it the problem of savings because it certainly has become a problem in the Australian community under present economic circumstances. At the moment, Government loans are looked upon as a very poor investment with the result that the money which should be forthcoming through tbem for public works is not being obtained. Because this avenue is not attracting the investors that it should, the Government has had to resort to a policy of heavy taxation in order to finance public works. This heavy taxation, of course, comes from the pockets of tlie poor old taxpayer. He is the one who suffers. . The big question is how we are to induce people to put their money into savings. This involves a consideration of how public investment can he made worthwhile. We have to. consider how savings can be made worthwhile and how to make the community more savingsconscious. As to how public investment can be made worthwhile, let me point out that if a person invested £1,000 in governrecall the tremendous taxation concessions ment bonds in 1939, that £1,000 to-day would be worth something like £300 or £400 based on 1939 values, whereas if he had bought a house with his £1,000 in 1939, that house to-day would be worth anything from £3,000 to £5,000. Eecently, the Australian Loan Council was called together for the purpose of reviewing the loan market. A t the conclusion of its proceedings, it appealed to the public to invest in government loans, urging upon them that it was their"" patriotic duty to so invest their money and that they paid good interest, and the security was good. It is very difficult indeed to induce a person to believe that it is his patriotic duty to invest in bonds when he can point to the fact that if he had invested £1,000 in bonds in 1939, the effective value of that £1,000 to-day would be something between £300 and £400, whereas if he had bought a house for £1,000 in 1939, that house to-day would be worth between £3,000 and £5,000. In other words, bonds are no longer the gilt edged investment that they once were. The interest is regarded as too low, and the security is not looked upon as good, because the value is not found in them. Apart from buying houses, there are many good industrial and other investments which are regarded as being far better investments to-day than the purchase of government bonds, and for that reason, attention should be given to the question of how we can greatly improve the conditions under which government bonds are made available to the public. Certain proposals have been made. It has been suggested, for example, that the interest rate should be higher and that bonds should be issued for shorter periods or at less than par. In addition, it has been proposed that a new form of savings certificate, akin to the former war savings certificate, should be issued. No doubt all of those are proposals that would be well worthwhile. But the question is: Do they go far enough ? The real attraction that government bonds once had was that they attracted taxation remissions, but the rate of remission has remained static for many years. There has been no endeavour to give better taxation remissions. Honourable members will allowed by this Government to the man on the land for the purpose of encouraging production. That was one of the ways in which we endeavoured to solve the problem of inflation. Those taxation concessions were so generous that tbe present Minister for Trade( Mr McEwen) told honourable members that a man could become rich nowadays only by going on the land and taking advantage of the tremendous taxation concessions that were given to people on the land. If the Government wishes to make its bonds popular so that people will buy them, it mu3t make very much greater taxation remissions than it has given in the past. If big concessions can be made for the purpose of encouraging production, they should be made also for the encouragement of savings, which are to-day equally important. In fact, the weak point of the Australian rconOTby at present is the low status of public investment, which results in people not buying bonds. The bond market could be improved also in other ways. Eor example, bonds could be accepted in payment of Commonwealth estate duty at face value. Such a procedure would not cost the Government very much, but it would be the sort of inducement that would weigh very heavily with a person who wanted to buy bonds. He would consider that a very substantial concession. Another way of improving the bond market would be for the Government to refrain from going into the market and buying its own bonds at less than par, thereby indicating to the public that it did not think its own bonds were worth the full face value. I am perfectly well aware that the economist Keynes was in favour of that being done by governments. However, Lord Keynes was a man whose views varied from time to time and who was always clear in his views to the extent that he believed they could be adapted according to the time, place and circumstance. In the Australian economy, the buying of bonds at less than face value by the GoA'ernment does harm to the bond market and does not improve the status of Commonwealth bonds. However, it is not sufficient merely to make public investment popular in the sense that it is financially worth-while. In addition, we must make savings popular. But how can they be popular when the age pension, is £4 a week for one person, and £8 a week for a married man and his wife? In order to receive £4 a week on an investment at tlie bond rate of 4rk per cent., a man would need to invest more than £4,500, and double that amount would bp needed by a married couple. A single pensioner who has £1,750, or a married couple who have £3,000, may not receive the pension. It is simply not worthwhile savins at present. It is much better to adopt the policy: Eat, drink, gamble and be merry, because to-morrow one can obtain the pension and be much better ofT. test was once the policy of the Australian Labour party, or at least of its leader, but only for a very short period indeed. No one believed that it was really the policy of the Australian Labour party. The means test has a bad effect upon the Australian economic structure because, as a result of it, people will not save. There is no reason for them to do so. It is worse for them if they save than if they do not. If the Government wishes to make its bonds popular it must introduce a form of national superannuation scheme under which, when we pay our income tax, we shall also be paying our superannuation premiums, and under which, when we attain a certain age, we shall be entitled to an adequate retirepeople should behave can have very little ment allowance or superannuation. Once this abhorrent means test disappears, people will be willing to save and invest their savings in government bonds. I realize that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) may ask where he is to get the money to abolish the means test and to make additional taxation remissions on interest from government bonds. The answer is to he found in tbe fact that the Government is spending hundreds of millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money on public works because too little is being invested in government bonds. That money will Le available for the granting of taxation remissions and for the purpose of abolishing the means test. A Liberal leader recently suggested that it is time the Liberal party re-examined its policy. I have advanced the views that I have put forward to-night as a practical way in which the problem of inflation can be dealt with and the policy of the party re-examined. first, express my appreciation of the honour conferred upon me by the electors of Yarra in electing me to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Speech of His Excellency the Governor General referred to three main problems; first, the constitutional problem, secondly, the problem of foreign policy and, thirdly, the economic problem. Like the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske), I shall direct my attention mainly to the economic problem. I think I shall come to something like the conclusion reached by the honourable member-the conclusion that the Government can take very little action to solve the problems of inflation. The main features of the Governor General's Speech, and of the remarks of Government supporters, were exhortations and appeals to the people to produce more and save more, and to do better in other ways. This approach has characterized the Government's attitude to the problem for some time. I suggest that it ignores altogether the important factors that determine much of the behaviour of the community to whom these appeals are addressed. I suggest that these are factors upon which lectures about how the real effect. Many of these matters are under the control of the Government or are subject to Government policy, and have been so since 1949. Man is very much the creature of his environment. When he lives in an acquisitive society in which self-interest is raised to the level of a social philosophy, as it is in ours, then man will",53,Mayit Please Your Excellency

141,Mr Cablets (Yarra) [8.47],"May I ,bear very much the marks of conflict and self-interest, as he does in our community. 1 suggest that it is useless to speak as if all members of the community were in exactly the same position. Not all members of the community can afford to take the same advice. Waterside workers are not in the same position as shipowners. Age and invalid pensioners are not in the same position as company directors. Even privates in the ArmyI am sure that the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) and the. honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) will agree with me in this respect-ar e not in the same position as officers. This being the case, we cannot expect all people to react in the same way to the advice and exhortations given out to them. The honourable member for Perth said that apart from armed strength it is the quality of the citizens that is the final determining factor in any struggle for existence. This is something that deserves emphasis in these days, when we appear to reply so much upon armed strength alone. I think that the nature of the society in which people live has a good deal to do with their quality and the way they behave, and a society in which there is considerable injustice, inequality, and oppresArthur Fadden) in his budget speech in sion, a society wherein the people do not govern themselves, a society in which serious departures from wage justice occur as they have occurred in ours in recent years cannot be a society in which the citizens exhibit all the qualities that please democrats and liberals. And if this is so, it is because of these conditions The Treasurer had at that time been in and not because of any moral fault that some may be able to find in these people. What the Parliament can do about tbe quality of our citizens is, I suggest, very much limited to what Parliament can do about these social conditions. It is hardly the function of Parliament to preach to the people. It is the function of Parliament to make and unmake social conditions. It is only too apparentindeed, it has been made clear in the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General-that one of the most important problems which affects Australian social conditions and which may be solved by Parliament or by parliamentary leadership, is the "" economic problem"", as it was referred to. It is equally clear that the economic problem we face to-day is the problem of inflation. Eecently, eight professors of economics said that even if expenditure in 1956-57 does not increase, imports, and therefore the available supply of goods, will be £200,000,000 less in the coining year. The result, they pointed out, will be a cut-back on demand by the haphazard and unfair process of inflation, a continuation of what has been happening for some considerable time. The December issue of the Review of the Australian Institute of I'ublic Affairs states that the position has been compared favourably with the balance of payments crisis of 1952, but in fact, the Eeview states, the situation to-day is more intractable and deep-rooted than was the situation in 1952. .In view of the experience of the Government in 1952, this surely must be little consolation in 1956. Indeed, when the Speech of His Excellency is taken into account, one may seriously ask whether the Government is aware of the seriousness of the problems of inflation to-day. However, the Government certainly does know that innation exists. The Treasurer ( Sir August of last year saidThe yenr 19.54-55 brought gathering signs or strain in the economy . . . Tlie deficit in our external trade . . widened rapidly and our overseas exchange reserves ran down. By the end of the financial year we had around us the unmistakable signs of active inflation. office for nearly six years. Then he went, on to make this quite remarkable statementThe spiralling of prices ancl costs can be expected to go forward in real earnest. This inflation, which in August the Treasurer seemed to accept as an inevitability, is one described in the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General as threatening to inflict deep injury upon our prosperity. Eecently the London Economist wondered when the Australian Government might need a policy to win an election. Actually, the Speech of the Governor General has not revealed even the slightest sign of one. Although we are faced with an inflation which, on the Government's own admission, would inflict deep injury upon the community-in deed, it has done so already-ther e are only three minor points in the speech which have any bearing at all upon the direct control of inflation. The first is the creation of a Department of Trade to increase our export earnings. I suggest that the Government can be complimented for having set up now a department, the proposal for which appeared in the policy speech of the leader of the Labour party at the last election, but not that of the leaders of the Government. The second is nothing more than a "" careful study of the ways and means of increasing production"". The third is an appeal for restraint in expenditure, an appeal directed alike to all members of the community, irrespective of whether they are living in poverty-and many are -o r whether they are the wealthiest of the community. These proposals, which eould make hardly any impact at all upon inflation, are all that the Government appears now to offer to combat an inflation which is, I suggest, the main cause of the poverty and degradation of many thousands of age and invalid pensioners throughout the Commonwealth. It is the main cause of the shockingly bad housing conditions of more than two-fifths of the people. It is the main cause of the falling standards of food and clothing of fully one-third of the working people of this country. It is the main cause of the totally inadequate supply of schools, education, power, light, water, and other essential public services. Surely we have a right to expect a more constructive approach fo these problems than that which we have witnessed, especially as the nature of inflation has long been recognized. I think it is worthwhile at this stage to that were quite clearly recognized as early examine the inflation of the immediate past, because there are lessons in it for the future. It is a commonplace statement that inflation comes about because of a sudden and large addition to purchasing power which cannot be matched by an equivalent quantity of additional goods. I suggest that it is useless to rely upon a faster increase of production to cure inflation, because inflation occurs only at a time when we have had such a large increase of purchasing power that production cannot be increased sufficiently to match it. The Treasurer recognized this in his budget speeeh in 1950. He pointed out that production had increased at a very satisfactory rate. Indeed, in recent times production has increased more rapidly than wages. It is not on the side of production that inflation can be cured, because inflation always arises as a result of such a large and sudden increase of purchasing power that no conceivable increase of production can match it. The most significant of the increases of purchasing power that have taken place in Australia were a result of the export boom. In 1950-51, there was a £370,000,000 increase of export proceeds. That was followed, in 1952-53, by an increase of £300,000,000. This was a direct increase of 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, of the existing national expenditure. As no conceivable increase in production can be more than about 5 per cent, a year, it can be seen quite clearly that something else must be done than talk about increasing production. Fluctuations in export proceeds have always been the dominating causes, not only of inflation but also of depression in Australia. So, if the Australian economy is to achieve a desirable level of stable development, the distribution of export proceeds must be stabilized. The Government is now proposing to stabilize, so to speak, a downward trend in export proceeds, as is indicated by its intention to introduce legislation for a stabilization scheme for the dried fruits and vine industry. This is the very time to emphasize that we must also stabilize on the way up, if inflation is to.be kept under measurable contvol. The consequences of not doing as 1950. The Treasurer, in the budget speech that he delivered in October, 1950, said' This rise in wool priees will add to our international reserves and from that standpoint it can be counted a national advantage because of the larger quantity of imports we will be able to buy. The internal consequences, however, could be very disruptive unless firmly controlled. Tn make a further great addition to tbe volume of purchasing power, not matched by an equivalent quantity of additional .roods would increase competition for available supplies and divert resources still further from developmental activities into less essential uses. All those things have happened. Treasurer went onTliis would tend to disperse and weaken the national effort at a time when it should be more and more concentrated. Moreover, there would be direct effects on the cost of living because of higher prices for clothing and meat, ancl this in turn would lead to higher wage costs, throughout the whole economy. Within the wool industry itself, property values would soar to boom levels and wages and other working costs would rise, thus weakenin tlie long-term position of an industry whose strength throughout the years has lain in its ability to produce wool at competitive cost levels. The Government will, therefore, bring down measures to restrain the effects which this excess purchasing power would have upon the economy. But, unfortunately, the Government did the problem which the Government now not clo so. The greater part of the finds to be insoluble, but it has a tendency £670,000,000 increase in export proceeds to blame others for the present situation. that occurred in two separated years was Last October, the Prime Minister( Mr. allowed to be spent, and the result was Menzies), made a statement in tbe House what the Treasurer had anticipated. But. that was only the beginning. The Government proceeded to amend the bankthat it is eating into, largely for consumption ing legislation, so that it would not have purposes, our vital international reserve -. power to control private trading bank position is much more accurately described as credit creation. £150,000,000 was added to our purchasboom. ing power by increased new loans by the Of course, wages and consumption have trading banks in the twelve months that increased, but the increase is a consefollowed. The Government, according to quence of inflation caused by other things. whether it has a deficit or a surplus, can If wages and consumption did not increase influence the amount of expenditure; but, in the face of rising prices caused by those in the period following those vast increases other things, the real living standards of in spending, the Government made use wage earners and others would fall of £150,000,000 worth of treasury-bills seriously. Indeed, despite the increases to finance its own operations-that is to that have taken place in wages and total say, it added another £150,000,000 to the consumption, the real living standards total purchasing power. In 1954-55, faced again with much the same problem, the Government found that its 1951-53 amendments of the banking legislation, changing the base date for the call-up of funds into special accounts at the Commonwealth Bank and fixing the amounts against advances instead of deposits, had deprived it of almost all power. Soi t turned to another method. Instructions were given to the trading banks to maintain their cash reserves at least at the level of 25 per cent, of their liquid assets and securities. But, by June, 1955, only one of the six main trading banks had cash reserves in excess of 25 per cent, of its liquid assets and securities. In the case of four banks, The the percentages were lower than when the instruction was given, and in the case of two other banks they were as low as 10.9 per cent, and 6.3 per cent. Soi t is apparent that the control of inflation in Australia requires at least the f u l l re-enactment of the 1945 banking legislation of the Chifley Government. There can be little doubt that the main originating causes of inflation in Australia are uncontrolled export booms, excessive treasury-bill finance by the Government and uncontrolled private bank credit creation. The cost level in Australia has been permanently raised by those factors. That is at the root of in which he saidOur prosperity is ill-founded to the extent This makes it perfectly clear that the present As a result, over a consumption boom than as a developmental of many wage earners have fallen. Since 1953, the value of the federal basic wage has fallen b.y 16s. a week. This affects, f u l l y and directly, about a half of the wage earners in Australia. Further, about 60 per cent, of the people working on federal margins now have a marginal wage which, in terms of real value, has fallen by from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent, since the margins were adjusted in 1950. The case of the watersiders is perhaps the most typical and best known case. Their margin in 1949 was 11-Jd. an hour. After nine applications to the Oommonwealth Court of Conciliation ancl Arbitration it is still H i d . an hour although it should be 2s. if it were to bave the purchasing power now that it had in 1949. I felt it an honour to support the waterside workers in their recent strike because the margin above the basic wage of £2 in that industry is a margin which today has fallen in real value to £1. It is true that wage increases have taken place, but all the statistical measures indicate that wage rates have not risen as rapidly as productivity and the wage rates for a large proportion of wage earners have not retained their real value. These circumstances show that ""'age increases have not been the cause of the inflationary trend, and I suggest that on this point the Treasurer agrees with me because in his budget speech in 1950 he pointed out that direct factors affecting intricate problem. One of the major the cost of living were the other inflationary causes I have spoken of, namely higher prices for clothing and meat which in turn have led to a higher wage cost throughout the whole economy. One was a consequence of the other. The statistical evidence suggests that inflation in 1956 is the result of a relapresent experiencing. tively new factor. The inflation of today is a profit inflation because of the excessive rates of profit investment. Nett sales for private investment in 1954-55 rose from £7S9,000,000 to approximately £958,000,000, an increase of £169,000,000 or about 22 per cent, in one year. Investment is a good thing. Progress is a good thing, but we are suffering from a large overdose of it at the present time. Prices are now rising more rapidly than costs, and the record profits reported by hundreds of companies on the Stock Exchange are proof of this. In the circumstances we have placed before us three main alternatives. The alternative proposed by the Labour party to control inflation is to reduce the expenditure of big business concerns which could be achieved by increasing taxation on large companies and corporations, and tbe income earners in high income groups. The Government, in the terms of the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in October last, has asserted that excessive expenditure bj the consumer is the main cause of inflation. But the eight economists, seeking apparent justice, have said that the expenditure of everyone-ric h and poor alike, those whose expenditure causes inflation and those whose expenditure does not-shoul d be cut. The honourable member's time has expired. [9.12] -As the youngest member of this House-in passing I should like to say that if I remain a member it will take me 33 years to reach the average age of members of the CabinetI appreciate the honour that the electors of Wannon have shown me by returning me as their representative. We have just heard a clever, learned and academic speech from the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns). However, I feel that he has over-simplified an extremely difficult and factors which he has neglected in his argument is that over the last few years the Government has pursued a vigorous policy of development which has placed great stress upon our available supplies of laboui-, capital and materials, and this, I believe, is one of the principal causes of the inflation wbich we are at I was very happy to note in His Excellency's Speech that adequate mention was made of defence, the necessity to maintain our armed forces and to develop them in the years to come. I think every Australian at present realizes that we cannot just sit down in our corner of the world and expect other people to allow us to remain quietly by ourselves. We owe a duty to ourselves, to future generations of Australians, and to the rest of the free world to play our part in the maintenance of world freedom and jieace; and any effective foreign policy directed towards that end must, quite obviously, envisage an effective defence force. There is, however, a far more enduring kind of defence which we have been pursuing over the last few years and which, I believe, we must continue to pursue more and more vigorously. That is the development of this great continent of ours. At present we have slightly over 9,000,000 people in Australia, and when we consider that this country is equal in area to the United States of America, which has over 150,000,000 people, we must realize how sparsely inhabited this continent is. We may not have the same natural riches as the United States, but",56,Mayit Please Your Excellency
142,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order!,60,Mayit Please Your Excellency
143,Mr Malcolm Fraser (Wannon),"every honourable meniber will agree that the possibilities for development in this country are very great indeed. I am sure that I shall live to see the day when we shall have 25,000,000 people in Australia and then we shall be able to look the world in the face far more boldly and play a more effective part in the maintenance of world peace and freedom. Then, we shall not be independent^ but we shall be far less dependent on outside help in times of national emergency. The development which I envisage and which has been taking place over the last few years has been undertaken in two spheres. First, there is the work that private people, groups of people or private companies can do. In my own part of the world, I have seen great examples of this in the agricultural and pastoral spheres. Three blades of grass have heen made to grow where formerly there was only one. Three and four sheep are being carried to the acre on land that formerly carried only half a sheep. Private people are doing this throughout the whole country and it is adding to the national wealth of Australia and thereby making it possible for this country to support more people and, at the same time, maintain a large exportable surplus of primary products. Large companies are helping in this work. The Australian Mutual Provident Society scheme in South Australia will eventually bring into production over 2,000,000 acres of former unproductive Crown land which will be sold to individual settlers. That scheme is an example of adding to the national wealth of Australia. In the industrial sphere we are manuPortland. In two yeavs, the first, new facturing things now which a few years berth, protected by a new breakwater ago we had to import.

This many things are too big in scope or too port will be more necessary than ever in important for private people or even the years to come because development in groups of people to undertake alone. I should like to say a few words about projects that are being carried out at pvesent inluding one which I believe must receive the attention of the Federal Government in the not too distant future. First, theve is the Snowy Mountains scheme about which many honovable members have a far more intimate knowledge than I possess. Eventually this scheme will produce more power than is at present pvoduced throughout the whole of Australia. The first unit is already supplying power to homes and factories in New Soutli Wales. I refer to the Guthega project. Eventually, enough new water will be sent down the Murrumbidgee irrigation system to increase the capacity of that scheme fourfold. Great quantities of new water will also be diverted into the Murray River for the Murray irrigation system. This is one of the best examples of Government action because it is providing new spheres of enterprise and activity for private people. The power from the projects will be used by pvivate people in theiv homes or by companies to produce goods wbich we in Austvalia need fov ouvselves or for export. Tbe water that will come down the two irrigation systems will be used again by individual farmers and add to the national wealth. That work shows -partnership between the Austvalian Govevnment and the people. Both play their part. I wish to speak now fov a few moments of a State scheme. I believe that it merits some attention from this House because it will have effects beyond the boundaries of any one State. In Victoria, a new harbour is being built at the port of Victoria is already overcrowding the ports of Melbourne and Geelong. When rivers. They have a good rainfall totalthe port of Portland is used more extenling about 26 inches a year, but, unforsively as an exporting and importing tunately, it all falls at one period and eentre for the nearby hinterland, it will quickly runs to waste in the sea.

144,Mr Bryant (Wills) [9.31],"I hopemembers on both sides will mean anything unless we recognize the fact that the Constitution, as it stands at the moment, hamstrings us and prevents us from ruling the nation adequately. Repeatedly, we are confronted with the fact that this Parliament is not empowered to make laws in relation to certain matters. I shall therefore direct the attention of the House to what I consider should be done in relation to our constitutional problems. House attracts the attention of a great many tourists. I understand that on Sunday last, about 400 people visited this building. It is becoming a place of increasing national interest. That, in itself, is a tribute to the importance of the Parliament, and should make us proud to be members of it. The Opposition believes that the sovereignty of the nation should reside in tlie Parliament, and we should strive to ensure that it does. The Governor General mentioned three deficiencies in the Constitution: first, the relationship between the two Houses of the Parliament; secondly, the conflict between the State and Federal arbitration systems; and thirdly, the lack of adequate power to deal with inflation. It is important that we should turn our minds to these matters. Over the last few years, many people have abandoned all hope of amending the Constitution. I believe that in the past we have proceeded too hastily when seeking to alter it. Previous governments, upon encountering constitutional problems, have almost immediately referred them to the people by referendum. people to the task of altering the Constitution, we should not do so hurriedly. First, we must decide what amendments or alterations are desirable. I believe that, unless the all-party committee which will be established to handle this matter accepts the fact that finally all power and responsibility must rest in this Parliament, it will break down after a series of conferences without having achieved anything worthwhile. The changes that have been taking place gradually since federation, have given this Parliament most of its power, and have resulted in thc States becoming almost cyphers in some respects with their representatives having to plead to the Commonwealth for financial assistance. Perhaps, in furtherance of that evolution, we should simply insert in the Constitution as paragraph 40 of section 51 a new section to give to the Parliament "" such other powers that it. considers it should possess in the national interest "". In the past, when referendums have beeu conducted, many people have considered it would be dangerous to give additional powers to the Parliament in Parliament Canberra. Many members of this House are better known to the people of Australia than are the members of their local governing bodies, because, by means of the broadcasting system, the utterances of members of this House are literally taken into the homes of the people. At least, our parliamentary elections are more democratically conducted than are the elections of other bodies in this country. Therefore, generally speaking, the people have nothing to fear in giving additional power to the Parliament. This Parliament is just as worthy of the right to rule in an absolute fashion as is the British Parliament. Sovereignty in Australia should reside in this Parliament. Let us direct our thoughts to convincing the people in this respect. Recently, I engaged in research to ascertain what copies of the Constitution are available to the citizens; because, after all, it will be necessary for us to convince at least 2,500 people in a majority of the States of the necessity to amend the Constitution. Honourable members on botii sides are agreed in principle on the necessity to amend the Constitution, but we If we are to commit 5,000,000 must acknowledge the fact that the people of this country will not vote willy nilly on matters that they do not understand. I suggest that we should embark on an educational campaign, in order to inform the people fully of its provisions. It is not reaUy a very lengthy document. I have before me a copy on which is endorsed ""Price, 2s. 3d."". I urge the Government to issuefree an annotated edition of the Constitution, in order to encourage the people to study its provisions.. After all. only the most public-spirited citizens would be prepared to pay 2s. 3d. for a copy. In view of the developments that bave taken place in the printing industiy, no great strain would be imposed upon it in producing a large number of copies. The Government ought to issue free not less than 3,000,000 annotated copies of the Constitution to the people. That will be our first task, and it will take us some time. I hope that we who have spoken here to-night for the first time will live to see the day when that result has been achieved. I do not think we should despair of taking new steps in the matter of constitutional development or expanding the rights of Australians generally, simply because the Constitution stops us from doing so at present. I wish now to refer to a matter that is close to my heart-the State education systems. For twenty years, I was a member of the Victorian teaching service, and for twenty years I saw and felt the frustration caused by shortage of finance and the inadequate resources made available to the people who were teaching in the .Queen's schools. In some States those schools are called "" State"" schools, and in other States they are called "" public"" schools, but they are all the people's schools, and they are the places at which young Australians are nurtured and trained to carry on our traditions. I believe that, in the past, they have suffered much greater facilities than are provided a good deal of neglect, partly because of shortage of finance, and partly because many of the people who have had control of our education system have been tbe products of non-S'tate schools and have not bothered too much about the problems involved. The Government should take action immediately to help to relieve the States of this heavy financial burden. In Victoria, education takes one-fifth of the annual budget. In Australia, the. total expenditure on education this year will be approximately £60,000,000. That, of course, is not a great sum to the Commomvealth of Australia. But to the States it is of considerable importance. This problem of education is one of great urgency. In Victoria, the State which I know best, the secondary schools are jammed to the doors. The building of additional schools has been undertaken, but the children who are ready to use those schools cannot wait until the nails are driven. Education is a matter of extreme urgency and cannot be deferred. Tf a child is debarred, because of inadequate accommodation, from entering a secondary school to-day, or if he has to spend his time in makeshift accommodation, he will never be able to regain his lost opportunities and it will be of no use saying to him. in six or seven years' time, that we bave solved his problem. Tbere are many ways in which tbe CommonAvealth could relieve the States of this great burden, Avithout resorting to constitutional alteration. Section 96 of the Constitution, the section under Avhich Ave haA'e already started to make grants to the universities, action AA'hich has relieved the States of some of their burden, Avould alloAv the Government, if it wished, to double expenditure on education. After all, the State education systems have great sources of ability, skill and man-poAver trained in these matters. It Avould not even be necessary to create another department of State, or to appoint another Minister. The States would be quite capable of handling the matter. There are, of course, many small Avays in Avhich this Parliament could assist education in the States. I believe that the Australian nation should be able to provide for the teachers in its schools at present. The Government could set up experimental schools in each State for the purpose of establishing an Australian standard of education. I am completely dissa tisfied, and I knoAV that a great many other people also are dissatisfied, with the standard of our schools. We have all seen school grounds which are dusty, gravelly wastes, and class rooms that are drab. That is not the environment in which to raise young Australians and to hand on to them the culture that we are rapidly acquiring. The education system is the machine belt by which we can pass on our culture and the means of fostering the ideals that have been advocated by honourable members on both sides of this House. The establishment of experimental schools in the States would, therefore, be one method by which the Government could help to relieve the educational burden on the States. Another method Avould be to enlarge the library service. Australian history has been neglected, and it is almost impossible to obtain cheap publications on most aspects of ouv history. In my many yeavs of teaching, I ahvays found it much easier to find, in the school library, information about the number of men who landed with Julius Caesar on the coast of Britain in 55 B.C. than information about the number of men who landed at Gallipoli with the Australian Expeditionary Force in 1915. Until 192G, the Government produced a publication known as the HistoricalRecords of Australia, in which was to be found despatches from our _ early Governors, and other information to which every citizen ought to be able to turn. Although it is 30 years since publication of those records ceased the Government should take up the task of republishing tliem, and that it should make available to every secondary school in the Commonwealth a set of those already published. That is the kind of thing that the Australian Government could do, and that is one of the things that is needed in the field of education. I believe that it is impossible for the States, from their present resources, adequately to expand their education systems. The States are battling all the time even to build sufFiicent schoolrooms, without even equipping them adequately. It would be a good idea to send educational or cultural attaches overseas, and also to bring teachers to Australia from overseas, not to relieve the staff shortage in our schools or specially to teach their languages to our reluctant children, but simply to give to our children, in their formative years, the chance to rub shoulders with people of a different culture. One of the disadvantages that we incur is our isolation, due to our geographical position. I suppose that not many of us on this side of the House will have the opportunity to travel widely, nor will the majority of the people of Australia have that opportunity. At least, we should be able to have people from overseas come to live with us and help us to gain experience of their culture. In addition, we should get into the habit of rubbing shoulders with people who have different ideals. Those are the thoughts that I want to leave with the Government in my first speech in this House. Others in this Parliament have spoken of ideals. I have those ideals, too. That is why I am here, and that is also why the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) and the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) are here. If one of the furthest back back-benchers on the Opposition side may be allowed to have any kind of aims at the beginning of his parliamentary career, then these are my aims. If , in the course of my stay here, I am able to alter the Constitutionwith the assistance, of course, of the other honourable members of this House-so that it will be more fitting for the Australian nation and so that it will enable the Government to meet national problems as they occur, and if, also, I can help to make the schools of Australia worthy of the Australian children, then I shall feel that my duty has been done. Speaker of this House, by his re-election, has been honoured by trie House, and I am glad indeed of this opportunity to join with other new honourable members in extending to him sincere congratulations. Active campaigning, during the recent election, amongst the people of the electorate that I now have the honour to represent, revealed to me more_ clearly than before the interest that is displayed in parliamentary broadcasts. Some people listen to the debates and question time of this House and of the Senate as a part of their entertainment, _ whilst others listen because of the keen interest that they have in everything political; but the majority of those who endeavour to keep abreast of the decisions of the ISlational Parliament ancl who listen in periodically have been disturbed, and at times shocked, by the conduct of some honourable members. How easy it is for high standards and ideals to be drastically lowered when bitterness takes possession of us! What a disappointment it is to many electors when they see their chosen representatives decline from statesmenlike language to street invective. I am confident that you, sir, as Speaker, will do your utmost to maintain the standard of conduct in this House on a parallel with that of the British House ef Commons. Honourable members should all aim at that high ancl difficult target. In this maiden speech I am pleased to have the opportunity of asking for your",63,Mayit Please Your Excellency
145,Mr Cleaver (Swan) [9.49],"Th esympathetic guidance. With your assistance, I trust that, in company with my new colleagues, I shall be restrained, even when speaking with extreme conviction, ancl when perhaps the sarcastic retort would give me relief. I hope that I may always remember that I speak for a large number of electors who deserve the very best type of service that I can render. By way of passing observation, let me say that it was encouraging to notice the emphasis given to certain items in the Governor General's Speech-amon g them, the fostering of manufacturing industries. achievements of the present Government, overall Australian production falls far short of satisfying the Australian demand. I suggest that we should absorb the spirit of some of our friends overseas, find a new conception of work and l if t production to a point where we shall not only meet our own requirements but we shall be enabled also to compete in markets elsewhere. Secondly, the export insurance scheme to provide cover to exporters against risk of non-payment should make a helpful contribution to increasing export earnings. ment encouragement is vital if firms are to break into difficult and competitive markets in countries with which contracts or financial adjustments may collapse. On an occasion such as this I , for one, feel that a positive note should be sounded, and one's contribution by way of his first speech in this National Parliament should perhaps lay a foundation for later action by the Government. I turn, therefore, to the subject of juvenile delinquency, a universal problem with which other countries are grappling on a very high level in contrast to our national planning-and jet there is the fear that they are engaged in a war which they are in danger of losing. In June, 1954, a national conference on juvenile delinquency was convened in Washington, TJnited States of America at the call of the Secretary for Health, Education ancl Welfare. This conference was attended by no fewer than 475 selected persons who, by their professions or their links with a wide va riety of organizations, could claim a close working association or relationship with youth. One of the speakers was Senator Robert Hendrickson, chairman of a Senate subcommittee to investigate juvenile delinquency. He dealt with the question "" Why are we losing the fight against juvenile delinquency? "" One cannot wonder at the senator's taking such a subject. Probably every honourable member of this Parliament has read articles or viewed magazines or films which portray the desperate situation arising out of crime among American juveniles. A special news service only a week ago contained this reportNotwithstanding all the Chicago's teenage wolf packs are more vicious than Al Capone, according to police in America's largest city. "" Al's boys at least had some sort of sense to their killings,"" said Deputy Police Chief Eobert Eyan to-day. "" The victims were squealers or competitors or other gangsters. These kids kill indiscriminately. They just walk down the street and knock a guy off. Chicago has had twelve murders since Christmas. Four of the victims had not reached voting age."" But for all that has been written about crime in Chicago over the last ten years, the murder rate in Dallas has been over 30 per cent, greater than in. Chicago, and Governin Atlanta 48 per cent, greater. The influences which cause child delinquency are being spread throughout the whole country, for juvenile crime rears its ugly head not only in the major cities, but virtually in all communities. In the United Kingdom, the same problem exists and skilled attention is being devoted to the field of youth. During the early years of the recent war a drastic mistake was made in the United Kingdom when organized youth clubs were absorbed in tbe defence training scheme. To the nation's credit, when the error was acknowledged, youth clubs, strongly sponsored by the Government, were established on a wider scale. It has been recognized that any positive contribution to assist idle youth cannot, and must not, be looked upon as an area for economy. In New Zealand, in 1954, the public was startled by the release of reports of immoral conduct among teenagers. So serious was the nation's concern that a special committee on moral delinquency in children and adolescents was estabOurs needs to be a constant, costly prolished, and its findings could well repgramme of citizenship training. In the resent one of oui' most helpful and up-tofinal analysis, the overall responsibility date handbooks on this subject. Among for assistance in that direction, as has many other .items, these appear in the been found in the United States of summary of conclusions in this comAmerica, is the National Parliament. mittee's reportSexual immorality among juveniles has become a world-wide problem of increasing on a national basis. The time has surely importance. Buring recent years the pattern of sexual becomes delinquent youth. Only a permisbehaviour has changed: it has spread to centage of our youth will engage in younger groups; girls have become more prespecialized studies; only a fraction can cocious; immorality has been organized; the be influenced to join or associate with mental attitude of some boys and girls towards misconduct has altered and there is evidence some helpful group or social activity that homosexuality may be increasing. The new pattern of juvenile immorality is youth field. We have long outgrown the uncertain in origin, insidious in growth and token financial assistance from the Comhas developed over a wide field. Coming nearer home, honourable memNational Fitness Council. I would probers will have read with concern of the pose to submit practical recommendations upsurge of juvenile crime in our various in this connection, and I believe that both communities. Recently, the Australian the Government and the Opposition Broadcasting Commission announced should take the broad view that any senthat in Queensland 32 per cent, of all sible expense to assist our youth should solved crimes within the year related to represent our most certain investment for the 17-21 years age group. At the same continued development as a young time, the increase of delinquent crime in nation. Personally, I am sure that AusNew South Wales was announced as 18 tralia, by positive visionary action now, per cent. In the past, .this young nation could well set an example for the rest of may have been considered to be removed the world in dealing with juvenile delinfrom the direct influence of the United quency and in introducing a scheme for States of America and other countries, citizenship training. All that is necesbut the pattern of Australian life is sary, Mr Speaker, is a burning convicchanging rapidly. Our youth is affected tion that youths, at all costs, must be conby millions of copies of publications and sidered, and adequate provision made for thousands of films which portray an them. approach to horror and crime basically different from our own. Dress and behaviour have also been influenced by a delinquency? There are social handicaps changing population. I say, therefore, which exert a real pressure upon youngwith emphasis, that we need now to accept sters from underprivileged neighbourthe fact that we in Australia have a hoods-overcrowded , unhealthy tenement juvenile problem too. But before it gets living; discrimination, grinding poverty, beyond our control we have a glorious lack of recreation facilities; an atmosopportunity to adopt positive measures phere of crime in the very air they to meet it and defeat it. This nation breathe. But, as one professor has is proud of its universal training scheme. observed, it is the emotional tone of the We may believe that it is good for charachome, not the plumbing, that is likely ter building to have army cadet training to prove a decisive determinant of in our various schools and colleges. It is juvenile delinquency. Many delinquent also good to train our young people to children have parents who can truly be know and respect our national flags. said to poison the atmosphere of the Special grants for education research and home. Marital conflict between such scholarships are also most commendable; parents is common; indeed, one authority but in order to produce good citizens we suggests that tensions in a home where must go a good deal further than that. the parents are deeply dissatisfied with We can no longer leave this growing problem to the States. Let us tackle it come to recognize that idle youth soon under our present administration of the monwealth approved in 1944 for the What are the basic deficiencies causing each other are more injurious to children than a broken home would be. The attitudes of parents towards children, and children's conceptions of their parents, differ significantly in comparable groups of delinquents and nondelinquents. One report in America revealed that 60 per cent, of a delinquent group felt their fathers were indifferent or hostile. This was true of one in five among the non-delinquents. In eight cases out of ten, the delinquents felt that their mothers were not deeply concerned about their welfare. The comparable figure for non-delinquents was only three mother's out of ten. Of the groups studied, one-fifth of the mothers workedmothers of delinquents as well as mothers of non-delinquents. Nevertheless, while seven mothers of delinquents in ten were found giving "" wholly unsuitable "" supervision to their sons, among the nondelinquents only one mother in ten failed in this respect. Certain social situations can, with considerable assurance, be said to constitute fertile soil for delinquency. These are rejection, tyranny, abuse, frustration, failure, limitation of opportunity, conflict of cultures. This Government has a good record in some of the fields related to this problem. New homes are being built, and the people generally are being encouraged to acquire their own homes under home ownership schemes. Family life and education are being assisted through taxation and social services provisions. Eecreation grounds and facilities are planned to-day for most communities. There is, however-, no room for complacency, for mucb remains to be done. Positive action by the National Parliament is essential. My concern, Mr Speaker, is that steps be taken, before a more critical stage is reached, to place the problem of juvenile delinquency on a. national level for review, research and remedial action. There is a deplorable lack of uniformity in Australia in respect of statistics, training of personnel, eourt procedure and correctional institutions. I would like to see the Government convene a widely representative national conference to survey this complete field. The outcome sbould reveal those areas of responsibility where State and Federal action should be co-ordinated. Such an analysis of the Australian situation would, for the first time, reveal to the nation, surely, how justified is the expenditure of considerable time and finance to remove the physical faults which adversely affect our youth, and to develop and preserve democratic idealism among our young people. ""We should recognize that post-school youth activity, which can make such a positive contribution to the defeat of juvenile delinquency, needs, at this important stage in our history, to be given great stimulation. Only a percentage of young people respond, after they leave school, to encouragement to engage in technical or advanced education. Not very many readily associate with the established youth organizations. The result is that idle youths are to be found in every community, with the numbers increasing in under-privileged areas. As I said before, and now emphasize, idle youth soon becomes delinquent youth. Now, sir, to meet this problem, as is also the case in almost every field, trained leadership is required. There is more to youth leadership-particularl y the leadership of delinquent youth-tha n equipping oneself with academic study or completing a short practical course. I envisage the use, in every main city and town of Australia at least, of a specialist trained youth leader who would be available as an adviser, and also a practical leader, to combat developing gangs of delinquents. The Federal Government would be well repaid, if scholarships were awarded to selected young people prepared to devote themselves to this type of youth leadership, so that they may be enabled to gain overseas training in cities where the prevalence of delinquency is more acute than it is in our cities here. Turning to another practical contribution which is overdue, I find myself mentioning a subject which gives concern to every thinking individual in the nation. Comic books, according to the experts, are blueprints for delinquency. In so many cases they are unabashed chronicles of violence and sex. Dr. Frederic Mertham, psychiatrist and director of the Lafargue Clinic, New York, has written on this subject in his book, Seduction of the Innocent. He saysIn 194S when I estimated that some GO.OOO,000 comic hooks were published in the US. each month people were incredulous. Today's circulation figure is in the neighbourhood of 90.000.000 and one crime booka veritable primer for juvenile delinquencyclaims 0,000,000 readers. Do not let us imagine that Australia is only on the fringe of this ohjectional innuence. books, mostly American in origin, are available in Australia, where at least 1,000,000 copies a week are reprinted for distribution in Australia and New Zealand. The education school at the University of Melbourne recently conducted a survey of 375 of these comics, when it was found that only seven in every 100-and they were mostly humormis-were not objectionable. The rest included quantities of sordid, ugly comics packed with sex, murder, war or crime. At present the comics available in Australia have not degenerated to the level of the worse United States examples. Some control is exercised by the Department of Customs and Excise. The State of Queensland has its own act for the purpose of censorship, and recently some 35 comic books were banned. The Victorian Teachers' Union, within recent weeks, was called to consider a total ban on horror comics because of theiv influence on child behaviour. Three Austvalian youngsters have hanged themselves in the past year, copying methods seen in comics. Dr. E. R. Wyeth, of the University of Melbouvne, saysYVe consider that comics provide the potentially delinquent youngster with a deplorable established. Associated youth committtes wealth of material on how to commit a wide have brought together voluntary youth variety of crimes. But an even more insidious organizations, and wovking together ou dansrer lies in the effect that we believe sordid projects such as Empire Youth Sunday, American comics are having on the general attitude of thc teenager-o n his evolving set youth weeks and conferences, much has of values, especially as regards race prejudice been done to break down intolerance and and sex. Tliere is little doubt in our minds prejudice. It is most significant to me that an unstemmed flood of such vicious pubthat Commonwealth grants fov this work lications could contribute to a cumulative lowering of private and hence public morality, have remained static since 1944 and, as through fostering a thoroughly unwholesome the national fitness programme has exattitude on the part of many susceptible panded, State finance has had to incvease. voimgsters towards the true moral values of life. I believe that any lead given adequately to deal with objectionable literature of this kind will be strongly supported by the Australian public. It should be made a federal mattev with its attendant advantages of uniform procedure. I want now to deal briefly with the only direct Commonwealth assistance to the youth of thc nation w hich I have been 7 able to trace. In 1939 the Commonwealth Government enteved the field of youth quite inadvertently by the launching of a national fitness movement, which was aimed to stimulate interest in physiSome 400 different comic cal fitness, pavticularly among the young people of the nation. Co-operation of State governments was invited and councils weve set up in each State. The sum of £20,000 pev annum was provided fov a period of five years and couvses of physical education weve established at four of the six Australian universities. In ST;ite of the war, the movement made remarkable progress and the fund was raised to £72,000 in 1944. Of this, £36,954 was spvead amongst the six State national fitness councils fov their work in youth service and community physical vecveation. An amount of £17,000 was given as supplementary gvants to State education departments to stimulate a physical education pvogvamme within the schools and the teachevs' colleges, and £12,400 was split between the six Austvalian univevsities. eithev to maintain couvses or to provide scholarships for pvomising young people to train in physical education. The sum of £6,146 was retained for the establishment of a central office at Canbevva, and fov depavtmental activities within the Austvalian Capital Territory. A gveat deal has been accomplished during the past ten years. Permanent camps and hostels for youth have been able member's time has expired. follow the debut of four maiden speakers to-night. A Paris would have to come to judgment to determine which of them made the best impression. It would suffice for me to say that they all enunciated splendid ideas, and gave a fresh approach",66,Mayit Please Your Excellency
146,Mr Speaker,Ovdev! The honor,70,Mayit Please Your Excellency
147,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [10.14],"Iwith very great eloquence. I was very glad to hear, whether they dealt with the economy or with national development or with the Constitution or with the human problems of our population, that they took a national and a continent-wide view. That is, they did not take a restricted or a negative view of the functions of this Parliament and of this Government; but they took an expansive and a positive one. I should like to refer to the vital point which was put forward by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) in respect of child delinquency. I suggest that there are three positive steps which the Government might take. delinquency is very largely due, as the honourable member himself stated, to the fact that, in an increasingly industrial civilization, it is very difficult for parents and that family allowances are more to give to their growing families the attention that they would like to give. With our increasing industrialization, we are having the same troubles which have appeared for some time in the TJnited States of America and the TJnited Kingdom; that is, in order to maintain a decent standard of living, the mother has to go to work as well as the father when the youngest child goes to school. The first step that I suggest the Government might take is to see that child endowment for children still at school is at least doubled, because child endowment has not increased during the term of office of this Government. The Government still pays child endowment at the same figure as was paid when the basic wage was half what it is at the moment. I suggest that, with increased child endowment, more mothers would be able to stay at home and look after their children when they come home from school, as I am sure most of them would desire to do. My second point is that the Government ought to ask the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to determine a decent basic wage in this country; that is, the Government should ask the court to restore the cost of living adjustments each quarter as, two and a half years ago, it asked the court to abolish those adjustments. Then, if the average income in this country rose, as it would rise automatically, by about 15s. a week, another contribution would be made towards having mothers stay at home. My third suggestion is that a greater contribution ought to be made to see that families are able to secure adequate housing within their means. Although statistics can be quoted to show that Australians, in general, have sufficient rooms and sufficient houses, there is no doubt that those rooms and houses are extremely maldistributed. The people who suffer most from the maldistribution are those with young families because they are the most needy and the ones who feel the pinch through not being able to purchase houses with decent long-term loans at low interest rates. It is perfectly open to Child this Government, as it has been throughout its six years of office,' to see that housing is made more readily available, that wages are more adequately adjusted, promptly and adequately adjusted also. I wish to refer to the remarks by the Governor General on the Senate. There was no great novelty in the Governor General's reference to the subject, with all respect to His Excellency. As a matter of fact, the last time that he made a speech opening the Parliament, on the 4th August, 1954, he statedA proposal will be submitted to the Parliament for the appointment of a committee of the Parliament representing both Houses and all parties, to review certain aspects of the working of the Constitution, and to make recommendations for its amendment. Among other matters which it is hoped that oommittee will consider is the method of ensuring in the future some coincidence between the dates of elections for the House of Representatives and of elections for the Senate. Then, on the 30th September, 1954, the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr. Turner) asked a question, in reply to which the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) saidThat matter has engaged the attention of Cabinet, and all that is needed now is that I should find an opportunity to have a talk with the Leader of the Opposition, with whom I should like to confer on the subject . . .. As soon as that is done we shall proceed. On the 10th November, 1954, at the end of the session, the honourable member for Gwydir( MrI a n Allan) asked a question of the Prime Minister, and that gentleman repliedI regret that there has been some delay in relation to this matter, for which I accept responsibility. I hope to say something about the matter quite soon. The session ended and ihe Prime Minister had said nothing. On the 10th January, 1955, the right honourable gentleman said that legislation to appoint the committee would be introduced in the next session of Parliament, probably in April. The proposals, he said, would be sent to the Leader of the Opposition. Towards the end of the next session, on the 27th A p r i l , 1955, the Prime Minister said, in answer to the honourable member Tliere has been some delay, for which I accept worried so long as it has a majority in responsibility, in connection with this matter, but I hope that before long we may be able to establish such a committee and get on with the work. The Leader of the Opposition, with the commendable patience which he always shows, on the 13th September last asked the Prime Minister another question on the subject. He was toldI owe the right honourable gentleman an apology in connection with this matter. I must say that in my experience of this Parliament it was the first occasion on which the Prime Minister had offered an apology to the Leader of the Opposition. He continuedFollowing our oral exchanges, I should have sent him a memorandum in writing before now. . . . However, I shall do so within the next few days. The session ended ancl the memorandum had not been sent. Six weeks ago, when the final Senate results were in and it became known that the Government would not, after June of this year, enjoy a majority in that august chamber, the Prime Minister said that he would write on this subject to the Leader of the Opposition. Needless to say, the Leader of the Opposition has not yet received the promised letter. I have quoted these pleasantries at some length because they show all too well how clearly the Prime Minister appreciates many of the problems which face Australia's Parliament, and how slowly he grapples with any of them. This, of course, is a problem that has been known to the Government for the last five or six years. In fact, the Government made certain suggestions regarding it in 1950. The Senate appointed a committee, which, under the chairmanship of Senator McKenna, took admirable evidence and furnished an it-[6.1 admirable report on the subject of deadlocks between tbe two Houses. Once, however, the double dissolution of 1951 had given tbe Government a majority in the Senate, the matter was shelved. We know the anomalies that can arise from having two Houses and having a Senate elected under proportional representation. Such a Senate is very likely to be evenly divided and therefore unable to pass legislation sent up to it from this chamber. The Government is not the Senate, but it panics as soon as the Senate is evenly divided or has a majority of senators opposed to the Govevnment. I must add that I do not share the appvehensions, which many people affect to feel, that the Government will be in a dilemma in the Senate after next June. There w ill then be in the Senate two persons, belonging to a splinter group, who w ill be kept adequately on side, one by being treated as the leader of a party and the other by being treated as a deputy leader, both being given male as well as female secretarial assistance, adequate transport allowances and the perquisites pertaining to such positions. Fov those veasons I would think that the Government had pvotected its flank vevy well. The position in the Senate should have been rectified at a referendum held coincidentally with the Senate election of A p r i l, 1953, and therefore more economically than is now possible. It could have been conducted in association w i th the House of Representatives election in May, 1954, or with the elections for. both Houses last December. Therefove, the proposed referendum w ill be not only a little belated hut also a little expensive. Despite all this, it w i ll be welcome if it provides for real reform of the Senate or, still better, the abolition of the Senate. If it does so, the Government can depend upon the whole-hearted support of Opposition members in this chambev, and probably in the other place as well. One member of the Senate was heavd to say vecently that it had grown in stature. I think that it would be more accurate to say that the Senate, since its numbers increased six years ago, has grown in girth. As long as there are two Houses of Pavliament there will be occasional diffevences between them.",70,Mayit Please Your Excellency
148,For New England ( Mr Drummond),"Wc either give our little Senate laws, Or sit attentive to its loud guffaws. The Senate is either superfluous or obstructive, a mere ornament or a sheer impediment. Therefore, I would hope that when the new relationship between the two Houses is put to the people, they will also be able to consider the alternative proposition that the chamber should be abolished. I hasten to assure honourable members, particularly as I notice that there are in the gallery some gentlemen from another place, that I yield to no one in my admiration for the body of senators as a whole, and for each as an individual. I would say without hesitation that the Senate contains persons as active in the public interest as any in this chamber. I should think that the interests of retirpublic expenditure of State governments ing senators would be adequately safeguarded by providing that, until their 70th birthday, or the termination of the period for which they were last elected, whichever might be the later, they would receive the same perquisites as are received during that period by members of this chamber. In suggesting the abolition of the Senate one is not doing anything that has not been suggested and, indeed, put into operation, in most other parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords, which I believe holds a comparable position to that of the Senate in Australia, has only the power to delay legislation for one year. In New Zealand, a Nationalist government did away with the legislative council. In the Australian federation we find that Queensland, with only one House of Parliament, is no less well governed than are the other five States, which have two Houses. In the Canadian federation we find that Quebec, with two Houses of Parliament, is no better governed fhan ai'e the other nine provinces, which have only one. Nebraska, with one House of Congress is just as well governed as are the other 47 States, which have two. Therefore, tbe abolition of the Senate would merely bring Australia into line with enlightened political practice in other democracies of the English-speaking world. The referendum could also seek a public time public investment by the States decision on two major problems that .were enunciated by His Excellency. In referring to the need for restraint in expenditure, he saidMy advisers want to make it clear that, limited as their powers may be, they will be prepared to use them to the f u l l to counteract an inflation which threatens to inflict deep injury upon our true prosperity. Those are eloquent and ominous words, and they are also completely vague. What are the Commonwealth's powers to deal with inflation? We have unlimited power to impose taxation on whatever scale and in whatever fashion we wish. We can place an embargo or any lesser restriction on imports and exports. We can, through our banking power, cut off bank credit. Wo can, through our domination of the Australian Loan Council, decide the and local and semi-governmental bodies. Wo can also manipulate the currency. No other economic power can be exercised by the Commonwealth. The only clear economic power of the State governments is in relation to securities on land. Is the pvoblem of inflation in Australia not due very largely to the unbalance between investment in the public and private sectors ? The honourable member for Yarra pointed out the very great increase in gross private investment expenditure. 1 shall give thefiguresfvom the year after that in which the horror budget was brought down because one might concede that that year was exceptional. In 1952-53 gross private investment expenditure was £467,000,000. Last year, it was £953,000,000, move than twice as much. Yet public expenditure has been, as the Governor General said, "" approximately static "". By those words, His Excellency meant that it has been declining. In 1952-53 the State governments received, for all theiv activities, £190,000,000. Last yeav they received £180,000,000 and this year they will receive £190,000,000. In the American federation, In 1952-53, local government received £128,000,000 for its public works programme ; last year it received £90,000,000 and this yeav'it will receive £SO,000,000. When one compares any sector of private investment, one finds that there has been a very great increase. I believe that it is correct to say that at the present amounts to less than 4 per cent, of the national income, and three or four years ago it amounted to more than 6 per eent. of the national income. U When we remember that a great deal of our prosperity depends on investment in public services-tw o incontrovertible fields are transport and power-ca n we be satisfied with the way in which the economy is being run? How do we meet the position? I suggest that at the same time that the referendum is held to reform, or to abolish, the Senate, there should be a referendum to arm the Commonwealth with powers over interest rates and over capital issues. By obtaining snch powers, we can ensure that investment is made in valuable private concerns instead of' in a great number of very trivial matters in which at present investment is greatest. I am not talking of all private concerns when I say that. I concede very readily that some of the big concerns in this country like the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited have followed probably a too cautious investment policy. At least they have made vast investments in our basic industries. If we were to have this power over capital issues, although it may be difficult to get it by referendum, and particularly over interest rates, we could ensure that investment was directed into valuable fields and not trivial ones. Eight professors of economics have and increased interest rates. the presence of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) I do not propose to say more about these professors of economics, two of whom are on the Government economic committee. Increased interest rates appear to be a policy of despair. The mere fact that the Commonwealth and States cannot control the interest rates allowed on debentures or shares or sundry borrowings does not mean that we must have increased interest rates on bank overdrafts for whatever purpose or on housing or public loans. This Government has already shown sity in industrial conditions in Australia. the folly ancl ineffectuality of such an interest spiral. Ever since the depression, the overdraft rate in this country in the tion until this Parliament has power case of the Commonwealth Bank had been over industrial conditions. The power has 4^ per cent, till the 29th July, 1952, when been sought on about six occasions by it went up to 4f per cent, and at the same time the savings bank interest rate went P hy i per cent. Again in January of last year it rose a further \ per cent. Commonwealth loans which had always been filled during the war and the postwar period under the Curtin and Chifley Governments at per cent., indeed under the Chifley Government at 3$ per cent., had their interest rates raised to 3f per cent, in August, 1951, and to 4 i per cent, in November, 1952. At the same time the interest rate in respect of housing went up, and everybody had to pay more on an existing or future loan from a building society or trading bank. In furtherance of the same trend, under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, which was referred to in His Excellency's Speech, there will again be an increase of the interest rate of 1-J per cent, for people who buy housing commission houses. There is no future in just increasing the interest rate on vital and sound investments in order to get some investment in those fields. The proper thing is to seek power over interest rates and capital issues and thus see that investment is directed into essential things, and diverted from unessential things. Another field in which I suggest the Government should seek authority by advocated increased taxation referendum is in. connection with indusIn trial powers. I last suggested that there should be a referendum on this subject on the 1.2th November, 1953, shortly after the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, for the first time in a generation, did away with the quarterly cost-ofliving adjustments in its awards. It was then already plain that some of the States would follow the same policy in their awards and that some would not. All the States have followed the policy of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court except Queensland and Victoria, and, in the last quarter, New South Wales. This experiment was followed and failed. The result is that we have a provocative diverThere is no way to cure such a situagovernnients of various political complexions-Labou r and Liberal-including governments under tbe various aliases adopted by the Liberals from time to time. I must confess that some Labour people have not supported the grant of industrial powers to this Parliament, when the Liberals have advocated them, but there have been some others like the late Mr on the wharfs were placed on the public Chifley and the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who have publicly proclaimed that they have never voted against the grant of powers to the Australian Parliament. There is no need to be defeatist about the prospects of such a referendum, because in 1946 the majority of the people voted that this Parliament should have power over industrial matters, ancl the Parliament did not get the power only because there was a majority in only three of the six States. It has been stated by a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir John Latham, on a very great number of occasions that it is necessary for this Parliament to have that power. Therefore, we could try that referendum again, and after the experience and chaos of the last two and a half years, the Australian people would probably repose that power in the Australian Parliament. If a government abused the power, it would go out of office at the next election. 1 now refer briefly to the biggest single I desire to take this opportunity to direct contribution we can make towards eliminating unnecessary expenses, and that is in the sphere of transport. As the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Eraser) pointed out, one-third of the national income is now spent on transport. It is therefore high time that powers over many forms of transport were reposed in this Parliament. That became plain in November, 1954, when the Privy Council threw out State legislation on interstate road transport, legislation which had successfully withstood challenges in the nigh Court for a quarter of a century. As a consequence, that legislation could no longer be availed of by the States to improve interstate highways. In June last, legislation which the States had introPrime Minister asking for the assistance duced in substitution was declared invalid by the High Court, ancl since then none of the States has been able to devise valid transport legislation. The only way in which roads can be effectively financed-inter-capita l roads are the chief ones-is through an excise tax on fuel, which this Parliament alone can impose. We can introduce greater efficiency on the waterfront. It is high time that the people who man the terminal facilities pay-roll, as are those who handle the terminal facilities on the railways. If the wharf labourers were put on the public pay-roll, we could select the men who were to go into the industry, instead of leaving the selection to union officials, of whom many are Communists. We would also ensure that the people in a vital industry were given security in employment instead of being, alone among major transport employees, merely employed on a casual basis. We would, above all, obtain efficient and responsible management. adjourned. posedThat the House do now adjourn. the attention of the House to a most serious matter. That is the improper use of the security service in an endeavour to intimidate a citizen exercising his democratic rights to interview a member of this Parliament in order to bring a matter to his attention. This particular gentleman evidently has a very interesting story to tell, but time will not permit me this evening to relate all that he may tell. He is a gentleman who is known to the Government. He is particularly known to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) because, away back in 1951, this man wrote to the Prime Minister. I do not intend to mention his name at this juncture, but he said that he wrote to the of the Government in forming an international democratic alliance for the purpose of combating communism in Australia.

151,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [10.39],"understand that his object was to form this organization to organize new Australians to oppose the growth of communism in this country. He duly received an acknowledgment signed by Mr A. S. Brown, secretary of the Prime Minister's Department. Nothing happened for about four months, until the 19th March, 1952, when he received another communication signed by Mr A. S. Brown, secretary of the Prime Minister's Department, in which he said1 refer again to your representation in conPetrov had had in selling their story to nexion with your proposal to form an organization entitled The International Democratic Alliance. I understand that a Commonwealth Security Officer has since heen in direct toueli with yon They were interested at first. There is concerning this matter. The security officer did not discuss the proposition with this new Australian, but he did induce the new Australian to do some work for the security service. This is the work upon which he was engaged -suddenly, after be had interviewed thfi He was given to understand that Dr. Bialoguski had under surveillance H member of the Russian legation whom it was hoping would defect at an early date. Strangely enough, the security service doubted the bona fides of Dr. Bialoguski. It was not satisfied as to whether he was working genuinely for the Australian community or the Australian Government or whether he was in fact a Russian agent, and it put this other new Australian on to watch Dr. Bialoguski, who was employed by the security service watching Mr Petrov. In order that this new Australian might be able to carry out his work more effectively, he joined with Dr. Bialoguski in the distribution of liquor which was obtained improperly through diplomatic channels. On one occasion when Dr. Bialoguski was asked where he was obtaining these supplies of liquor, he said he wa.s getting them through diplomatic channels with the aid of "" that thief Petrov "". This particular gentleman was known to the New South Wales police as being engaged in this traffic, but it was also known to the New South Wales police that he was working on behalf of security and, therefore, he was not apprehended, although they knew that this was going on. NowI come to the point to which 1 want to direct the attention of the. Government. The security service has an important function to perform in this country, but, in my opinion, it is not part of the duty or work of the security service to intimidate Australian citizens, whether they be new Australians or old Australians, who want to interview a member of this Parliament in order to bring any matter to his notice. This particular gentleman, no doubt encouraged by the success that Dr. Bialoguski and Mr the Australian newspapers, approached the Daily Mirror in .Sydney, and the Daily Telegraph, to publish his story. correspondence in existence to indicate that they were interested in the story. They had been interested in the earlier stories published by Dr. Bialoguski and by Mr Petrov and Mrs. Petrov. But representatives of the newspapers, he was visited by security officers. Those security officers questioned him as to whether it was a fact that he had approached a member of this Parliament, and they wanted to know what he had discussed with the member of Parliament. They further indicated to the chap that they knew he had been to two of the newspapers to sell his story. According to my information, they said, "" We are not worried about Dr. Bialoguski; you can say what you like about him; but do not say anything about the Commonwealth security service"". Strangely enough, after this interview, the newspapers lost all interest in the story. There is no doubt in the world that security had been informed about what was happening. I should like this gentleman to be given the opportunity of telling his story. Where is this great vaunted freedom of the press that we hear so much about from time to time? There was any amount of space available in the daily press to publish the story of this scoundrel Bialoguski. There is no doubt that if this chap is allowed to tell his story it will be proved. This gentleman is well known to security and to the Government. I understand he served with British security overseas before he came to this country. His work was known. I suggest to the Government that it ought to make some investigation. L do not know the names of the Commonwealth security omcers who interviewed this gentleman. If I knew the names, I would give them to the Government, but it ought not to be very difficult to find out who it was who interviewed this particular chap to intimidate him and to mal.2 it plain to him that as a new Australian he should do certain things. I do not know whether he is naturalized as yet, or whether it has been said to him that unless he does what security wants him to do and refrains from telling his story to members of this Parliament, he may be sent out of the country, but I understand that that is one of the suggestions that have been conveyed to him. I want the Government to investigate this matter. I want it to discover who were the security officers who approached this particular man. I likewise want it to y.r::cate to this Parliament exactly : what type of work this man was supposed to be engaged upon for security. It could check up on his bona fides. I am prepared to let tbe Prime Minister or any member of the Government who cares to investigate it know the name of this particular man. I tcld the Government some considerable time ago. There is no doubt in the world that if the Government is game enough to have an investigation, it will prove that my allegations are based on f.nrt=. My allegation is that for a period great quantities of spirituous liquors were being brought into this country through diplomatic sources, free of duty, and were being peddled on the Australian market at great profit to the people who were engaged in this particular traffic. The Government would not do anything about it because the particular gentlemen in whom it was interested at the time-Dr. Bialoguski and were securing supplies of liquor to be placed on the Australian market. It is known to the New South Wales police, as it is known to many other people, that they were engaged in this traffic. Let me say finally to the Minister for is at the table, that my purpose in rising to-night is to protest against this improDer use of the Commonwealth security service. I think it is a most serious thing in a democratic country. It is a tactic that one would expect to be employed in a police state. The security service is endeavouring to intimidate Australian citizens. It does not matter how long they have been in this country. Whether they have been here long enough to become naturalized British subjects or not, they are Australian citizens, and they have a right to approach any memher of this Parliament if they want a matter ventilated. I suggest that the Government ought to regard this as a rery serious matter, and conduct an immediate investigation into the allegations that I have made. have a matter that I wish to bring to the attention of the Ministei' for the Minister is aware, certain wool growers have been deprived, over a period of six or seven years, of their share of joint organization profits by reason of the litigation known as the Poulton case. Briefly, the faets are that, during the war, certain dealers were allowed to buy wool direct from growers and subsequently submit it for appraisal, Some of those dealers, in order to induce the growers to sell wool to them, promised that, when the wool was sold by the acquisition authority, if the profits were paid to the dealers, they would pay those profits back to the wool-growers in any event. As the Minister will recall, the present Government passed legislation directing that the profits should go to the growers in any event, and not to the dealers. Some of the dealers took legal action, with Mr Poulton as the nominal plaintiff, to contest the validity of that, legislation. One thing that has always puzzled me is the delay that has occurred in bringing this litigation to finality. Although Poulton ancl his colleagues have professed that they want, this money, tbere CIOPS not seem to have been any great hurry on their part at any sta?e to obtain a legal decision. Indeed, I think that, when the matter was first before the High Court of Australia, it was the Australian Government that took action to have it brought on for hearing.

154,Mr Freeth (Forrest) [10.49],I.,77,Adjournment Security Service Wool Wa R Service Homes Primar Y Production
155,Primary Industry ( Mr Mcmahon). As,"Court decided in favour of the Government, there have been indications that application will be made for leave to appeal to the Privy Council. But. again, there has been a long period of delay. The net result is that a total of some £2,000,000 bas been tied up. That may not seem much to a government that deals in thousands of millions of pounds, but it means a great deal to individual wool growers to have £500, £600, or even £1,000, tied up over a period of six or seven years. AVe are now beginning to see why the private dealers who agreed to pay this money back to the wool-growers in any event have ;oined in this litigation and ave actively engaged in keeping tlie money tied u]). It seems that they hope by some means or othev to claim commission. If thp money is paid through them to thp growers, instead of directly by the Commonwealth to the growers, the dealers may hope to claim commission. Thai., of course depends on the original bargain with the wool growers from whom they bought their wool. Theve is one aspect of this mattev that perfectly legal, it seems grossly unfair is a little move disturbing. It was recently brought to my attention that one firm in Western Australia had circularized growers offering to release the Australian liability to the dealers-in other words, to free the money tied up by the Poulton case, if the growers would undertake to pay commission of 3 pev f-ent. on that money when they received it direct fvom the Commonwealth. Of course, a farmer who has been waiting six ov seven years to collect £500 ov move, which he would gladly use on his farm at any time, is subject to great temptation to accede to the vequest. If he did so, he would get his money immediately instead of having to take the chance of litigationand I suppose that, although the High Couvt decided unanimously that the Commonwealth legislation was valid, there is a chance that that decision may be upset, and the grower might then have to pay commission to the dealer in any event-o r having to wait, possibly for an indefinite period, to receive the money from the Australian Government without any deductions. In those circumstances, there is a great temptation tor the growers to yield to the pressure of the dealers, pay them 3 pev cent, now, and let them give a release to the Australian Government, which will then pay the money direct to the growers. I suggest that the Minister should inquire into the situation that has arisen and that, if he finds what I have said to be correct, he should make a clear and positive statement that the mattev will be brought to finality as soon as possible. If possible, he should give some indication of the date by which it will he brought to finality, and he should state in clear terms that there is no obligation on any of the growers to pay commission to the pvivate dealers. If the growers ave prepared to wait for a little while and take theii chance on the result of the 1 litigation, I should say that there is a good cliance that, they will get the money without the deduction of any commission. As the litigation has dragged on for so many years, and is apparently approaching finality, the dealers seem to be trying to cover themselves by collecting some commission. Though theiv action may be that dealers who have been partly responsible for farmers being kept waiting six or seven years, or longer, fov their money, should now try to cash in and extract Government fvom any commission from the farmers. Therefore, T ask the Minister to publicize the exact position. The farmer who is in urgent need of the money will pvobably pay the commission, but, if publicity is given to the matter, farmers will at least be enconraged to wait a little longer and not suffer the deduction of commission from money that is realy theirs. am very glad to see that the Minister for is about to relinquish control of the War Service Homes Division, and his successor designate, who is at pvesent in the position of having powev without glory, are both present in the House to heav about a vevy serious mattev. T refer to the distvess that has been caused by the backlog of applications for assistance fvom the division. Let me say to the retiring Minister that his administration and the administvation of the division are not challenged at the administrative level,",77,Adjournment Security Service Wool Wa R Service Homes Primar Y Production

157,"Primary Industvy ( Mr Mcmahon), Who","although the 'Government's policy is challenged. The net result of that policy is to drive the ex-serviceman seeking a home, and already in receipt of approval for a loan from the division, iuto the hands of the black-market interest operator who exacts a charge of 10 per cent. I have a simple but effective case to put before I lie Minister. I rlo not raise tha matter from the viewpoint of Labour visa-vis Liberal, or Opposition vis-a-vis Government. I ask the Minister and his successor designate to try to find a formula that will assist these ex-servicemen who suffer real distress after they have received advice from the War Service Homes Division that their application for assistance is approved, but that they must wait for a specified period before the money is available to them. Let us get down to reality in thes? mattevs. Let us consider the statistics and see whether, between us, we can arrive at a solution of the problem. The War Service Homes Division has received an allocation of £30,000,000 for the current financial year. I am sure the Minister will agree that that is so. I believe the division's allocation last financial year also amounted to £30,000,000. The last advice that we in this House received was that there were 30,000 applicants for assistance, to 11,000 of whom advances were made. That leaves a backlog of between 19,000 and 20,000 applications. Let us leave it at 19,000. the applications are effective. The honourable member has the wrong figures. used are those that were given to the House. If we accept the Minister's statement that only 60 per cent, of the applications are effective, we are left with about 10,000 applicants still waiting for assistance. This makes the case I am going to present all the more direful in its implications of the lack of imagination on the part of the Government and of lack of fluidity of advances to ex-servicemen for the essential requirement of home building. The interest rate on advances from the War Service Homes Division being low, there is a growing desire to take advantage of assistance from the division. This is what happens in one aspect of the division's activities. I shall not deal to-night with the question of new homes built by the division and occupied by ex-servicemen. I shall deal now with the man who is in a desperate position, and who lives in a flat, or with his in-laws, and whose housing is perhaps sub-standard and out of all consonance with Australian living standards. In his desperation he clutches at a straw. He does even more than that. By the combined efforts of himself, his wife, his friends, his sympathizers and his local member of Parliament, he obtains a house somewhere in the electorate, or even elsewhere. He ascertains the valuation of the house. It is inspected and a loan is approved by the War Service Homes Division. They then say, "" Your £2,750 loan is made available, but you have fifteen months to wait"". The Minister agrees that that is the procedure. I want to know why, in the name of sweet reasonableness, there should be a lag over that period. Is it because the provision of £30,000,000 for this purpose is inadequate, as very obviously it is? I notice that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden) is in the chamber. Is it because the Government has become terrified of inflation? Tf the Government, or the Deputy Leader of the Government tells me that it is afraid tc invest in housing for ex-servicemen, the sort of capitalism which the Government represents is finished; it could not be otherwise. Considering the matter from the aspect of the infiltration of communism, treatment of this kind produces discouraged and disheartened men. The points I want to make can be made clearly in the cases of MrX , Mr Y, and Mr Z. They are ex-servicemen in my electorate, and I do not want to use their names. The first man saysI am an ex-serviceman, and my problem is with War Service Homes and the delay which is occurring in the settling of claims. Aly loan of £2,750 was approved last March, and my builder went ahead, and now the home is finished, to be precise, it isfinishedto-day. After contacting War Service Homes, they advised me it would take a further eight to twelve weeks for this money to be paid over to my builder and to discharge the mortgage. Having been assured that the money was immediately available I contracted witb the building society, which is now charging me f 5 a week until I get into occupation of my home.

159,Mr Haylen,"The figures I haveiliie amount or not I am legally obliged to pay homes legislation, which has stood in illU lo a week, and I am wondering where the cheap interest rate and the service to ex-servicemen comes in from the present Government. Mr Y, who is a technician in a Sydney factory, by the combined efforts of Eobin Hood, little Joan of Arc, and Hercules, got himself a house in Sydney, an existing property, at a reasonable price, and after being assured by the department that it would be another twelve or fifteen months before the money would be available, although the loan was granted, he did what the normal man would do and went to the local branch of the Commonwealth Bank where he has an account. A. sympathetic manager said, ""Yes, I think we can do something for you. There is a provision, or a government instruction in relation to these cases. I will look it up"". He looked it up, and he came back and said, "" I am sorry, old man. If it will take longer than nine months to get your money from the War Service Homes Division we cannot do a thing for you "". Who fixed the period of nine months? Who put the X there, because the whole matter is so ridiculous? In very few cases is the waiting period less than between twelve and fifteen months. The case of MrZ is the same as that of Mr Y. This is the position that we arrive at, which applies only to existing properties. The Minister knows cases of this type, because he has handled so many of them. These people get a house and they obtain approval of an advance. They think, "" If I could only get the money instead of the promise of the advance, I would get into a home"". There are two aspects of the matter. There is the domestic aspect, because the family is overcrowded, concerned and in difficulties, and there is the financial aspect. They resolve one difficulty. A house is ready for occupation because of the sympathy of the occupier, who is prepared to get out. But they cannot get the money from the War Service Homes Division. Where do they get the money, instead of waiting for fifteen months? It is, of course, ridiculous to think that any vendor would wait for that period of time. They do get the money, but they get. it through the black market at 10 peicent. I say that the war service able gentleman's time has expired. two wars, has been degraded and desecrated by the Government's failure to face up to what appears to me to be a simple problem of loosening this money. What happens? These people go to the Commonwealth Bank and they are told that the money can be advanced to them if the waiting period is only nine months. The War Service Homes Division says, "" Yoi! must wait fifteen months "". They go to their solicitor, who says, "" It is bad, but I have a trust company which is prepared to lend you the money"". I have statutory declarations, which I am prepared to give to the Minister, that show that in no less than 15 cases of residents in my electorate, applications have been made and money has been loaned from trust funds at 10 per cent. If that is not disgraceful, I should like somebody to tell me what is. The Treasurer and Government supporters talk about their eight economists. There is a black market in interest and the first victim of it is the ex-serviceman in his necessity, and he ought to have a better go than he is getting. I do not think that it is an impossible problem. I just cannot understand that the difficulties are so immense that they cannot bo overcome. I know that the Minister has been most sympathetic and I know that the honourable member for Biverina( Mr Roberton), who will become his successor, will in turn be most sympathetic, but we want something more than sympathy. We want some dynamic action. We may get some explanation from the Treasurer as to why the problem cannot be met. The provision of £30,000,000, of course, will not meet requirements. What is wrong with £60,000,000 or £90,000,000? Will it wreck the economy to have these things done? All that the Government would be doing in return for the work of the ex-servicemen would be providing them with a home at a low rate of interest under a scheme that has worked successfully since the original legislation was introduced. The sad and horrible thing is that the pressure on the home-seeker is at its highest peak on the ex-serviceman, who is being mulct to the tune of 10 per cent.",79,Adjournment Security Service Wool Wa R Service Homes Primar Y Production

If he thinks it would be wise to distribute it, I shall have it distributed and, if necessary, published in the newspapers. I do not want to commit myself on this matter, but I think it is hoped that a decision will be made by the Privy Council in the very near future. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) referred to war service homes. I think he knows the facts just as well as I do, because towards the conclusion of the last Parliament I went to great trouble to assemble all the facts and present them to the House. I did so because I thought there was an obligation on us to let the Opposition know just as much as was known by the department. One cannot divorce the problem of providing homes for ex-servicemen from the problem of providing homes for people in other sections of the community, nor can we completely ignore the general position of the building industry in this country. I think it would have been wise if the honourable gentleman had looked at the problem of war service homes in the light of the position of the building industry. If he were to look at the problem in that way, I believe he would come to the conclusion that this is not a time at w hich 7 any government would be willing to provide extra funds for building. If it did so, prices would be boosted and it is very doubtful whether many more homes would be provided with the extra funds.

There has been an increase by 21 per cent, of the number of people employed in the building industry since June, 1953, but there has been only a 7 per cent, increase of total civilian employment throughout the Commonwealth since then. I could go on in this way for a considerable time. I think the facts indicate that it would be a mistaken policy for this Government, or any other government in Australia, to pump further money into the huilding industry at present. In fact, the sensible course would be to try to get some reduction of the building industry throughout the Commonwealth. I put the matter in this way. Tf very much more money were pumped in, whether for expenditure on home building, civilian building or public works programmes, the probability is that costs would rise and inefficiency would creep in. pumped in, but interest is charged at 10 per cent, instead of 3$ per cent.

AlthoughI have heard many accusations about usury, it is an amazing thing that, so far, not a single member of the Opposition has bought a concrete case to me and asked me to look at it to see whether anything could be done. The honourable gentleman says that he has fifteen statutory declarations relating to his own electorate. Let him give them to me. If he does so, I shall look at them to see whether I can do something. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr ""Ward) made some extravagant accusations and said he could mention the name of an individual. When I asked him, by interjection, whether he would give me the name, he turned tail, funked it, ran to his corner and refused to give the name. This is an extraordinary practice. Allegations are made in the House, but when I ask honourable members opposite to produce a case to me so that I can have a good look at it in order to find out if it is a case of real hardship, and so that, if it is, I can they had a better deal than they have make a sincere and honest attempt to do something to relieve the hardship in the document that I hand to you. member would not give it to me before. He had to be forced to do so against his will. If these cases are given to me, I shall have a look at them. I should like to have the fifteen statutory declarations made by people living in the electorate of the honourable member for Parkes. I wonder whether he can produce them. I ask him to show me fifteen statutory declarations dated before to-day. It will be very interesting to see them, if he has them. If he has the interests of those people so much at heart, what an amazing thing it is that he has not already presented the documents to me and asked that the cases be looked at! Let me deal with the provision of funds. This Government is making a record allocation of £30,000,000. half as many houses as £30,000,000 would that if an ex-serviceman, -pending the have built in 1949. able member for Lalor must remain silent. has made substantially greater amounts of money available for the provision of war service homes than any previous r government. I cannot cover the whole of this subject to-night, but I shall repeat a statement that I have made before. I think it should be repeated whenever tbe Opposition raises its voice on this problem. Between June, 1950 and June, 1955, this Government has provided 74,000 homes for ex-servicemen. During the period from the 6th March, 1919, to the 30th June, 1955, only 91,000 homes were provided, at a cost of £169,000,000. Rome was not built in a day. We cannot provide everything for the ex-serviceman when he asks fov it. I have had the good fortune to sit on the ex-servicemen's committee of Cabinet for the last three years. I venture to say that the leadersof the ex-servicemen's movement will be prepared to enter the Cabinet room and advise the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) and those who sit around him that never before have received from the Menzies Government during the period from 1950 to 1955. We are proud that we have been able to do this job, and we shall continue to do it because we are proud to have the responsibility of providing homes for ex-servicemen. We do not think for one instant that we can solve all their problems in a moment; but we believe that the problems ave being rapidly solved, ancl we hope that by the end of the term of this Government there will be very few ex-servicemen who do not own their home. desire to say a few words about the war service homes problem, and to strip the matter of all the evasion that has been indulged in by the Minister for Primary fact is that this Government adopts the attitude that it should not make available more than a specific sum of money annually for the provision of war service homes, but, at the same time, it informs the ex-servicemen's organizations of this arrival of the end of his waiting period,",82,Adjournment Security Service Wool Wa R Service Homes Primar Y Production

The Plain,"can raise finance from an outside sourcea bank or a building society or through trust funds-h e can go ahead and commence to build his house provided he assures the War Service Homes Commissioner of his intention and provided that his plans are satisfactory. if r . McMAHON -Does that refer to old homes or new homes? home or a new home is involved is beside the point. A so-called old home is considered to be old only because a private contractor has built it. It may not be more than three months old. In some instances, it may not be more than three weeks old. Nevertheless, the War Service Homes Commissioner will not purchase such homes because the funds made available to his organization are inadequate; and as a result the soldier has to wait fifteen months. He can get a home constructed almost immediately if he is lucky enough to have a rich uncle in F i j i , if he is pre-war service homes has nothing whatevei pared to pay high interest rates to a banking institution or if he knows ;i solicitor with trust moneys to invest. In those circumstances the pressure is not lessened on the available supplies of labour and material but is actually accentuated, because contractors are building in anticipation of ex-servicemen being able to get private finance. Consequently, the reply given by the Minister that if the Government makes more finance available it will increase the pressure for materials and labour is sheer humbug and does not square witb the facts. The private contractor knows that if the ex-serviceman can arrange private finance, or if the contractor himself can supply it, he can go ahead with the construction of houses, and thus he increases the pressure in the building market for both men and materials. The net result is that in this country to-day thousands of ex-servicemen are paying higher interest rates to outside organizations than they would be obliged to pay to the War Service Homes Division which was established in this country to give to the ex-serviceman the benefit of lower interest rates and other concessions in the purchase of homes. If the statement of the Minister squared with the facts and no funds were' being made available from outside sources at higher interest rates, he would be justified in saying that the Government will not make available additional funds because it seeks to prevent inflation and pressure on the building market. All the Government is doing to-day is helping private banking institutions, solicitors with trust funds to invest, and all sorts of people to lend funds at higher interest rates. These people, of course, are helping ex-servicemen to a degree; but, nevertheless, they, are depriving ex-servicemen of the lower interest rates and concessions which the people of Australia believe they are entitled to. That is a damning indictment of the Government's attitude in this matter, and it is high time that members of the Parliament who are ex-servicemen jacked-up against the Government and ejected it neck and crop. racket. The need to make additional funds available for the construction of to do v/ith inflation. Mr SpeakerT h a t the question be now put. The House divided. (MR. SPEAKER-HON . ARCHIE CAMERON.)
