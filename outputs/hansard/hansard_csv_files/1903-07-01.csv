Then if, later on in the session, there seems to be a general consensus .of opinion that tlie orders, as reconsidered and redrafted, in view of the suggestions made, can be adopted without very much discussion, I may then see my way elear to reconsider my former announcement, .and endeavour, if possible, to have them adopted during the present session.

Is it true that no snch distinction is to be conferred on privates? Sir JOHN FORREST In regard to the first question, I may say that no recommendations were made by this Government. Two officers received the order. In reference to question No. 2, the Royal Warrant restrictsfcheorder to commissioned officers. I have a copy of the Warrant which clearly sets that forth. In Committee of Supply : Treasurer) I move That a sum not exceeding £75,000 be granted to His Majesty for or towards defraying the services of the year ending 30th June, 1904. Honourable members will recollect that in the Commonwealth Treasury we follow whafc is called the cash system. Under our Audit Act the appropriation made for the year absolutely lapses on the 30th June, and the Treasurer has nofc one shilling left in the Treasury with whichfcopay accounts. to settle the contents of the Estimates, and also their form and order in many respects, and. I am, therefore, not in a position just now to bring down an ordinary Supply Bill, with the various appropriations presented under their proper divisions and subI have had. divisions. Such a Bill would provide for an appropriation of from £350,000 to £400,000. I hope before the end of the current month to be able to make the financial statement, and to bring down the Estimates. Honourable members will realize thafc it is nofc easy, even in a State, to obtain the necessary information forfchepreparation offcheBudget, but when particulars have to be obtained from six States, the task becomes all the I hope that the honourable more difficult, and if I am able to make my financial statement before the end of July, I think I shall do very well. I am making If he afterwards desires any every effort to do this, so that honourable members may know whafc provision has to be made for the current financial year, and in order thafc the States Treasurers may ascertain my views before they are called on to deliver their Budget statements. In the meantime, it is absolutely necessary that I should have at my disposal a certain amount of money, because ments have to be made every week or fortnight. There are also men in our employment whose wages have to be provided for from week to week. The £75,000 now asked for will form part of the Treasurer's advance vote-los t year fche amount of £200,000 was granted-and will be applied solely to the payment of claims which are daily arising, such as progress payments on contracts, wages, and small advances to officers of the different departments, in order to enable them to carry on until the end of the month. . After having placed the financial statement before honourable members, I shall be able to ask for Supply to cover our ordinary expenditure for one or two months. If I were to introduce a SupplyB ill which was based upon last year's Estimates, I should create a great deal of confusion in all the Departments, besides imposing additional work upon them in making transfers from one set of entries to another.

Under the circumstances, I think that the House will entrust me with the sum for which I ask, relying upon my assurance that I propose to expend it for only absolutely necessary purposes. worth) I think that the explanation given by the Treasurer is perfectly satisfactory. I am sure that no honourable member desires to see the arrangements for the payment of our public servants in any way dislocated. It is pleasant to reflect that in all matters of this kind we can place implicit reliance upon the statements of the Treasurer. His position is a little different from thafc taken up by some Ministers, who entertainfcheidea that no man should be considered other than a rogue until he has proved his honesty in the police court. I should like to ask my honourable friendbecause fche remark is nofc irrelevantwhether any provision has been made in this schedule for compensating Mr Goldring for tbe outrageous treatment he has received afc the hands of the Customs Department? I learn fromfchepi-ess thafc his books have now been returned fco him, and thafc, to use a colloquial expression, the Minister for Trade and Customs has been "" barking up fche wrong tree."" Whether a citizen of another country, whose own Government had to intervene through the Imperial authorities, can be subjected to a system of torture, misrepresentation, and absolute tyranny by the Customs Department, without receiving any compensation for the outrage, is a matter for serious consideration. measure will contain provision for carrying I desire to impress upon the Government the necessity for treating Mr Goldring with the same magnanimity which is extended to every man who carries on his trade under the protection of the British flag. . I believe three and four months of the financial year that serious injury is being done to him, and that a greafc mistake has been made by the Customs Department. I trust, therefore, that Mr Goldring will not be forced into the law courts to fight; fche Government. The Minister for Trade and Customs incurs no risk in such an action, because he has millions of pounds of Treasury funds afc his ' back. I hold that it is unfair for him to use those funds for the purpose of fighting a poor individual citizen. If injury has been done to Mr Goldring, if he has been maltreated during the past six months, a magnanimous Government should grant him compensation for the offence thus committed. I trust that this matter will T receive consideration at the hands of the Treasurer. I repeat that the Committee can accept the Treasurer's statement in regard tofchisBill as absolutely correct, and, unless some grievance requires to be ventilated, we need not occupy very much time in the discussion of this resolution. am not satisfied with the information given to the House by the Treasurer in regard to the sum of £75,000 for which he is now asking. A t present we do not know if that amount forms a portion of the accounts of last year which have lapsed. It may be required to meet an expenditure in excess of the vote of last year. Until we have further information upon this matter we should nofc be asked to sanction the proposed advance. The Treasurer declares that fche Estimates will be laid before the House within a reasonable time. But unless the practice of the British Parliament is followed, and they are tabled before the beginning of the financial year, I do not think that the Government are acting reasonably. It is true, of course, that occasionally a supplementary Budget has to be submitted, but if this House is not able to determine the estimated expenditure for the financial year, when that year has eleven months to run, there must be something radically defective -somethin g which we ought to attempt to remedy. After the Estimates have been laid upon the Table, the Treasurer has stated thafc honourable members will be asked to sanction a Supply Bill. That on the public services of the Commonwealth until the end of September, so that the Estimates may not be considered until after that period. In other words, between will have elapsed before we have an opportunity to consider the Estimates. If we deem it advisable fco make reductions in those Estimates we cannot then effectively carry out our intentions, and thus the general public are deceived. I was hopeful that this Parliament would break away from the bad practice of the States Legislatures, under which fchey exercise practically no control over expenditure until ifc is impossible fco effectively check ifc.

Those ordera were framed with the object of preventing large sums of money being voted in a thin House. Whilst, under present circumstances, there does not seem to be serious objection to the' course proposed, I think when measures of this sore are likely to be brought forward, it is within the power of the responsible Minister to notify honourable members to that effect a week before.

Under the cir(Parramatta) -I cumstances, it would be just as well if the Government came down with the bold announcement that it is not intended to give the country districts throughout Australia any facilities in the way of postal ortelegraphic accommodation. I can understand that during the first six or twelvemonths of Federation there might be excuse for delay in these matters ; but now nearly two and a half years have elapsed, and we have the backward state of affairs which I have described.

But every schoolboy knows thafc that sort of arithmetic is not true, because such a policy diminishes tlie power of the people to use the means of communication provided. I trust that in fche future we shall have some progress made, and that the country districts of New South Wales, Victoria, and the other States will not be starved.

But under the next clause any party may at any time apply to the Court or to a Judge for an order that the cause be transferred from the registry in which it is pending, if that is not the principal registry, to the principal registry, or from the principal to a district registry. It must be assumed that actions will be brought either where the cause of action arises or where the defendant resides or carries on business.

The practice of destroying telegrams after the expiration of that time has been attended with many disadvantages in Victoria,' as it has been found impossible in some cases to prove that certain communications have passed between the parties to an action.

As the sub-clause stands, it implies that the court possesses Admiralty jurisdiction. I would further point out that the whole tendency of recent procedure has been to limit trial by jury. The determination of most issues by a Judge is less expensive, and there is less risk of injustice in regard to findings as to fact, although I admit it is desirable that citizens should be brought closely into touch with criminal procedure, which involves issues that they understand and appreciate. Sub-clause (2) states that ""Upon the application of any party to a suit for a trial with a jury of the suit, or of any issue of fact, the High Court or a Judge shall make an order for the trial of the suit or issue with a jury."" I am convinced that such a provision will be greatly abused. I know that it frequently happens that a litigant who has a bad cause asks for the trial of his suit by a jury. The freer that we leave the hands of the High Court in this direction the better. Personally, I think that we should retain the first part of this provision, and omit the second. clause (2) should be excised. In the preceding clause it is laid down that unless the court otherwise orders, the trial of issues of fact shall be by a Justice alone. I have no objection to the Sub-clause (2), however, makes it compulsory for a Justice, upon the application of notice that the High any party to a suit, to order its trial with a jury. If we do not desire to make ifc comIf sub-clause (2) be pulsoryfchafcsuits shall be tried with a jury, ample power is given to the court under sub-clause ( I . ) Queensland practice. Is we may not go too far, the Attorney General proposes to restore the right of any litigant to have his suit tried with a jury if he chooses to make an application. Upon fche whole, I think ifc would be better to eliminate sub-clause (2). English custom. this provision we deny a suitor the right to have his case tried by a jury at the outset, but restore it to him subject to an application, whereas in England fche right exists to have suits tried by jury, subject to an application to take ifc away. I think there is no we should be acting wisely in omitting the sub-clause, and thus rendering fche provision absolute. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I agree that ifc is advisable to make the trial of any'civil suit by a jury subject to the order of a Judge. But I would point oufc that if we eliminate sub-clause (2) we shall have to make further modifications in sub-clause (1). I also desire to direct attention to the distinction which is intended to be drawn between those two sub-clauses. Reference to section 61 of the Queensland Act shows that it isintended to apply to cases the trial of which is not in progress at the time. It is evidently not applicable to the ordinary legal procedure after a writ has been issued. It might be desirable-seein g the class of actions which are likely to be brought; before fche High Court-to have the procedure by which issues are to be tried determined by an order of the court.

MrL . E. GROOM I take them to mean that the court would have power to give all the ordinary remedies, either in common law or equitable jurisdiction. If tlie alternative be put in the way suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi, it will give a Justice power to decide whether any case is a proper one in which a jury should be granted. attention to the concluding words of subclause (1).

But the property qualification for the electoral franchise has now been swept away in eveiy State except, perhaps, that of Victoria, and it does not appear reasonable that a property qualification for jurymen should remain. The idea is, of course, that a man shall be tried by a Jury of his peers; but, as a matter of fact, that, to a large extent, is impossible in the States where jurymen are exclusively selected from a particular class. to apply to criminal jurisdiction, and that is the reason I propose to amend it . The amendments I propose to make are rendered necessary by the fact that the High Court has been deprived of all criminal jurisdiction. clause is inserted to regulate the method by which the panel is to be summoned, it is A'ery obvious that the juries will be selected as they are now selected in the States. were made in the Judiciary Bill depriving the High Court of its original criminal jurisdiction, it became necessary for us' to take out of that measure those clauses which had been drawn to relate to that original criminal jurisdiction. When we reach the similar clauses in this Bill, I shall have to propose that the whole of Part IV . be omitted. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney is raising a question, which would have been more apt if we had proceeded with fche Bill as printed. But, in consequence offchealterations made in the Judiciary Bill, I shall have to move certain amendments, and therefore the question of criminal juries in the High Court cannot arise. It is necessary to retain this clause, because it is the States should be put upon the broad national basis Courts which are to undertake, as Courts of first instance, the hearing of all causes within the original jurisdiction of the High Court, whether exclusively or concurrently. Consequently, unless we go to the expense of preparing a jury list of our own, we must accept the laws and the jury panels as we find them in the States. As the more economical method, and the method most in accordance with the principles laid down, I propose to accept the States jury panels in the States Courts and under States law. for Kennedy last night submitted an amendment in respect to the appointment of a public defender, and such an amendment could only apply in cases where Pederal jurisdiction is exercised by the States tribunals. Are we unable to regulate the procedure in such cases 1 are unable, bub it would be a very expensive plan, because it would involve the preparation of special panels, although the juries are to hear causes in the States Courts before States Judges and under State procedure. The amendment would mean the introduction of one piece of Pederal machinery into the States Courts, when all the rest of the State machinery would be left unaltered. The method proposed by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney would be expensive, awkward, and very rarely required. nofc mean to say that fche trial of a civil cause is as important as the trial of a criminal case, but, at the same time, there W h e n the amendments appears no good and sufficient reasonespecialh'in these days, when tbe last vantage ground has gone of those who, in municipal matters, hold that there should be a property qualification--for providing that even in civil cases juries should be summoned from those specially qualified byfchepossession of property. The Attorney-General may be able fco afford us some reason for the continuation of the custom, other than the blind following of precedent set by existing tribunals. In criminal matters there is of course absolutely no justification for a property qualification in the jurors, even from the stand-point that in matters involving property, those who have to decide the case should have what is termed "" a stake in the country.""

If citizenship is the qualification, why should there be any difference between the jury list and the electoral rolls? to form the jury list, naturally there would be no difference, but I think the honourable and learned member will find he has a long road to travel before he induces either this Parliament or the States Parliaments to -adopt his view. A t any rate, this is not the time to consider it, when we have .accepted the States jurisdiction and the States Courts and procedure in every -respect. AVe should be adopting an unnecessary and troublesome, if not cost!)'', procedure, if we now endeavoured to introduce the suggested jury panel. MrM c C AY (Corinella) -^-I ask the honourable and learned member for West Sydney to withdraw the amendment. The snore we consider the proposal the more we I should-like to point see that there is a very long road to travel before we can arrive at a satisfactory result. In the first place, as was pointed out .in the interjection by the honourable member for North Sydney, tlie Committee, in regard to the Judiciary Bill, have said in effect that the States Courts are good enough in most cases to try Pederal causes. That is a view with which I most heartily agree, and I fancy the honourable and learned member for West Sydney was on the same side as myself in those crucial divisions. If the State system is good enough, surely we should accept it as a whole. The amendment simply strikes out the words ""tbe qualification of jurors,"" leaving the State laws still to prevail in regard to the preparation of jury lists and jury panels, and the summoning and the empanelling of juries. By tbe time the honorable and learned member had made all the consequential amendments which are necessary to carry out his object, he would find that what is needed is really a special jury Act. He suggests that we should take the FederalI t would be very simple electoral rolls, but they are very much in nnbibus at pi-esent. I agree with him that the matter is one for serious consideration when the opportunity arises to consider it , but as this is purely a Procedure Bill, and we have deliberately substituted the States Courts for the High Court in so many instances, I think that we should avoid alterations which, at least, would mean a considerable amount of trouble and unjustifiable expense. The cases in which juries are required are chiefly libel and breach of promise cases, and surely twelve citizens with property are as able to deal with such cases as twelve citizens without property. jurv svstcm into the Commonwealth. arguments which have been brought against my proposal are very numerous, but. I do not think they are equally cogent. Thet Attorney-General says that it would be very expensive to prepare the jury lists, but the expense will not be anything if the jury lists are co-incident with the electoral rolls. As to there being but a few cases to be tried by juries, I would point out that the Attorney-Generali n introducing the Judiciary Bill, told us, I do not know how many times, that there were a great number of cases of the most extraordinary character awaiting trial before the High Court, because the persons",23,George Turner Thi S B I L L Appro General I Admit That The Rules Of Court

AVhen the High Court is within Federal territory, I do not think that the fact that the Federal site is -situated within New South Wales will necessitate compliance by the High Court with the laws of evidence in force in that State. In any case it will be very awkward for the Judges to follow one set of laws in one State, and another set in another State. In that case the Judges would have provided for them some splendid exercises in mental gymnastics. Not only the laws of evidence, but others, such as tliose relating to the -competency of witnesses, and so on, are mentioned in clause 78. There may be variations in the different States, and I am not at all clear but that in some cases the High Court will have to follow thecommon law of England. I am not prepared to express a definite opinion upon this matter at present, but it is one of great importance, which, I think, demands the most careful attention of the Attorney-General. If it should be found that the High Court has no law of evidence of any State to apply to it , I do not know what the exact result will be. The Justices may make laws of evidence under the rules authorized under this Act, so long as they -are not inconsistent with the Act. in these rules. learned member for In d i suggests that a paragraph should be added to the effect that until otherwise provided by rules of court, and subject to any express provision in the Bill, the laws of each State relating to -evidence, competency of witnesses, and so -on, shall apply to the proceedings of the High Court in that State. the state of affairs of which the honourable And learned member has been speaking. better than no state of affairs at all. Moreover, the provision would be only temporary. and in the meantime I shall be glad to see the amendment suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi. not know whether the clause is necessary, as full provision is made in tlie schedule for applied by the schedule, under order 37, are different from those applied under this clause. In this clause the American practice has been followed, whereas tlie order follows that which is in vogue at present in the States. It will be better to strike out the clause and trust to the rules, which are as obligatory as the clause itself would be. learned member for Corinella has called attention to a very important matter, which, in my opinion, is already provided for in clause 7S of the Judiciary B ill ; but I am glad to have his criticism, as well as the valuable suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Indi. As I read clause 78 of the Judiciary Bill, the laws of each State, including the laws relating to evidence, procedure, and other matters will, except as otherwise provided, be binding upon all courts exercising Federal jurisdiction in that State, in all cases in which they are applicable. That appears to me to introduce the not altogether satisfactory condition of affairs which the honourable and learned member for Corinella expected to arise. That is to say, the High Court will find some variations in its laws of evidence. AVe had, however, to face that position when this matter was under discussion two years ago. After drafting a series of clauses relating to the law of evidence.and endeavouring to lay down general principles, it appeared at last that any proposal of this nature must be postponed. The very large jurisdiction exercised in the States Courts, to which the la ws of evidence in force in each State must appropriately a Ppl} ! would make it a difficult matter, 7 even at the appeal stage, to take up a case which had been conducted under State laws of evidence, and then deal with it according to another High Court standard.

This practice frequently saves the expense that would be involved in bringing witnesses -some hundreds of miles to attend the court. In this connection, I would point out that this Parliament can exercise jurisdiction in divorce matters, and, as most divorce cases .are undefended, I think that an affidavit of the service of a divorce petition should be sufficient evidence of such service having been effected. Under the present practice at is necessary to obtain witnesses to prove thab service has been made.

A similar case occurred in Svdney. as it stands certain men are denied justice. In the case to which I. have referred, Gillespie and 46 others were prora'ised by the Government, of Victoria that, if they retired from the military forces, they would receive 9d. a day each for rations for six months. The Chief Justice decided, however, that, although the men were entitled to receive the rations promised, it was a rule of law that no soldier or seaman could sue the Queen, on the ground that Her Majesty had such a compassionate heart that she would be only too glad to see justice done in these matters. Unfortunately, the Victorian Government did not place the amount upon the Estimates, and consequently themenhaveneverreceived it. I am sorry that the Attorney-General has not provided for such cases. to my mind since I referred it to the Defence Department.

I should like the A t I think that the case was torney-General to consider whether provision should not be made to allow the Commonwealth to be garnisheed. The Victorian Railway Commissioners can be garnisheed, and when a specially incorporated body such as the Commonwealth is instituted, I do not see why it should not begarnisheed, though, of course, the Crown cannot be garnisheed. All the privileges of the Crown, however, except those in regard to the issue of executions and attachments, are being abolished, so that I do not see why we should not provide for the garnisheeing of .the Commonwealth. public interest? do not see why public servants should form, a separate and distinct class. It was found advisable not to renew the provisions of the Act allowing the attachment of wages in the railway service, and it seems very strange that the rail wav servants should bein a different position from that of otherpublic servants in the State. There ishardly any remedy at. all, however, against the public servants of the Commonwealth. Some of us made a big fight, when the Public Service Bill was before the Committee, to require a public servant who did not pay his debts to be dealt with by his superior officers. It is a wrong toward those who have to deal with public servants not to allow tbem to garnishee for debt. I should like the Attorney-General to give the matter his consideration. Inasmuch as the Commonwealth is entering the legal arena, like any private person, I do not seewhy it should retain this privilege. with the honourable and learned member forCorio that proceedings should be capable of I do not think so. being taken against the Commonwealth in all cases where, in a claim against a private person, an action or proceeding would lie.

We declare in effect that even where a State allows execution to issue think the provision is ultra vires. The provision is certainly an anachronism, because it is the survival of an old practice which is now being very largely discontinued, and I think it should therefore be struck out. the honourable and learned member wishes me to repeat tbe arguments that have already been used to show that there is a broad distinction between the Commonwealth in its corporate capacity and the individual subject. We have yet to learn of a single case in which a State having had any judgment given against it has failed to discharge ifc without delay. have been under appeal. the honourable and' learned member is Certainly, why not ? enthusiastic in the application of the principle of universal justice, he has not been able to allege a single definite case in which a judgment has not been satisfied by a State.

Amendments agreed to -know when he may act upon a judgment I wish to direct attention to the rules relating to appeals from the decisions of Justices of the High Court. They are to be found upon page 74. To my mind one of the most important matters in connection with appeals is that the successful litigant should be able to ascertain at what time he is free to act upon the judgment which he has obtained. When a man has obtained a judicial decision in his favour, if the other party to the suit desires to appeal, he should be compelled to do so promptly. The effect of rule 4 is to allow a litigant 21 days from the date of the j udgment in which to gi ve noticeof appeal, and to calculate thafc date from* the time thafc the judgment is entered or otherwise perfected. Nowi t frequently happens fchafc a judgment is not drawn up for a month or six months after it has been delivered, especially if it is a complicated judgment. Under this provision, therefore, an unsuccessful litigant would be able fco I would point out to play fast-and-loose for months before his rival would know whether he intended to appeal. Further, under order 7 fche appeal cannot be heard for 42 days from its institution. I cannot understand the reason for prescribing such a long period. I would remind the Attorney-General fchafc under the rules of appeal to the Privy Council, an appellant is allowed only fourteen days from the time that judgment is pronounced to give notice of his intention to appeal. I suggest thafc equal prompitude should be required in the case of appeals from the High Court. big place. tralia embraces a large territory, we have to fix a limit within which a person who is aggrieved may announce whether or not he intends to appeal against fche decision of the court. The successful litigant is entitled to the fruits of his judgment as soon as possible. I suggest that sub-clause (1) To my should be made to read "" if the appeal is from a final judgment, within fourteen days from the date of the judgment being pronounced."" Sub-clause (3) of rule 4 provides that tbe court or Judge may extend the time within which the notice of appeal must be served. I think that ifc ought to provide for the extension before the time allowed for the notice has expired. Ifc is very material that fche successful litigant should which he has obtained. I suggest adding to sub-clause (3) the words "" before the expiration of the period above stated."" I would further point out that rule 7 provides thafc notice of appeal from a final judgment shall be lodged at the first sitting of a Full Court after the expiration of 42 days from the institution of the appeal.

Of course the Full Court can always postpone the hearing of a case, if it thinks thafc either party to the suit is not ready to proceed. I suggest, therefore, thab the words "" twenty-one "" should be substituted for the words "" forty-two."" with all that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said about the necessity for promptitude in giving notice of appeal. I am glad thafc he is prepared to allow 21 days' notice in the case of Australia. I do not. think that that period is too long. Further, I believe that it ought to be calculated from the time judgment is pronounced. But I do nofc agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in the opinion thafc under subclause (3) of rule 4, the extension ought to take place within the time allowed. Under the English and Victorian rules, and, I believe, under the Queensland rules--and certainly under the rules on page 70there is the beneficent; provision thafc the court or Judge may enlarge or abridge the time whether the time be expired or not. It may be that, by some unfortunate accident, the time has been allowed to expire. It is quite true thafc, under the Privy Council rules, the Supreme Court of a State has no power to enlarge the time; but under colonial legislation the Court has that power in Victoria. Judge did enlarge the time,' but on appeal that enlargement was disallowed under the Privy Council rules. It would, perhaps, be tying the Judge's hands too closely if we provided that the notice of appeal must be served withinfchetime allowed. One of the parties may thinkfchafche has plenty of time afc disposal; but, by some unfortunate slip, it may be on the part of a clerk, the notice of appeal may not be served in time, aud ifc would be regrettable if, under the circumstances, justice could nofc be done. It is to prevent unfortunate accidents of fche kind thafc rule 46 has been introduced, and in the States CourtsI never knew a similar rule to be a source of difficulty or abuse. In altering tlie rules ifc must be remembered that tbe Judges of the High Court will be able to pass new rules providing these be not annulled by Parliament; but it would be perhaps fettering the court too much if the Judges were not allowed the same power which Judges in the States Courts and English Judges have, namely, to enlarge the time, although the period in which the notice of appeal should have been served may have elapsed. Of course, there is the discretion of refusing, but I think we ought to adhere to the practice which has been followed for a great number of years in England and in Australia. I have nofc had the decision of the Attorney General as to the 21 days referred to in sub-clause (1) of rule 4 in the rules relating to appellate jurisdiction. There may be some difference of opinion in regard to the matter referred to by the honourable and learned member for In d i ; but I attach a great deal of importance to the subclause I have mentioned, when taken in conjunction with the clause which follows, providing thafc the period shall be reckoned from the date when the judgment or order is "" signed, entered, or otherwise perfected."" I think that, in sub-paragraph (1), the words ""from the date of the judgment being pronounced"" ought to bo inserted, and the provision as to "" signed, entered, or otherwise perfected"" omitted. the suggestions made by my honourable and learned friends. The suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, which he has just made, seems reasonable and necessary; but I am in In fact, one some doubt as to-the suggestion made in regard to sub-clause (3), nofc only for the reasons given by the honourable and learned member for Indi, but because, as the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, reminds me, if we make appeals to the High Court too difficult, we further encourage appeals to the Privy Council.

The subsidy amounted to £44,000 per annum, divided as follows :-Ne w South Wales, £ 1 0 , 0 0 0; Queensland, £ 7 , 5 0 0 ; Canada, £25,000 ; and Fiji, £1,500.

Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN If c is £59,000' in all. £60,000. The original application for the renewal of the service for two or three years,, or more, was accompanied by the request that we should increase the £44.000 contributed by the contracting parties to £72,000,. an addition of £28,000. I have not laid thepapers upon the table, because the negotiations, were mainly verbal, but honourable membersmay safely take whafc I say to be correct, as. I conducted them myself. It was pointedout thafc, having regard to deterioration and wear a.nd tear, and the cost of the half yearly overhauls of the vessels employed in. the service, operations had so far resulted, in a loss. The service, however, is a promising one, inasmuch as the number of passengers is increasing, and a full cargo istaken from Canada nearly every trip, whilesometimes goods have to be left behind, has nofc been so satisfactory as the contractors had wished, and in respect to it there has been a loss. Having consulted my colleagues in regard to the application for an increase of £38,000 in the subsidy from all the contracting parties, I laid it down thafc we should not, under any circumstances, give more than our proportion of an increase of £16,000, which we thought on the whole to be fair. It has been stated outside thatfcheprovision in the contract that the Mioicera shall be brought up to the same standard of efficiency as the two otherboats in the service is the only consideration for this increase of subsidy, but that is nofc so.

I put this proposal before the House simply as a tentative one. A certain interval has to be bridged over, as a good many contracts expire within the next year or two. Both the Suez contracts expire on the 31st January, . 1903, and the extension now asked for will take the Canadian contract up to the 30th April of the same year. Various other contracts expire in 1905 and 1906, but they .are more in the nature of coastal contracts. Sir -Canadian contractors to increase the speed of their boats ? rate of speed is computed at about 13^ knots an hour, including detentions, the-contract time for the journey from Sydney to Vancouver, with stoppages at Brisbane, Fiji, and Honolulu,-being 21 days. That is much about the rate of speed maintained by the Suez boats. MY. CROUCH -I s there any arrangement for an extension of the service, to Melbourne -or other parts of the Commonwealth ? would mean the granting of a larger subsidy. -One object which the Government have in view in asking the House to ratify this -contract is that within the next two years, before the expiration of the Suez contract, -provision must be made for"" the letting of fresh contracts for the carriage of mails from England to Australia and back .again, and as the whole matter must then be gone into, I am loth to allow this route to become closed-. -open may save us money when we come to bargain for fresh contracts in connection -with other routes. save us a great deal of money in the end. If the Canadian service fell into desuetude, instead of being continued at almost a nominal cost, we should have more difficulty in arranging for a new contract upon the same route, because others coming into the business would not have the good-will of the trade which has been gathered together during a number of years by the present -company. I think, therefore, that as a matter of policy it would be wise to continue this contract for the time specified. The Postal Department has not yet finally drawn up the agreement which will have to be made, but it will be simply an extension pf the agreement which has just expired. The only difference will be in regard to the extension of time and the extra payment. . Thirteen trips a year have to be made each way, and the Miowera is, to our satisfaction, to be brought up to the same degree of efficiency as the other steamers in the service. The carriage of mails to England by the Canadian route at present takes three or four days longer than by the Suez route, but if a couple of years hence we can arrange for a more up-to-date service, with larger, better, and quicker steamers, as I think is possible, the Canadian-Pacific Company will, I believe, from what I was told when in Canada by people connected with it, be prepared to shorten the railway jourhev across the continent by 24 hours, and the Canadian Government are most anxious to secure the assistance of the I m perial Government in obtaining a contract for a service across the Atlantic equal to the American services. called for tenders. bridge over this interval of two years, we may at the end of that time, with the assistance of Canada and the participation of the old country, obtain speedier service than that which we now have by the Suez route. The existence of the Pacific cable, too, may reasonably be expected to increase business between Australia and Canada, because it has been the experience of other countries that the laying of cables has brought trade into existence where hitherto it was unknown, and has largely expanded that already in existence. abandoning the Suez services ? Sir EDMUNDBARTON It is impossible to say what will happen in regard to the Suez services. When I have received an answer from England in regard to the publication of some papers which were marked private, but which I think there is no objection to make public, I shall be able to lay the whole matter before honourable members by placing all the documents in connection with it upon the table.",37,William Mcmillan Thafc Is Though The Trade From Australia To Canada

It would be a disadvantage-to lose the opportunity of maintaining the Canadian service, in view of the contracts which we may have to enter into in regard to other services, and in view of the arrangements which we may see fit to make upon the expiration of the present Suez contracts. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -It is a shrewd business-like proposal. Sir EDMUNDBARTON worth) -Unde r ordinary circumstances, I think that the fullest information should be placed in the hands of honourable members before they are called upon to discuss an important question like that now submitted to us. The correspondence which has passed, and the history of the service up to the present time, should have been laid upon the table. Although this matter was originally arranged by the States Governments, and a tentative arrangement only is now proposed, honourable members should be made fully acquainted with the details of the service. The Prime Minister has told us that it is intended to extend the original contract for a short period, and that the Statesof Queensland and New South Wales have, not protested against it, but, preoutlay, should not be the subject of negotiasumably, are content to have .an additional tax placed upon them. Although this is being dealt with as a Commonwealth matter, the States which are more immediately interested will have to bear the expense under the operation of the bookkeeping system. I feel quite sure that a service like, that in question must have some subsidy in the early part of its existence, if for no other reason than that it is desirable to keep up mail communication with other parts of the Empire. Where two highly protected countries like Canada and Australia are concerned, something must be done to make up for the loss of cargo, arising from the ridiculous trade restrictions imposed. The only question for consideration is whether the amount to which the subsidy .has been increased is reasonable under the circumstances. Upon this point, we have no definite information beyond the statement of the Prime Minister, who, I presume, has examined tbe position. Sir JOHN QUICK W ill this not be new expenditure and be charged to the Commonwealth ? Sir WILLIAM "" M c MILLAN No , it will be transferred expenditure, and I am speaking on the understanding that the proposal now before us has been within the cognisance of the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales, and that they . are satisfied to bear the increased expenditure. member been so informed 1 although the language used in conveying I think so. the information may not have fully indicated all that I have stated.

I should think that, as this is not a purely Commonwealth affair, we ought to have the formal acquiescence of the States Governments' who are more immediately concerned. the Post-office Department on their behalf. quite aware of that; but we are now passing through a transition period, and, al^ though, eventually, expenditure of this kind will be distributed over all the States, there is no reason why a tentative arrangement such as that now proposed, under which two States will be called upon to bear extrations between those States and the Commonwealth. respondence which has passed is known to those States, but I have not before me any letters which have passed between thoseStates and the Commonwealth. have already said, it is very difficult for honourable members who take an interest in this matter to understand the exact position of affairs. As, however, an arrangementhas been entered into by the Commonwealth and agreed to by Canada, and we have the statement of the Prime Minister that it is absolutely necessary to grant theincreased subsidy in order to insure the continuance of the service for the present, I shall not oppose the motion.

The amount is not large, and if it is necessary in order to prevent the service from falling through, I shall be satisfied to assume that the Government have made the best possible bargain. entirely agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that it is extraordinary that we should be asked to renew the subsidy at an increased amount without having before us all the particulars of the agreement, which has been tentatively entered into. A t the very least, we should have been, placed in possession of the correspondence which has passed between the Government and the agents of the company. We are told that the service is not paying. It is very easy to make a statement of that kind, but we liave no right to accept the mere ipse dixit of any one upon a matter of this kind. We should insist upon being made acquainted with the whole of the negotiations that have passed. The question thatoccurs to my mind is-whe n is the line likely to pay if it has not proved remunerative up to the present 1 It has already been in existence for eleven years, andlam'notsurethat there has ever been any assignment of the original contract entered into by the late Mr James Huddart. Immediately the additional subsidy, amounting to £7,500, had been secured from Queensland, bhe financiers in London, to whom Mr Huddart was responsible, stepped in and took the contract out of his hands. Mr Huddart had sunk the whole of his fortune in the venture, and I think we should-do well to remember with every kindly feeeling the services of a man who may be said to have given his life to the enterprise. entered into the contract because he thought it would pay ultimately, but I think his lines were cast in very unpleasant places, because, after nursing fche service through its earlier and more troublous days, he had ifc taken from, him afc the moment when there appeared to be a prospect of its proving remunerative. about. It was because the service was becoming unprofitable that ifc_ was taken out of the hands of Mr Huddart. by Mi'. Huddart's representativefchafcwhen the Queensland subsidy was secured the service was placed upon a most satisfactory basis. However, be that as it may, we cannot but remember with the greatestpossible appreciation the strenuous and heroic efforts made by Mr Huddart toestablish the line. Returning fco the original question, if the line does nofc pay now, is it likely to prove profitable in the nearfuture ? I am disappointed to hear from the Prime Minister that we are sending very little cargo to Canada. It appears, that Canada is deriving all the advantage from this line of ccmmunicafcion, and fchafc being so, the question suggests itself whether that country should nofc foot fche bill for the extra subsidy. The service has many features to commend ifc to Australia. The management is liberal, and the labour engaged in fche service is treated well j and, therefore, from that point of view, I liave nofc one word of adversecriticism to offer. It appears to me as strange that the Government, who have been doing their very utmost for the past twelve months to shut out products from Canada, as well as from other countries, should now ask for an additional subsid)' in order to keep open a line of communication which, we are told, is intended fco enable Canada to send her goods to us, although we have very little to send in return. As a means of coramuivication for mail purposes, the service is of very little use to the Commonwealth, and we should, therefore, look upon this as a trade subsidy. I doubt very much if any value is to be attached to the argument of the Prime Minister that, from considerations of prudence alone, we should continue the service until we can deal with fche whole question of mail communication between here and the old country. I am afraid that, notwithstanding that the Like every business man, he Canadian Pacific Railway Company eontemplate shortening the journey over their lines by 24 hours, they will nofc be able to compete with the Suez route in the conveyance of mails for England. I am sure that for many years we shall not send our mails by the Pacific route. I am now giving the House the view of this question taken by postal officials. It is nofc regarded as of very much consequence from that aspect. The subsidy is really paid from year to year for trading purposes. Consequently, I do nofc understand the eagerness of the Government, which for the past twelve months has been endeavouringfcoclose the ports of the Commonwealth against those who desire to",39,Malcolm Mceacharn Z Re The

264,Mr Joseph Cook,"I was informedtrade with us, to pay this additional subsidy for the purpose of keeping open this trading route. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -It is the necessary outcome of their policy. so. The policy of the Government is the prevention of foreign trade as much as possible, whereas this proposal isone to assist in keeping open a channel of communication so that that trade may be developed. We do not send much in the way of goods to Canada. According to the statement of the Prime Minister, nearly all the loading carried by these vessels is brought from Canada to Australia. Since this line of .steamships is of special consequence to Canada, I am not sure, if an increased subsidy is needed, that that country should not be asked instead of the taxpayers of Australia to foot the bill. of New Soufch Wales and Queensland. the additional subsidy can be regarded as other than new expenditure. It is certainly not a transferred expenditure. This is a proposal to renew a mail contract upon different terms, and I take ifc, therefore, that the additional money which we are asked to vote should be regarded as new expenditure, and as such should f a j l upon the whole of the States. But I am not satisfied that this increased amount ought to be paid at all. Certainly, it should not be paid unless it is made, abundantly clear that otherwise this channel of communication will be closed. Upon thafc point all the evidence thafc has been submitted is a confidential communication to the Prime Minister to the effect that fche service is not a paying one. I have not heard of any threat of a cessation of the service if the increased subsidy is nofc forthcoming. The plan that has been adopted by the Government in dealing with this -matter is most unsatisfactory. I venture to say thafc no State Parliament would sanction what we are now proposing to do. IndeedI do nofc know of any State Legislature which would so quiescently provide funds for the Government as this House seems disposed to do upon the present occasion. The acting leader of the Opposition has declared that he sees no objection to the course thafc is proposed, and I presume, therefore, that no action will be taken to counteract ifc. I protest, however, against the unsatisfactory .method adopted by the Government in dealing with the whole question. The Prime Minister has stated thafc it is advisable to keep this trading route open, pending the determination of the whole of the mail contracts of the Commonwealth two years hence. If that is a reason for the payment of the increased subsidy, it is certainly a reason why every State should contribute in equitable proportion. That argument, is essentially a Federal one. If it is considered prudent to pay the additional money required to keep an alternative service open, surely every State in the Union should contribute towards thafc end in proportion to its population. Therefore, I fail to see why the New South Wales and Queensland Governments should shoulder not only fche entire burden cast upon them under the old arrangement, but also their proportions of the increased vote. However, as the Government have committed themselves to this arrangement, there is not much fear of Canada paying the whole, of the subsidy herself. Rather than see the service brought to an abrupt standstill, I am prepared to subscribe to the new arrangement, although the circumstances under which we are .asked to vote the money are altogether unfair. I know that there are collateral advantages which we gain commercially from having the terminal point of this service in Australia. A t the same time, I think that the whole question has been badly handled by the Government, who have treated the House very arbitrarily by asking that the increased subsidy shall be voted for two years longer, upon the bald statement of the Prime Minister. Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) -When mail subsidies come up for review, it is only proper that the grievances relating to them should be carefully scanned and considered before new arrangements are made. I do not intend to offer any objection to the proposed renewal of this, agreement for temporary purposes, but afc the same time. I think that the House ought to have been placed in possession of a copy of ib. Upon making inquiries to-day, I ascertained that no printed copy of the agreement between the States was available, but, through the courtesy of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, I was allowed to peruse the original documents.

267,Mr Joseph Cook,"= 1 cannot see howknow what they were doing. There is one preliminary question fco which I desire to draw attention It relates to whether, under this agreement, the Commonwealth itself is fco be charged with the increased subsidy, or whether that subsidy is to be debited to the original contracting States of New South Wales and Queensland. stated that it was to be debited to them. Sir -JOHN QUICK the Prime Minister did say so, and thatthat is the Ministerial view of the matter. On the other hand, we cannot settle the point at issue without reference to the original agreement, and I have not had an opportunity of perusing it long enough to say whether that view is correct. It seems to me that if the proposed increased subsidy was nofc contemplated by the primary agreement, ifc must be regarded as new expenditure, which should be federalized, and in regard to which the representatives of every State should have a voice. For my own part, I hope that the Ministerial view is correct, and thafc the increased subsidy will be debited to the States of New South Wales and Queensland. A t the same time, ifc would be. just as well to examine the agreement for the purpose of ascertaining whether that view can be sustained legally as well as from an equitable stand-point. MrL . E. GROOM -Why does the honourable and learned member wish the increased subsidy to fall upon two States only ? originally responsible for this contract. They were responsible for any advantages conferred by ifc, and also for any defects which ifc contains. . I shall draw attention in a moment or two to one very serious defect in the original agreement which should be rectified if possible at the present stage. Honourable members will recollect that this agreement was one of the outcomes of the visit to Australia some years ago of Mr Mackenzie Bowel!, a Canadian Minister, who dwelt upon the great advantages that would result from the establishment of reciprocal trade relations between Australia and Canada. We were led to ""believe thafc it was part of the great character for fche conveyance of produce of Pacific cable scheme that such relations should be established, and fchafc the cable subsidies by fche Eastern States should be used to promote such relations. Buti t appears that up to fche present Canada has derived the chief advantages from this subsidy. According to the statement of the Prime Minister, most of these vessels have= carried a full cargo when coming from Canada, whilst they have been very light indeed when returning from Australia. In fchafc respect, the advantages held out by Mr Mackenzie Bowell have nofc been realized by the people of Australia. .Beforea renewal of this agreement is granted, I understand that and an increased subsidy voted, some inquiry should be instituted as to why thebalance of trade has been upon the side of Canada, and why Australia has not enjoyed some substantial trading advantage. In. granting such a subsidy we ought to beguided by the principle that trade should accompany the mail. Such a principleis quite as vital as the principle that trade should follow the flag. learned member would not use the fastestpassenger boats to carry cargo ? Sir JOHN QUICK If the honourable and learned member will take the trouble to peruse the agreement he will see that it contemplates the traiisport of cargo as well as of passengers. There is a distinct provision for the carriage of passengers freight 1 and mails, and it is stated that the freight and passenger rates should be of a reasonable character. I should like to point out why, in my opinion, Australian trade with Canada has not been promoted as expected. I rememberfchafc Mr Mackenzie Bowell stated, in a speech he made here, that Australia, being in one hemisphere and Canada in the other, Australia would afc one time of the year produce the very class of fruit, <fcc, which Canada required. He further pointed out how it might be expected thafc, in course of time, a vast export trade of Australian f r u it and other perishable products might be established by the subsidy to be given to these mail steamers. Thafc result has nofc been achieved, for the simple reason that the subsidized steamers never made provision for the carriage of perishable products. There is no condition iu the agreement before us requiring the steam-ship companies to provide appliances of an up-to-date the kind. How, then, could it be expected that any trade would result? If we are to renew the agreement afc an increased subsidy, we ought to insist on getting some consideration. But Australia is getting no.",41,Malcolm Mceacharn Z Re The

I sincerely hope and trust thafc fche I quite agree with the honourable member House will insist in connection with all such for Parramatta in all the strictures he agreements, upon imposing conditions requiring fche subsidizedcompanies to present reasonable accommodation for the conveyance of Australian perishable produce. Only lasfc t week in some offcheAustralian papers we saw thafc accounts had been received of damage to hundreds of tons of Australian f r u it consigned to London on some of the subsidized steam-ships. The damage resulted or from the negligence with whichfchetransit was conducted. Mr G. B.

The mails, if they were carried to any extent in bulk, must be an evidence of the existence of trade relationships.

This subsidy will undoubtedly lead, or will tend to the development of trade relations with Canada; and it is highly desirable some such movement should be made. I only regret that restrictions by way of duties on our trade will prevent the opportunity being taken full advantage of. Hadi t not been for the restrictions which existed both in this country and in Canada, there would liave I see nothing about been no reason for the subsidy now proposed.

If we desire speed, the steamships must practically carry only passengers and a certain class of cm-go. In-fact, the reason why I must point out that oceau tramps exist in such profusion is that they can carry our products at a much cheaper rate than that at which they can be carried by other vessels. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo got himself into a great state of excitement over the fact that a lot of goods had been destroyed in transit to England. W it h the excitement of the honourable and learned member I thoroughly sympathize ; but as I showed by my interjection at the time, I was absolutely astounded to hear the remarks from a protectionist who has taken such a stand in restricting trade.

Even from a purely nothing in regard to it, however, except the free-trade point of view, it is justifiable, in statement of the honourable member who view of the great benefits they confer upon representsfchePostmaster-General-that the traders here and in ofcher parts of fche contract was originally entered into by world, to subsidize steamers for the purQueensland and New South Wales, that poses of facilitating trade. AVe have to theyapproaehed the Government some time remember that British steamers are now ago in regard to the renewal of it, and that obliged to fight against vessels subsidized by a certain senator asked a question upon fche tbe Governments of France and Germany, subject some time last year. What we and when we are considering arrangements should be told is whether the two States with a view to increasing our trade, we concerned are willing to continue to pay the should take into account the desirability of When the Commonwealth That is one view of the matter, aud if fche subsidy should not be charged to the two -sustaining our own people against -competitors. The honourable member for Parramatta has referred to the fact that --the whole of the benefit accruing from the running of this line of steamers has been -derived by Canada, and that she therefore should bear the whole of the cost; but I find it impossible to conceive that such means -of communication between Australia and Canada could confer the whole of its benefits -upon one of the parties. The advantages must be felt all round, and although I .admit we have done very little trade with Canada recently, I would point out that we were approaching a very satisfactory state -of affairs in regard to the trade between New -South AVales and Canada, when the whole -of the conditions were rudely upset by the introduction of the Federal Tariff. New South AVales in the pre-Federation days had the same treatment Great Britain, and her manufactured goods were admitted into that country at a rate -of duty 33£ per cent, lower than that levied -upon goods imported from the United States or the Continent of Europe. quently, the subsidized mail service performed a satisfactory part in the development of trade relations between the two countries. Tariff, however, all this preference was done .away with, the exports from New South Wales to Canada fell off -and there is very little prospect of the trade being revived on the old lines. For all that, however, I we could not do better than subsidize a good service of boats between and Canada; we should get a quid pro quo for what we pay, in any case. In Great Britain the Government are now considering the desirableness of taking action with regard to the subsidized lines of steamers which are making inroads upon the trade of Great Britain, -consider whether we should not derive great trade advantages from adopting a similar policy. To that extent, perhaps, the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is probably justified. stance of the amendment itself does not seem to effect any good, because it must be remembered that this line of steamers trades -only between New South Wales, Queensland, aud Canada. in New South Wales and Queensland suitable for export to Canada, I am convinced Mr G. B. Edwards. their steam-ships would fit up their boats so as to carry it ; but I speak from personal knowledge when I say that we should not be able to send away any appreciable quantity. Four-fifths of the f r u it export trade of Australia belongs to Tasmania, and the other fifth, to Victoria and South Australia; neither New South Wales nor Queensland has any f r u it worth speaking of for export. The steamship company would take very good care to cater for any specific lineof cargo that might offer, particularly for goods requiring cool storage, because the freight charges in such cases are very heavy and highly payable. The mail boats have been struggling for many years to work up this class of business. Notwithstanding the fact that an accident to one of the boats recently involyed considerable loss of perishable cargo, they have, in Canada as had taking one vogage with another, succeeded in landing their f r u it cargoes in Londoni n good condition, and the exporters are satisfied with the prices obtained. This trade, however, has been worked up Consewithout any subsidy, and in the absence of any arrangement. AVhen we have to consider the renewal of the contracts for the mail services vid Suez, we should stipulate On the advent of the Federal that the steamers should call at Hobart, because, at the present time, the question whether the boats will call there or not immediately, depends entirely upon the arrangements which can be made betweenfcheagents and fche exporters in Tasmania. To that extent think I think we might agree with the amendment of the honourable and learned member. AVe Australia should subsidize our steamers to enable them to compete with lines which receive similar assistance from foreign countries, upon a purely commercial basis, and apart altogether from the question of the carriage continental of mails. I think ifc is highly desirable that some such motion as thafc now before us and we should should be carried; but I join with those honourable members who have complained of fche slipshod and inadequate manner in whichfcheproposal has been placed before us. We are asked to assent to a motion which The subwill involve the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, and as we are the custodians of the public purse, we should not be asked to vote without the fullest information.

It seems to me to partake very closely indeed of the traditional ""dog in the manger "" policy. The people of New South Wales have all along contributed to the subsidy paid to the line of mail, steamers -vid the Suez Canal, and they have also paid their share of the cost of the service from Vancouver. Y e t the honourable member declares thafc if we cannot make arrangements with the Suez Canal servicefcorenew the existing contract, we should refuse to subsidize the line of mail steamers via Vancouver. son wh} we should nofc do so. 7 Mi-. WATSON -Precisely . I regard the proposed arrangement as merely a tentative one. It seeks to continue fche existing contract for a couple of j ears, pending 7 more complete arrangements being made. I quite sympathise with the suggestion which was put forward by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, thafc we should insure as far as possible that refrigeralong stretch as ifc is upon a short stretch of ting space should be provided upon the mail steamers .specially trading with Canada. To me ifc seems unlikely that any great amount of freight will go from Australia to Canada other than frozen meat; or perishable produce. A t the same time, I would point out to honourable members, that if we insist upon such a condition at the present time, ifc will most certainly lead to the breaking of the contract. It is absurd to expect that for the sake of a two years' contract the company will go the expense of building new boats. The present steamers have only refrigerating space sufficient to enable them to cany the stores which are necessary for their own consumption. I appeal to the honourable and learned member to withdraw his amendment in order that we may be enabled to discuss the whole matter at a later stage. It is true-as was mentioned byfchehonorable member foi Kalgoorlie-that a new service of steamers is to be established between the United Statesand Australia-uidiNewZealand. But that line, I understand, will be primarily a cargo line. it can obtain cargo. Zealand newspapers the report of an interview with Mr Alley, who is the moving1 spirit in the venture. He declared that the idea was to establish regular communication between Seattle, . in the United States, New Zealand and Australia. The vessels will not sail from particular ports upon fixed dates. . Therefore the new service cannot be considered as an alternative mail service But; the mere fact fchafc such a line is being established should encourage us to hope that within a short time we shall be able to obtain better terms than those which we a t present obtain. I think that the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta that the Vancouver line of steamers will never seriously compete with the service vid the Suez Canal is open to question.

The shorter any stretch of ocean is upon a route, the greater is the likelihood of speed being increased. Consequently, I consider that within a shorttime mails from London will be delivered in Brisbane wifchin 26 or 27 days at most. To my mind there is no doubt that the proposed expenditure is as much transferred expenditure as would be the payment of an' increased sum for the carriage of mails between two towns in any one State. Consequently, honourable members need not fearthat States other than New South Wales and Queensland will be called upon to bearany burden in this connection.

I submit that it should have originated in Committee, inasmuch as it involves a charge upon the people of the country. Standing Order 243 is as follows:If any motion be made in the House for any public aid or charge upon the people, the consideration and debate thereof may not be presently -entered upon, but shall be adjourned till such further day as the House shall think fit to uppoint, and then it shall be referred to a Committee of the whole House before any resolution -or vote of the House do pass thereon. I take ifc, therefore, that fche proper method in regard to this motion would have been to ask leave fco go into Committee for its -consideration. I submit, further, that before this contract is finally made it should -come to the House for ratification. That is the course taken in the House of Commons whenever a contract is made with any -company, a distinct resolution being submitted. Here there is no contract yet, and we are asked to make a charge on the people of the country without knowing what the precise terms offchecontract may be. The Government seeks authority to give this -company more money and to provide for the continuance of a service for another two 'years with some emendations of the -existing contract. Clearly, therefore, this is a proposal to make a further charge on the people of the country. I admit that there would not have been so much in the point I am taking had the proposal been merely for the continuance of the existing -contract; but the proposalfcomake a further charge clearly comes within Standing Order 243. This is a charge on the people ; ifc is -a motion for public aid to the company which has been carrying our mails for some time past, and therefore the matter should have been considered in Committee, and finally the contract should have come here for final approval. advantage of not having heard the opening remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta, but gather that he is referring to 'Standing Order 243. I notice that that standing order occurs in the chapter relating to Committees of Supply and Ways -and Means, and both by its position in that chapter and by its own form evidently relates to a motion which is practically to make an appropriation of public money and render it available by its authority alone. thafc; it means a proposal of the sort before us. not for "" public aid,"" and if it is anything, I presume, that it is ""a charge"" on the people. motion proposing a scheme which involves any expenditure as one of its conditions would be a charge on the people.

Having reminded the honourable member for Parramatta of the general practice, I ask him to observe that this motion affirms that the House of Representatives approves of the extension of an old contract for a period of two years, and proposes that the subsidy shall be increased by a certain amount. The honourable member does not say that if this motion be carried the money will be available. On the contrary, it will be necessary to place the amount on the EstiI labour under the dismates, and have ifc considered in Committee of Ways and Means, when it will be accepted or rejected by the House. message.

I submit that this is merely a motion of a general character submitted to the House, because, when it is passed, it does not mean that the money will be available, and no effect can be given to it until this Chamber has further considered the matter. If this had been such a proposal as that which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo had in his mind when he interjected, it would have been necessary to introduce it by a message ; but the fact that the motion is not so introduced shows that it is not intended in itself and by itself to be an effective appropriation. not have been preceded by message 1 propose to make a special appropriation for two years by Bill, and thus remove the matter altogether from the consideration of the House. I now come to the last and material point-that this House, by passing the motion, does tie its hands morally, though not legally. This House is under no obligation to keep its pledge, but it is committed in a way from which there never has, to my knowledge, been any retreat. To that extent tlie honourable member for Parramatta is perfectly justified in raising the point; but I again appeal to his experience as against his present logic. New South Wales is against the argument of the Attorney-General. experience in A ictoria, and from information T as to South Australia, that motions of the kind have continually been passed in the f u l l House when they did not of themselves authorize any expenditure-whe n they only committed the House, and did not technically commit the Committee which afterwards considered the Estimates. these circumstances, I submit that the practice of Parliament allows us to deal with the motion before the House. not afc all surprised that the honourable member for Parramatta has raised the point. When first the notice appeared on the paper I felt ib was very near the border line, and looked carefully into the matter before the day's proceedings began. H a d I judged thafcfchemotion was not one to be submitted except in Committee, ifc would have been my duty to call the attention of the Government to the fact. But, looking into the matter carefully, I came to the conclusion,, for reasons which have been mentioned by the Attorney-General, and for some otherreasons, that the motion was properly on the paper, and could be debated in the House, not requiring consideration in Committee first. I simply emphasize, in oneor two words, what the Attorney-General has said. In the first place, Standing Order 243 is one of a group under the heading ""Committees of Supply and Ways and Means."" I nfchenext place this motion, if it were passed unanimously, would not without some sum being later voted on the the motion Estimates, after recommendation by message, authorize the payment of one single penny, technically and really. After we have I think not, unless we passed this motion, should it be passed, ifc will still be necessary to have a message recommending the voting of the sum, and to include it in the Estimates and in an Appropriation Act in order to make it effective. The honourable member for Parramatta kindly told me some minutes ago that he intended to raise the point; and having looked up the practice of the House of Commons, I have come to the conclusion that that practice supports the view I have taken. I shall read two short extracts to the House. In May, page 568, there is the following paragraph :Control Over Packet and Telegraphic Contracts -Ifc may be mentioned, iu conclusion, that, as a check upon corrupt or improvident contracts, it is provided by standing orders, that in every contract for packet and telegraphic services beyond sea, a condition should be inserted that the contract shall nofc be bindiug until it has been approved by a resolution of the House.

I may say that if it had been .proposed to follow the motion by another to the effect that the Prime Minister be authorized to bring in a Bill to give effect to it, I should have ruled such a proposition out of order, as contrary to both the standing order and the practice of the House of Commons.

318,Mr Speaker,"closely on the point before us should be read. I find in the British House of Commons records of the 7th August, 1900, a reference to a precisely similar matter in the following resolution, which was passed in the House, and not in Committee :.Resolved. That the contract, dated the 1st day of June, 1900, entered into with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company for the conveyance of mails between Liverpool and South and Central America and the Falkland Islands be approved. That resolution was submitted to the House, and ultimately carried. I am bound in fairness to point out that there is the one distinction that the motion in the House of Commons does not mention any specific amount, while the motion now before us does. In both cases, however, a specific contract is mentioned, and, as that contract must carry with it a specific sum, I do not think the omission material. I am, therefore, against the honourable member for Parramatta, and I rule that the motion is properly before the House. the House of Commons seems to infer that the Ministry make the contracts on their own responsibility'. resolution which was passed under similar circumstances in reference to New Guinea, and in which a specific sum of £20,000 was mentioned. of order before the Chair. rise merely to draw the attention of the Minister in charge to a certain matter. Before doing so, however, I may say that as regaids the subsidy generally I should nofc be inclined to vote the amount proposed or any other did I believe thafc this service could be conducted without such assistance. There are circumstances, however, which make me believe fchafc thafc is not fche case. Had the conditions existing afc fchefcimefchesubsidy was originally granted continued, I believe that this service would now be in a position to,' at any rate, run under a reduced subsidy. But the fact isfchafcthe San Francisco service was conducted, without an American subsidy, by two vessels belonging to an American owner and two vessels belonging tofcheUnion Company. Then the American owners succeeded in getting a very large subsidy from fche United States Government, under the conditions of which 5o the British ships then running on the San Francisco line had to retire. The considerable subsidy given by the American Government has resulted in the placing on this line of vessels of high speed and large carrying capacity. But the position of the Vancouver service has, by the American action, nofc improved, but deteriorated. Then the question arises : shall we allow theseBritish boats, which now run, tobedriven out of the service by the American subsidy ? I am at one with the Prime Minister in the opinionfchafcfor the next two years, at any rate, until we have re-arranged our mail contracts, it is desirable to continue this British connection across the Pacific with a British colony, especially since that colony is willing to so largely assist us in subsidizing these steamers'. I agree with him, too, that it is not desirable that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo should press his amendment, at all events, in its present terms. I am with the honourable and learned member in his desire to obtain resolution in something more than efficiency for the carriage of mails, but ifc might be altogether unreasonable to demand from fche company facilities for bhe conveyance of perishable I should like to quote a products. As the honourable member for Bland has pointed out, entirely new steamers inight be .required to do whafc the honourable and learned member wants, and there is no evidence that the perishable cargo which he has in view will be forthcoming. If there were evidencefchafcaccommodation is needed for perishable cargo, I think fche company would provide it, because such cargo is the most profitable that they could carry. But if there is no evidence of the need for this accommodation, ifc would be unreasonable to require them to provide it. WhatI suggest to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is that, as we are? regarding this line more as a cargo than as a mail line, he should move the insertion, after the word "" efficiency,"" of the words "" for the carriage of mails and cargo."" If we carried that amendment, ifc would enable the Ministry to demand such efficiency as they may deem desirable in connection with fche carriage of cargo. But the point to which I rose to draw the Minister's attention is fche manner in which it is proposed to debit the subsidy. I have no objectionfcothe method of distribution proposed, if it is the legal method to adopt.

322,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"II shall not press that point. I would draw his attention, . however, to the need of establishing one method for dealing with all such additions as this to the expenditure upon transferred services. When the last Estimates were before us, we voted an additional subsidy of £2,000 for the New Hebrides service, and that expenditure was debited as ""other,"" or new expenditure Mr G. B. EDWARDS -There is also the case of New Guinea. rely upon the case which I have cited, as it is more particularly applicable. I am anxious that whatever is the proper and legal method of charging the subsidy should be adopted. I am not desirous of relieving the State of New South Wales from the larger share of theadditional subsidy mow proposed, but I hold that the rule which we adopt in one case we should adopt in all other cases of the kind. ourselves, by resolution, to the payment of the additional subsidy by Queensland and New South Wales. we do that. The statement in the motion that the arrangement was entered into on certain dates by the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, is only a statement of fact which we cannot dispute ; but I do nob think that in passing the motion we necessarily pledge ourselves to any particular allotment of tlie contribution. I should like the Attorney-General to give his attention to the matter I have spoken of. One of the methods adopted must be wrong, though I am not prepared to say which, and I am willing to accept for New South Wales whichever method may be considered most in keeping with the provisions of the Constitution. clination tp support the Government on . this occasion made me hesitate about addressing you, sir, because my position is such a curious one that I was hardly sure that I am ou solid ground. The honourable member for North Sydney seems to be in doubt as to whether this additional subsidy should be borne by the Commonwealth or by the original contracting States. The amount at issue is not of serious importance, aud could be paid by those States without difficulty or cavil. But what we require is a decisive opinion from the Attorney-General as to tbe constitutionality of the method of contribution proposed. We could obtain such an expression of opinion from him or from the Prime Ministeri f the honourable and learned member for Bendigo would withdraw his amendment to permit the insertion, after the figures "" £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 ,"" of the words, ""such increase to be equitably apportioned among all the States."" ber can do what he desires by. amending the amendment by the addition of a new sub-clause (c). Queensland have asked the Prime Minister to renew a certain contract. That is an admission that they were satisfied with the old arrangement, and my experience as a former member of the New South Wales Legislature is that, not only were the representatives of that State willing to agree to the arrangement in the first instance, but the}' were ready to ratify it on succeeding occasions, and even to increase the subsidy, because of the commercial advantages of the line and the improvement to State interests which the communication with Canada created. The honourable member for Parramatta spoke of the collateral advantages of the service, and it is to the collateral advantages that the practical-minded man must look. Sir James Huddart, and the company which was subsequently formed, have expended afc fche terminal point in Australia, upon repairs to their 'vessels, more per annum than fche subsidy paid to them ; and in one year the cost of repairing the Miowera exceeded the subsidy paid by the States of New South Wales and Queensland. Prior to Federation, the outward cargo almost filled their vessels, and the inward cargo always did so. cargo has fallen off now. Tariff; though the inward trade still, continues. Prior to Federation the Company had almost become self-supporting. There are other reasons besides fche commercial advantages which we gain from subsidizing the line. We subsidize companies which employ Chinese, Lascars, Cingalese, Afghans, and other alien and servile labour, whereas this company employs only white labour. Mr Spreckles, the sugar king of the United States, has, with his San Francisco line, made the competition against these vessels very severe ; but while",52,Malcolm Mceacharn Z Re The

A good deal has yet to be said before the Commonwealth can commit itself generally to the granting of subsidies. line, I think that the Government might well demand that the company shall take and train a certain number of boys from our reformatories. This would encourage our young people to take to fche sea, and give us men for our ships when we become a maritime nation, as we are bound to be, and would also provide a nucleus' for an Australian navy. I agree with fche honourable member for North Sydney, that there is no reason why the company should be burdened during the next two years with fche expense of providing a refrigerating plant. The Peninsular and Oriental and -Orient Companies . have been able to undertake the carriage of perishable products only after a heavy expenditure, which I do not think the trade would warrant the Canadian company in incurring. I think that the additional subsidy should be treated as new expenditure, and be equally apportioned among the States. I therefore moveThafc the amendment be amended by the addition of the following words :-""(c ) Such increase -to be equitably apportioned among all the States."" take advantage of the amendment to again protest against the way in whichfchematter has been brought before the House. I do nofc wish fco traverse your ruling, Mr on a two monthly service to the Gilbert and Speaker-fa r from it : but I desire to take advantage of fche reference to tlie practice followed in the House of Commons to emphasize the immense difference that exists between fche manner in which such matters are presented to the House of Commons, and the way in which this proposal has been submitted to us. In the former case ifc is unmistakably shown that fche contracts were made upon the responsibility of the British Government, and were afterwards submitted in their completed form to the House of Commons. In this case, however, we are asked to vote away money without any particulars. Before voting the money for fche ment has to be made. extra subsidy to the steam-ship company, or H ppoi'tioning the liability to be borne by fche tinuation of fche old agreement with very States, we are entitled to have before us slight alterations, in the direction of 5 o2 the exact terms of the arrangement entered into. I hope thafc we shall have no more of these slipshod Ministerial methods. As the acting leader of the Opposition has already expressed his approval offchemotion, I must be content fto enter my protest. But in paying a subsidy to this ral) I hope thafc it will nofc be necessary for me to address the House at any length. The honourable member for Dalley will see that the amendment; he has submitted cannot have any practical effect. The money proposed to be appropriated for the payment of fche increased subsidy must be treated as transferred expenditure, aud must necessarily be charged as is proposed. The honourable member for North Sydney directed attention to the fact that a different course of procedure had been adopted in the case of the contract for the mail service to the New Hebrides. He was quite correct, and that case was apparently parallel, but, as a matter of fact, when thafc contract was considered, it was decided that fchafc should be regarded as involving new expenditure, because one of the new conditions wasfchafcthe company should cease to employ coloured labour. the £400 thab was paid on that account, but to the additional payment of £2,000 thafc was agreed upon. the honourable member was aware of the condition regarding tlie exclusion of black labour from employment upon steamers engaged in the service. In addition to that, we arranged for an entirely different service. Provision was made for a new boat to carry Marshall Islands. This almost doubled the distance covered by fche service, we multiplied the number of stopping places to the extent of nearly doubling them, and made arrangements for land settlement. Therefore the contract was practically a new one, with conditions designed to confer benefits upon the whole Commonwealth. The present proposal is for an extension of an J existing contract for two years only. A t the end of that time ifc will be necessary to take the whole of the mail contracts of the Commonwealth into consideration.",53,Malcolm Mceacharn Z Re The
