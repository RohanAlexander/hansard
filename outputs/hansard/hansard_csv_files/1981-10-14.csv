The present situation in relation accused the Government of not being active to indirect tax is that it certainly has an extremely enough in respect of tax dodgers. Let us bring heavy incidence on low income groups. I refer not these two points together because they are closely to these changes, but to the totality of indirect tax linked. One of the important reasons for beginat the moment. But that is basically related to the ning a broadening of the tax base, particularly in fact that low income groups spend a very sigthe sales tax area, is that a considerable difference nificant proportion of their income on items that exists in the area of evasion and avoidance beat present carry very high rates. I am thinking of tween a tax on spending and a tax on income. The things like alcohol, cigarettes and so on, which honourable member was drawing a distinction becarry a form of indirect tax. tween the two. Earlier today I heard the shadow Treasurer, the There is a significant measure of tax avoidance honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis), and tax evasion. The Government has recognised quoting a study. An earlier study is based directly that and it has done more about it than any other on survey data of actual family incomes and government. There is also-in effect it is one form expenditure, which is very difficult to obtain, and of tax evasion-a very large component in the this shows very clearly the extent of the extremely economy to which we sometimes refer as the 'cash heavy incidence on the low income groups basieconomy'; that is, the work that is done at weekcally because of the relatively high proportion of ends which is paid for in cash but which never the low incomes which goes on these items.

We are doing a lot to try to cope with formal pact on low income groups and not the other way avoidance schemes. But it is extremely difficult to around. bring within the purview of the system these This move to increase sales tax can be, and I activities in the so-called cash economy. hope is, the first step in a very significant broadenIf one cannot nail down the income, then tax ing of this base. The existing sales tax is the best the income at this point of spending-everybody vehicle to do this. We heard a lot of discussion has to spend, including the tax evader, the capital earlier in the year as to whether it should be a gainer, the person operating in the cash economy; value added tax or various other forms of tax. I all these people have to spend-there is thus a big think that issue has basically been decided. The difference between the income tax and trying to existing sales tax is indeed the best vehicle. There expand the spending tax base somewhat. That is exists an established, well-understood machinery all that we have done. We have made a relatively to levy that tax, and other forms of tax, such as minor change in the mix to expand the tax base in the v'alue added tax, are more irksome and comthe area of taxes on spending. There is a big plex administratively and they are not, as has gendifference between that and the income tax.

As I effective in combating avoidance and evasion said, it catches the cash economy person, the spiv, than the established sales tax system. I hope we the capital gainer-everybody. The more that see here the beginning of a broadening of that base taxation is switched in that direction the more in the interests of all Australians. The suggestion effective is the system as a whole, and the more that our Government has no mandate to extend equitable the system will be.

Australia vis a vis other countries in regard to this with some of the arguments that have been raised methods.

By comparison ( Mr Braithwaite), the last speaker from the with other countries the proportion of taxation Government side. This is a thoroughly hopeless which is raised in Australia by indirect taxation is argument in our view. It represents absolute cahigh.

In other some way by resorting to indirect taxation, what words, the Government is hoping to deceive and one is doing is capitulating to tax avoiders and dupe the Australian electorate into feeling grateful towards it. It is ironic that this Government, evaders and asking the people who are already which came into office making great noises about bearing a higher proportion of the tax burden how it was going to end the secret tax of inflation, than they ought to be bearing-those people on has not only maintained the secret tax of inflation lower and middle incomes-to pay an even and abandoned tax indexation absolutely but also greater proportion of that burden because the inwill in future apparently rely on the secret tax of direct tax will be regressive and the impact on indirect taxation to try to get some revenue withthem more severe than on higher income earners. out the electorate knowing about it.

As is that indirect tax increases provide a basis on the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) has which income tax levies can occur. Various already pointed out in the course of this debate, members on the Government side have made the Budget strategy is looking pretty sick at the bleeding heart statements about how they hope present time. One of the fundamentals of that that the Government will get round soon to reBudget strategy was that 45 per cent-almost half ducing income tax. But what a big deal this will be of the growth of the money supply-would come for the Australian people if the Government from the surplus on private foreign exchange eventually brings in some income tax cuts I must transactions. So far there is no such surplus with a say as seems likely, before the next election. What quarter o""f the year gone. If this continues for any Government members are saying is that the length of time in the future it will certainly be the Government, when it gets the Sales Tax Amendcase that the Government will have to look at a ment Bills (Nos lA to 9A) through eventually and total revision of its budgetary strategy. In any case because of those Bills that have already gone what we are talking about here, as the Treasurer through, will have the room to provide income tax said in opening the debate, is $100m of revenue cuts. In other words, the Government will be able which would be lost if he capitulated to the Senate to put more money in one pocket by way of an inon this issue. This is in respect of a domestic surcome tax cut because it is taking more out of the plus of $1,500m. If the domestic surplus were other pocket through indirect taX'ation. That canreduced from $1,500m to $1,400m, is the not be of any satisfaction to taxpayers as a whole. Treasurer really saying that this would bring Indeed, because of the regressive nature of inabout enormous pressure for increased interest direct taxation it means that it will be no satisfacrates? I think it is an absolute absurdity to put it tion whatever to lower and middle income earners that way, but that is, in effect, what he is saying to as from such a deal they are likely to finish up us here today. worse off than they are at the present time. The impact of the income tax cuts will almost ineviI remind the Committee that we oppose this tably be such as to give higher proportionate kill(of legislation also, apart from the reasons benefits to high income tax earners.

We object to the intime the Budget was brought down, provided the crease in the overall tax burden. It is an increase right alternative measures are taken by the which, again this year, means that the proportion Government in the face of that reduced private of gross domestic product which goes in taxes is capital inflow. In any event, it is altogether too higher than last year and is the highest level ever soon for the Leader of the Opposition or the in our history. We object to the inequity of these honourable member for Gellibrand to be saying measures because of the factors which I raised that private capital inflow will disappear and we earlier. I showed quite conclusively, from the Neil are going to have a massive exodus of funds. The Warren study, that such taxation is thoroughly refact is that private capital inflow so far this finangressive. The argument that a pension adjustment cial year, is running at a higher rate than it was for price increase will occur is no satisfaction. It is during the September quarter of 1980. What in by no means clear that pensioners will finish up in fact, has happened is that we have had a much front. As the honourable member for Henty( Mrs Child) said, there is every reason to be skeptical larger current account deficit because of the about this because of the delay in payment to pendifference between exports and imports. Really, sioners. Finally, of course, low wage earners, all of the rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposuperannuants and fixed income earners of other sition and the honourable member for Gellibrand kinds will receive no such automatic adjustment about private capital inflow and the Budget stratbut will have to pay these taxes. So there are egy is sadly astray and sadly irrelevant to this dismany reasons for this Committee agreeing to the cussion.

The Bills are, in the Government's view lot of talk about what is a desirable tax mix. I was indispensable to the passage of the Budget.

The Budget strategy is to 38.5 per cent. In other words whereas our overall achieve a series of economic objectives principally tax burden is 5 per cent or 6 per cent below the controlling inflation through a series of different OECD average-I repeat that the overall tax take approaches including a responsible fiscal policy, a in Australia is 5 per cent or 6 per cent below the responsible monetary policy, a sensible approach OECD average-our personal tax take, as a proto wages and the sensible management of our portion of overall tax, is 5 per cent above the averexternal policies.
